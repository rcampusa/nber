                                           ABSTRACT

A survey of the illustrations in textbooks of modern art produces the startling finding that art

scholars consider Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty to be the most important individual work made by

an American artist during the past 150 years. More generally, quantifying the evidence of the

textbooks reveals the source of the “pluralism,” or stylistic incoherence, of American art since the

late 1960s. A persistently high demand for artistic innovation has produced a regime in which

conceptual approaches have predominated. The art world has consequently been flooded by a series

of new ideas, usually embodied in individual works, generally made by young artists who have

failed to make more than one significant contribution in their careers. The dramatic and monumental

Spiral Jetty, made in 1970 by a young artist who was killed soon thereafter while in the process of

making his art, has become a symbol for the art of this era.

       Late in the summer of 2002, visitors to Rozel Point in Gunnison Bay, the north arm of

Utah’s Great Salt Lake, reported that Spiral Jetty was visible from the lake’s shore. The artist

Robert Smithson had formed the 1500-foot-long jetty in 1970, using two dump trucks, a tractor,

and a front loader to move more than 6,500 tons of mud, salt crystals, and rock.1 Although

Smithson recognized that his creation would be submerged periodically when the lake’s level

rose, he may have miscalculated how common this would be, for the jetty had been hidden

almost continuously since 1972.

       The reappearance of Spiral Jetty in August of 2002 occasioned little excitement. The

New York Times did record the event, but only after the passage of several months and then only

at a length of less than 750 words.2 New York’s Dia Art Foundation, which now owns Spiral

Jetty, did not begin selling tickets for admission to view it, and neither the foundation nor any

government authority in Utah undertook to pave the 16 miles of gravel roads that lie between

Utah State Route 83 and the jetty.3

       By surveying a large collection of scholarly narratives of the history of modern art, this

study will demonstrate that art scholars have implicitly judged Spiral Jetty to be not only the

dominant American work of art of the late 20th century, but the most important individual work

produced by an American artist during the past 150 years. This startling finding raises a number

of questions. One is how any work made in 1970, during an era that art historians invariably

describe as a time of pluralism, can attain such a prominent position. Another follows from the

events of the past year. If Spiral Jetty holds such an exalted position in American art history,

how can its reemergence have produced so little reaction from the art world?

       Quantitative analysis of the history of American art in the late 20th century can help to
                                                  4

answer these questions, by providing a new understanding of the careers and contributions of the

leading artists of the time. More generally, this systematic approach can allow us to perceive the

unifying elements of an era that is usually considered to be characterized only by disunity. Thus

as in similar studies of art in other periods, simple quantitative analysis serves both to pose and

to answer significant new questions.

Artists and Evidence

               In the last analysis, the artist may shout from all the rooftops that
               he is a genius; he will have to wait for the verdict of the spectator
               in order that his declarations take a social value and that, finally,
               posterity includes him in the primers of Art History.

       The goal in choosing the artists to be studied here was to select the most important

American artists from the 1960s to the present. This was done by using six textbooks on the

history of modern art published since 1994.5 Twenty-five artists who were born between 1930

and 1960 and who lived and worked primarily in the United States had at least one work

illustrated in three or more of these six books. They are listed in Table 1.

       Textbooks of art history are also the source of evidence analyzed in this study. This

evidence was drawn from all available books, published in English since 1990, that provide

illustrated surveys of at least the period from 1960 on. A total of 40 such books were found.6

The data set for this study was created by listing every reproduction of every work of art shown

in these books by all of the 25 artists in the sample.

       A straightforward measure of the importance of a given contributor or contribution to an

intellectual activity is the probability that that person or work will be discussed in the course of
                                                 5

scholarly accounts of the history of that discipline. Counting the illustrations in these 40 surveys

of art history to measure these probabilities for the sample members and their individual works

effectively allows us to draw on the judgments of scores of art scholars concerning which

American artists, and works of art, are considered to have been the most important of the period

studied here.

Rankings: Artists and Works of Art

       Table 2 presents the ranking of artists by total illustrations. Two painters, Jasper Johns

and Frank Stella, head the ranking. Yet what is perhaps most striking about the table is its

evidence of the demise of painters as the leading American artists of recent decades. For after

Johns and Stella, the next 11 places in the table are held by artists who are known for work in

media other than painting. Eight of these 11 artists are younger than Johns and Stella, and as will

be seen below, all made their reputations after the two painters. No painter currently under the

age of 65 has his work illustrated in more than 70% of the books analyzed.

       Table 3 ranks individual works of art by total illustrations. Like Table 2, it witnesses the

eclipse of painting as the primary source of the advanced art of the late 20th century. Only three

of the top 10 works in Table 3 are paintings, and of these three - all by Johns - only one is a

conventional painting in form, for Three Flags is composed of three separate canvases joined

together in layers, and Target with Plaster Casts has at its top a row of small boxes that contain

plaster casts of human body parts. In Table 3 as a whole, only seven of the total of 22 works are

paintings, and only three of these are by painters other than Johns.

       Table 3 also clearly points to the preeminence of very large works in this period. Among

the five highest-ranked works in the table, in addition to the 1500-foot-long Spiral Jetty, Judy
                                                  6

Chicago’s Dinner Party is 48 feet long, Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial consists of two

wings, each 246 feet long, and Richard Serra’s Tilted Arc was 120 feet long. For another work

ranked among the top 10 in Table 3, Christo used 6 million square feet of polypropylene fabric

to surround 11 of the small spoil islands in Miami’s Biscayne Bay with floating pink skirts for a

period of two weeks.

       Table 3 furthermore contains one dramatic and unexpected fact. Three previous studies

have measured the frequency with which the major works of the leading American artists of their

time are reproduced in art history textbooks for the appropriate periods. One of these studies

found that Thomas Eakins’ The Gross Clinic was the most-often reproduced work made by any

American artist born during 1830-60, a second found that Grant Wood’s American Gothic was

the comparable work made by an American artist born during 1860-1900, and a third found that

Willem de Kooning’s Woman I was the comparable work made by an American artist born

during 1900-40.7 The astonishing result in Table 3 concerns the relative frequency with which

Spiral Jetty appears in the books surveyed here. The Gross Clinic appears in 70% of the books

surveyed for that study, American Gothic in 48% of the respective texts, and Woman I in just

36% of the respective books. Thus Spiral Jetty, which appears in 93% of the books surveyed, is

by this measure the most important single work made by an American artist during the past 150

years, for it is the work of art most likely to be reproduced in a scholarly narrative of the history

of American art.

An Era of Incoherence?

       Art scholars consistently characterize the American art world of the 1970s and beyond

with the terms “pluralism” and “postmodernism.” These words are effectively the scholars’ way
                                                  7

of accounting for their difficulty in producing coherent narratives of the art of the past three

decades. Thus one scholar observes that “the Pluralism of the seventies... effectively did away

with the idea of dominant styles for at least a decade,” while another remarks that

“Postmodernism is an inclusive aesthetic that cultivates the variety of incoherence.”8 Although

the number of artistic movements has proliferated as the number of artists has increased in recent

decades, the absence of dominant styles does not mean that there are no coherent trends

underlying many of the most important artistic developments of the 1970s and beyond. Tables 2

and 3 help us to perceive some of these broad trends.

       The clear demise of painting from a preeminent position as the most advanced of the fine

arts occurred within the period considered here. This was accompanied by the proliferation of

new hybrid forms of art, a number of which were recognized as new genres in their own right.

An example of this, of which Spiral Jetty is the prime product, is earth art; others include

happenings, performance art, and installation art. Yet both the declining importance of painting

and the appearance of new hybrid art forms represented a continuation of processes that

originated much earlier, and in fact were operating throughout nearly the entire 20th century.

       When Picasso invented collage in 1912 and Braque invented papier collé later the same

year, by attaching small pieces of cloth and paper to their canvases, they were not only bringing

scraps of waste material into the domain of fine art, but they were violating the integrity of the

flat picture plane that had been respected by Western painters since the Middle Ages. This

initiated a process in which the distinction between (two-dimensional) painting and (three-

dimensional) sculpture would progressively be eroded. In 1913, when Duchamp first presented

unaltered manufactured objects as works of art that he called readymades, he was defying the
                                                  8

tradition that art could be created only by the hand of an artist. This began a process that

undermined the previously rigid division between fine art and everyday objects. The late 1950s

and the 1960s witnessed an intensification of interest both in breaking down the barriers

separating painting from other forms of art and in the use of real objects in the creation of works

of art. Jasper Johns’ use of sculptural and collage elements in his paintings and Robert

Rauschenberg’s use of found objects in making his combines were both strong proximate

influences on many American artists of the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s who participated in movements

that further advanced these two tendencies.

       During the 1960s another tendency appeared, as a number of leading American artists

began to challenge the conservative role of museums and galleries in the art world in

perpetuating traditional forms of art. Some Minimalist artists of the ‘60s pursued this agenda by

bringing into galleries sculptures made of base material like bricks or lead plates. Other artists

began to create outdoor sculptures that could not be brought into galleries - often because they

were too large, but in some cases because the artists declared the works to be site-specific, and

consequently valid only in the specific locations where they were created and placed.

       The trends described above are familiar to students of modern art, for they are staples in

accounts of recent developments. A third trend, however, is much less widely recognized, for its

importance has only become apparent in light of recent research on artists’ careers. This third

element is the fact that American art of the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s has been dominated by

conceptual artists. The conceptual artists in question include not only those of the Conceptual

movement of the late 1960s - Sol LeWitt, Joseph Kosuth, Lawrence Weiner, and others - but

more generally those artists who work systematically in executing preconceived images or plans,
                                                   9

in order to produce works that communicate specific ideas.9 By this broader definition most of

the leading American artists of the 1970s and beyond appear to have worked conceptually.

        The significance of this recognition of the conceptual basis of most of the leading

American art of recent decades goes beyond merely identifying a common practice of these

artists. For recent research has found that conceptual artists tend to make their most significant

contributions early in their careers.10 This implies that the most important art of the past three

decades should be the product of young artists.

        Table 4 confirms that this has been the case. The table lists the 20 most important 5-year

periods in the careers of the artists in the sample for this study, ranked by total textbook

illustrations of the given artist’s work in the appropriate period. All of the top 10 periods were

completed by the time the respective artists were 35 years old; in the entire table, only two

periods were completed when the artist was past the age of 40. Four of the top 10 periods, and 8

of the top 20, were completed before the artist reached the age of 30.11

        Another characteristic of conceptual artists’ innovations is that they appear suddenly, as

the product of a new idea, and are quickly embodied in new work. Consistent with this, Table 4

shows that in 14 of the 20 cases, the five-year period identified in the table accounted for more

than half of all the illustrations an artist received for all the work of his or her career. This

temporal concentration was often extreme, as in no less than six of the cases, the period listed in

Table 4 accounted for 90% or more of the artist’s total illustrations in the textbooks.

        Table 5 gives additional evidence of the effect of the conceptual origins of most of the

major works of art in this period, by showing the ages at which artists executed the works listed

in Table 3. As in Table 4, the ages are generally low. Twelve of the 22 works were made by
                                                10

artists in their 20s, whereas only four - less than 20% - were made by artists aged 40 and above.

Remarkably, Joseph Kosuth produced One and Three Chairs, which is tied for third place in the

table, at the age of just 20. No comparably important work of art has been produced by an

American artist at such an early age in the past 150 years.12

Conceptual Artists at Work

       Conceptual artists work systematically, after planning their work carefully in advance.

The clarity of their purpose allows them to create individual works that fully embody significant

innovations, and that can therefore be understood and appreciated even when seen in isolation

from other works by the artist. Because of this, in the modern era conceptual painters have had a

great advantage over their experimental counterparts in being able to produce individual large

and complicated paintings that are generally recognized as important and successful works, and

that can stand alone as milestones in art history.13 The domination of recent American art by

conceptual artists therefore helps to explain why a number of extremely large, and often

complex, works stand at the top of Table 3.

       The Dinner Party ranks second in Table 3, behind Spiral Jetty. To symbolize the neglect

of women’s achievements by historians, Judy Chicago decided to create a work that would

reinterpret the Last Supper from the point of view of women. Because she found she could not

reduce the number of guests to 13, she designed the table as a triangle, and tripled that number.14

Chicago selected women who were representative of particular historical epochs, whose lives

embodied some significant achievement, and who had worked in some way to improve

conditions for women. After Chicago had planned the work, she assembled a team of people to

help her execute it. A total of 400 people - mostly, but not all, women - worked on The Dinner
                                                 11

Party over a period of five years.15 As described in an exhibition catalogue, the work has many

components:

               A triangular table, forty-eight feet per side, is arranged with thirty-
               nine commemorative settings in which sculptural ceramic plate
               forms, with napkins, knives, forks, spoons, and goblets, sit on
               individualized needlework tablecloth runners. Each plate setting
               creates a memorial to the life of an individual woman in history.
               The whole is complemented by the additional 999 names of
               women penned across the 2,300 lustrous triangular tiles that
               comprise the raised floor on which the table sits. The Dinner Party
               thus images a collaboration that is a collective or combined history
               of 1,038 women, through a process that was itself collaborative.16

       In spite of the ambitious nature of its collaborative execution, The Dinner Party was a

conceptual work. Chicago herself left no doubt that her conception was the work’s message, and

that the process of producing it was secondary: “I am often asked whether the process of creating

The Dinner Party was even more important than the final work of art, and my answer has always

been no.”17 Like the large paintings specifically planned by 19th-century French Salon painters to

be seen in institutional settings, Chicago explained that “The Dinner Party was conceived to be

exhibited in major museums.”18 Yet because it was a conceptual work, Chicago discovered that

its message could be communicated even if the work itself was not displayed:

               It was extremely fortuitous that The Dinner Party was structured
               so that the information it embodied was able to enter the culture in
               several forms. Consequently, when the work of art was blocked by
               the art system, the book [about the work, written by Chicago]
               brought the concept of the piece to what turned out to be an
               extremely receptive audience.19

       One and Three Chairs ranks in a tie for third place in Table 3. It consists of a wooden

folding chair, flanked on one side by a life-size photograph of the same chair, and on the other

by an enlarged photograph of a dictionary definition of the word “chair.” As a 19-year-old art
                                                 12

student, Joseph Kosuth had given up painting, having decided that “the belief system of the old

language of painting had collapsed.”20 Kosuth believed that what the artist now had to do “was to

question the nature of art,” and he could not do that by painting, since by painting the artist was

already accepting the nature of art.21

       One and Three Chairs was one of Kosuth’s earliest efforts at demonstrating how art

could move beyond objects into a more purely conceptual realm. The work included a physical

object, a visual representation of that object, and a mental representation of the object. Later

Kosuth began to omit the first two of these from his work, and provide only the mental

representation, in the form of photographs of dictionary definitions of a variety of words.22

       Kosuth’s austere form of conceptual art reflected his understanding of the implications of

Duchamp’s readymades: “With the unassisted readymade, art changed its focus from the form of

the language to what was being said.”23 In the mid-1960s, Kosuth observed that “How things

were made was once important. The final object is now important.”24 His early work was among

the most radical solutions to the problem that a number of artists of the period were posing, in

their desire to produce a less commercial art that would undermine the gallery system, of how to

make a more purely conceptual art that did not depend on any specific physical embodiment.

Thus Kosuth declared that the objects in his work were unimportant:

               All I make are models. The actual works of art are ideas... It does
               not matter who actually makes the model, nor where the model
               ends up.25

Kosuth’s explicit use of language in his work provided a model for a number of other conceptual

artists who were seeking ways to present ideas without making objects. That he could produce a

work as influential as One and Three Chairs at such an early age was a result of his success at
                                                  13

creating a form of art that embodied a complex idea without requiring extensive experience in

the use of traditional artistic methods and materials.

        Like Spiral Jetty and The Dinner Party, Tilted Arc gained attention in part for its large

size and monumental conception, for it consisted of a curved sheet of steel 120 feet long and 12

feet high. The sculpture was commissioned by the federal government’s General Services

Administration, and was installed in 1981 in Federal Plaza in New York. After considerable

public debate, the work was removed in 1989, in spite of the objections of the artist and many

others in the art world.26

        Ironically, the work’s removal was a consequence of Richard Serra’s success in using

Tilted Arc to achieve specific goals he had set for his art. During the 1960s, Serra decided that

what he wanted for his work would be “to take it out of the places that are considered the

cultural institutions and bring it into greater dialogue, for better or for worse, with the general

condition of where people are. My works deal head-on with their architectural sites.”27 From his

admiration of Barnett Newman’s large canvases in which blocks of color are divided by vertical

lines, Serra also decided he wanted “to cut space with sculpture” in a way that the viewer would

experience “as you walk or scan the field. It is an experience that unfolds in time.”28 Serra’s

success in achieving these two goals with Tilted Arc - of making viewers confront his work and

having that confrontation require a passage of time - became a powerful argument for its

removal, as opponents of the work could point to many people who worked in buildings on the

plaza who complained that the sculpture inconvenienced them by requiring them to walk out of

their way in getting to and from their jobs.

        Unlike the other artists whose work ranks highly in Table 3, Serra’s approach to art was
                                                    14

not conceptual but experimental. He was one of a group of young artists in the 1960s who were

sometimes called Process artists. His first published article, titled “Verb List, 1967-68," was a

series of active verbs specifying things that could be done to materials: “to roll, to crease, to fold,

to store, to bend, to shorten, to twist...”29 Serra later recalled his situation at the time:

                I was very involved with the physical activity of making. It struck
                me that instead of thinking about what a sculpture is going to be
                and how you’re going to do it compositionally, what if you just
                enacted those verbs in relation to a material, and didn’t worry
                about the result? So I started tearing and cutting and folding lead.30

Serra has explained that he avoids planning his works:

                I never begin to construct with a specific intention. I don’t work
                from a priori ideas and theoretical propositions. The structures are
                the result of experimentation and invention. In every search there
                is always a degree of unforeseeability, a sort of troubling feeling, a
                wonder after the work is complete, after the conclusion. The part
                of the work which surprises me invariably leads to new works.31

For Serra, the source of his achievement lay in the process of making the work:

                I can’t think my way through a problem; I have to work my way
                through a problem. And that’s why I’m interested in building
                things, because often what happens in the process of sustaining the
                effort to build something is that you could not have foreseen what
                you thought the conclusion of what your intention would be. And
                the physical fact of things counts for a lot more to me than the
                thought that doesn’t take a physical manifestation.32

Because he begins his works with no specific goal, Serra must execute his work himself:

                The building method is based on hand manipulation. A continuous
                hands-on procedure, both in the studio and at the site, ... allows me
                to perceive structures I could not imagine, for retention of physical
                properties is limited.33

        Serra’s experimental approach, and his desire that his finished works reveal the process

of their construction, reflect the powerful influence of Jackson Pollock on his art.34 But Serra
                                                 15

wanted to extend Pollock’s all-over compositions beyond the constraining boundaries of the

picture frame or the gallery, and his friendship with Smithson, whom he helped in laying out

Spiral Jetty, prompted him to make larger works that were designed for specific outdoor

locations.35 The influence of Smithson contributed both to the monumental size of Tilted Arc and

to its demise, for when the government proposed to relocate the work to an alternate site, Serra’s

response was unyielding:

               Tilted Arc was commissioned and designed for one particular site:
               Federal Plaza. It is a site-specific work and as such not to be
               relocated. To remove the work is to destroy the work.36

Thus although Tilted Arc is currently in storage, Serra’s position remains that Tilted Arc is

destroyed.37

       The Vietnam Veterans Memorial might fairly be called “The Masterpiece of the

Unknown Artist.”38 Its appearance in 16 textbooks places it in a tie for third place in Table 3.

Remarkably, no other work by Maya Lin appears in any of the textbooks analyzed for this study.

       Lin’s design for the memorial originated in an architectural seminar she took in her

senior year at Yale. At the time there was a national design competition for a Vietnam veterans

memorial, and the class, on funeral architecture, took this task as its final design project. Lin and

a few friends traveled to Washington, D.C. to see the intended site for the memorial, and there

Lin had the basic idea for her project: “I had a simple impulse to cut into the earth. I imagined

taking a knife and cutting into the earth, opening it up, an initial violence and pain that in time

would heal.” Lin later recalled that when she returned to Yale, “I quickly sketched my idea up,

and it almost seemed too simple, too little.” Yet she soon dismissed the idea of making any

additions: “The image was so simple that anything added to it began to detract from it.” When
                                                  16

Lin decided to enter the national competition, she found that it took longer to write the required

one-page description of her project than it had taken to design the memorial.39

        Lin’s design for the memorial occasioned considerable controversy. One criticism, that a

veterans memorial must include a statute of a soldier, was answered by placing a sculpture of

three infantrymen near one end of the work. The memorial was otherwise executed according to

Lin’s design, and it was dedicated in the fall of 1982, just eighteen months after Lin graduated

from college.

        In the two decades since she designed the Vietnam memorial, Lin has pursued a career as

an architect and sculptor. A recent book about women artists observed that “Now a beneficiary

of a stream of commissions, this still-young master designer is riding her good fortune, turning

out institutional and private projects while also making the individual sculptures to which she

attaches such importance.”40 Yet the present study demonstrates that from the vantage point of

art scholars Lin’s career consists of a single work, that has been described by one scholar as “one

of the most compelling monuments in the United States.”41 That a 20-year-old artist could

conceive an idea that would be completely embodied in a single major work, and not be followed

by any others deemed significant by art scholars, is a quintessentially conceptual phenomenon.

Lin’s procedures still reflect her conceptual approach: “I begin by imagining an artwork

verbally... I try not to find the form too soon. Instead, I try to think about it as an idea without a

shape.”42 Her plans for her works “are made instantaneously. Sometimes I just wake up and

without really thinking make a model.”43

American Icon

        The questions posed earlier about Spiral Jetty remain to be answered. Table 3 documents
                                                   17

its remarkable position among art works of this era: not only does it appear in 93% of the books

surveyed, but it is the only work of the era that appears in more than half of those books. How is

it that an individual work from a pluralist era can emerge so clearly as a dominant work, and in

view of the fact that it has, why is there not more excitement about the fact that the work can

now be seen for the first time in three decades?

       The ability of Smithson to create a preeminent work in 1970 in fact was a consequence of

the conceptual orientation of the art world of the time. The secret of Smithson’s success with

Spiral Jetty appears to have been that in that single work he incorporated a remarkable number

of the central themes of the advanced art of the 1960s. More generally, in a diverse body of work

- monumental outdoor sculptures, small indoor exhibits that documented these, published

explanations of his work, and photographs and films of the works - Smithson created a complex

oeuvre that could represent many different things to different people. The dense and obscure

nature of much of Smithson’s writing about his work and his vision of art makes it impossible to

catalogue its contents in any systematic way, but some central elements can be clearly identified.

       Smithson’s approach to art was archetypally conceptual. In one of the simplest

statements he made about his work, he told an interviewer that “An object to me is the product of

a thought.”44 The remarkable feature of his work is the surprisingly large number of thoughts he

was able to associate with the objects he created. Spiral Jetty is the outstanding example of this,

but many of the following generalizations apply to all his works.

       The actual shapes of his sculptures were simple. In this they drew on Minimalism, which

was the leading American art movement of the late ‘60s. Many art scholars in fact categorize

Smithson’s work as “Post-Minimalist.”45 Smithson put his stamp on this borrowing, however,
                                                 18

by the scale of his works - he made Minimalism larger, more monumental, and often more

elegant.

       In the placement of his monumental works in the landscape, Smithson was a pioneer of

earth art. He was the first to use the term “earthwork” for the large objects that he and a few

other artists created in remote areas.46 Spiral Jetty became the trademark work of this movement.

       The placement of art works in remote areas drew on the anti-gallery sentiment that was

shared by many young advanced artists of the late ‘60s. Although Smithson regularly

participated in gallery shows, where he displayed written texts, photographs, stones, and other

documentation of his earthworks, his major works appeared to symbolize the rejection of the

gallery-museum system in their scale and inaccessibility.

       Smithson’s work also defied the traditional canon of art, as did much other art of his

time. Not only were his sculptures made of such base materials as dirt and stones, but their size

and location required viewers to experience them over longer periods of time than fine art had

traditionally required. In his writings Smithson vigorously attacked traditional divisions between

the arts, and denounced critics who wished to maintain the formalist purity of painting and

sculpture.

       Smithson included written texts in many of the gallery presentations of his work. This

followed the practice of Joseph Kosuth and other advanced conceptual artists of the ‘60s. More

generally, Smithson was a prolific author, initially of art criticism, and later of programmatic

statements about his work and his vision of art. In this Smithson’s practice reflected a vital

tradition of modern art, for since the time of Italian Futurism and Russian Constructivism, in the

first few decades of the 20th century, the impact of conceptual art movements has been greatly
                                                 19

enhanced by manifestos written by the artists themselves. Smithson’s manifestos surpassed all

such earlier documents in the great range of subjects they touched on and the remarkable variety

of the symbols they cited for particular works. Smithson’s writings about art combined, often in

baffling ways, his interests in entropy, archeology, science fiction, physics, dinosaurs, geology,

cartography, modern painting, technology, philosophy, and a host of other subjects. He provided

not one or two symbolic meanings for specific works, but many more. So for example in an

essay on Spiral Jetty, he associated its spiral shape variously with the solar system, the molecular

structure of the salt crystals found in the Great Salt Lake, Brancusi’s sketch of James Joyce as a

“spiral ear,” the spiral of the reels of the movie film he used to document the work, the propeller

of the helicopter he used to survey the work, a painting by Jackson Pollock titled Eyes in the

Heat, the ion source of a cyclotron, ripples in the water of the Great Salt Lake, and other images

that are presented in rapid-fire prose that seems intended to document Smithson’s thought

processes.47 The wide variety of suggested symbolic meanings considerably increases the

intellectual appeal of Spiral Jetty, for art scholars are not constrained to any specific symbolic

interpretation, but can instead choose from this cluster one or more that appeal to them.

       Smithson made extensive use of photography in presenting his work, in numerous ways.

An early published article about his excursion into a suburban wasteland was accompanied by

still photographs he himself took with his Instamatic camera.48 Their inelegant snapshot quality

reinforced the unaccented prose that describes his progress through the unattractive and banal

landscape. Later he also used movies in much more sophisticated fashion, as for example the

construction of Spiral Jetty was filmed by a professional photographer according to detailed

plans Smithson made for that treatment.49 But perhaps the most important photographs of
                                                   20

Smithson’s work were the dramatic stills of Spiral Jetty, in a number of which Smithson himself

appears as a solitary standing human figure, dressed in black, silhouetted against the barren

landscape of the shore of the Great Salt Lake.

          All of the preceding characteristics of Smithson’s practice and his art appear to have

contributed to making Spiral Jetty an anomaly, a unique synthetic work in an artistic era that

defied synthesis. Yet the reputation of the work has also been increased by the circumstances of

Smithson’s tragic death. Smithson died in 1973, at the age of just 35, when the small plane from

which he was filming the staked-out plans for his latest work crashed into a hillside, killing the

pilot, the owner of the Texas ranch where the work was to be situated, and Smithson.50

Smithson’s premature death, in the process of making art, added poignancy to the images of the

brilliant and articulate young artist who created monumental works in remote and desolate

places.

          Spiral Jetty thus appears today as a work that stands for its time, made by a cherismatic

young artist who worked on a grand scale and who sacrificed his life for his art. In view of this,

in today’s atmosphere of media-star artists and blockbuster museum exhibitions, why is Spiral

Jetty the subject of so little fanfare?

          The answer to this puzzle seems to lie in the fact that, in part as a consequence of the

efforts of conceptual artists of recent decades, photographs are now widely accepted as adequate

representations of many works of art. As discussed above, Joseph Kosuth presented photographs

of written texts as sufficient representations of, or substitutes for, objects. Early in his career,

Robert Smithson appears not to have regarded photographs and other documentation of his

earthworks as works of art in their own right, but as time went on he apparently realized that
                                                 21

these secondary representations could not only enhance the appreciation of the primary works,

but could become part of their meaning, embodying the same ideas as the object they portray.

His careful attention to the filming of Spiral Jetty served to make the film “both a record and a

representative work by Smithson.”51 The availability of this film and of the dramatic still

photographs of Spiral Jetty, in combination with the considerable difficulty involved in traveling

to the actual site, appear to account for the fact that it could become the greatest masterpiece that

few people have ever seen, and why today Spiral Jetty may be the destination for handfuls, but

not busloads, of artistic pilgrims.52

The Disappearing Master

        This investigation points strongly to the underlying source of the lack of coherence

emphasized by art historians in describing American art of the 1970s and beyond. As many in

the art world have observed, during this time there has been a persistently high demand for

artistic novelty and innovation.53 This has produced a regime in which conceptual approaches,

which can quickly create new results, have been preeminent. The result has been that the

advanced art world has been flooded by a series of new ideas, usually embodied in individual

works, and in most cases created by young artists who have failed to make more than one

significant contribution in their careers.54 American art in the last three decades of the 20th

century has therefore produced more masterpieces than masters.

        Perhaps the most telling quantitative evidence of this phenomenon comes from Table 4.

In that table, which effectively ranks the most important periods in the careers of the most

important American artists of this era, only three artists have more than a single entry. Of these

three, Jasper Johns and Frank Stella had completed their two five-year periods listed in the table
                                                 22

before they reached the age of 35.55 Only Richard Serra, whose second entry in the table spans

the ages 38-42, managed to make one of his two significant contributions even partly in his fifth

decade.

       With the exception of Serra, American art in the late 20th century appears to have

produced no great experimental innovators whose work developed over an extended period. Nor

with the possible exceptions of Johns and Stella has American art in this era produced great

conceptual innovators who made more than one important contribution. Now, with Johns, Serra,

and Stella all past the age of 60, we continue to wait to see whether any younger American artist

or artists can develop into figures whose entire careers can attract the attention of art scholars.

11.    The generally young ages in Table 4 might be attributed to the bias of the textbooks
       against recent work. Some bias is inevitable, if only because some of the books analyzed
       were published early in the 1990s, so obviously could not present later work. And Table
       4 contains no period in any artist’s career that runs past 1990. Yet the same is not true for
       the late 1980s, for the table does contain two periods from that time, as Jeff Koons’ work
       from 1985-89 ties for 7th place, and Jenny Holzer’s work from 1986-90 ties for 12th. In
       1985, 10 of the artists in the sample were 45 or older, yet none appears in Table 4 for
       work done after that age.
