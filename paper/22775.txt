This paper investigates theoretically and empirically the factional arrangements and dynamics
within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the governing political party of the People's
Republic of China. Our empirical analysis ranges from the end of the Deng Xiaoping era to the
current Xi Jinping presidency and covers the appointments of both national and provincial
officials. We present a set of new empirical regularities within the CCP and a theoretical
framework suited to model factional politics within single-party regimes.

1     Introduction
This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of the internal organi-
zation of Chinas political linchpin: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As
the regime party of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the CCP is de jure
and de facto the be-all and end-all of political activity in the second largest
economy and the most populous country in the world today1 . This motivates
the interest of political economists in the CCP.
    The nontransparent and often informal nature of elite interaction within a
country lacking competitive elections and with a rich history of informal polit-
ical jousting among factional leaders raises formidable obstacles to a rigorous
politico-economic analysis. The economic literature on the internal organization
(and, we will see, factional competition) at the highest levels of the Chinese
government is limited2 . Political scientists focused on China studies have been
more attentive, but also often more qualitative and descriptive, at least until
recently3 .
    The CCP remains today a secretive, selective organization of about 65 mil-
lion members who have positions of inuence in all sectors of Chinese society...
(Nathan and Gilley, 2003 p.7)4 . Operations of the Politburo and the highest
echelons of the CCP have been often described as opaque at best (Pye, 1980;
Dittmer, 1995; Shih, 2008). As reported in Nathan (2016): Deng built a system
of tacit norms by which senior leaders were limited to two terms in o¢ce, mem-
bers of the Politburo Standing Committee divided leadership roles among them-
selves, and the senior leader made decisions in consultation with other leaders
and retired elders.
    Within this context, intra-elite competition is extremely hard to assess. The
CCP o¢cially rejects factional elite politics5 , but scholars since Nathan (1973)
   1 And plays a crucial role in steering economic activity in the country. See Bai, Hsieh, and

Song (2016).
   2 The study of the political economy of China has several important exceptions, but often

not precisely focused on national elite competition. Persico, Pueblita, and Silverman (2011)
in their analysis of factional politics focus on the CCP, among their various case studies. Less
relatedly, work such as Li and Zhou (2005) focuses on the promotion pro les of provincial
leaders and so does Jia, Kudamatsu, and Seim (2015). Work by Lau, Qian, and Roland
(2000) models the process of reform under Deng Xiaoping and the reform era.
   3 Descriptive discussion most pertinent to this paper includes Li (2012, 2013). Several

quantitative exceptions are discussed in Shih (2016) with respect to scholarship in East Asian
studies and political science, while less recent examples include Huang (2000), Shih (2004,
2007); Shih, Adolph and Liu (2012).
   4 At the time of writing. By 2016 the CCP membership has grown to 88:76 million.
   5 BBC, Monday January 5, 2015: An editorial in Mondays agship newspaper, The Peo-

ples Daily, says cliques are akin to parasites and are harmful for both the country and the

have emphasized how the faction intended as patron-client clusters of mutually
linked o¢cials represents the correct unit of analysis of elite politics in China.
Since Nathan (1973), evidence supporting this interpretation has also steadily
accumulated (Pye, 1981; Dittmer and Wu, 1995; Nathan and Gilley, 2003; Shih,
2004; Li, 2012; Li, 2013; Shih, 2016; Meyer, Shih, and Lee 2016). The present
paper follows this line of inquiry, but with special attention paid to individual
incentives, supplying an inherently economic model of behavior, where lower-
level o¢cials [...] join factions in order to secure promotions and other regime
goods from powerful patrons (Shih, 2016, p.1) and where promotion dynamics
throughout the party hierarchy are microfounded and characterized. A theo-
retical contribution of this paper is in the formal model of factional interaction
that we present.
    In our model factions operate within a given party hierarchy. On the one
hand, the advantage of factions is that they provide support to their members
in obtaining promotions up the pyramid. On the other, factions allow the
allocation of that support to be decided by senior a¢liates, with the possibility
of junior members being blocked by higher ranked cofactionals keen to avoid
promoting colleagues who will compete with them for future openings. A faction
member, though potentially bene ting from cofactional support, has to bide his
time and wait for the seniors in his faction to allow that support to materialize.
The seniors make this decision based on their own career objectives, so that
a junior members ascendancy through the hierarchy is tethered to the rise of
the relevant seniors above him. Una¢liated (neutral) politicians face no such
restrictions, and this is why neutrals can also emerge in equilibrium. Though
they do not enjoy factional support, they are also not restricted in their capacity
to contest openings higher up. The analysis of the costs and bene ts of joining
factions is complicated by the dependence of promotion opportunities on the
factional composition of every level of the hierarchy at any point in time. This
determines what kind of openings may arise and who is in a position to block
advancement at any level, a problem that we study in detail.
    Our theoretical results are important in matching empirical moments in
terms of factional composition, promotion rates, and the e¤ects of changes in
the factional identity of the top leadership in China. Absent hard and veri able
information, we rely on the extant discussion of Chinese elite politics to identify
a minimal set of factions within the CCP. Factions have historically emerged
people. http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-30685782

within the CCP through close personal connections with prominent patrons
(e.g. in the cases of former General Secretary Jiang Zemin and his successor,
Hu Jintao) to mutually foster the career prospects of a¢liated cadres, and do not
necessarily represent speci c territorial or economic interest groups (Dittmer,
1995). As we discuss in Sections 2 and 3, this paper will lever only the most
obvious factional links identi ed within the CCP, links based on a¢liation to the
Communist Youth League of China (related to General Secretary Hu Jintao) or
to the so-called Shanghai Gang (a¢liated most prominently with Jiang Zemin
and levering on the special status of Shanghai in Chinese politics).
    Scholars such as Shih, Shan, and Liu (2010), Shih, Adolph, and Liu (2012),
Jia et al. (2015) have explored methodologies for the imputation of factional
linkages based on place of birth, university ties, and shared career pro les6 .
While we also focus on systematic biographical information, we remain wary
of potential mismeasurement in the identi cation of factional ties, as is likely
for factional a¢liation based purely on place of birth or shared career paths.
An important reason for this wariness will be evident in our statistical analysis.
Based on our factional de nitions and within a proximate set of party o¢cials
of almost equivalent rank in the same o¢ce and area (e.g. the number 1 and
number 2 highest ranked party members in a province), we show that members
of a faction (let us call it B) are virtually never paired with members of the same
faction B at the same o¢ce. On the contrary, they are paired with members of
a rival faction (R) beyond what would be predicted by random chance alone.
For instance, if a province has a B faction Party Secretary (ranked number 1),
the Governor (his number 2) is likely to be an R, possibly a neutral o¢cial, but
most de nitely not a B faction member. Thus simply sharing part of their career
paths may not be informative of factional a¢liation for CCP elite o¢cials, in
fact our evidence shows it may mislead completely.
    The statistical analysis of these systematic factional cross-patterns in top
CCP positions is new to the literature and will be discussed in Section 4. In
addition to studying these cross-factional patterns, Section 4 reports statisti-
cally signi cant premia in terms of promotion rates and post allocations to a
leaders cofactionals. That factions may deliver advantages to their members is
a necessary condition for our models coherence. But the existence of precisely
estimated leadership premia points also in the direction of factions both being
   6 Shih (2008, p.66) discusses issues of measurement with the premise that Despite the

centrality of factions in Chinese politics, they are extremely di¢cult to observe in a systematic
manner, especially in such an opaque political system.

reasonably identi ed within our analysis and of operative relevance within the
CCP.
    We formally explore and test for the presence of additional factions. This
is possible within our setting thanks to the structural econometric approach we
follow. We directly bring our model to the data, obtain estimates of the primitive
parameters (such as leadership premia and parameters governing the contest
functions for promotion) and formally test our mechanism against alternatives,
including mechanisms based on pure seniority or meritocracy. Our factional
model displays excellent in-sample and out-of-sample t. We show how the
estimated leadership premia in the CCP are quantitatively substantial, but quite
far from winner-take-all levels, and that the intra-faction competition among
faction members operates as a de facto endogenous dampening mechanism in
slowing factional growth.
    Our analysis includes several counterfactuals. We model possible institu-
tional changes within the CCP, including the e¤ect of increased leadership pre-
mia, which may indicate a break away from the collective leadership design
envisioned by Deng. We also study the role of the identity of the top leader-
ship, the factional role of princelings, and assess General Secretary Xi Jinpings
factional a¢liation.
    Besides the politico-economic literature on Chinese elite politics mentioned
above, this paper speaks to the literature on the internal organization of au-
tocratic regimes. Francois, Rainer, and Trebbi (2015, 2016) discuss at length
the importance of its connection to the expanding literature on the political
economy of development. Most related to our work (and one of the rst rig-
orous analyses of factional politics within the economic literature) is Persico,
Rodriguez-Pueblita, and Silverman (2011), who present a theoretical model of
endogenous factional growth and link it qualitatively to evidence from factional
local politics in Mexico within the Institutional Revolutionary Party.7
    From a theoretical perspective, Dewan and Squintani (2015) model endoge-
nous faction formation (an issue we address in our setting as well, when charac-
terizing the decision of party members to join a faction). The authors develop
a model where incentives for faction formation are ideological rather than eco-
    7 See also Belloni and Beller (1978). Persico et al. (2011) also point out to the relevance

of factional politics well beyond Mexicos camarillas or the CCP, with references to studies of
factionalism within the Japanese legislature (Cox et al., 1999, 2000) and the Italian parliament
(Zuckerman, 1975; Kato and Mershon, 2006; Ceron, 2015; and Laver and Giannetti 2004).
Factions in Australian politics are discussed in McAllister (1991). The US urban party machine
factional structure, such as in the case of Tammany Hall, are subject of an entire and even
earlier literature. See Myers (1917).

nomic (as in our setting and in Persico, Rodriguez-Pueblita and Silverman, 2011)
and show how within their framework factions may serve welfare-enhancing pur-
poses, limiting extremists within the party by tying them to moderate faction
leaders. Factions are also shown to facilitate information sharing and party
e¤ectiveness in their model.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide
a brief institutional overview of the CCP. In Section 3 we discuss our data, op-
erationalize factions, and provide a descriptive analysis of our samples. Section
4 produces a set of stylized facts, some novel, useful to frame and guide the
theoretical analysis. In Section 5 we discuss our theoretical setup and Section
6 develops our estimator. Our main empirical results are reported in Section 7.
Section 8 presents our counterfactual exercises. Section 9 concludes.


2     Institutional Background: the CCP
This section presents a brief institutional overview of the internal organization of
the CCP in the reform era. It is in no way exhaustive, but only of assistance to
the reader unfamiliar with Chinese politics in framing the analysis that follows8 .
    In 2016 the Chinese Communist Party, with its 88:8 million members, is
one of the largest political parties worldwide and one of the most enduring
(founded in 1921). The CCP organization is strongly hierarchical in nature and
the party reects one-to-one the organization of the Chinese state, as typical in
the architecture of Leninist regimes.
    The top of the CCP hierarchy is shared by the gures of the General Secre-
tary of the CCP and the second ranked member of the CCP, which respectively
assume the roles of President and Premier of the State Council of the PRC. Both
leaders belong in turn to the Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC), formed
by the other 5 members and which represents the set of the highest ranked
politicians in China. The PBSC is an expression of the 25-member Politburo
(PB), the executive body of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party. The Central Committee (CC) is de jure the highest political body in
the CCP and currently consists of 205 full members and a set of 171 Alternate
Central Committee (AC) members in junior standing relative to the full mem-
bers (and without voting rights). All members of the CC and AC are ranked
hierarchically. The CC and AC are elected during National Congresses of the
   8 See also Chapter 1 in Nathan and Gilley (2003) for a less brief overview. For a compre-

hensive discussion of elite politics in China see references in Shih (2016).

CCP and the interim plenary sessions ll retirements or deaths, granting promo-
tions (and occasionally administer demotions). Typically, CC members include
ministerial-level o¢cials and provincial ranking o¢cials, including Provincial
Party Secretaries (the highest CCP post in a Province) and Governor (the sec-
ond ranked). It is important to notice that Provinces tend to display a political
architecture that mimics the national government and the national party struc-
ture. Provincial leaders operate in the context of local party committees and
local party congresses are held typically every ve years. The CCP maintains
a pyramidal structure, branching all the way down to the village level and the
Village Party Branch Secretary.
    While not all layers of the Chinese political hierarchy present nodes mapping
into a diarchic structure, most do, typically separating party roles and admin-
istrative roles. Examples of diarchic arrangements include the presidency and
premiership as the two highest ranking members of the Politburo Standing Com-
mittee; the PRC Presidency (President and Vice President); the State Council
(Premier and Executive Vice Premier); and the top dyads at the provincial level
(Provincial Party Secretary and Governor)9 . We will occasionally refer to such
pairs of positions as position 1 and 2.
    The opportunity of entering the ranks of the CCP is closely guarded and
party membership typically guarantees access and career opportunities beyond
those available to common citizens10 . For this reason, an elaborate recruitment
process typically operates through the selection of successful university students
and through family and work connections.
    Membership of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), an ancil-
lary organization to the CCP responsible for the youth (members are typically
between 4 and 28 years of age), has traditionally operated as an entry point
in the CCP. As discussed in Li (2012, 2013), individuals with a background in
the CYLC are often referred to as members of the tuanpai (i.e. Youth League
[faction]) and tend to originate, although by no means exclusively, from the less
prosperous (red) regions11 . Li (2012) associates with the CYLC populist
    9 See Li (2014) for a discussion and examples. Other instances include the CMC (chairman

and executive vice chairman), the CCP Secretariat, the NPC and CPPCC (chairman and
executive vice chariman), the Supreme Peoples Court. Assuming the presence of such dyads
across the whole hierarchy should be simply read as allowing for the presence of a close
substitute in the party hierarchy for any member.

policies close to the rural poor and recent migrants to cities, as opposed to the
policies preferred by more elitist groups comprised by CCP cadres close to
former General Secretary Jiang Zemin and a group of party o¢cials connected
to the Shanghai municipal administration. Indeed, the economic and political
role of Shanghai cannot be emphasized enough in CCP internal interactions,
to the point that the term Shanghai Bang (Gang) has been often employed to
identify the patronage cluster close to Jiang and to the economic interests of
the coastal (blue) provinces (Li, 2002).
    Whether additional factional groups besides the CYLC and the Shanghai
Gang may be present within the CCP is unclear and disputed even among schol-
ars of Chinese elite politics. For instance, some observers point at the anomaly
of the exceptionally rapid careers of sons and daughters of prominent party of-
 cials and revolutionary veterans under Mao, often referred to as princelings.
The analysis below will discuss this speci c group of CCP members in detail.


3     Data
We combine two biographical databases of Chinese politicians. The rst data
source is China Vitae, which collects biographical information on more than
4; 494 Chinese elites in government, politics, the military, education, business,
and the media since 1992. Information provided by China Vitae includes gender,
year of birth, place of birth, ethnicity, colleges attended, and career trajectory.
Information in China Vitae comes from Chinese and English language web sites
in China that are supported by or a¢liated with the Chinese government.
    Our second data source is a biographical database of CC members developed
by Shih, Shan, and Liu (2008), and further updated by Lu and Ma (2015). This
database contains all CC and AC members from the rst Party Congress in 1921
to the eighteenth Party Congress in 2012. This data also provides biographical
information and career trajectories similar to China Vitae. We focus our analysis
on the period of 1956 to 2014, which starts from the rst Party Congress since
the founding of Peoples Republic of China (8th Party Congress in 1956) and
ends with the most recent Central Committee (18th Party Congress in 2012),
covering a total number of 1; 853 individuals.
    We combine these two data sources to construct our estimation samples.
Whenever there is inconsistency between the two data sources, (e.g. multiple
and President of the PRC Hu Jintao.



                                        8
politicians in the same position in the same year), we manually check with a
third source, typically o¢cial websites a¢liated with the Chinese government
(e.g. www.xinhuanet.com; cpc.people.com.cn). We also collect provincial popu-
lation and GDP data from China Data Online. The anti-corruption data origi-
nates from ChinaFile and Chinas Central Commission for Discipline Inspection
(CCDI) website.
    Following the literature on Chinese politics (Bo, 2008; Li, 2013a; Li, 2013b),
we construct four a¢liation indicators for the full sample of politicians: CYLC,
Shanghai Gang, but also Military and Princeling status. A politician is clas-
si ed as from the CYLC if he/she has held provincial and national level posi-
tions in CYLC. A politician is classi ed as from the Shanghai Gang if he/she
has held o¢cial positions in the Shanghai municipal party apparatus, municipal
government, municipal Peoples Congress, and municipal Peoples Political Con-
sultative Conference. This again underlies the exceptionality of the Shanghai
political machine. A politician is classi ed as from the Military if he/she served
as military personnel in the Revolutionary Era (1921-1949), or has participated
in the volunteer armies to Korea or Vietnam, or served as military personnel for
more than half of its career after the founding of Peoples Republic of China.
The restriction on the minimum time of military experience is to rule out civilian
o¢cials who work as the party secretary of a military region for a short period
of time (e.g. Hu Jintao as the First Secretary of Guizhou Military District from
1985 to 1988), or civilian o¢cials chair the Central Military Commission (e.g.
Jiang Zemin as the chairman of the Central Military Commission from 1990 to
2005). A politician is classi ed as a Princeling if he/she is from a prominent
political family, the so called red aristocracy (prominent examples include
General Secretary Xi Jinping and disgraced former governor of Liaoning Bo Xi-
lai). These four a¢liations are not mutually exclusive (for example, Xi Jinping
is both a princeling and an a¢liated of the Shanghai Gang according to our
de nition) and not all party members in our sample are a¢liated. In fact, we
allow for politicians in our sample to also be una¢liated (neutral, indicated as
N ).
    Theoretically one could consider CYLC, Shanghai Gang, military, and princelings
alternative political factions. In Section 4 we show however than only two of
these groups, CYLC and Shanghai Gang, truly exhibit the features of politi-
cal factions within the CCP. Formal statistical tests will be also developed and
brought in support of this thesis. To distinguish, we will refer to princelings and
military as groups and CYLC and Shanghai Gang as factions.

                                      9
     The military is virtually a parallel structure with limited political control,
while the princelings as a group are extremely heterogeneous and appear to
operate as a set of neutral and independently powerful actors (in fact, often times
in deep rivalry among themselves, such is the case of Bo Xilai and Xi Jinping).
While we will keep track of all types of a¢liations in the analysis that follows,
we emphasize here that our theoretical and empirical design will separate CYLC
and Shanghai Gang faction members from all other political actors, including
the military and princelings, which we will deem neutral. Because of the
traditional coloring associated with these two established factions, we will also
occasionally refer to the CYLC as the Red faction, R, and to the Shanghai Gang
as the Blue faction, B.
     Table 1 provides summary statistics of demographics and careers of 4; 494
politicians who held important positions in government, politics, the military,
education, business, and the media in China since 1992. The unit of observation
is a position-individual pair. We classify the organizations into 12 categories:
party apparatus, government, military, Peoples Congress, Chinese Peoples Po-
litical Consultative Conference (CPPCC), court, procuratorate, CYLC, busi-
ness, media, education, and an unclassi ed category. The average duration of
each position is about 4 years, and the age of starting each position varies from
the early 30s (CYLC) to the late 50s (Peoples Congress). Individuals who
hold these positions are predominately male, which reects the large gender
imbalance at the top levels of government and business in China12 . Ethnicity is
predominately Han, reective of the ethnic composition in the Chinese popula-
tion. The last four columns provide the frequency of the various a¢liations in
each type of organization. CYLC members tend to work in the party apparatus
and media instead of the government system.13 The Shanghai Gang is more
evenly distributed across all types of organizations. Princelings are more likely
to have experience in the military, but are less likely to work in the legal system
(court and procuratorate), potentially due to the fact that the power of the
judiciary is relatively muted in China.
     We then turn our focus to a subset of elites, the members of Central Com-
mittees of the CCP. This is a group of around 400 people who comprise the
CCP top leaders. Table 2 provides the demographics and the factional a¢lia-
 1 2 25:1%of CCP members were women in 2016.
 1 3 This
        is consistent with the anecdotal discussion of Ho¤mann and Enright (2008) that
CYLC leaders often have experience in non-economic elds, such as party organization and
propaganda

tion by sessions of the Central Committees. Similarly to the larger sample of
elites, the CC members are predominantly male, in their mid-50s and mostly
Han. Over the past 60 years, more members hold college or even post-graduate
degrees. However, only 10 percent of them studied or worked abroad. More
than 10 percent of them have worked as personal secretaries (Mishu) of promi-
nent politicians, illustrating the importance of personal ties in Chinese politics.
Conditioning on entering the Central Committee, around 20 percent of them
are promoted into higher level in the four levels of the Central Committee, and
around 50 percent will retire in next CC session. In terms of factional a¢liation,
CYLC, Shanghai Gang, and princelings each account for around 5 percent to
10 percent of members. The military has experienced a large downward trend,
dropping from 56 percent in the 8th Central Committee to less than 20 percent
in recent years.


4    CCP Factional Politics: Reduced Form Re-
     sults
This section presents a set of facts on factional politics in China, the most
important of which are novel to the best of our knowledge. These stylized facts
are going to inform and motivate the theoretical analysis that follows.
    i) National Political Actors. We begin by arguing qualitatively that the
factional a¢liations we posit (CYLC and Shanghai Gang) share properties that
make them bona de large national players within the CCP and are not merely
political actors representing local constituencies.
    In Figure 1 and Table 3 we describe the geographic distribution of members
a¢liated with the CYLC and the Shanghai Gang in provincial roles. As is
evident, the representation across provinces is fairly broad and not limited to a
particular local area, despite a small positive correlation between the presence
of Shanghai Gang and the average GDP per capita of the province. On the
other hand, individuals associated with princelings and the military group are
distributed more unevenly: princelings are more likely to hold positions in rich
costal areas  possibly due to their privileged status  while military members
are more concentrated in poorer western provinces and places with strategic
importance (e.g. Fujian, which neighbors Taiwan).
    ii) Cross-Factional Mix. Useful to the understanding of factional dynamics
within the CCP is the study of the peculiar factional mix which we observe when


                                        11
sampling the diarchic nodes pervading Chinese institutional design. These are
pairs of positions of similar rank and operating in close institutional vicinity to
each other. Table 4 reports formal statistical tests of the factional composition
of virtually all top two leadership posts in post-Deng China. In particular, we
ask: given the factional a¢liation of a politician sitting in one of the top two
leadership positions of a national or provincial organ, what is the likelihood
that the other position will be held by a cofactional member? It turns out it is
extremely low.
    Table 4 shows panel regressions of the factional a¢liation of the number 1
o¢cial on the number 2 o¢cials a¢liation at the same node. The variables
CY LC1 and Shanghai1 (respectively, CY LC2 and Shanghai2) are dummies
which equal 1 if the number 1 o¢cial (respectively, number 2) is from that faction
and 0 otherwise. We will also refer to such factions through the abbreviations
R; B. The sample period is from 1992 to 2014. Columns 1-4 include all posi-
tions, and Columns 5-6 break down to provincial and national level positions.
The provincial positions include 31 provincial and municipal units (secretary
and governor)14 . The national positions include the Politburo Standing Com-
mittee (two highest ranking members), PRC presidency (President and Vice
President), the State Council (Premier and Executive Vice Premier), Central
Military Committee (Chairman and Executive Vice Chairman), CCP Secre-
tariat (two highest ranking secretaries), NPC (Chairman and Executive Vice
Chairman), CPPCC (Chairman and Executive Vice Chairman), the Supreme
Peoples Court (President and Executive Vice President).
    Taking the top two leadership positions in any CCP (or PRC) organ, posi-
tion 2 being lled by a R (respectively, a B) politician predicts negatively and
signi cantly the likelihood of position 1 being lled by an R (respectively, a
B) politician. The estimated negative coe¢cients indicate a statistically robust
lower likelihood of same-faction pairs (R; R) or (B; B) relative to what would
happen in case of pairings forming randomly between B; R; N . Interestingly,
the evidence for princelings is much weaker, in line with further evidence below
showing their lack of behavior as an organized faction. In Table 5 we further
show that there is also a statistically precise excess likelihood of matching pairs
in the form (R; B) and (B; R) relative to possible pairings with neutrals, N .
    The presence of cross-factional pairs exceeds signi cantly what would emerge
by random chance alone. To the best of our knowledge these facts on systematic
 1 4 Shanghai   Municipality is excluded in the regression sample of Shanghai Gang.

cross-matching within Chinese elite politics are new. An implication of this evi-
dence is that methodologies imputing factional a¢liation based solely on shared
professional paths may be highly deceptive, as discussed in the Introduction.
    iii) Leadership Premia. A crucial feature of any theoretical model of fac-
tional politics is the ability of factions to deliver resources to their members.
This seems a necessary condition that our factional de nition should satisfy, a
conceptual underpinning that we must be able to verify in the CCP data in
order to justify our approach.
    We will do this in what is possibly the starkest way: estimating premia in
factional seat assignment and promotion rates of cofactionals of the country
leader (i.e. the PRC President and General Secretary of the CCP). Again, we
are not aware of any systematic analysis of this type for the CYLC and Shanghai
Gang.
    Table 6 shows a panel regression of promotion and retirement dummies on
the factional a¢liation of Central Committee members interacted with the fac-
tion of the General Secretary. The sample includes all members of the 8th to
the 18th Central Committees (Politburo Standing Committee members are ex-
cluded from the promotion regression). Promotion is equal to 1 if a Central
Committee member moves up in the rank de ned by the four levels of Central
Committee (1 PBSC, 2 PB, 3 CC, and 4 AC).
    As is clear from the reduced form regressions, an R (respectively, a B) politi-
cian has substantially higher likelihood of promotion when an R (respectively, a
B) leader is in power. On average CYLC and Shanghai Gang members exhibit
promotion rates higher by 10 percentage points relative to neutral members
(excluding military and princelings), as reported in Appendix Table 3. How-
ever, this result masks substantial heterogeneity. While promotion rates hover
around 4 percentage points higher in times where the leadership is not from an
individual faction, having a cofactional leader adds 20:6 percentage points to
CYLC and 19:3 to Shanghai Gang, inducing a substantial, highly signi cant,
leadership premium in the speed at which leaders cofactionals are promoted.
Figure 2 provides a vivid visualization of the leadership premia in promotion
rates.
    We also perform an analysis looking at allocations of crucial posts to factional
members. The dependent variables include: the share of o¢cial positions allo-
cated to a faction constructed following the scheme of Bo (2010) and weighted
by value (we will refer to it as power score); the share of seats of Alternative
Central Committee members (AC); of the full Central Committee (CC); of the

                                        13
Politburo members (PB); and of the Politburo Standing Committee members
(PBSC). These e¤ects are reported in Table 7. Leadership premia are statis-
tically signi cant, between 4 percentage points higher in terms of power score
shares for the CYLC and around 2 percentage points for the Shanghai Gang.
These estimates are not trivial, but quite far from winner-take-all levels. The
leadership premia in the power score can be easily observed in the simple time
series plots of Figure 3.
     iv) Anti-Corruption Campaign. As in the allocation of rewards to cofaction-
als through leadership premia, we would also expect evidence of factional bias
in the administration of punishment. We have limited systematic evidence in
this respect, but it interestingly points in a direction consistent with the limited
leadership premia discussed at point iii).
     This novel evidence comes from the factional analysis of the CCP members
hit by President Xi Jinpings anti-corruption campaign (initiated in 2012 and
still ongoing as of 2016). A remarkable factional balance seems to be present
in the administration of punishment, when looking at the detailed resumes of
the so-called tigers, a code name for high-ranking party members a¤ected
by the purge15 . Table 8 shows that both CYLC16 and Shanghai Gang cadres
appear represented in the purged sample17 and, importantly, both factions are
represented in shares proportional to their overall representation in the upper
echelons of the CCP, and not statistically signi cantly higher or lower. The
reader may however notice a lower, but not signi cant, representation of Shang-
hai Gang members, the faction most likely to be associated with Xi (if at all
see Section 8).
     v) Post-Deng era. Finally, we provide brief empirical justi cation for our
focus on the post-Deng era. Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping have been often
characterized as political strong men by many observers, as their legendary
careers in the revolutionary era won them ultimate control over the military. In
   1 5 As opposed to low-level politicians, ies, involved in petty corruption. Tigers directly

hit by the anti-corruption purge have included retired PBSC member Zhou Yongkang and
retired PB member Xu Caiou.
   1 6 Links to the CYLC were evident in o¢cial news releases by The Peoples Daily which

explicitly singled out speci c subsets of this faction, particularly "The Shanxi Gang", o¢cials
linked to Ling Jihua, a disgraced protegé of Hu Jintao. http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-
china-blog-30685782
   1 7 We build a corruption dummy indicator for whether a political/military o¢cial is listed

in the public anticorruption database of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and
from ChinaFile. Table 8 shows the cross-section regression of corruption dummy on faction
a¢liation of an o¢cial. The sample includes all the individuals covered by China Vitae who
have not retired in the year of 2007, the year of 17th party Congress. We dropped military
personnel from the sample as the coverage of this group is relatively limited in China Vitae.



                                               14
contrast, subsequent leaders, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping, appear
categorically di¤erent: civilian o¢cers who rose through the party hierarchy
relying on their ability and connections. This structural break is evident in the
data.
    Underlying the symbolic retirement of Deng in 1989, we document structural
changes in the whole spectrum of political elites. Figure 4 shows the share
of power score by factions or groups in the Central Committees of the CCP.
Post-Deng China witnesses a signi cant decline in the inuence of the military
group, and a rise in factions such as CYLC and Shanghai Gang. Figure 5 breaks
down the power score by four constituencies of the Central Committee: state
organs, party apparatus, military, and regional governments. The pre-Deng
era was ridden with volatile shifts across constituencies, with the most salient
example being the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, during which
state organs and party apparatus were virtually paralyzed. In contrast, the
post-Deng era witnessed the stabilization of power shares for each constituency.
Despite the lack of political reform often alleged by outside observers, the above
evidence suggests that Chinese politics evolved to a new phase in which political
strongmen became replaced by factional politics after Deng18 . This is the period
we focus on.


5     Model
Having produced a series of statistical regularities pointing in the direction of
a systematic role for factional a¢liation in the organization of the CCP (and
the Chinese state more in general), we now proceed with the construction of a
formal theory useful to understanding the incentive structure driving the data
in the post-Deng era.


5.1     The Hierarchy of Positions
There is a L level hierarchy of leadership positions, ordered from the highest
level 1, to the bottom, L. Each level, `, of the hierarchy has a M (`)=2 leader-
ship nodes. Each leadership node has a pair of leadership positions. The two
positions at each node are ordered (position 1 and position 2). The hierarchy
  1 8 Appendix Figure 3 shows additional evidence that age limits on Politburo members are

strictly and systematically enforced in the post-Deng era, again another sign of break toward
institutional regularization.




                                             15
is broken up into regions, each of which nests a higher number of smaller re-
gions below it. Level 1, the top level, has one node and hence two positions;
M (1) = 2: It is the paramount leadership node for the country as a whole (cur-
rently, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang). Level 2, the second layer
in the hierarchy, has M (2) > M (1) positions divided up into M (2)=2 , and so
on, with the number of positions strictly increasing down to level L. The nodes
at the lowest level are the entry leadership positions, corresponding to the
  rst step in a political life that we model.
    Time is continuous. Each individual politician dies (or exogenously re-
tires) with an instantaneous probability, , which also acts as the instantaneous
discount rate. Upon a politicians demise, his or her position opens up for re-
placement. A politicians position also opens up when promoted to a position
above, freeing the current spot. We assume that the ow utility from being
in o¢ce is increasing in the position within the hierarchy. Denote by u(`) the
instantaneous utility generated at any position at level `, with ` 2 f1; : : : ; Lg,
so that u(`) > u(` + 1). Positions within a level are ranked, but the utility ow
di¤erence is small. Position 1 at a node at any level ` is preferred to position 2,
but to reduce complexity, simply refer to each as identically generating a ow
of u(`):19
    Politicians cannot leapfrog levels of the hierarchy. An opening for either
leadership position at a node in level ` is lled by applicants from that level,
or the level immediately below, level ` + 1. The only exception is positions at
entry L (where there is no lower position). Though levels cannot be jumped,
positions within a level can. Leaders can move from one level in the hierarchy
to the next without having to progress through all the positions at their level.
For example, a leader at position 2 in level ` + 1 can be promoted to position 1
in level ` without having to rst go to through the intervening positions.
    All eligible leaders from lower positions can apply for openings. It costs an
arbitrarily small amount to do so. So, if there is an opening at position 1 in
any node of level `, then all position 2 leaders in level ` will apply, as well as
all leaders from position ` + 1. If a position opens up at position 2 at a node in
level `, then all leaders from ` + 1 will apply. The winning applicant is said to
be promoted up a step in the hierarchy.
  1 9 Formally: position 1 generates  ! 0+ extra utility relative to a position 2 at all ` in the

same node.




                                               16
5.2     Factions
There are two factions, denoted B (Blue) and R (Red), and the remaining
individuals are neutrals, denoted N .20 Factions exist to create promotion op-
portunities for their members and are organized in a hierarchy. A faction can
support one and only one member applying for a single position. A faction mem-
ber not supported by his faction for an opening cannot win promotion against
a supported member.21 For the time being, let us assume factions randomly
choose whom to support amongst their eligible candidates.22
    When a faction holds the paramount position, the e¤ect of promotion sup-
port is enhanced, thus increasing the chances of the paramount leaders factions
candidate winning promotion vis-à-vis the other faction candidate and neutrals.
    Factions write binding contracts with their members determining and re-
stricting how factional support will be allocated. One can never quit a faction
and the contract is a quid-pro-quo. On the way up the leadership hierarchy, the
faction member will be helped in obtaining positions through the support from
the faction infrastructure. If the paramount leader is from his faction, he will
receive additional support. If he eventually becomes the paramount leader, the
faction member will then o¤er the same support to the juniors that will follow
him in return. This speci c characterization of a faction aims at capturing in
a stylized fashion the essential patron-client nature of such an organization, as
strongly emphasized in Nathan (1973).
    Factions are organized geographically (for the sake of exposition and, to a
certain extent, realism), in a way that mimics the allocation of power positions
within the country. The most senior faction member is the individual with the
highest leadership position in the hierarchy. Any faction member occupying a
leadership position at level ` is senior to a faction member at level `0 > `. Faction
members are designated by their region. A member who has a position at the top
of the government is in the region of the whole country, but a member holding a
position at the top of a provincial government is a member of that province and
is parallel in faction seniority to a member holding a similar position in another
province. This person has factional seniority over all individuals below him in
  2 0 The presence of more than two factions is easily incorporated. Here, we maintain this

assumption only for expositional purposes and in line with the empirical analysis that follows.
  2 1 Or against a neutral.
  2 2 We will relax this assumption below when we introduce a role for meritocracy and seniority

in promotions. If a faction does not support a member, he could, in principle, quit the faction
and contest positions as a neutral. We do not allow this, implicitly assuming that the costs
of doing this are prohibitive  factions are like the ma a: able to severely punish people who
do not ful l commitments.


                                              17
the leadership hierarchy within his province. So, if a member of faction B is
the provincial leader in province a, he has factional seniority over any member
of faction B who is a village leader in province a. He does not have factional
precedence over a village leader in province c, or any other B member who is
not in a.

5.2.1    Vetoes

Factions exist to facilitate their members rise through the leadership hierar-
chy. This requires having both as many members as possible and ensuring that
members attain promotions. Each of these dimensions increases the probabil-
ity of the faction being powerful, i.e. attaining the paramount leadership.
But given that factional support for a contested position can only be given to
a single faction member, an individual may have personal incentives that run
counter to his factions objectives. For instance, a member may have an incen-
tive to block the rise of cofactionals who could dilute his own factional support
in future competitions for promotion. Factions guard against this by allowing
for a seniority veto in allocating support for promotions. Support can be given
if, and only if, no faction member within the region of the opening and senior
to the candidate requesting support blocks it. Thus, when an opening arises
in a region, each cofactional at equivalent or higher levels of seniority to the
opening in that region can veto the provision of support. Vetoes importantly
allow for individuals to block the rise of a member from the same faction who
would directly compete with them for factional support in a future opening23 .
     Such localized blocking of cofactional members will be very important in
determining the shape of factional allocations throughout the hierarchy and
the distribution of individuals across factions. The veto ensures that a faction
member never has to support someone in his region from his own faction that
will directly compete with him for subsequent promotions. At the same time,
since the veto is regional, it does not provide so much blocking power that
   2 3 Vetoes can be exercised for a promotion anywhere below in the hierarchy - as long as

within ones region of pertinence. However, a politician at ` has no interest in vetoing any
co-faction member below ` + 1. He can always veto them if, and when, they get to ` + 1.
If vetoes cost even an arbitrarily small amount, they will not be exercised for promotions
up to any level lower than `, else they may be wasted (a politician may be promoted to
` 1, potential rivals may retire, etc.). The single exception is where all politicians below are
cofaction members. According to the model, a politician above would never let this happen
and would have vetoed the rise of one of these cofactionals to avoid such a situation and ensure
there is at least one individual below who can be promoted to his accompanying position not
from his faction. Reassuringly, this is observed at all levels and for all periods in the data.




                                              18
a high up faction member can freeze the advancement of anyone below him
anywhere in the country. Providing these limited vetoes is the factions way of
balancing career incentives while lessening the costs of intra-faction rivalry, so
that su¢cient faction members in the hierarchy have a good chance of attaining
the paramount leadership.


5.3    The State Variable
In principle, promotion probabilities at each point in time for each politician
in the hierarchy will depend on their faction and the distribution of faction
members across all other positions in the hierarchy. Hence, we will need to
de ne the full distribution of positions by faction as the state variable of the
                                                                   PL
system. Denote this by S t at instant t. The state space is thus a `=1 M (`)`
dimensional space, with each dimension taking one of three values B; R; N . The
state does not change if no position opens up. However, each time an opening
happens at a level `, then one individual will be promoted from ` + 1 to ` to ll
the open position, creating an opening at ` + 1 leading to one promotion from
` + 2, and so on, until the bottom of the hierarchy L, where a new politician
enters and chooses his faction. Thus a single opening will lead to a cascade
or, what we call, a chain of promotions. We assume that these chains occur
instantaneously, and if at least one individual moving in a chain replaces an
individual from a di¤erent faction, then S t changes.


5.4    Paramount Leadership and Contests
In a competition for promotion with one member supported from each faction
and one neutral politician, the probability of winning promotion, for a I faction
member is given by the following contest function, W (I):

                                                i
                             W (I) =                ;                         (1)
                                             ++
                          where i =         ; if I = B;
                                 i = ; if I = R;
                                 i = ; if I = N:

     ; ; and  are parameters determining the strength of faction members in
the contest function. Since a faction can only support a single member, the rel-
ative value of faction membership for a single politician, compared with being a


                                       19
neutral, depends on both the size of these parameters and the endogenous num-
ber of eligible candidates from that faction. Additionally, having the paramount
leadership position in your faction helps getting a promotion for the factions
supported candidate. If the paramount leader comes from faction B; we allow
  l
    > , and if from faction R we allow l > , thus incorporating leadership
premia in the model.24
    Neutrals contesting a position operate as a somewhat disorganized faction.
The overall likelihood of a position going to a neutral is una¤ected by the
number of neutrals contesting a position, provided there is at least one. Their
total contest weight function is . This treats neutrals symmetrically to factions
and can be thought of as a proportional diluting of the neutral support in the
same way a factions support would be diluted were they to forward multiple
candidates instead of one.

5.4.1    Promotions and Factional Distributions

The hierarchical structure of positions within the party is taken as given and
constant over time.
    Promotions arise to ll openings occasioned by a death/retirement or other
promotions. As already explained, a single death can have many knock-on
e¤ects. At level 1, the instantaneous probability of an opening arising at any
position is . Since this is the highest level we observe, only death/retirement
removes the top leader. However, the instantaneous probability of an opening
arising at a post at level 2 comprises the death hazard , plus the probability
that there was an opening at level 1 and the individual at that level 2 post
ascended to level 1 to ll it. This probability of promotion can, in principle,
depend on both the factional a¢liation of the individual at the post at level
2 and the faction of the individual at the post partnering the opening at level
1. Similarly, the instantaneous probability of an opening at a post at level 3
is  plus the probability that the individual at the post at level 3 ascended to
an opening at level 2 in the hierarchy, and so on. In the estimation Section 6
that follows these knock on promotions, or promotion chains, will be explicitly
computed.
           t
    Let pJI (`) denote the probability that an I faction member at level ` gets
   2 4 We allow for the possibility of no factional advantage, which might be especially likely at

low levels of the hierarchy where the reach of the paramount leader could be muted. Note that
it is also the case that a neutrals ascension to the paramount position does not advantage
neutrals down the hierarchy.



                                               20
promoted to an opening paired with a J at level ` 1 at instant t, for I; J =
B; R; or N . Let I t (`) denote the number of positions held by faction I at level
`; at time t for I = B; R; or N . By de nition M (`) = Rt (`) + B t (`) + N t (`).
Since the instantaneous arrival rate of death is  at any position, there are, in
expectation, I t (`)  deaths arriving at a position paired with an I at level ` each
t, and M (`) at level ` in general at each instant.
    Let  tI (`) denote the instantaneous arrival rate of promotions for an I politi-
cian at level `: Consider rst the simplest case, which is a promotion from level
2 to the top of the hierarchy ` = 1. Since there are, in expectation, I t (1)
openings arriving for a position paired with an I due to a death, and since at
level 1 there is no other way for an opening to arise, the instantaneous arrival
of promotion for a I from level 2 is:25

                    tI (2)                                                                (2)
                                        t               t                       t
              = Rt (1)   pR        t         N        t         B
                            I (2) + N (1)   pI (2) + B (1)   pI (2):


    We can now similarly compute the arrival of promotions from level 3 to level
2. Intuitively, the possibility of these arises when either a leader at level 2 dies,
or is himself promoted to level 1, which in turn depends on a death at level 1 as
speci ed in equation (2). Using these, we can compute the instantaneous arrival
of promotions for an I from level 3 at t as:

                    tI (3)
                                         t
                                                                    Nt
              = Rt (2)  +  tR (2)  pR         t         t

                                       I (3) + N (2)  +  N (2)  pI (3)

enter recursively, allowing the computation of arrival rates for all I factions all

Note that J (the faction of the politician that the opening at level ` 1 is
paired with) does not enter directly into the probability of winning a promotion
contest. But this is because speci cation (4) assumes that if members of another
faction are present, one of them will always be supported in the contest for the
position. As we now demonstrate, this will not always be the case, which will
in fact simplify the expression above considerably:

Proposition 1 i) A politician from faction J at level ` will veto the support of
a cofactional member ascending to his level from ` + 1 at t if there are members
of both I 6= J and neutrals, N , at level `.
    ii) If there are no members of faction I at level `, a politician from faction
J 6= I at level ` will veto a member of his own faction from ` + 1 at t if the
number of cofactional members at level ` is such that J t (`) < j+i where i = ,
            t                          t
j =  if J = R and i = , j = if J = B.

Proof. All proofs are in Appendix.
   If both R; B types are represented at a politicians level, he will gain by
vetoing the ascension of a competitor from his own faction, as this increases the
probability that his faction will support him for a subsequent opening at the


                                            22
level above. However, if all other factions are not already present, then he faces a
trade-o¤. By vetoing a cofactionals promotion the party member still improves
his chances of gaining factional support. But he also increases the chance that
a member of a rival faction, which was not already present, gains entry to the
group of competitors. This lowers the chances of him winning promotion condi-
tional upon receiving the support of his faction. The su¢cient condition in the
statement of Proposition 1 ensures that the former e¤ect dominates the latter.
From now on, we proceed under the assumption that the su¢cient condition for
vetoes holds, so that we continue to see them throughout our observations. We
will verify that this is indeed the case in the data, so we do not dwell on weaker
necessary conditions for vetoes to hold further.
    Following Proposition 1, vetoes generate a large amount of structure to the
pattern of openings  meaning no two cofactional members will ever be paired at
the same node. We have already veri ed in Section 4 that this is, in fact, a sys-
tematic feature of the data. Moreover, the prospects of promotion at any node
depend not only on the distribution of openings immediately above, but also
on the distribution of openings further up, as these determine the chances that
a politician immediately above will himself be promoted. Promotion chances
at all levels are a¤ected by the full distribution of positions above. We can
compute this explicitly using the recursive structure of the  tI (`) terms and our
results on vetoes.

Proposition 2 The instantaneous arrival rate of promotions at each level of
the hierarchy is as follows.
    Let ItB = 1, i¤ B t (`) > 0 and ItB = 0, otherwise; ItR = 1, i¤ Rt (`) > 0 and

      For each one of these expressions we can see the negative dependence on the
prevalence of ones own faction members. Take for example the last expression
for R. The greater the number of other Rs at level ` at t, the more diluted
is an Rs support (i.e. the lower the probability that any given R member
will be chosen by the faction as the one to be supported), as per Rt (`) in the
denominator. Further, the more frequent the Rs at level ` 1 the harder it is
to get an opening for which an R at ` will not be vetoed (e.g. at the extreme
if Rt (` 1) = M t (` 1), then  tR (`) = 0). This is true for all levels of the
hierarchy from the recursion of these equations.
      The proposition highlights the possible down side of factional a¢liation.
Though factions have the potential to provide support for promotions such
support is decided by cofaction members sitting above one in the hierarchy.
They will never let a junior member contest with them for their own future
promotions so, in a sense, the rise of the junior is tethered to, and thus depends
upon, the rise of the cofactional seniors. If they do not rise then not only do
they not generate the extra support that comes from the paramount leadership,
they actively block their own juniors from ascending in their place.
      Finally, note that each statement of  tI in Proposition 2 ignores the e¤ect of a
factions holding of the paramount leadership on promotion (i.e. il ). E¤ectively
 tI is written for the case of an N in paramount leadership. In the Appendix we
state the full set of  tI conditional upon paramount leadership a¢liation.


5.5    Entry
Entry into the hierarchy of political positions occurs only at the lowest level, L.
An entering politician at instant t decides which faction to join when starting
his politician career, or to contest as a neutral, and bases this decision on the
discounted expected utility he will receive via each one of the options. He
maximizes his discounted expected utility stream:
                                         Z   1
                                  Vt =           e   s s
                                                       ds
                                         t


                                             24
where  t is the instantaneous utility at t: We formally consider this decision here.
Recall that u(`) denotes the politician per instant payo¤ to holding a position
at level ` 2 f1; Lg in the hierarchy. So that if a politician holds a position at
` at instant t then  t = u(`). De ne the corresponding value function for a
politician of type I = B; R; N at level ` at instant t by, VIt (`). This is related
to the promotion probabilities,  tI (`) ; via the Bellman equation:

                 Et VIt (`) = u(`) +  tI (`) Et VIt (`            VIt (`)
                                                                          
                                                              1)                 (5)

The expectations operator appears in the expression because the value of be-
ing a type I politician at ` depends on the instantaneous probability of being
promoted to level VIt (` 1): Though this is known at instant t, via  tI (`) ; the
value of being at this higher level in turn depends on the evolution of  tI (`) :
The evolution of these  tI (`) promotion probabilities themselves depend on the
state of the system, S t ; which is changing continuously in a stochastic manner
due to deaths, openings, and promotions occurring through time via the contest
function (1).
    The entering politician at t chooses the faction with the highest expected
utility stream:

                                     Et VBt (L); Et VRt (L); Et VNt (L) :
                                 
                       sup                                                       (6)
                    I2fB;R;N g


After entry, since a politician is xed in his faction from then on, his choices
are simple. He will apply for all promotions to which he is eligible, and he will
veto according to Proposition 1. We consider the more di¢cult problem of the
initial entry decision (6) now.


5.6    Equilibrium Behavior
Entering politicians will choose to enter the faction (or remain neutral) yielding
the highest expected utility, which implies choosing the faction guaranteeing the
fastest progression through the hierarchy in expectation. The most immediately
relevant information for the agent will be the arrival of promotions if he/she
registers as a I politician from level L to L 1, but one cannot specify, a priori,
the relative weight an entering politician puts on the chances of being promoted
at higher levels of the hierarchy compared to lower levels. Perhaps politicians
care little about regional promotions, that occur early in their career, but greatly
about promotions from the province to the central government. Conversely,

                                              25
politicians may put substantial value on their immediate entry prospects. Note
that, indirectly at least, the relative performance of factions at higher levels
already enters into a politicians evaluation of promotion at the lowest level,
L, since openings immediately above depend negatively on the frequency of
cofactional politicians all the way up the hierarchy; as discussed above after
proposition 2. At any point in time this valuation will depend on the full
distribution of positions higher than the politician, that is on S t , the high-
dimensionality state space of the system. Without mapping the full form of
expected hierarchy evolution, it is not possible to compute the value function
VIt (`) analytically. However, it is possible to establish a su¢cient condition
under which optimal entry ensures that along any time path all factional types
and neutrals will be observed in equilibrium:

Proposition 3 With M (`) large enough for all `, any equilibrium necessarily
involves politicians in factions B; R; and N .

    Intuitively, with su¢ciently many openings at all levels of the hierarchy, the
value of entering via a faction (or as a neutral) that is not already present will
eventually outweigh even the largest parametric disadvantages of that faction
(or being a neutral). That is, for example, even if   (so ceteris paribus it
is better to enter as an R than a B), if there are su¢ciently many positions in
the hierarchy, a large number of R members and proposition 1 will imply that
the expected promotion rate will be faster if entering as a (rare) B member
over entering as (one of the many) R. Thus, though we are not able to fully
characterize optimal entry in an equilibrium, the su¢cient condition of the
proposition ensures that any equilibrium distribution of positions that we do
observe will feature both factions and neutrals.


5.7        From Model to Data
Openings in the hierarchy occur at any point in time via the functions in Propo-
sition 2. Other than through the e¤ect of time on the changing distribution of
factions across the hierarchy St , which the model explicitly accounts for, the
process leading to openings occurs independently of time (conditional on St )26 .
   Treating openings this way amounts to assuming that openings are indepen-
dent events caused by exogenous factors, each triggering a chain of knock on
e¤ects. This assumption may be violated at the time of Chinese Communist
 2 6 In   what follows below we will dispense with the time index t for the empirical analysis.


                                                26
Party Congresses, when there appear to be a large number of shu­es at dif-
ferent levels of the hierarchy observed in a way that appears simultaneous, not
sequential. Indeed, for the most part, the data is observed at low frequency,
i.e. at each CCP Congress T; T + 1; ::: This implies that the promotion chains
that our model postulates are not fully observable, so simulation methods will
be necessary to link two subsequent ST ,ST +1 .
     To operationalize the model in our speci c empirical setting, we will assume
that the simultaneity observed in exits and promotions reects a particular
structure, as follows.
     First, we purge all individuals from all positions that we observe leaving the
data in between snapshots T; T + 1; ::: That is, all individuals who are no longer
present between times T and T + 1 are assumed to have retired at some point
between two Congresses.
     Second, openings are lled through a sequence of promotion chains. Each
chain starts with the highest ranked exit in the sample and selects politicians to
  ll in the knock-on openings sequentially. This continues until all the exits and
promotions between ST and ST +1 are accounted for and all positions have been
  lled. Because there are many sets of promotion chains that can rationalize the
observed openings in the data, Section 6 shows how simulation methods can be
used to transparently address this issue in practice.
     Third, for positions for which there is no explicit dyadic structure in the
data, we draw at random a paired politician from the set of potential matches
at the level at which the promotion occurs.


5.8    Discussion of the Model
Before moving to the estimation of the model, we o¤er here a brief discussion
of an alternative modeling choice and justify our speci c line of reasoning em-
pirically.
    Perhaps the best alternative to our individual career concerns model is a
model that views the allocation of positions as the outcome of factional bar-
gaining. In such a model the faction, as opposed to the individual politician, is
the decision maker, and factions negotiate with each other over the allocation
of positions in the hierarchy. Negotiations would favour the faction holding the
paramount leadership position, and could thus easily exhibit the patterns of
increased representation at all levels with leadership of a faction. The relative
overall balancing could also be supported as an equilibrium outcome that en-


                                        27
sures peace. If a leader comes from faction B he is not willing to completely
expropriate faction R because he fears dissent from R. Dissent in extreme cases
could take the form of revolt that would destabilize not just his own position
but, in the limit, the overall hold of the party. So positions could be still allo-
cated to the other faction, as a price for peace. Reciprocally, the other faction
might show similar restraint if it ascended to the paramount position. Antic-
ipating this, the current leader would have further incentives to be moderate
and inclusive in allocating positions.
    Problems arise for this alternative story when the actual distribution of
positions  and not just their overall number  is scrutinized further, as done
in Section 4. We saw that a pronounced pattern in the data was the omission
of (B; B) and (R; R) pairs at leadership nodes. R members are more likely to
be accompanied by B members than by N members and much less likely to be
accompanied by another R  which is extremely rare. Why? One explanation
consistent with factional negotiations is that each faction fears that the other
faction may gain control of the node. If a B is in place, placing an R alongside
him ensures that the B members do not gain permanent control of the node.
But this sort of concern does not seem likely as there does not appear to be
evidence of such permanent nodal control in the data. We observe shu­ing of
cadres occurring regularly for Provinces for instance. There does not seem to
be lock in of factions to posts. B members are replaced by R members at a
node with the R subsequently replaced by another B. This evidence is available
upon request.
    But shu­ing could itself be the strategy that factions employ to ensure that
control does not get held too strongly. We may see B members replaced by R
members in order to ensure that the B members do not hold the position at the
node too strongly. But if this is the case, a further puzzle arises. A process of
shu­ing  though able to easily explain (B; R) nodes  would not especially
favour these. We should also regularly see (B; B) nodes and (R; R) nodes, which
are then replaced by (R; R) and (B; B) nodes immediately after. If shu­ing is
used to avoid entrenchment, then there is no reason that intertemporal sharing of
the nodes should not be su¢cient to achieve this. There should be no particular
reason to see the proliferation of (B; R) nodes that we observe in the data.
    This seems to be the single most di¢cult fact to explain with a factional
balancing model. Our individual career-concerns model explains this directly.
In our view, the model we develop has a further advantage relative to a model
that treats the factions as bargaining parties in that it treats the decision maker

                                        28
as the individual, in a microfounded way.


6     Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation
This Section describes our estimation methodology. De ne Y the observed data
on career outcomes (i.e. promotions, exits, etc.) between two Congresses T
and T + 1 and X the observed data on the hierarchy plus a set of individual
characteristics (i.e. X includes factions and position within the hierarchy/level
ST , plus individual covariates).
    We de ne k as a set of promotion chains, so that k = fk(1); k(2); :::g, where
each chain k(c) of politicians (say, s0 ; s; s0 ;and s00 ) is simply a set of politicians
each belonging to di¤erent, but adjacent hierarchical levels `, whose promotions
were triggered by the exit of the highest ranking one of the chain (e.g. when
s0 dies or retires, s is promoted from ` = 2 to ` = 1, then s0 replaces s at level
` = 2, and then s00 replaces s0 at ` = 3).
    A chain starts from an opening at level ` 1 and involves promotions from
` all the way down to L.27
    We impose that each politician promoted in the data belongs to exactly one
chain and that each change between ST and ST +1 is part of at least one chain
k(c): (A politician promoted by two levels between T and T + 1 will need to
belong to two separate promotion chains.) Let C = # (k) be the number of
promotion chains in set k.
    The unconditional likelihood of observing Y given X is:

                              f (Y jX) = Ek [f (Y jX; k)] :

    De ne Yk(c) as the set of career outcomes pertinent to the individuals in-
volved in promotion chain number c of k. Because the structure of the political
hierarchy will change once a promotion chain is realized, i.e. the interim S will
change, positions within the hierarchy/level and factional a¢liations at all levels
Xk(c) need to be modi ed after each chain k(c) is realized.
    The conditional likelihood upon the realization of a set of promotion chains
k happening over time is given by:
  2 7 Plus a new entry at the lowest level, which we do not model, as per our discussion

of Proposition 3. The entry choice is not necessary for estimation and all parameters are
identi ed without its addition.

                                              c=1

    The likelihood contribution f (Yk(c) jXk(c) ; k) of a chain k(c) of promotions
initiated at ` 1 involves computing the promotion probabilities of all individuals
involved in k(c) at the various levels, down to L. A promotion from level ` to
level ` 1 to be paired to a politician K = R; B; N is a random event distributed
over a discrete support formed of M (`) points (individual politicians), B(`) of
which occurring with probability pK                                            K
                                      B (`), R(`) occurring with probability pR (`),
and N (`) occurring with probability pK   N (`). (We omit time indexes as they are
unnecessary here.)
    Given the independence of the promotion events across levels, the construc-
tion of this likelihood is straightforward. Let I ` be the faction of the individual
belonging to k(c) at level ` and J ` 1 be the faction of the individual with which
s/he is paired when promoted to level ` 1:

                                                         L
                                                         Y         l   1
                            f (Yk(c) jXk(c) ; k) =            pJI l       (l) :
                                                         l=`

Going back to the example above of a chain of politicians s0 ; s; s0 ;and s00 be-
longing to factions N , R, and B respectively, and assuming they all happen to
get paired with N -type politicians, the likelihood contribution of this chain is:

                    f (Yk(c) jXk(c) ; k) =   pN        N        N
                                                N (2)  pR (3)  pB (4)
                               `   1
where each probability pJI ` (`) is computed based on Xk(c) , ordered from the
top promotion to the level L promotion, as imposed by the sequential nature of
the promotions comprised in each chain.
    The Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL), for given number of simulated
sets of promotion chains RK ,28 is:

                                          RK Y C
                                        1 X
                       f (Y jX) =                 f (Ykr (c) jXkr (c) ; kr ):
                                       RK r=1 c=1

This is the estimator that we employ.

7      CCP Factional Politics: Structural Results
This section presents MSL estimates of the model and sample t assessments.
The sample includes all the members of the 14th-18th Central Committees in the
post-Deng era. The simulation procedure in Section 6 was rst implemented in
a series of Montecarlo simulations and successfully probed for: i) identi cation
of the structural parameters; ii) sensitivity to misspeci cation in the number of
factions; and iii) sensitivity to misspeci cation in the contest function we use29 .
    We begin our analysis with the most parametrically parsimonious model
possible, one where we normalize  = 1 and the two faction parameters f ; g
are estimated on top of a single leadership premium , de ned as  = l = =
l =. The MSL results for this model are reported in Column 1 of Table 9.
The estimated contest function parameters are 0:045 and 0:029 for CYLC and
Shanghai Gang respectively, which are close to the average share of seats in the
Central Committee. The estimated leadership premium  is 2:553, implying
that a faction candidate is more than twice as likely to be promoted when the
paramount leader is from the same faction. The magnitude of the leadership
premium is consistent with the reduced form evidence in Table 6. All parameters
driving the promotion process across factions are precisely estimated.
    Because it may seem restrictive to assume a common contest function across
all levels of the CCP top echelons (which include heterogeneous layers in both
size and jurisdiction, such as the top CCP positions and the PBSC, PB, CC,
AC), Column 2 in Table 9 allows for level-speci c parameters f k ; k gk=H;L for
the PB and higher versus CC and lower. The parameter estimates show that
faction a¢liation helps signi cantly more at higher levels than that at lower
levels within the CCP: the estimated contest function parameters reach 0:162
and 0:193 at the PB and higher for CYLC and Shanghai Gang relative to CC
and AC levels of 0:041 and 0:022.
    One may also wonder whether the leadership premium di¤ers across factions.
Column 3 explores this possibility by allowing for faction-speci c leadership
premia fR ; B g. The parameter estimates show that two factions have very
similar premia (both are between 2 and 3). The improvement of log-likelihood
is negligible, indicating that the two factions operate in a similar fashion. This
result is also consistent with the reduced-form evidence in Table 6.
    Column 4 in Table 9 combines both level-speci c parameters f k ; k gk=H;L
and faction-speci c leadership premia fR ; B g. We conduct Likelihood Ratio
 2 9 All   simulation results are available upon request.

(LR) tests for model 1, 2 and 3 against model 4 (numbering indicates the Column
of reference). LR tests reject model 1 and 3, which impose a constant contest
function across levels, against model 4, but do not reject model 2, which imposes
a constant leadership premium across factions. In the following analysis, we will
thus use the more parsimonious model 2 as our benchmark and refer to it as
the baseline faction model.
    Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the factions seat shares by level
as predicted by the model. The ve bars represent the ve levels of the Central
Committee (the top two CCP positions, PBSC, PB, CC, and AC). The blue,
white, and red parts represent the seat shares of the Shanghai Gang, Neutral,
and CYLC respectively. The left panel is the data, while the right are the pre-
dictions of our baseline faction model. Our baseline faction model successfully
replicates the distribution of factions across di¤erent levels of the hierarchy:
faction members are relatively scarce in the lower levels, but become increas-
ingly concentrated in the higher ones. This is related to the increasing contest
function parameters estimated above, which imply an increasing advantage of
factional a¢liation as one progresses up the hierarchy. Notice that our model
also captures the inertia of the factional composition of the various levels over
time evident in the data thanks to the slow percolation of factional members
up the hierarchy. The intuition is that promotions and retirements occur grad-
ually over time. It takes time for a faction leader to grow his inner circle from
the bottom of the hierarchy up. Interestingly, such dynamics can function as
checks and balances on an incoming paramount leader. When a new leader rst
assumes power, he is likely to be surrounded by members from rival factions.
There is also anecdotal evidence in line with this nding: Jiang himself once
described his rst few years as the General Secretary as standing on the brink
of a deep ravine, or walking on thin ice30 . Bo (2004) also suggests that the
Shanghai Gang continued to exert strong inuence in the rst term of Hu Jin-
tao. This nding will be particularly useful in understanding the upcoming (in
the Fall of 2017) second term of Xi, expected by many observers to gain greater
clout relative to his rst term in o¢ce.
    Our faction model also provides insights for the dynamics of power transi-
tion between factions. Figure 7 plots the aggregate share of promotions of each
faction over time31 . The share of promotions is de ned as the ratio between the
number of promotions for a faction and the total number of promotions. Again,
 3 0 See Kuhn (2005).
 31 A   more detailed breakdown by level of the Central Committee can be found in Table 11.



                                             32
the t of the model is good. Figure 7 points also to a more subtle implication
of our model: there are no discontinuous drops in the share of promotions of
the paramount leaders faction right after he retires. When Jiang Zemin retired
after the 15th Party Congress, a large share of the Shanghai Gang continued to
be promoted to the 16th Central Committee. The pattern was repeated at Hu
Jintaos transition to Xi Jinping at the 18th Party Congress. In reality there
is uncertainty over the precise point at which the inuence of the incoming
paramount leader eclipses that of the departing incumbent and this inuences
promotion rates. Scholars have suggested that Deng retained considerable in-
uence well after formal retirement in 1989; Jiang maintained informal and
formal military oversight after stepping down as General Secretary. A retiring
paramount leader may continue to shape the composition of the next Central
Committee. Such intricate dynamics are captured by our simulation approach
that draws di¤erent paramount leader transition dates across multiple simula-
tions, smoothing out sharp discontinuities around the o¢cial power transition
date.


7.1     Adding Individual Covariates
So far we have assumed that faction members are selected to challenge a post
randomly within a faction and level; modulo vetoes of course. We can easily
add individual characteristics, Z, to the within-faction selection process as well.
Consider each row of the matrix Zs to be a vector of characteristics for politician
s. De ne qI;s (`) as the probability that s of faction I is selected as the candidate
of this faction at level `, also de ne AI (`) as the set of the members of faction
I at level `. We assume a within-faction selection probability of the logistic
form32 :

                                               exp ( Zs )
                            qI;s (`)  P                          :
                                           s0 2AI (`) exp ( Zs0 )

   Therefore, the probability of winning promotion can be rewritten as qI;s (`)
W (I). Notice that our baseline faction model is nested in this formula by setting
coe¢cients of individual characteristics, , to 0. In this case we get back our
                                                            1
random within-faction selection probability, qI;s (`)  I(`)   . We refer to the
  3 2 Since our data only includes the top 5 levels of the party hierarchy (President/Premier,

PBSC, PB, CC, AC), individual characteristics of the potential candidates eligible for promo-
tion to AC are not always observable to us. As a result, we assume within-faction selection is
random below the AC level.



                                             33
above model as the faction model with individual characteristics.
    The parameter estimates are reported in the Column 2 of Table 10. Compar-
ing with the baseline faction model in Column 1, we see a reasonable improve-
ment in model t measured by log-likelihood. At the same time, however, we
observe little change in the estimates of the parameters for the contest function
and the leadership premium, suggesting that these parameters are indeed more
related to the technology of factions than to individual covariates omitted in
the baseline model. Examining the estimated coe¢cients of individual charac-
teristics, we nd that being a princeling or a male increases the probability of
promotion, while having a graduate degree or being an ethnic minority hurts.
The e¤ect of age is non-linear: it has a positive e¤ect at rst, but eventually
negatively a¤ects promotion chances, in line with previously observed hard age
limits enforced within the CCP.


7.2     Alternative Models
Given our main speci cations, we are equipped for both in-sample and out-
of-sample t analysis of our structural model. It is useful in this respect also
to present some alternative benchmarks to which we can compare our models
performance. First, we can use as the simplest alternative a model based on
random promotion. This is done by setting:

                                                 1
                                       p(`)          :
                                                M (`)

Second, we implement a pure seniority-based promotion mechanism, setting for
politician s:
                                      '(ages )
                             ps (`)           ;
                                       M (`)
with '(:) a (third order) polynomial in age33 .
    Figure 8 provides the scatter plots of model predicted shares of promotions
by Party Congress and by level of the CCP against the data34 . Our models
(baseline faction and faction with individual characteristics) handily outper-
form both the random and the seniority models: the predicted shares by the
faction models line up with the data nicely along the 45 degree line, whereas the
shares predicted by random and pure seniority-based promotion models appear
  3 3 For the seniority and random model, we calibrate the probability of entering AC using

the average share of each faction in the Central Committee.
  3 4 We combine level 1, 2 and 3 because there are two few observations in the rst two levels.




                                              34
completely at. This result is independent of which Party Congress we consider.
More concretely, with only ve structural parameters our baseline faction model
reduces the mean squared errors of the predicted shares of promotion by more
than 80 percent comparing to the random model, and more than 70 comparing
to the seniority model. The right panel of Table 10 conducts formal speci ca-
tion tests. The Vuong statistics reject the random and the pure seniority-based
promotion models against the faction model with individual characteristics35 .
    What about political meritocracy? Because the CCP promotion model is
by many referred to as a strictly meritocratic mechanism (Li and Zhou, 2005;
Bell, 2015) and there is substantial debate as to whether systematic assessment
of cadres based on economic performance plays a role in the CCP, we test
our model against this third purely meritocratic mechanism. First, in order
to nd a suitable measure of performance, we need to restrict our analysis of
promotions to provincial leaders in the Central Committee. We associate these
prominent provincial CCP cadres with the economic performance (in terms of
real GDP growth over their tenure) of their Province of service precisely as in
Li and Zhou (2005) and Jia et al. (2015) and use this as a (admittedly rough)
proxy for overall performance. Graphical evidence of the performance of our
model is reported in Figure 936 . In the appropriate subset of promotions (i.e.
those for which performance metrics are available), our model performs better
than the purely meritocratic model in terms of sum of mean squared errors,
which is reduced by 35 percent.
    We further examine the out-of-sample t of our model. Speci cally, we re-
estimate the model using only the 14th-17th Central Committees and predict
the shares of promotion of each faction at 18th Central Committee. We compare
the model predicted share of promotion with the actual data in the scatter plot
in Figure 10. Our faction model again outperforms random and seniority-based
models in terms of out-of-sample t. The reduction in mean squared errors is
77 percent and 69 percent comparing our baseline faction model to the random
model and seniority model respectively, reassuring us of its robustness.
   3 5 The pure seniority-based model outperforms the baseline faction model in terms of log-

likelihood. However, this is driven by the fact that only 10% of the politicians have fac-
tional a¢liation. After we include individual characteristics in the factional model, the pure
seniority-based model is easily rejected by the Vuong test.
   3 6 In this scatter plot, we do not break down the share of promotion by level because of the

small number of observations in the subset of provincial leaders.

8     Counterfactuals and Model Analysis
Within our econometric framework we can explore a set of counterfactual exer-
cises and present an additional quantitative analysis of several questions relevant
to the study of Chinese political economy.


8.1     Forgoing Collective Leadership
We begin by exploring an historical counterfactual on leadership premia in the
post-Deng era. Our model explicitly recognizes such premia, but a wealth of
anecdotal discussion in Chinese politics (and the empirical evidence of Section
4) suggests them to have been curtailed in the post-Deng era. This peculiarity
of the post-Deng Chinese system, the emergence of so-called collective lead-
ership, has been frequently recognized in the literature. It is often indicated
as the main structural break from the strongman political equilibria thought
to have prevailed under Mao Zedong37 and the paramount leadership of Deng
Xiaoping (Tsou, 1995; Fewsmith, 2001; Shambaugh, 2008). This exercise is
also useful in perspective of the current changes as scholars like Nathan (2016)
suggest President Xi may be overturning Dengs system, as he has taken
the chairmanship of the most important seven of the twenty-two leading small
groups that guide policy in speci c areas and tightened direct control over the
military.
    Here, we will ramp up the limited role played by leadership premia in fac-
tional representation in China and present a counterfactual of what would have
happened under heightened winner-take-all type factional competition. We run
the model with twice as high a leadership premium .
    Results are reported in Figure 11. A more detailed breakdown by level can
be found in the third panel of Table 11. The counterfactual is implemented
by simulating for each Congress T the share of promotion of each faction to
the following Congress T + 1. Under the Jiang Zemin (Shanghai Gang) pres-
idency, openings in the Politburo and the Central Committee are lled with
more of the top leaders cofactionals. Under the CYLC leadership of Hu Jintao,
numbers would have been comparable, swinging in the opposite direction with
more tuanpai members promoted. The magnitude of the increase in the shares
of promotions, however, is less than the increase in the leadership premium.
The dampening e¤ect emerges from the factional veto mechanism detailed in
  3 7 During the Maoist era, factions were ideologically as well as personally de ned, and

remained ercely loyal in what could become a winner-take-all game. Dittmer (2004, p.18)


                                            36
Proposition 1. As members of a faction become crowded at a certain level `,
new promotions from the same faction are more likely to be blocked by their
cofactionals out of their own career concerns. Indeed, as shown in Table 11,
the dampening e¤ect is stronger in higher levels of the hierarchy where faction
members are more concentrated (Figure 6). Therefore, individual incentives in
intra-faction competition surprisingly limit the ability of a paramount leader to
grow his own faction.


8.2    Li Keqiang Presidency
A second counterfactual we perform involves the choice of leadership rati ed by
the 2012 18th Party Congress. This is the event that brought Xi Jinping to the
PRC Presidency. Nathan and Gilley (2003) present compelling documentary
evidence that already ten years before the formal power transition Xi Jinping
and Li Keqiang belonged to a select few with potential accreditation to the
paramount post. Bo Xilai was also part of this highly selected group.
    It is possible for us to study a counterfactual Li presidency. Figure 12 reports
the aggregate share of promotion, and a more detailed breakdown by level can
be found in the fourth panel of Table 11. Interestingly, given the estimated
leadership premia, the promotion at PB level would have had a very limited
increase in CYLC representation (Lis faction). More radical shifts would have
been recorded in the promotion at the CC and AC though. Again this is a
result of the slow percolation of factional representation induced by our model,
compounded with the already high CYLC representation at the upper levels of
the CCP at the end of Hus last term in o¢ce.


8.3    Are Princelings a Faction?
The reader will notice that the analysis above posits factional a¢liation of pres-
ident Xi Jinping as a member of Shanghai Gang. This is in itself a matter
of debate among scholars interested in Chinese elite politics. For instance, Li
(2013) in his bi-factional representation of the Chinese top tiers de nes Xi as a
princeling associated with Jiangs camp (Shanghai Gang). In fact, Xi spent only
seven months in any o¢cial role in Shanghai, but Jiangs substantial inuence
on Xi has been noted by many. Other researchers have pointed to President Xi
as the leader of a new faction of his own, mostly with roots in Shaanxi, where
Xi was born, and in Zhejiang Province, where he served as Party Secretary from



                                        37
2002 to 200738 . Our model allows a formal statistical analysis of some of these
questions.
   We begin by investigating whether our postulate of the princelings not be-
having as a uni ed faction is warranted by the data. To assess this formally we
implement Vuong speci cation tests between our baseline model and one where
princeling status is coded as membership in faction P , with a speci c parameter
 regulating an expanded contest function of the type (1):

                                               
                                W (P ) =            :
                                             +++

    We also specify a faction-speci c leadership premium, p =  l =, which
regulates the di¤erential promotion probability when the paramount leader is
from the princelings (e.g. Xi in the 18th Party Congress).
    Results are reported in Table 12. The Vuong test indicates that the model
where princelings are considered to be neutrals is preferred over one where
princelings are treated as a separate faction. More importantly, the estimated
leadership premium within the model imposing princelings as a faction, p ,
is estimated to be less than 1. This means that, as princeling Xi reached the
paramount position, other princelings did not appear to enjoy a higher premium
in promotions. This nding prima facie violates one of the crucial features
of factional politics  delivering resources to members of the faction once the
faction leader is in power  and appears in stark contrast to what we have
already observed for the broadly accepted factions, CYLC and Shanghai Gang,
where we estimate  > 1. In brief, the evidence rejects the hypothesis that
princelings operate as a uni ed faction.


8.4     Is President Xi Jinping A¢liated to the Shanghai
        Gang?
Our structural approach allows also to produce formal tests for the analysis of
factional a¢liation of the top leadership. The case of Xi Jinping is emblematic
because of both his strong ties to the CCP elite through family connections and
  3 8 Some recurring a¢liated politicians include current PBSC member and anti-corruption

czar Wang Qishan, and potential PBSC future members such as Li Zhanshu, director of
the CC General O¢ce, and Politburo member Zhao Leji. Shih (2016) estimates, based on
shared career experience, that less than 6 percent of current CC members have past ties with
President Xi. This should however not be confused with a truly factional organization of the
Presidents inner circle for which hard evidence is not available.

his repeated rejection of intra-party factional politics (e.g. cabals and cliques
mentioned in o¢cial transcripts on Peoples Daily, May 3rd, 201639 ).
    To this goal, we re-estimate the model assuming that Xi is an una¢liated
neutral, and compare the alternative model against our baseline speci cation
where Xi is a Shanghai Gang member. The Vuong test shows that Xi is slightly
more likely to be a Shanghai Gang member, although the statistical evidence
is inconclusive. Our tests do not have enough power in this speci c instance.
Fortunately, such ambiguity is likely to be resolved after the 2017 19th Party
Congress, which will unveil a wealth of data on new promotions within the CCP.


8.5         An Out-of-sample Forecast for the 2017 19th Party
            Congress
To conclude our quantitative exercises we employ our model to forecast the 19th
Party Congress in 2017. Although admittedly speculative, to the best of our
knowledge this is probably one of the very few rigorous quantitative environ-
ments allowing for exercises of this kind. The model incorporates individual
characteristics in this analysis to obtain more accurate forecasts40 .
     The top panel of Table 13 shows that share of promotions by level of the
Central Committee. Under the assumption that Xi is in fact a Shanghai Gang
member, the Shanghai faction is expected to enjoy a higher share of promotions
in the Politburo than the CYLC faction due to leadership premia. In contrast,
promotions at lower levels are expected to be more comparable between the
two factions due to the dampening e¤ects stemming from vetoes. Since there is
still unresolved ambiguity regarding Xis factional a¢liation, we also conduct a
forecast assuming Xi is a neutral in the bottom panel of Table 13. In this case,
the Shanghai Gang would appear to lose its advantage in promotion for all the
levels of the Central Committee.

Chinese Communist Party. The CCP, much like historical Leninist parties in
Socialist countries, represents the linchpin of national politics and understanding
its inner workings is central to any political economic analysis of the PRC.
    We present a model of internal organization of this single-party regime, where
explicit factional dynamics within the party enrich a problem of career concerns
of political cadres. The model o¤ers a series of novel insights on the role of
factions in these regimes in a fully microfounded setting. Alternative modeling
choices are also discussed.
    The model is validated empirically employing a rich data set on the career
pro les of top CCP members. In reduced form, a set of previously unexplored
systematic empirical regularities in Chinese elite politics are probed and dis-
cussed. The extent of the 2012-2016 anti-corruption purge in shaping Chinese
factional politics is also analyzed. In our structural estimation, we explore im-
portant counterfactuals pertinent to the Chinese historical case and use the
model to answer a series of questions relevant to the political economy of the
CCP. We hope that this framework may also prove useful to the understanding
of the latent institutional shifts occurring within the CCP under Xi.
    In future research we hope to extend our analysis to the 2017 19th Party
Congress. This will allow precision on all dimensions concerning the Xi Presi-
dency. Besides our application to Chinese politics, we plan to focus on similarly
complex nondemocratic environments the example of Russia comes to mind
where our model of hierarchical party organization may be to a certain extent
transposable.

10     Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1. Part (i). Suppose that, I(`) > 0; where I 6= J, and
N (`) > 0. Consider the decision by a faction-J politician in a node at ` of
whether to veto a cofactionals support for promotion to his node. With the
promotion of a same-faction member from J to the politicians node, let J  (`)
denote the total number of faction J members that would be present at level
`. Then, using equation (3) and (4), the promotion hazard parameter for this
J politician at level ` (if the other faction K also vetoes co-faction members) if
he does not veto becomes:
                                                                          
                 j              ( +  I (` 1))            ( +  N (` 1))
      J (`) =        I(` 1)                   + N (` 1)                    ;
              J (`)                  j+                      j+i+

with j = and i =  or viceversa. If instead, the politician vetoes his cofac-
tional, and a member of the other faction (or a neutral) ascends to his node, his
promotion hazard becomes:
                                                                                  
                j                    ( +  I (` 1))             ( +  N (` 1))
    J (`) =               I(`   1)                 + N (`   1)                       ;
            J (`)   1                     j+                       j+i+

which is strictly greater.
   If the other faction does not veto its members the respective expressions
become:
                                                                       
                 j            ( +  I (` 1))           ( +  N (` 1))
       J (`) =       I(` 1)                 + N (` 1)
               J (`)             j+i+                     j+i+

and

                                                                                  
                j                    ( +  I (` 1))             ( +  N (` 1))
    J (`) =               I(`   1)                 + N (`   1)                       :
            J (`)   1                   j+i+                       j+i+

And the latter hazard is clearly higher again. This proves part a).

   Part (ii). Suppose that, I(`) = 0; and N (`) > 0: Suppose further that, with
the promotion of a co-faction member to Js node there will be J  (`) members
of Js faction at level `; then the hazard parameter for promotion of this J

politician is:
                                                                                              
               j                       ( +  I (` 1))                       ( +  N (` 1))
     J (`) =               I(`    1)                 + N (`             1)                       :   (7)
             J (`)                          j+                                   j+

If an N member instead ascends to his node, then the J members promotion
hazard is:
                                                                       
                 j            ( +  I (` 1))           ( +  N (` 1))
     J (`) =         I(` 1)                 + N (` 1)                   ;
             J (`) 1               j+                       j+

which exceeds (7), so he is clearly better o¤ vetoing his own faction member.
    However, if an I 6= J; N ascends to his node, then the J members promotion
hazard becomes:41
                                                                          
              j                ( +  I (` 1))             ( +  N (` 1))
  J (`) =            I(` 1)                  + N (` 1)                     : (8)
          J (`) 1                   j+                       i+j+

Since this I will contest ` 1 level openings (the second expression above),
this lowers the chances of the J begin promoted to one of those. Assuming
I factionals also veto, an I ascending to Js node lowers the chances of a J
promotion the most if N (` 1) = M (` 1). So a su¢cient condition for J
to exercise a veto assumes all higher positions are lled by members that are
neutral, N . Under this assumption expression (8) becomes:
                                                                                     
                                         j                          ( +  N (` 1))
                        J (`) =                     M (`      1)                         ;
                                   J  (`)   1                         i+j+

and expression (7) becomes:
                                                                                 
                                    j                           ( +  N (` 1))
                          J (`) =              M (`        1)                       :
                                  J (`)                              j+

So J will veto a J coming from level ` + 1 provided that:
                                                                                          

Consider further that, di¤erently from (4) where pR N (`) = =(IB +  + IR ),

veto any R possibly competing against N . For a similar reason, it holds that
pB

    Proof of Proposition 3. We rst demonstrate that, if the system is station-
ary, so that VIt (`) = VI (`) and  tI (`) =  I (`) 8I; `, then  I (`) >  J (`) implies
VI (`) > VJ (`): So, (6) is solved by the I such that  I (`) is sup f B (`) ;  R (`) ;  N (`)g :
    The stationary analog of equation (5) where VIt (`) = VI (`) and  tI (`) =  I (`)
8I; ` is:
                      VI (`) = u(`) +  I (`) [VI (` 1) VI (`)] ;

    Since ow payo¤s are higher the higher the politician is in the hierarchy, i.e.
u(` 1) > u(`) 8`, then necessarily increasing the rate of promotion improves
                 I (`)
valuations, dVd I (`) > 0 8`. This implies that  I (`) >  J (`) ensures VI (`) >
VJ (`).
    The proof proceeds next by establishing su¢cient conditions for three parts.
(i) The existence of neutrals given factions exist; (ii). The existence of a single
faction given neutrals exist; (iii) The existence of a second faction, given neutrals
and a rst faction already exist.
    In each part, a su¢cient condition is provided for  I (`) >  J6=I (`) and
 K6=I (`) at a single level, `. The su¢cient condition established in each case
is thus required to hold at all ` in order to ensure that an entering politician
prefers entry as a type I.
    Part (i). We establish a su¢cient condition for there to be neutrals. Suppose,
on the contrary, that there exist no N members. Necessarily, due to Proposition
1, without N s, all nodes will be lled by both a B and an R: Thus, under the
supposition, the hierarchy remains stationary, so that, from the result above, it
is su¢cient to compute only the stationary  I (`) for each ` to determine the
optimal I.
    Assume, without loss of generality, that the paramount leadership position
is held by a B. Consider level ` in the hierarchy. Necessarily the promotion

Due to optimal vetoes at each node, it must be that R(` 1) = B(` 1) =
M (` 1)=2 and IB = IR = 1. The relationship between  R (` 1) and  B (` 1)
is ambiguous. So consider both cases separately. First, assume that  R (` 1) 
 B (` 1), which will imply, due to the symmetry of the posited hierarchy, that
 R (`)   B (`) too. Then, substituting for IB ; IR , R(` 1) and B(` 1) yields:

Since  R (`       1)   B (`   1) then:

Now consider  B (`):

Then  N (`) >  B (`) if:

which rearranges to:

By supposition  R (`)   B (`), so this condition, which clearly holds for M (`)
large enough at all `, is su¢cient for neutrals to be the preferred entering type,
thus contradicting the maintained assumption that neutrals are not in the hi-

erarchy. Assuming, alternatively, that               , instead of using the inequality in
(9) we now have:
                                                                            

                                                                       +

which, by following the same procedure as above, yields the analog to (10) as a
su¢cient condition for  N (`) >  B (`), namely:

                                              1
                                            >       :                                      (11)
                                        +   M (`)

This again holds for su¢ciently high M (`), and again, since it continues to be
the case that  R (` 1)   B (` 1), this implies that entering politicians will
choose to be neutral.
   Now suppose the alternative relationship between  R (` 1) and  B (` 1),
that is:  R (` 1) >  B (` 1), and again rst posit that l > . Then let us use
these two inequalities and substitute for IB ; IR , R(` 1) and B(` 1) exactly
as we did above. Equation (9) now yields:
                                                                                           

Now  R (`) is given by:
                                                             

                  R (`) =        M (` 1)=2 
                          M (`)                       

                        =       (M (` 1)  ( +  B (` 1))) :
                          M (`)

Then  N (`) >  R (`) if:
                                               

                                           +           M (`)




                                              51
A su¢cient condition for this is:

                                                      1
                                             l
                                                    >       :
                                                 +   M (`)

This again holds for M (`) high enough. Since  R (`) >  B (`), This implies also
that  N (`) >  B (`). The analogous procedure under the alternative assumption
 l
     yields a su¢cient condition exactly as in (11):

                                                  1
                                                >       :
                                            +   M (`)

    Part (ii). We now establish a su¢cient condition for there to exist at least a
single faction. Suppose that all positions in the hierarchy are held by a neutral.
Consider an entrant choosing to also be a neutral. In that case under the
supposition, the system is again stationary and we have:

                                           N (` 1)
                                N (`) =           ( +  N (`         1)) :
                                            M (`)

But by entering as a B member the entrant would have:
                                                                            
                                                              +  N (` 1)
                            B (`) = N (`           1)                           :
                                                                    +

These rearrange to imply that  B (`) >  N (`) provided that M (`) > + . The
analogous su¢cient condition for an R entrant is M (`) > +       . This establishes
this part.
    Part (iii). We establish a su¢cient condition for two factions to exist. We
proceed as above, by demonstrating a contradiction. If there is only one faction
present, without loss of generality let it be B, and the other politicians are N ,
for su¢ciently high M (`);  R (`) >  B (`) or  N (`); so that an entering politician
will choose to enter as an R.
    As previously, with only N and B in the hierarchy we have:

a B, or the converse, in which case he would choose to enter as a B over an

single entering R:
                                                                             
                              ( +  B (` 1))               ( +  N (` 1))
       R (`) =  B(`    1)                   + N (`   1)                         :

If  N (`) >  B (`) for an increase in M (`), then necessarily the term M (`) B(`)
increases with M (`), since an extra politician would enter as an N instead of a B.
But since  R (`) above is independent of M (`), there exists an M (`) su¢ciently
high so that  R (`) >  N (`), and an entering politician would instead choose to
be an R over being an N , contradicting the posited non-existence of R members
in equilibrium.
     Alternatively, suppose that  N (`)   B (`), then, for an increase in M (`)
necessarily the term M (`) N (`) increases with M (`), as a politician would
choose to enter as a B over being an N . Now consider the promotion hazard
for a B:                                                            
                                                     ( +  N (` 1))
                  B (`) =                 N (` 1)                     :

Again, since  R (`) is independent of M (`), there exists an M (`) high enough so
that  R (`) >  B (`), which implies that a new entrant will choose to enter as an
R member, again contradicting the posited non-existence of R members. 

             Figure 1: Geographic Distribution of Factions or Groups (1956-2014)

Notes: This graph shows the geographic distribution of factions or groups across provinces
(municipalities) over the period of 1956 to 2014. The color scale represents the average share of
faction or group in a province (municipality).
         Figure 2: Leadership Premium in Promotion Rates of Each Faction or Group

Notes: This graph shows the leadership premium in promotion rates of each faction over the rest
of members in the Central Committee over time. The leadership premium in promotion rates is
defined as the regression coefficients of promotion dummy on faction or group affiliation. The
regression is repeated for each session of Central Committee. The capped spikes indicate the
standard errors of the estimates. The shaded area indicates that the General Secretary of CCP
is from the same faction or group.
           Figure 3: Leadership Premium in Power Score of Each Faction or Group

Notes: This graph shows the share of power score of each faction or group in the Central
Committee over time. The power score is constructed following the scheme of Bo (2010). The
shaded area indicates that the General Secretary of CCP is from the same faction or group.
           Figure 4: Power Score of Each Faction or Group in the Central Committee

Notes: This graph shows the share of power score of each faction or group in the Central
Committee over time. The power score is constructed following the scheme of Bo (2010). The
vertical line indicates the year of 1990, the first time when a civilian, Jiang Zemin, took over the
Central Military Committee. The power score is normalized to zero in 1990. The upper panel
shows the whole sample period from 1956 to 2012, the lower panel shows the post-Deng period
from 1990 to 2012.
             Figure 5: Power Score of Each Constituency in the Central Committee

Notes: This graph shows the share of power score for each constituency in the Central
Committee over time. The power score is constructed following the scheme of Bo (2010). The
vertical line indicates the year of 1990, the first time when a civilian, Jiang Zemin, took over the
Central Military Committee. The power score is normalized to zero in 1990. The upper panel
shows the whole sample period from 1956 to 2012, the lower panel shows the post-Deng period
from 1990 to 2012.
                Figure 6: Seat Shares at Each Level of the Central Committee

Notes: This graph shows seat shares at each level of the Central Committee predicted by the
baseline faction model and in the data. Each of the five bars represents the top two CCP
positions, PBSC, PB, CC, and AC, from the top down, respectively. The blue/white/red bar
represents the Shanghai Gang/Neutral/CYCL. The model is estimated using the 14th to 18th
Central Committees and the results are averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.
                     Figure 7: Aggregate Share of Promotions over Time

Notes: This graph shows the time series plot of the share of promotions of each faction over
time. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of promotions of a
faction and the total number of promotions to this level. The share of promotions is predicted
by the baseline faction model estimated using the 14th to 18th Central Committees and the
results are averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.
                               Figure 8: Model Fit (In Sample)

Notes: This graph shows the scatter plot of the model predicted share of promotions of each
faction against the data. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of
promotions of a faction and the total number of promotions to this level. The blue/red dot
represents Shanghai Gang/CYLC. Each dot is a share of a faction at a given level of a given
Party Congress. The estimation sample includes the 14th to 18th Central Committees and the
results are averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.
                              Figure 9: Meritocracy (In Sample)

Notes: This graph shows the scatter plot of the model predicted share of promotions of each
faction against the data. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of
promotions of a faction and the total number of promotions. The blue/red dot represents
Shanghai Gang/CYLC. Each dot is a share of a faction at a given level of a given Party
Congress. The estimation sample includes the 14th to 18th Central Committees and the results
are averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.
                            Figure 10: Model Fit (Out of Sample)

Notes: This graph shows the scatter plot of the model predicted share of promotions of each
faction against the data. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of
promotions of a faction and the total number of promotions to this level. The blue/red dot
represents Shanghai Gang/CYLC. Each dot is a share of a faction at a given level of the 18th
party congress. The estimation sample includes the 14th to 17th Central Committees and the
results are averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.
Figure 11: Counterfactual Aggregate Share of Promotions over Time (Leadership Premium × 2)

Notes: These graphs show the time series plot of the share of promotions of each faction over
time. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of promotions of a
faction and the total number of promotions to this level. The counterfactual simulations are
conducted by doubling the leadership premium of the baseline faction model and the results are
averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.
 Figure 12: Counterfactual Aggregate Share of Promotions over Time (Li Keqiang Presidency)

Notes: These graphs show the time series plot of the share of promotions of each faction over
time. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of promotions of a
faction and the total number of promotions to this level. The counterfactual simulations are
conducted by assuming Li Keqiang became the president in the 18th Party Congress and the
results are averaged over 100 simulations for each Party Congress.

Notes: This table shows the cross-section regressions of the share of each faction in provinces
(municipalities) on the average provincial (municipal) GDP per capita over the period of 1956-
2014. The share of a faction in a province is defined as the ratio of the number of faction
members who have worked in this province (municipality) over the total number of central
committee members who have worked in the same place during their careers. Robust standard
errors are reported in the bracket. ***,**,* indicates 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent
significance level respectively.

Notes: This table shows panel regressions of promotion and retirement indicators on the faction
or group affiliation of Central Committee members interacting with the affiliation of the General
Secretary. The sample includes all the members of the 8th to 18th Central Committees, except
Politburo Standing Committee members are excluded from the promotion regressions.
Promotion is a dummy which equals to 1 if a Central Committee member moves up in the rank
defined by the four levels of Central Committee (1 PBSC, 2 PB, 3 CC, and 4 AC), 0 otherwise.
Retirement is a dummy which equals to 1 if a Central Committee member retires from the
Central Committee, 0 otherwise. Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. ***,**,*
indicates 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent significance level respectively.

Notes: This table shows regressions of the power scores and seat shares of each faction or group on the affiliation of the General
Secretary. The dependent variables are the power score (Score), the share of Alternative Central Committee members (AC), the
share of full Central Committee members (CC), the share of Politburo members (PB), and the share of Politburo Standing
Committee members (PBSC). The independent variable Secretary is a dummy which equals to 1 if the General Secretary is from the
same faction, 0 otherwise. The top left panel (column 1-5) reports the results for the CYLC faction. The top right panel (column 6-10)
reports the results for the Shanghai faction. The bottom left panel (column 1-5) reports the results for the Military group, the bottom
right panel (column 6-10) reports the results for the Princeling group. The sample period is from 1956 to 2014. Newey-West standard
errors with 5 lags are reported in brackets. ***,**,* indicates 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent significance level respectively.

Notes: This table shows the parameter estimates of four alternative models of CCP promotion
dynamics. The sample includes all the members of the 14th to 18th Central Committees. The
probability of entry for seniority and random model is calibrated using the mean faction shares
in the sample. Standard errors are reported in brackets. ***,**,* indicates 1 percent, 5 percent,
and 10 percent significance level respectively. The estimator employs 100 simulations for each
Party Congress. The bottom panel shows log-likelihood, log-likelihood ratio, p-value of the log-
likelihood ratio tests, Vuong test statistics, and the p-value of the Vuong tests for each model
against the model “faction with individual characteristics” column as the alternative hypothesis.

 Notes: This table shows the share of promotions of each faction by level of the Central Committee in the data and predicted by the
 different models. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of promotions of a faction and the total number
 of promotions to this level. The sample includes all the members of the 14th to 18th Central Committees. The first panel shows the
 share of promotions of each faction in the data. The second panel shows the prediction by the baseline faction model. The third panel
 shows the counterfactual prediction in which the leadership premium is doubled comparing to the baseline faction model. The last
 panel shows the counterfactual prediction in which Li Keqiang becomes President in the 18th Party Congress.

Notes: This table shows the aggregate share of promotions of each faction at each level of the
Central Committee in the 19th Central Committee predicted by the faction model with
individual characteristics. The share of promotions is defined as the ratio between the number of
promotions of a faction and the total number of promotions to this level. The sample used to
estimate the parameters includes all the members of the 14th to 18th Central Committees. The
forecast employs 100 simulations for this Party Congress.

Notes: This table shows the panel regression of promotions and retirement dummy on the
faction affiliation of Central Committee members. The sample includes all members of the 8 th to
18th Central Committees, except Politburo Standing Committee members are excluded from the
promotion regression. Promotion is a dummy which equals to 1 if a Central Committee member
moves up in the rank defined by the four levels of Central Committee (1 PBSC, 2 PB, 3 CC,
