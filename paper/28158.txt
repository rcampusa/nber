                                          ABSTRACT

Concerned about the low academic ability of public school teachers, in the 1990s and 2000s,
some states increased licensing stringency to weed out low-quality candidates, while others
decreased restrictions to attract high-quality candidates. We offer a theoretical model justifying
both reactions. Using data from 1991­2007 on licensing requirements and teacher quality--as
measured by the selectivity of teachers' undergraduate institutions--we find that stricter licensing
requirements, especially those emphasizing academic coursework, increase the left tail of the
quality distribution for secondary school teachers without significantly decreasing quality for
high-minority or high-poverty districts.

1        Introduction

In 1983, an influential report from the Department of Education, titled "A Nation at Risk," critiqued the U.S.
educational system and student outcomes on a number of dimensions. One of the points of the report was that
"too many teachers are being drawn from the bottom quarter of graduating high school and college students"
(Gardner 1983). A number of academic studies reported similar findings--that public school teachers do
not come from the upper tail of the academic-ability distribution.1 These findings sparked a wave of reforms
to state-level licensing laws over the next several decades intended to improve teacher quality (Hanushek
and Rivkin 2006). However, the question of how to improve teacher quality led to heated debates among
researchers during the 1990s and 2000s, with some researchers (e.g., Darling-Hammond 1997) arguing
that increased stringency would improve quality and others (e.g., Ballou and Podgursky 1998) arguing the
opposite.2 This disagreement further led to a wide array of policy responses--even opposite responses--by
different states. Some states raised teacher licensing requirements in an attempt to increase the lower tail of
teacher qualifications--hoping to weed out low-quality candidates--while at the same time others decreased
requirements (and thus decreased the cost of licensure) in an attempt to attract high-quality candidates who
might otherwise have chosen a different profession.
        In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework demonstrating that both camps' reactions have
some rational grounding: when licensing stringency changes, the marginal teachers come from the left tail
and right tail of the quality distribution, not just one or the other. Increased stringency can increase the left
tail and simultaneously decrease the right tail of the teacher quality distribution. We then use state-by-year
variation in the difficulty of obtaining a teaching certification to empirically quantify the effects of licensing
stringency on the distribution of teacher quality within each state and year.3
        Our focus--both in the theoretical and empirical analysis--is on how teacher licensing stringency affects
the selection of high-academic-ability vs. low-academic-ability teachers into the profession, as this has
been a concern for education policymakers and a motivation behind many licensing changes. As such,
    1
      Although the accuracy of the original "bottom quarter" statement is debated (Nelson 1985; Hanushek and Pace 1995), a number
of studies point to the negative relationship between academic ability and the likelihood of entering teaching (Hanushek and Pace
1995; Bacolod 2007; Hoxby and Leigh 2004; Cochran-Smith and Fries 2005; Goldhaber and Walch 2013). A 2013 op-ed in the
New York Times highlights this point: "In the nations that lead the international rankings--Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Finland,
Canada--teachers are drawn from the top third of college graduates, rather than the bottom 60 percent as is in the case in the United
States." (Mehta 2013).
    2
      This debate has continued in recent years (e.g., Mehta 2013; Ellison and Fensterwald 2015; Ben-Shahar 2017) and is especially
relevant today: in response to COVID-19-induced teacher shortages--from teachers retiring due to safety concerns or distance
learning workloads--many states are choosing to lower teacher licensing requirements (Smith 2020).
    3
      In the context of requirements to become a public school teacher, the terms license and certification are used interchangeably
to refer to state-mandated requirements (see, for example, https://learn.org/articles/What is a Teaching Certificate.html), and we
follow that convention here. In contrast, in the broader occupational licensing literature (e.g., Kleiner 2006), the term license is
reserved for legal restrictions and certification refers to optional professional qualifications. Such optional certification is also
available for teachers from organizations such as the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Our focus in this paper
is solely on state-mandated licensure requirements.


                                                                 1
the dimension of a teacher's quality that we focus on is a measure of the teacher's academic ability and
earnings potential: the selectivity of a teacher's undergraduate institution, as measured by the average SAT
scores of entering freshmen at the institution. This measure of college selectivity has been shown to be
highly correlated with earnings for non-teachers, which is precisely the dimension of quality captured in our
model.4
       To quantify licensing stringency, we manually collect detailed historical data for 37 distinct dimensions
of state-level teacher certification requirements for all years available between 1991­2007.5 We conduct a
principal factor analysis to reduce these measures to a single-dimensional stringency score. The dimensions
that are weighted heavily in this stringency index are academic course requirements, such as requirements
in math, English, social studies, humanities, and science. These types of requirements have been central in
teacher licensing debates: many professional education programs have historically opposed them (Ravitch
2003). We estimate the effects of changes in this licensing stringency metric on the average, 10th percentile,
and 90th percentile of the teacher quality distribution within each state and year.
       Examining each prediction from our theoretical framework, we find that a one-standard-deviation in-
crease in our licensing stringency index is associated with a statistically significant 0.14 standard deviation
increase in teacher quality at the 10th percentile of the secondary school teacher quality distribution within a
state-by-year cell, accompanied by a positive but insignificant effect at the mean and a negative but insignif-
icant effect at the 90th percentile. Our results indicate that teacher certification may be effective at weeding
out less-qualified candidates from the profession.
       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. We model
a worker's quality as the wage offer she will receive if she chooses not to be a teacher. Workers are hetero-
geneous in this wage offer as well as in the cost of obtaining a teaching license. This cost decreases with
teacher quality and increases with licensing stringency. The model predicts that increased stringency can
increase the left tail and (simultaneously) decrease the right tail of the teacher quality distribution, possibly
with zero effect on the mean. Moreover, if increased stringency drives away highly qualified candidates, vul-
nerable school districts--such as high-minority or high-poverty districts--may be harder hit. Importantly,
our model provides possibility results. It allows for the possibility that changes in licensing stringency have
no left-tail or right-tail effect or no differential effect for different districts. This feature highlights that our
research question--how licensing affects the teacher quality distribution--is an empirical question.
   4
      See Dale and Krueger (2002) and references cited therein. We also demonstrate this relationship between average SAT of
entering freshmen and expected earnings at the institution level in Appendix Figure A6, panel A. Dale and Krueger (2002) highlight
that this correlation is clearly not causal, as students of high unobserved academic ability select into more selective colleges. Such
a metric--one that is strongly correlated with a teacher's unobserved academic ability and earnings potential--is specifically what
we want to study herein.
    5
      One contribution of our study, in addition to the findings, is the creation of this dataset, which we have made publicly available
on our websites.


                                                                   2
    Section 3 describes our data sources. Our data on teachers come from a survey of 26,280 teachers in
Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. We also describe
the construction of our licensing stringency metric, which varies widely across time for some states, and
for others, it remains relatively constant. Identifying power for our empirical analysis comes from this
variation over time within states. In Section 4, we discuss the sources of this variation. We argue that this
variation is plausibly unrelated to other unobservable factors affecting the distribution of teacher quality,
driven primarily by differences across states and time in policymakers' views of how best to tackle teacher-
quality concerns, in particular because, during this time period, researchers as well as policymakers arrived
at very different conclusions as to how to best address the same problem. This variation across states and
across years essentially leads to a number of natural experiments that we exploit in this paper.
    In Section 5 we present the main results. In contrast to most previous studies of occupational licensing
(for teachers or other occupations), our data includes variation in stringency within states over time, allowing
us to control for state and year effects in two-way fixed effects regressions. We find robust positive effects
on the left tail of the quality distribution. The effects are driven by secondary-school teachers, with no
detectable impact on the quality distribution of elementary school teachers.
    As highlighted above, we rely on the assumption that, within a given state, changes in licensing strin-
gency are exogenous. It is not possible to rule out all potential violations of this assumption, but we provide a
number of empirical tests that reveal several robust findings. These tests include controlling for state-specific
trends or controlling for changes over time in other educational policies, local labor markets, political and
teacher union environments, and student and school characteristics. In all specifications, we consistently
find a positive and significant effect of licensing stringency on the left tail of the teacher quality distribution
for secondary school teachers. The results are not driven by any single state; the effects are similar with any
state removed from the analysis.
    Our main results exploit cases where states increase stringency or decrease stringency (and, in some
cases, states who do both at different times). In Section 5.3, we analyze separately these increases vs.
decreases. Again, we find a robust effect on the left tail: increasing stringency raises the left tail and
decreasing stringency lowers it. Among states that increase stringency, we also detect a significant positive
effect on average quality, but the magnitude is smaller than the left-tail effect. We then use these samples
in an event study design with staggered adoption proposed recently by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille
(2020). We find no significant pre-trends and a significant effect of these policy changes on the average and
the left tail in some periods after the policy.
    Motivated by the possibility of disparate impacts (e.g., Boyd et al. 2007), we ask whether high-poverty
and high-minority districts show evidence of losing more high-quality teachers in response to increased


                                                        3
licensing stringency. We define these vulnerable school districts as those with a high share of minority stu-
dents or a high share of low-income students (who qualify for free lunch). Such districts may struggle to
attract teachers, both on salary and non-salary dimensions (e.g., Prince 2003). We do not find strong evi-
dence of disparate effects: while our confidence intervals do not rule out the possibility that high-minority
or high-poverty districts are negatively affected by increased stringency, the effects are statistically indistin-
guishable from zero. We also find that increased licensing stringency does not negatively affect the diversity
of teacher supply: the fractions of black, Hispanic, Asian, or non-white teachers do not decrease.
       Our primary results focus on licensing stringency as measured by academic coursework requirements.
We demonstrate that other dimensions of licensing requirements, such as teacher testing, pedagogy require-
ments, other training requirements, or background checks, are not strongly correlated with our primary
measure of stringency, and factors that do capture these other licensing dimensions do not have robust and
significant effects on the teacher quality distribution. Our results suggest that, if weeding out less aca-
demically qualified candidates from the teaching profession is the desired policy outcome, stricter academic
coursework requirements are an effective instrument.
       Our work is related to the empirical literature studying teacher certification. Berger and Toma (1994)
find that a state-level requirement that a teacher have a master's degree is correlated with lower student test
scores. Goldhaber and Brewer (2000) find that certification exams and field experience requirements have
no significant correlation with average student test scores. Hanushek and Pace (1995) show that requiring
a certification exam reduces the likelihood that a college student becomes a teacher.6 These studies rely on
cross-state variation in licensing requirements. To our knowledge, the only studies to exploit panel variation
in licensing requirements are Angrist and Guryan (2004, 2008). The authors focus on two specific licensing
requirements--basic skills exams and subject matter exams--and exploit variation in these two requirements
in four years (1987, 1990, 1993, and 1999). The authors find no significant effect of these certification test
requirements on the average of the quality distribution (where, as in our study, quality is a teacher's college
selectivity). While we focus on a larger panel (17 years) and a broader set of teacher requirements (37 rather
than two), our results are consistent with Angrist and Guryan (2004, 2008) in that we do not find strong
effects on average quality in our main specification.
       A key contribution of our study is an analysis of the tails of the teacher quality distribution. The debate
   6
     A separate issue that we do not analyze in this paper is that of alternative certification. The term originally derived from a goal
to allow high-quality workers from non-education backgrounds (such as those changing careers) to become teachers without having
to complete the full set of requirements for an education degree. Critics argue that, in practice, alternative certification requirements
have evolved to be similar to traditional education school requirements, packaged under a different name (Walsh and Jacobs 2007).
Several studies (e.g., Ballou and Podgursky 2000; Rockoff et al. 2008; Kane et al. 2008; Boyd et al. 2006; Sass 2015) compare
student outcomes and teacher qualifications among teachers holding a standard certification vs. an alternative certification. In a
recent handbook chapter, Goldhaber (2011) argues that, relative to these studies, "far less evidence exists on the impact of licensure
on the pool of potential teachers." Our paper relates to this latter question.



                                                                   4
about how to improve teacher quality has largely revolved around these tails: stricter licensing requirements
are targeted to eliminate the worst-qualified candidates from becoming teachers--moving the left tail of
the quality distribution. And the primary argument against stricter teacher licensing requirements is that
they drive away high-quality candidates--moving the right tail.7 In this paper, we argue that, in addition to
studying effects on average quality, it is informative to study whether licensing stringency has any detectable
effects on other features of the quality distribution, the tails in particular. One study that offers a theoretical
model in which increased licensing stringency can decrease the right tail of teacher quality, is Wiswall
(2007).8 We are not aware of previous work examining the effect of teacher licensing stringency on the left
tail.
        Our paper contributes more broadly to the literature studying teacher quality (e.g., Hanushek 2002;
Hanushek and Rivkin 2006). This literature has been particularly concerned about the low ex-ante quality
(prior to becoming a teacher) of those who select into a teaching career, as measured by teachers' college
selectivity or other measures of academic ability. The literature has also documented how and why the ex-
ante quality of teachers has been declining over time. This literature includes, for example, Nelson (1985),
Hanushek and Pace (1995), Figlio (1997), Bacolod (2007), Hoxby and Leigh (2004), Cochran-Smith and
Fries (2005), Goldhaber and Walch (2013), Jones and Hartney (2017), and Kraft et al. (2020). Ex-post
measures of teacher quality, such as student test scores, have been shown in recent studies to be positively
related to measures of teachers' academic ability (Dobbie 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Goldhaber et al. 2017;
Hanushek et al. 2019), although existing work also demonstrates that this relationship does not always hold
(Harris and Sass 2011; Kane et al. 2008).9 Our results do not speak to this relationship but instead focus
directly on the selection of new teachers from the ex-ante quality distribution. This focus allows us to study
effects for all states, whereas other measures of quality, such as teacher value-added estimates, are typically
only available in the context of a single state or district.
        In work contemporaneous to ours, Kraft et al. (2020) use panel variation in policies adopted from 2011­
2016 regulating the evaluation of new teachers after they begin teaching. The authors document a related
finding to our results: high-stakes evaluation requirements for existing teachers raise the lower tail of the
distribution of quality (as measured by college selectivity) among new teachers. Bruhn et al. (2020) study
the teacher value-added distribution within Massachusetts and find that higher-performing teachers who
   7
      Hanushek (2002) states, "Teacher certification requirements are generally promoted as ensuring that there is a floor on quality,
but if they end up keeping out high-quality teachers who do not want to take the specific required courses, such requirements act
more like a ceiling on quality." Ballou and Podgursky (1998) also argue this point strongly.
    8
      Wiswall (2007) estimates this model using longitudinal survey data and finds that eliminating licensing costs would result in a
2.2 percent increase in average teacher quality, as measured by foregone non-teaching wages.
    9
      No single dimension of teacher quality can paint a full picture of what constitutes quality. For example, recent work argues that
even traditional test-score-based measures of teacher value-added miss important non-cognitive performance impacts of teachers
on students (Petek and Pope 2016; Jackson 2018).



                                                                  5
attrit from charter schools move to traditional public schools, and lower-performing charter teachers exit
teaching entirely. The authors propose a model in which this phenomenon can be rationalized by the cost of
obtaining a teaching license (required for teaching in a traditional public school but not a charter school).
       We also contribute to a broader literature on occupational licensing--government-mandated require-
ments for professionals in a given occupation. These requirements affect nearly 30% of the U.S. labor force,
a larger proportion of workers than are in unions or covered by minimum wage laws, and over 1,100 occupa-
tions are licensed in at least one state (Kleiner and Krueger 2010).10 A number of previous studies examine
the relationship between licensing laws and quality in a variety of occupations (Carroll and Gaston 1981;
Maurizi 1980; Kleiner and Kudrle 2000; Kugler and Sauer 2005; Barrios 2019; Hall et al. 2019; Kleiner and
Soltas 2019; Farronato et al. 2020; Rupp and Tan 2020). These studies have generally found non-positive
effects on quality. Anderson et al. (2020) offers a recent exception, finding that licensing laws for midwives
in the early 1900s reduced maternal mortality. Two studies that, like ours, study a continuous quality mea-
sure and document positive effects on the left tail of the distribution, are Ramseyer and Rasmusen (2015)
(studying lawyers) and Bhattacharya et al. (2019) (studying financial advisers).11
       Previous studies of occupational licensing have also documented the potential for disparate effects for
low-income or minority groups. Currie and Hotz (2004) and Hotz and Xiao (2011) demonstrate that tighter
educational requirements for child care professionals lead to higher quality for children who receive care, but
also lead to price increases resulting in fewer children being served. Kleiner (2006) finds similar results in
dentistry. Law and Marks (2009) and Blair and Chung (2018) offer evidence that occupational licenses can
serve as a positive signal for minority workers, while Federman et al. (2006) find that licensing requirements
for manicurists disproportionately exclude Vietnamese people and Angrist and Guryan (2008) find that
teacher certification test requirements reduce the fraction of Hispanic teachers. In our results, we find no
disparate impacts of increased teacher licensing stringency on these groups.
  10
      Over the past decade, policymakers from both sides of the political spectrum have been especially interested in research and
reform surrounding occupational licensing. See http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/02/09/in-obamas-budget-an-effort-to-rein-in-
occupational-licensing/ and https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20180625. Barrero et al. (2020) argue that occupational
licensing restrictions are one of the primary dimensions of U.S. policy that will determine the speed of the economic recovery from
the COVID-19 pandemic.
   11
      In this broader literature, teacher licensing has been a major focus. See discussions in Kleiner (2006, 2011). Understanding
the effects of licensing laws may be particularly important in the market for public school teachers, where tenure laws make it more
challenging than in other professions to fire low-quality workers, and hence regulating the gateway for initial employment may be
desirable. A theoretical literature studies occupational licensing in general markets for services (e.g., Leland 1979, Shapiro 1986,
Kleiner and Soltas 2019). Results from this theoretical literature do not immediately extend to our setting in that the consumers of
schooling services--parents and students--do not directly hire teachers, and wages for teachers are set by public agencies, not by
competitive market-clearing forces. Because of these features, our theoretical and empirical results do not necessarily immediately
generalize to other occupations.




                                                                 6
2        A Simple Theoretical Framework

We present a simple theoretical model of licensing stringency and the teacher quality distribution. We
consider a static environment with a finite mass of potential teachers (whom we will refer to as workers)
indexed by i. Each worker i is endowed with a quality index qi , which has finite support; without loss of
generality, we consider the support of qi to be [0, 1] for all i. As in the teacher supply models of Angrist and
Guryan (2008) or Kraft et al. (2020), quality in our model is synonymous with the overall strength of the
worker's resume or qualifications: qi is i's expected wage outside of teaching.
        Each worker chooses to become a teacher or not. If she does not become a teacher, she receives a payoff
of qi . If she does become a teacher, she receives a payoff of w. Unlike markets for other service providers,
such as plumbers or electricians (e.g., Farronato et al. 2020), wages in the teacher market are set by public
agencies (in many cases, through collective wage bargaining with teacher unions) rather than by competitive
market forces. This results in a rigid salary structure that differentiates pay for teachers only based on years
of teaching experience and, in some cases, the level of college degree attained (bachelor's vs. master's).12
Because of this feature, we model each teacher as receiving a uniform salary of w that does not depend
on her quality qi . To become a teacher, worker i must pay a cost ci , representing the cost of receiving a
license and getting a teaching position; we will refer to this simply as the cost of licensure.13 We model this
licensure cost as ci = c(r, qi ), where r parameterizes the stringency of licensing requirements.
        We will refer to the real line R = (-, ) as the extended support of qi . We assume the following
conditions hold at any qi  R:
                                                                                                                          c(r,qi )
Assumption 1. At any r and any qi  R, (i) c(r, qi ) is continuous and twice differentiable, (ii)                           r         > 0,
        c(r,qi )                   2 c(r,q   i)
(iii)    qi        < 0, and (iv)     q2
                                                  > 0.
                                      i


        Assumption 1 states that increases in stringency increase the licensure cost, the cost of licensure is lower
for high-outside-option (high-quality) teachers, and the cost of licensure is strictly convex in qi .14 Define
f (r, qi ) = w - c(r, qi ) - qi as the expected gains from becoming a teacher. A worker will become a teacher
if and only if f (r, qi )  0. The strict convexity of c leads to the strict concavity of f , which implies there are
   12
      Podgursky (2006) documents that wages and hiring policies in public schools followed this rigid structure in our sample period;
the Wisconsin reform in flexible wages studied in Biasi (2018) occurred in 2011, after our sample period. In contrast to rigid teacher
wages, in general service markets with flexible wages and competitive labor market conditions, stricter licensing policies can lead
to higher wages in the licensed profession, at least partially accommodating workers for the cost of licensure, as in the recent
structural model of Kleiner and Soltas (2019), or earlier work by Shapiro (1986).
   13
      This model assumes for simplicity that each worker who pays the cost of licensure is also guaranteed a teaching job. In practice,
teachers have to be successful in interviews and performance evaluations to be hired (Strauss et al. 2000). We have examined an
alternative version of this model in which each worker faces a probability of pi of getting a teaching job (in addition to facing a cost
of licensure), where pi is decreasing in r and increasing in qi . This probability pi can be embedded within ci , and indeed we find
that the alternative model generates the same features we show here. We choose to focus on the simplest model that delivers these
key insights.
   14
      The strict convexity assumption can be replaced with weak convexity and the results still hold but the proofs are more involved.


                                                                   7
at most two real roots of f (r, qi ) in the extended support of qi . Below we assume a positive mass of workers
choose to be teachers. This implies that f (r, qi ) has two distinct real roots and the interval between the two
roots covers at least part of the support [0,1].

Proposition 1. Suppose Assumption 1 holds and a positive mass of workers choose to be teachers. Then
there exists 0  qL < qH  1, such that all workers with qi  [qL , qH ] choose to become teachers and the
rest do not. Moreover, qL increases with r (and strictly increases if qL > 0) and qH decreases with r (and
strictly decreases if qH < 1).

       All proofs are found in Appendix A. Proposition 1 implies that increases in stringency will weakly raise
the lower tail of the distribution of quality within the set of workers who become teachers. This occurs
because increasing stringency raises the cost of licensure, weeding out some low-quality teachers, who have
relatively higher costs of licensure than do high-quality teachers and whose resulting teacher payoff is lower
than their outside option wages. Increasing stringency also weakly lowers the upper tail of the teacher
quality distribution. This occurs because workers in the upper tail have such high outside option wages that
a small increase in the cost of licensure makes teaching unappealing to the marginal high-quality teachers.
       The weak monotonicity feature of Proposition 1 is important and relies on the finite support of qi . It
implies that the model can generate a result where the left tail increases without the right tail decreasing
(and vice versa), or a result where neither tail is affected. Which of these changes occurs depends on where
the marginal teachers come from. The left tail is unaffected by increased stringency if the lower root of
f (r, qi ) on the extended support of qi is well below zero, capturing a situation in which there are many
low-quality workers willing to become teachers even if licensing costs were to increase. If this lower root
is close to or above zero, raising licensure costs immediately affects the marginal low-quality teacher. A
similar argument holds for the right tail.15
       Figure 1 illustrates the results of Proposition 1 as licensing stringency changes from low (top row) to
high (bottom row). The left panels show the case where increased stringency leaves the lower tail of the
pool unchanged while the upper tail of the pool decreases. The right panels feature the case where increased
stringency leads the lower tail of the pool to increase and the upper tail of the pool does not change. The
middle panels illustrate the intermediate case where the lower tail of the pool increases and the upper tail of
the pool decreases.
       The following result demonstrates that it is also possible for these changes in the tails to be completely
off-setting, such that the mean is unaffected:
  15
      An immediate corollary of Proposition 1 is that an increase in the teaching wage, all else equal, leads to a weak decrease in the
left tail and weak increase in the right tail--the opposite effects of a stringency increase. Our model explicitly assumes that w does
not depend on r. Any stringency increase accompanied by a teacher salary increase would bias against an empirical finding that
increased stringency contracts the quality distribution.

Notes: Figure illustrates how the distribution of teacher quality changes with licensing stringency, as described in Proposition 1. For this
illustration, workers are drawn from a Beta(2, 2) and the cost function is c(r, qi ) = r(1 - qi )2 . Each column represents different parameters  and
teacher wages w. From top panels to bottom panels, licensing stringency r increases. The mass of workers who become teachers is shaded in dark
gray and the mass of workers who do not is shaded in light gray.


Proposition 2. Suppose Assumption 1 holds and a positive mass of workers choose to be teachers. An
increase in stringency can result in changes to the tails of the distribution of teacher quality without neces-
sarily changing its mean.

     Figure 2 illustrates Proposition 2. An increase in stringency from the left panel to the right panel results
in an increase in the left tail and an off-setting decrease of the same magnitude in the right tail, leaving the
mean unchanged. This proposition is one possible explanation for the null finding in previous studies fo-
cused on the mean rather than tails of the quality distribution (e.g., Angrist and Guryan 2008), and highlights
effects that would be missed by examining only the average quality. The proof of the proposition considers
a particular cost function and a symmetric quality distribution such that changes in stringency result in sym-
metric changes to the upper and lower bounds, leaving the mean unchanged. This mean-preserving property
does not hold in general; Proposition 2 only states that there exists a possibility of a mean-preserving change.
Whether the mean is left unchanged in practice is an empirical question.
     We now consider the possibility of two populations facing the same level of licensing stringency and

the same licensure cost but having different payoffs for teachers. We will refer to these areas here as school
districts. In practice, school districts within a given state may offer different payoffs for teachers even if the
nominal wage w is the same. For example, some districts may offer more classroom support, more funding
for teacher-led initiatives, or better working conditions in general. We capture these non-wage amenities
here by simply subsuming them into a higher nominal teacher wage in one district. Thus, we assume one
district offers a teacher wage w
                               ~ > w while the other district only offers w.16 Our final result relies on one
additional assumption:

                                                                        2 c(r,qi )
Assumption 2. The cost function c(r, qi ) satisfies                     qi r         < 0.

        This cross-partial condition implies that increases in stringency raise the licensure cost more for low-
quality workers than for high-quality workers.

Proposition 3. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold and a positive mass of workers choose to be teachers.
                                                                         ~ than in a district paying w < w.
When stringency increases, qH decreases weakly less in a district paying w                               ~
The difference in the change in qL between the two districts is ambiguous.

        Proposition 3 suggests that the potential negative effects of increasing licensing stringency (i.e., the
driving away of high-quality candidates) will be dampened in a school district that can offer a higher real
   16
     Prince (2003) discusses widespread evidence that teachers view these non-wage dimensions of job appeal as analogous to a
wage gap. There is evidence that high-poverty districts pay less even in nominal wages (Lankford et al. 2002). We also infor-
mally interviewed teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area and found similar gaps between high- and low-poverty districts in both
non-wage amenities and actual pay. Differentials in nominal wages are ostensibly made smaller through policies geared toward
equalizing funding across schools, but even these policies have been criticized as leaving loopholes through which high-poverty-
area teachers are still paid less nominally (Long 2011).


                                                                           10
payoff w
       ~ . A district that cannot offer this higher payoff will see weakly greater declines in the upper tail
of quality when stringency increases. The difference of the effect on the lower tail between the high- and
low-paying district is ambiguous, as is the difference of the effect on the means. This ambiguity suggests
that, like the effects highlighted in Propositions 1 and 2, the actual sign of differences in mean quality effects
across districts must be measured empirically.17


3         Data on Teacher Quality and Licensing Stringency

3.1        Data on Teachers and State-by-Year Controls

Our data come from several sources. Our first dataset is the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) from the
U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which was administered
to a nationally representative sample of teachers in several waves: 1993, 1999, 2003, and 2007.18 Each
wave contains information about individual teachers and their schools and districts. For each year from
1991­2007, we keep the cohort of teachers who begin teaching in that year from the first SASS survey in
which they appear, allowing us to use the four SASS survey years to construct a panel of states across all
years, with a separate sample of teachers within each state-by-year cell. For example, from the 1993 survey,
we keep the three distinct cohorts of teachers who began teaching in 1991, 1992, and 1993. From the 1999
survey, we keep the six distinct cohorts who began teaching in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999.
         For each teacher, SASS records the teacher's undergraduate institution, which we link to data on the
selectivity of that institution as measured by the average SAT score of entering freshmen.19 We will refer to
this college selectivity variable as quality, although, as described in Section 1, a teacher's academic ability
or impressiveness to an outside employer is only one of many possible definitions of quality. A single
    17
      The ambiguity in the left tail (and hence the average) arises from the feature that higher-paying districts attract a wider range of
teacher quality (see footnote 15), and thus an increase in stringency increases the cost of the marginal low-quality worker more in
the higher-paying district. This tends to increase qL more in the higher-paying district, but the convexity of c(r, qi ) is a force pushing
in the opposite direction. Specifically, convexity implies that an equivalent increase in licensure costs in the two districts would
lead to a smaller change in qL in the higher-paying district. Which force dominates depends on the curvature of c(r, qi ). A simple
extension of the model generates ambiguity even in the upper tail: if lower-paying districts draw from a distribution of worker
quality that is stochastically dominated by that of higher-paying districts (for example, with qi having support on [0, q] rather than
[0, 1], with q < 1), then changes in stringency can result in a decrease in qH in the higher-paying district and not the lower-paying
district.
   18
      Public versions of SASS are available at nces.gov. We use the restricted-use SASS sample, which allows us to link teachers to
their undergraduate institution. The restricted-use data is available in a secure fashion to researchers who apply for access through
nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/licenses.asp. For any figures or tables using SASS data, the full citation for this data is U.S. Department of
Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, "Public School Questionnaire," "Public School
Teacher Questionnaire," "Public School District Questionnaire," "Private School Teacher Questionnaire," 1993-1994, 1999-2000,
2003-2004, and 2007-2008.
   19
      Data on average SAT scores of entering freshmen come from a 1983 survey conducted by the Higher Education Research
Institute (see Astin et al. 1983; Angrist and Guryan 2008). The average SAT score of an institution is highly correlated across time.
To verify this, we obtained 2007 institutional-level data from collegescorecard.ed.gov. For the set of institutions appearing in both
the 1983 and 2007 data, the correlation of average SAT scores across the two years is 0.81.


                                                                   11
observation in the SASS data represents a particular teacher who began teaching in a particular year and
state, and we can link this observation to the licensing stringency for that year and state. We treat this
observation as an independent draw from the teacher quality distribution in a given year and state.
       We standardize the raw quality measure so it has mean zero and variance one within the sample, meaning
all quality results are reported in units of standard deviations of college selectivity. We then compute several
moments of the quality distribution within each state-by-year cell: the average, the 10th percentile, and
the 90th percentile.20 Descriptive statistics for these quality moments across state-year cells are shown at
the top of panel A in Table 1. The first column of Table 1 demonstrates that the mean quality in a state-
year cell is 0 on average (by construction), the 10th percentile of quality is -1.04 on average, and the 90th
percentile is 1.11 on average. The gap between the 10th and 90th percentiles is 2.15 on average. Columns
2­4 demonstrate that these moments differ widely across state-year cells. The final four columns in Table
1 demonstrate that these statistics are similar for elementary and secondary school teachers, although the
quality distribution is wider for secondary school teachers.
       Statistics on the number of teachers per state-year cell are reported at the bottom of panel A, and the
total number of state-year cells is shown at the bottom of Table 1. Our SASS sample consists of 26,280
teachers, and includes only state-year cells with at least six teachers, which yields 857 state-by-year cells
when we consider all teachers, 696 state-by-year cells when we consider only elementary school teachers,
and 815 state-by-year cells when we consider only secondary school teachers.21 Panel A displays a number
of other variables we construct from SASS data, including the fraction of schools in city, suburban, or rural
environments; the average (across districts in a state-year cell) percent of minority (non-white) students and
percent of students qualifying for free lunch; several measures of the median teacher earnings within a state-
year cell (the log of public school teacher earnings, the log of district-level salary for new teachers with a
bachelor's or master's degree, and the log of private school teacher earnings); and the fraction of teachers
belonging to the union.22

      These state-by-year moments are computed using SASS sampling weights. We aggregate to a group (state-by-year) level
because our policy variation (licensing stringency) exists at the state-by-year level and our empirical analysis in Section 5 relies on
grouped quantile regression. Additionally, aggregating (as well as standardizing the college selectivity measure) allows our analysis
to rely on data that we can release to other researchers while satisfying NCES reporting requirements.
   21
      We also limit our sample to teachers from school districts with at least 50 students enrolled. Given that we have 17 years and 51
states (for our purposes, Washington, D.C. is also treated as a state), we would have 867 state-by-year cells constructed from 26,320
teachers. We restrict our sample to state-by-year cells with at least six teachers to satisfy NCES minimum-cell-size requirements,
reducing the number of individual teachers to 26,280, and reducing the number of state-year cells to 857. Note that the raw SASS
sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10 to comply with reporting requirements.
   22
      We adjust all monetary quantities throughout the paper to be in 2007 dollars. One of the earnings variables shown in panel A is
the median log of earnings for private school teachers in a state-by-year cell. This variable comes from separate SASS surveys of
private school teachers, available the same years as the SASS public school surveys. This data is more sparse than the public school
teachers sample, and fewer state-by-year cells constructed from this data meet our minimum cell size requirement of six. We set
this variable to zero for any state-by-year cells without at least six observations and we construct a dummy indicator for these cells,
denoted "Pri. teacher earnings exists" in Panel A.



                                                                 12
       Our analysis incorporates a number of other state-by-year-level controls. Descriptive statistics for these
state-by-year controls are shown in panel B of Table 1. We obtain information on total student enrollment,
total government spending on education, and the number of charter schools from the U.S. Department of
Education Common Core of Data (CCD). We use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Integrated
Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS, Flood et al. 2020) to construct the state-by-year average wage for all
workers and for public and private school teachers, as well as the fraction of teachers in the union. We also
obtain data on per-capita income from the census and unemployment rate data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. We construct a Bartik measure for labor demand following Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020),
which measures wage growth over time accounting for the industry mix within a state. Data on the political
party in control of state executive and legislative branches, as well as an indicator for whether the governor
is a lame duck, come from Klarner (2013a,b). These party variables are coded on a scale with 1 being
Democratic and 0 being Republican.23 The percent of Democratic votes minus the percent of Republican
votes in the state's most recent gubernatorial election is constructed using the CQ Press Voting and Elections
database. Section 4 discusses additional education policy variables from panel B and Section 5.4 discusses
the teacher race variables from panel A.


3.2       Data on Stringency of Teacher Licensing

The requirements that teachers need to satisfy prior to initial licensure vary widely across states and time
and can consist of dozens of distinct dimensions. For each year possible, we collected data on 37 major
dimensions of licensing requirements in each state (plus Washington, D.C.) from 1991 through 2007 from
a large number of physical and online data sources; see Appendix G for details. Teacher certification re-
quirements include specific coursework and pedagogical training, certification tests, background checks,
and much more. We codify each dimension using binary indicators for whether a requirement in a given
dimension was in place in a given year and state. In each case, 0 indicates less stringency. For example, the
indicator for Humanities takes a value of 1 for a given state and year if teaching candidates were required
to have taken a humanities course prior to initial licensure in that state and year, and takes on a value of 0
otherwise.
       The large dimensionality of these requirements necessitates a dimension-reduction approach in order
to make the analysis of licensing stringency feasible and meaningful. We employ principal factor analysis
(PFA) to perform this step. This method reduces a matrix to latent factors that best explain the variation
in the original matrix. Appendix Figure A6, panel B, displays the eigenvalues for each component from
this factor decomposition. The eigenvalue of the first component is nearly three times that of any other,

suggesting that the first component explains the lion's share of the variance in licensing requirements; each
successive factor after the first adds little explanatory power. For this reason, we focus primarily on this first
component as our measure of stringency throughout the paper. We analyze other factors in Section 5.5.24
    Summary statistics for this stringency measure are reported in panel C of Table 1. Figure 3 displays the
loading of each of the 37 original licensing requirements in our stringency measure (i.e., the weight each
dimension receives). The figure demonstrates that our stringency measure is most strongly correlated with
course requirements for teachers, including social science, natural science, English, math, and humanities;
it is also positively (but less strongly) correlated with teacher training requirements such as student teaching
or knowledge-of-teaching exams; it is weakly negatively correlated with some dimensions, such as evidence
of employment, oath of allegiance, minimum age, and fee requirements. These correlations are particularly
interesting when put in historical context: Ravitch (2003) and other contemporary sources point out that
teacher certification requirements have been influenced and shaped to some extent by teacher preparation
programs and teacher unions (Winkler et al. 2012), who tend to favor certification policies that promote pro-
fessional educator training through education schools and tend to oppose policies that require standards to
be met outside of education schools, such as academic course requirements or academic subject matter test-
ing (Ravitch 2003).25 In this light, our stringency measure captures some of the most important dimensions
surrounding teacher certification debates.


4     Why Does Stringency Vary Across States and Across Years?

We now explore the variation in our stringency measure across states and across time. Teacher licensing
requirements have changed significantly over time, including some changes long before our sample period.
In the mid-1800s, most states began requiring prospective teachers to pass some sort of test to get a teaching
certificate (Ravitch 2003), and by the early 1900s, many states required teachers to have a high school
education and at least some college (Law and Marks 2009). State requirements became less important after
1915, when education schools (initially referred to as normal schools) evolved into the primary educators
of teachers, and the primary drivers of changes in teacher standards for the next several decades, with the
emphasis in teacher training being pedagogical skill rather than academic subject mastery (Ravitch 2003).
    The seminal report "A Nation at Risk" in the early 1980s (Gardner 1983) highlighted a number of de-
ficiencies in U.S. education and sparked a new wave of interest in teacher certification reform. Academic
   24
      Note that omitting these other factors from our main analysis does not lead to any bias as these factors are, by construction,
orthogonal to one another. Note also that our stringency measure is, by construction, normalized to have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1 across state-year cells.

research that followed demonstrated that the academic ability of public school teachers was lacking (Vance
and Schlechty 1982; Hanushek and Pace 1995; Strauss et al. 2000; Hoxby and Leigh 2004; Bacolod 2007).
However, the level of interest in reform--and the opinions on how to implement such reform--differed
widely across states and across time in the ensuing decades. Heated debates frequently involved one side
arguing for stricter licensing to improve teacher quality while the opposing side argued for looser require-
ments to achieve the same goal.26
   26
    Speaking before the White House in 2003, Diane Ravitch in the NYU Education School stated, "Our nation faces a daunting
challenge in making sure that we have a sufficient supply of well-educated, well-prepared teachers for our children. There is
surely widespread agreement that good teachers are vital to our future. However, there is not widespread agreement about how
we accomplish this goal. Some propose that we raise standards for entry into the teaching profession, while others suggest that
we lower unnecessary barriers" (Ravitch 2003). A prime example of these opposing viewpoints is the back-and-forth critiques by



                                                                                       16
    This heterogeneity of opinion and ideology led to widely varying policies across states in the 1990s and
2000s, a prime example of federalism, with each state functioning as what Supreme Court Justice Louis
Brandeis referred to as a "laboratory of democracy" to "try novel social and economic experiments without
risk to the rest of the country."27 Even national changes in education policy over this time frame, such as the
No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), led to state-level experiments, leaving it up to individual states
to decide how--and largely when--to achieve the NCLB requirement that each state's teachers be "highly
qualified teachers"; the precise definition of highly qualified teachers was also left to individual states to
decide (Kuenzi 2009; Kraft 2018).28 Similar examples of variation in policy direction and intensity across
states and time are found in occupational licensing more broadly (Kleiner 2013; Kleiner and Soltas 2019).29
    The heterogeneity in teacher licensing requirements across states and across time is demonstrated in Fig-
ure 4. Each panel shows the evolution of a given state's stringency measure from 1991­2007, with the year
NCLB passed (2001) marked with the vertical line in each plot as a benchmark. Most states are relatively
constant in their stringency score over time.30 Several states experience large increases in stringency, such
as Kentucky and North Dakota. Other states have large decreases in stringency, such as Arkansas, Florida,
and Georgia. Still, others experience large temporary changes, such as the large temporary dip in stringency
observed in Maryland or Michigan or the temporary increase in stringency observed in Alaska or Arizona.
Florida and North Dakota offer a particularly interesting contrast. Both experienced drastic changes in our
stringency measure surrounding NCLB, but in opposite directions. Neighboring South Dakota, on the other
hand, stayed flat over this time frame, while Florida's neighbor, Georgia, experienced a similar drop, but
several years before Florida.
education researchers (Darling-Hammond et al. 2001 and others, favoring increased requirements and professionalism of teaching)
on one side, and Ballou and Podgursky (1998) and Goldhaber and Brewer (2000) on the other, summarized in Cochran-Smith and
Fries (2005).

      Brandeis quotes from New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262 (1932), accessed on October 23, 2020 from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratories of democracy. Tamir (2010) offers a detailed historical analysis of the battle of opinions
over teacher certification policy that took place within New Jersey in the 1980s, which resulted in more state-level power over
licensing requirements (and less power in the hands of university teacher preparation programs) and greater emphasis on academic
preparation rather than pedagogical training.
   28
      NCLB specifies that, at a minimum, a highly qualified teacher (HQT) much have a bachelor's degree and full state licensure and
must prove that she knows her subject matter. Any other dimension of HQT is left up to states to define (as are the specifics of what
constitutes state licensure and subject-matter knowledge). This freedom led to states reacting differently even to a federal policy
change. Furthermore, even if requirements had been uniform across states, these requirements would likely have had asymmetric
impacts on state policy because of cross-state differences in stringency prior to NCLB. Any effects of NCLB on the teacher quality
distribution that were indeed uniform across states will be captured by year fixed effects in our empirical model.
   29
      Law and Marks (2009) study historical occupational licensing restrictions (from before 1940) across states for a broad range
of occupations, including teachers. The authors find that southern states were later adopters in requiring teachers to have a high
school education or some college education. Other than this geographic variation, the authors find no systemic explanation for why
some states adopt stricter licensing requirements before others. The authors argue that historical variation in licensing requirements
across states is in general quite arbitrary. Kleiner (2013) offers similar evidence. Kleiner and Soltas (2019) similarly argue that,
for licensed occupations broadly, "the political sources of variation in licensing policy are often so arcane and arbitrary as to be
plausibly as good as random."

      For example, stringency in Illinois does not change during the early-retirement incentive intervention of the early 1990s studied
in Fitzpatrick and Lovenheim (2014).

Notes: Figure shows the evolution of each state's stringency measure from 1991­2007, with the year NCLB passed (2001) marked with the
vertical line in each panel.


                The changes in stringency shown in Figure 4 naturally reflect changes in individual requirements that are
heavily weighted in our stringency measure. For example, the large decrease in stringency in Arkansas in
2002 consists of a removal of coursework requirements in English, social science, natural science, math, and
general education, as well as the removal of a requirement that teachers be professional education majors and
have some field experience before beginning student teaching. All of these requirements receive a positive
loading in the factor analysis shown in Figure 3.
                We searched historical discussions for context on the drivers of the teacher licensing stringency changes
found in Figure 4. Several discussions point to perceived teacher shortages as one motive for states reducing
stringency, and Appendix E offers some evidence consistent with this possibility. However, these shortages
were a widespread problem, not limited to specific states (Cortez 2001), and certainly not restricted to
the states in Figure 4 that reduced stringency. Another potential driver highlighted in education policy
discussions during this period is an explicit concern over low teacher quality, and pre-trends here could



                                                                                                                                             18
invalidate the research design we adopt in Section 5. However, these same policy discussions demonstrate
that states showed no clear agreement on how to improve quality, and thus some reduced stringency while
others increased it, while others kept licensing requirements constant (Ravitch 2003). We present results
from an event study in Section 5.3 that support the exogeneity of licensing stringency changes.
       As would any 17-year period in the U.S., the period we study naturally encompasses a number of other
education policy changes in different states. Examples of such changes that have received attention in the
recent literature, and that we are able to explicitly control for in our analysis, are school finance reform, the
phasing out of school desegregation orders, changes in state collective bargaining laws, and the rise of char-
ter schools. Panel B of Table 1 contains the following variables at the state-by-year level that relate to these
policies: an indicator for before and after a state adopts its key school finance reform aimed at guaranteeing
sufficient funding to high-poverty districts, obtained from Lafortune et al. (2018), as well as the level of total
government education expenditure from the CCD; the log of the number of districts with a desegregation
order still in place (plus 1), obtained from Reardon et al. (2012); indicators for whether collective bargain-
ing for teachers is required or allowed but not required, obtained from Valletta and Freeman (1988) and
Frandsen (2016); and the log of the number of charter schools (plus 1) from the CCD. We also performed
a detailed reading of other state-level education policy changes over our time period (such as changes in
high school graduation requirements, minimum school day or year length, class size, compulsory school
age requirements, vouchers, or standardized curriculum); we observed no obvious connection between the
timing of these changes and the timing of the stringency changes captured by our metric.31
       Overall, our reading of historical discussions and other education policy changes is that the timing and
magnitude of teacher certification requirement changes are as good as random. We offer additional empirical
evidence consistent with this idea in Appendix D, where we show that states' levels of stringency are not
systematically related to a number of historical educational, political, union, or labor market conditions. In
our estimation in Section 5, we explicitly control for these conditions as much as possible, and in Section 5.3
we present an event study testing for possible differential trends in teacher quality prior to licensing policy
changes.
  31
    A number of state education policy changes occurred before our sample period, such as the wave of policies in the 1970s and
1980s aimed at school finance equalization (Jackson et al. 2016). A number of other policy changes occurred after our sample
period, such as major accountability/teacher evaluation regulations (adopted after 2011), Race to the Top grants to states (occurring
in 2010­2011), and the adoption of Common Core curriculum standards (2009­2010); see Kraft et al. (2020) for a discussion of
some of these post-2008 policy changes.




                                                                19
5     The Effects of Stringency on the Teacher Quality Distribution

5.1     Two-Way Fixed Effects Results

In this section, we describe our empirical approach for measuring the effects of licensing stringency on the
teacher quality distribution and the results of our analysis. For teacher i who began teaching in year t in
state s, let qist be the college selectivity (as measured by the average SAT score of entering freshmen) of
i's undergraduate institution, standardized to be in units of standard deviations. Let q st (with no i subscript)
represent a statistic of the distribution of qist within a given state-year combination ( s, t). The statistics of
the distribution that will be our primary focus are the mean, the 10th percentile, and the 90th percentile.
      Our primary methodology is a two-way fixed effects framework. The regressions we analyze take the
following form:


                                      q st =  +  s + t + S tringency st  + W st  +  st .                                            (1)


Our parameter of interest in equation (1) is , the effect of licensing stringency on quality. For example,
when the outcome variable is the 10th percentile of quality in state s and year t, a positive value of 
would indicate that an increase in licensing stringency from year t - 1 to year t leads to an increase in the
lower tail of quality. A negative value of , when the outcome variable is the 90th percentile of quality,
would imply that an increase in stringency decreases the upper tail.32 The vector W st includes a variety
of state-by-year controls that vary depending on the specification, as we describe below. State effects  s
capture characteristics that are unchanging over time within a state (e.g., some states may have higher-
quality teachers than others over the entire sample period), while year effects t capture factors that affect
the whole country in a given year (e.g., any nationwide effects of NCLB legislation in the early 2000s).33
   32
      This model is a special case of the grouped quantile regression estimator (Chetverikov et al. 2016a), an alternative to quantile
regression for settings with a group-level treatment and micro data on outcomes within a group. In our paper, a group is a state-
by-year cell, the treatment of interest is state-by-year level licensing stringency, and micro data corresponds to individual teachers
surveyed in each cell. This estimator offers a number of benefits over traditional quantile regression, including being computation-
ally simple to estimate (via ordinary least squares) even with a large number of fixed effects and being robust to measurement error
in computing quantiles (unlike standard quantile regression; see Chetverikov et al. 2016a for details). Because our minimum cell
size is six, the 10th percentile in the smallest cells is equivalent to the 20th, and the 90th percentile is equivalent to the 80th. Our
results are unchanged if we instead use state-by-year cells with at least ten observations; see Appendix Table A12. Chetverikov
et al. (2016a) derive a mild growth condition on the minimum cell size as the number of cells increases such that this measurement
error can also be ignored when computing standard errors. Chetverikov et al. (2016b) extend the method to clustered standard
errors, which we allow for here.
   33
      By construction, there is one cohort in the data per starting year. For example, teachers who began teaching in 1997 appear
in the data as third-year teachers surveyed in the SASS 1999 wave, and 1997 absorbs the mean of q st for this cohort. In addition
to any nationwide 1997 effect, average quality for these teachers may differ not because of experience itself (because our quality
measure is a fixed characteristic of a teacher that does not vary with experience) but rather because of teacher exit: higher-quality
teachers may be more likely to get high outside offers early and exit teaching. In our regression analysis, year fixed effects absorb
average quality differences across cohorts due to this type of teacher attrition. Appendix B describes in detail how teacher attrition
may affect our results, and demonstrates empirically that this does not appear to be a driving force in our findings.



                                                                  20
       In our baseline specification, where W st is empty, our identifying assumption is that unobserved factors
at the state-by-year level ( st ) that are not common to all states or all years do not systematically change
at the same time as licensing stringency. As highlighted in Section 4, changes in stringency in response to
past low quality may violate this assumption. The assumption may also be violated if  st contains a number
of other state-by-year factors, such as local labor market conditions, student and school characteristics,
political preferences within a state, or features of education policy apart from licensing stringency. These
factors would not by themselves be a problem for identification, but if these variables covary with stringency
and are omitted from the regression, our identification assumption would be violated.34
       We examine the possibility of such omitted variables by consecutively including in the vector W st a
number of different controls at the state-by-year level. The results are shown in Table 2. To conserve space,
we only show the estimates of the stringency effect ; estimates for other parameters are found in Appendix
Tables A7­A9. Each cell in Table 2 corresponds to a different regression, with the controls varying across
columns and the outcome and/or sample (all, elementary school, or secondary school teachers) varying
across rows.35 Before presenting the results, we discuss how the controls differ across columns.
       All columns in Table 2 include state and year fixed effects. Column 1 is our baseline specification
without any additional control variables (W st is empty). Column 2 adds controls for the school and student
characteristics listed in panels A and B of Table 1: the urbanicity of the state's schools, the fraction of
minority students, the fraction of free-lunch students, total enrollment, state expenditures on education,
and the number of charter schools. Column 3 incorporates controls for teacher labor market conditions
(earnings and union strength controls) from panels A and B of Table 1 that might potentially change at
the same time as licensing stringency or drive changes in licensing stringency.36 Column 4 adds controls
for non-teacher labor market conditions listed in panel B of Table 1, including the Bartik measure, the log
of per-capita income, average wages among all workers, and the unemployment rate. This column also
includes quadratic terms of the unemployment rate for state s in year t and three years of lags, as well as
quadratic terms of the unemployment rate in state s in the corresponding SASS survey year.37 Column 5
  34
      Another consideration is that migration of teachers across state lines could change in response to changes in licensing require-
ments; Appendix F demonstrates that this is indeed the case, but that the effects do not appear to drive the changes in the distribution
of quality that we document here.
   35
      Throughout the paper, unless otherwise stated, regressions use weights constructed from the sum of individual SASS sampling
weights within a state-year cell. All standard errors are clustered at the state level.
   36
      Arguments in Kleiner and Petree (1988) and Kleiner (2011) suggest that these union and salary controls may be important, as
increased stringency may increase a union's wage bargaining power. Arguments in Cowen and Strunk (2015) similarly suggest that
collective bargaining policies themselves may be important to control for, which we do in column 5. However, as demonstrated in
Section 2, any simultaneous increases in salary and stringency should bias against finding an increase in the left tail and a decrease
in the right tail.
   37
      Strauss et al. (2000) offer evidence that these unemployment terms could be important for our analysis, as low-qualified
workers may be more likely to opt into teaching especially in times of high unemployment: "In a time of difficult employment
prospects, teaching jobs are among the highest paying and the most coveted in many parts of [Pennsylvania]." Note that the
earnings and union controls and school/student characteristics constructed from SASS data (listed in panel A of Table 1) capture


                                                                  21
includes controls for education policies that changed over time in different states: an indicator for whether
the state has implemented a major financial adequacy policy (Lafortune et al. 2018), the number of school
desegregation orders still in place (Reardon et al. 2012), and indicators for collective bargaining policies in
a given state and year (Valletta and Freeman 1988; Frandsen 2016). Column 6 includes political controls
listed in panel B of Table 1: the political party of the state legislature and governor, the Democratic minus
Republican vote share from the gubernatorial election, and an indicator for the governor being a lame duck
(i.e., the governor facing a term limit and being in her last term).
    Column 7 of Table 2, our preferred specification, includes all of the variables from columns 1­6 simul-
taneously. Column 8 includes all of the variables from column 7 as well as state-specific linear time trends
(a separate linear time trend for each state). This final column offers an additional check specifically on the
parallel trends assumption as it allows for the possibility that different states may have different trends in the
growth of teacher quality. Appendix B offers additional robustness checks.
    Panel A presents the results for the sample of all teachers. We find a positive effect on the 10th percentile
teacher quality of about 0.13­0.18 standard deviations. This effect is consistently significant across speci-
fications, suggesting that increases in stringency raise the lower tail of the teacher quality distribution. The
estimated effects on the average and the 90th percentile are not significant in most specifications in panel
A. Only column 8, with state-specific trends, shows a significant effect on the average quality of 0.058. For
elementary school teachers (panel B), we do not detect any robustly significant effects for any statistic of the
distribution (the lower tail, the upper tail, or the average).
    For secondary school teachers (panel C), we find no significant effect on average quality, but a positive
and significant effect on the 10th percentile of quality, robust across specifications.38 The estimates suggest
that a one-standard-deviation increase in stringency leads to an increase in the left tail of about 0.13­0.17
standard deviations of quality. This finding is consistent with stricter licensing improving the lower tail of
quality. We find no significant effect on the upper tail of quality, and the point estimates are smaller than
the left-tail effects. The point estimates for the effect on the 90th percentile are all negative--consistent
with arguments in Ballou and Podgursky (1998) and others who have pointed out that stricter licensing may
drive away high-quality candidates. The 95% confidence interval for the effect on the 90th percentile in our
preferred specification implies that we cannot reject a decrease of 0.12 standard deviations or an increase
of up to 0.06. A t test on the gap between the 90th and 10th percentiles yields a statistically significant
decrease, implying that we can reject the possibility that the right tail increases to a degree that dominates
features contemporaneous to the year in which a given set of teachers is surveyed in the SASS data, whereas the corresponding
non-SASS controls (listed in panel B of Table 1) capture features of the year in which teachers started teaching.
   38
      These results are not driven by any single state. Leaving out any given state in the estimation, we still find a significant,
positive estimate of the effect on the left tail, with the estimates from leaving out one state tightly distributed around the full-sample
estimates. See Panels C and D of Appendix Figure A6.

Notes: Table presents the estimates of equation (1). An observation is a state-year combination. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different
regression and the reported coefficient is the effect of licensing stringency on quality, or . Each row represents a different statistic of the
distribution: the mean, the 10th percentile, and the 90th percentile. Each column uses different control variables. All columns include state and
year fixed effects. Column 2-6 adds additional control variables on school/student characteristics, teacher labor market, non-teacher labor market,
education policies, and political conditions. Column 7 adds all variables from columns 1­6. Column 8 further includes a separate linear time trend
for each state. Panel A presents the results for all teachers. Panel B restricts to elementary school teachers and Panel C restricts to secondary
school teachers. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in parentheses.  : p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.


the increase in the left tail.39 Consistent with a large increase in the left tail and a small decrease in the
right tail, we find a small positive (but insignificant) effect on the average. This insignificant effect on the
average quality is consistent with findings of Angrist and Guryan (2008) and with the possibility raised in
   39
     The finding of a large point estimate for the left tail and a smaller for the right is consistent with the range of possibilities
predicted by Proposition 1. See, for example, the middle column of Figure 1. Note that a very large increase in the left tail can
bias us against detecting an decrease in the right tail, as increases primarily affecting lower quantiles can spill over into changes
for higher quantiles. For example, consider a case where quality is initially distributed U [0, 1] and suppose a stringency increase
truncates the support to U [0.46, 0.96], truncating the left tail by far more than the right. In this case, the 90th percentile increases
from 0.90 to 0.91 due to the stringency increase, even though the upper bound of the support actually decreases. The t test on the
change in the 90­10 percentile gap, described above, is robust to such changes, and shows that increased stringency indeed leads to
a narrowing of the quality distribution.


                                                                       23
Proposition 2.40 From the 95% confidence interval for the effect on the average, we can reject a negative
effect smaller than -0.02 or a positive effect larger than 0.08.
       Several related studies offer interesting benchmarks for the size of our estimated effects. For the sake
of comparison, we focus on the 0.140 increase in the 10th percentile and the 0.0328 decrease in the 90th
percentile (even though the latter is insignificant) from column 7, Table 2, panel C. We define very low-
ranking or high-ranking colleges as those with average SAT scores outside the 10th or 90th percentiles.
These point estimates translate into a 2.1 percentage point (or 21 percent) decrease in the fraction of teachers
coming from very low-ranking colleges and a 0.45 percentage point (or 4.5 percent) decrease in the fraction
coming from very high-ranking colleges.41 Figlio (1997) finds that a 1% increase in average teacher salary
in a school district is associated with a 0.75% increase in the probability that a teacher comes from a selective
college, and a 1% increase in average overall salary in a metropolitan area is associated with a 1.58% increase
in this probability. Bacolod (2007) studies trends from 1971 to 1995 and documents an 11 percentage
point decrease over this period in the fraction of teachers coming from highly-selective colleges and a 16
percentage point increase in the fraction coming from less-selective institutions. Kraft et al. (2020) find
that teacher accountability reforms instituted after 2011 lead to an 8.1 percentage point increase in the
likelihood that a teacher comes from a selective undergraduate institution.42 Relative to these findings, the
magnitude of the effects we find from a one-standard-deviation increase in licensing stringency appears to
be economically meaningful.
       We find a significant effect of stringency on the left tail among secondary school teachers and we do not
detect any significant results among elementary school teachers, although the confidence intervals do not rule
out effects of a similar size for the two different teacher types. One possible explanation for this difference
is that some certification requirements may be binding only for secondary school teachers, although the
sources from which we collected the data claim that these requirements apply to both levels of teachers.
An alternative explanation is that, even conditional on college selectivity, secondary school teachers may
have higher-paying outside options than elementary school teachers, such that an equivalent increase in the
licensure cost can affect the career decision of workers on the margin of becoming secondary school teachers
without affecting marginal elementary school teachers.
  40
      Angrist and Guryan (2008) find that a state having a basic skills or subject matter certification test requirement (two of the 37
dimensions of licensing requirements we study) does not have a significant effect on the mean of the quality distribution (measuring
quality as the average SAT score of teachers' undergraduate institutions, as in our study) or on the probability that a teacher comes
from a Carnegie-classified research university or liberal arts college.
   41
      These quantities are approximated by computing 0.1 - F       ^ 10 - 
                                                                ^ (q      ^ 10 ) = 0.021 and F    ^ 90 - 
                                                                                               ^ (q      ^ 90 ) - 0.9 = 0.0045, where F
                                                                                                                                      ^ denotes
the empirical CDF of individual secondary school teachers' quality, q       ^ 10 and q^ 90 denote the 10th and 90th percentiles of this CDF,
and   ^ 10 = 0.140 and ^ 90 = -0.0328 are the estimates of the stringency effect on the 10th and 90th percentiles.
   42
      Each of these studies relies on slightly different measures of college selectivity, but these measures tend to be highly correlated,
as discussed in Bacolod (2007).

5.2       The Full Distribution of Quality

We now examine the effects of increased stringency on the full distribution of quality rather than only the
tails or the average. We evaluate equation (1) with the outcome being the  percentile, for   {10, 20, ..., 90}.
The results are shown in Figure 5. Each point represents ^ from a separate regression for each percentile

outcome. For all regressions, we use the preferred specification, with all state-by-year controls included
(corresponding to column 7 of Table 2). 95% confidence intervals (clustered at the state level) for each
percentile are shown with the shaded region.43

Notes: Figure presents the effect of increasing licensing stringency on the full distribution of teacher quality, estimated from equation (1). The
outcomes are the 10th, 20th, ..., 90th percentiles of teacher quality. Panel A uses the full sample of teachers, panel B uses elementary school
teachers, and panel C uses secondary school teachers. 95% confidence intervals for each percentile are shown with the shaded region, constructed
using seemingly unrelated regression to estimate all quantiles simultaneously and using state-level clustering.


        Panel A shows that increased stringency raises the 10th percentile of quality. Point estimates at any
other percentile in panel A--or at any point in the distribution for elementary school teachers in panel B--
are not significantly different from zero. Panel C demonstrates that the increase in the left tail is driven
   43
    These standard errors also take into account cross-quantile correlation in error terms by using seemingly unrelated regression
(Zellner 1962) to estimate the effects on all nine quantiles simultaneously.

by secondary school teachers, whose quality distribution increases significantly at both the 10th and 20th
percentiles, without any significant effects at other percentiles of the distribution. Other than the 10th and
20th percentiles, the point estimates at nearly every other percentile of the distribution are at or below
zero. The confidence intervals at these other percentiles allow us to reject an effect size that is constant
across quantiles. The evidence points strongly to a narrowing of the quality distribution driven largely by an
increase in the left tail.


5.3     A Closer Look at the Timing of Stringency Changes

Our results in Sections 5.1­5.2 suggest that licensing stringency has its most robust effect on the quality
distribution of secondary school teachers. Here we take a more in-depth look at the precise timing of these
effects. A particular concern for identifying the effect of licensing stringency is the possibility that the
unobserved component  st in equation (1) may be correlated over time within a state, and states may adopt
stricter licensing in response to past low realizations of quality, which would be reflected in a differential
trend in quality in states that change stringency vs. those that do not, prior to the law change. Here we adopt
an event study design to look for such pre-trends.
      The state-of-the-art methodology in event study analysis (see Appendix C.1) is most powerful when
treatment is binary and adoption is monotone; that is, when states only change licensing status once over
time, and only in one direction, although the adoption may be staggered across states. To exploit such a
sharp design, we use information in Figure 4 to create a binary treatment variable, classifying each state-
year pair as having either high or low stringency. Specifically, we classify Arkansas, Florida, and Georgia
as beginning with high stringency and changing to low stringency, and we classify Kentucky, Maine, North
Dakota, and Pennsylvania as moving from low to high stringency. A number of other states move in both
directions.44 The remaining states are either always high or always low. We use this classification to create
two subsamples: the high-to-low sample (H2L), consisting of state-year pairs that move only from high
to low stringency, stay always high, or stay always low; and the low-to-high sample (L2H), consisting of
state-year pairs that move only from low to high stringency, stay always low, or stay always high.
      Before presenting our event study, in Table 3, we replicate our two-way fixed effects analysis from
columns 1 and 7 of Table 2 using these high-to-low and low-to-high samples. Panel A uses the same
continuous stringency measure as in Table 2, while panel B uses the binary indicator for high stringency.
For average quality, we find a small and insignificant effect in states that changed from high to low strin-
  44
     We classify some states as changing from high-to-low only over a subset of the time period (Alaska after 1994, Arizona after
1996, Minnesota before 2002, and Maryland before 1999) and low-to-high over another time frame (Alaska before 1999, Arizona
before 1999, Minnesota after 1998, and Maryland after 1996). We treat states with minor fluctuations over time as having not
changed stringency; these include Hawaii, Louisiana, Texas, and Connecticut.

Notes: Table displays results from regressing average, 10th percentile, or 90th percentile of secondary school teacher quality in each state-year cell
on licensing stringency. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different regression and the reported coefficient is the effect of licensing stringency.
Columns 1 and 2 use the sample of states that change stringency from high to low or not at all (H2L) and columns 3 and 4 use the sample of states
that change stringency from low to high or not at all (L2H). Odd columns include only state and year fixed effects, and even columns include all
state-year controls as in column 7 of Table 2. Panel A uses the same continuous stringency variable as in Table 2, and panel B uses a binary
indicator for high stringency. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.


gency (columns 1 and 2), but a significant positive effect in states that changed from low to high stringency
(columns 3 and 4). Both groups of states experienced a significant positive effect on the left tail, and no
significant effect on the 90th percentile. Motivated by these results, we focus on the low-to-high sample for
analyzing the timing of the effect on average quality, and both samples for analyzing the timing of the effect
for the left tail.
     Using these binary treatment samples, we perform a staggered-adoption event study following the
method of de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) (DCDH). This method aggregates cross-state and
cross-year comparisons in a way that is robust to potential treatment-effect heterogeneity. The DCDH event
study results can be illustrated graphically, as shown in Figure 6. The time 0 estimate corresponds to the
instantaneous change (i.e., the change in the year the treatment occurs) in outcomes for states that change
treatment status vs. those that do not. The time > 0 estimates correspond to the treatment effects of changed
stringency one or more years after the change, and the time < 0 estimates correspond to placebo effects--
those prior to the change in stringency. A significant estimate for a time < 0 effect would suggest a concern-
ing pre-trend, as it would imply that quality was already different in treated states even before the treatment

Notes: Figure shows the results of the staggered-adoption event study following the method proposed in de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille
(2020), with the outcome variable being the average quality (in panel A) or the 10th percentile (in panels B and C) of teacher quality among
secondary school teachers within a state-year cell. "Treatment" is defined as a change from low to high stringency in panels A and C, and from
high to low stringency in panel B. 95% confidence intervals are shown with dashed lines, computed from 200 bootstrap replications, with
clustering at the state level.


took place.45
        In Figure 6, the results are imprecisely measured, and we do not observe a persistent, discontinuous
jump at time zero characteristic of some event study designs. In contrast, our main regression approach in
Sections 5.1­5.2 offers more power by pooling across post-change years rather than isolating year-by-year
   45
     A traditional event study design consists of replacing S tringency st in equation (1) with a vector of leads and lags of year-by-
year changes in stringency, potentially with some pre-treatment and post-treatment years aggregated into bins. DCDH, as well
as a number of other recent studies (listed in Appendix C.1), demonstrate that such a design is problematic in that it represents a
weighted average of average treatment effects (ATEs) across state-year cells with potentially negative weights, which can lead to
incorrect estimation and inference if ATEs are heterogeneous across ( s, t) pairs. The DCDH methodology does not rely on these
negative weights, but instead computes the time = 0 effect, for example, by directly comparing outcomes in time t and t - 1 for
states who changed treatment status from t to t - 1. A full description of the DCDH method is quite involved, and we relegate these
details to Appendix C.1. There we also discuss that DCDH demonstrate that a standard two-way fixed effects estimator (the main
estimator we rely on in our paper) also relies on potentially negative weights when aggregating ATEs across state-year pairs and
these weights can result in biased estimates in the presence of treatment-effect heterogeneity across state-year pairs. The authors
offer a number of diagnostics to test whether treatment-effect heterogeneity is indeed problematic for the two-way fixed effects
estimator. We describe the results from these tests in Appendix C.2, which suggest that potential treatment-effect heterogeneity
does not invalidate our main estimates.


                                                                                                  28
effects. However, the event study still offers several insights. First, we detect no significant pre-trends for
either the average quality or left-tail effects, although we do not have sufficient statistical power to claim a
precise zero in each placebo (i.e., pre-treatment) year. Second, we do detect significant effects of the change
in stringency in some years after the treatment occurs: a significant effect on the average and 10th percentile
in year 2 (panels A and C), and a significant effect on the 10th percentile in years 1 and 3 (panel B). This
effect is negative in the high-to-low sample (panel B), as treatment in this sample represents a reduction in
stringency. These results suggest that there is a lag in the effect of changes in licensing stringency. This
is consistent with college students who are prospective teachers changing their majors (in the years before
graduating) in response to changes in licensing requirements. Overall, the results of the event study suggest
that the effects we measure on the quality distribution for secondary school teachers are not driven by any
clear pre-trends in quality; unobservable factors affecting teacher quality do not appear to be changing
differentially in treated vs. untreated states prior to changes in licensing stringency.46


5.4      Effects of Licensing Stringency on Potentially Marginalized Subgroups

We now explore the possibility that changes in licensing stringency may have negative effects on marginal-
ized subgroups of students or teachers, such as high-poverty or high-minority school districts or minority
teachers. Our focus on high-poverty or high-minority districts is motivated by evidence from the existing
literature (e.g., Lankford et al. 2002; Prince 2003; Boyd et al. 2007) that these districts struggle to attract
high-quality teachers.47 Proposition 3 in Section 2 demonstrates that disparate effects are indeed a theoret-
ical possibility: improvements in the quality distribution from changes in licensing stringency may accrue
more to low-poverty districts if these districts can offer higher pay (either through higher nominal pay or
higher non-wage amenities). Section 2 also highlights that it is possible that no differential effect occurs.
Here we investigate this question empirically.
       We differentiate school districts on two different dimensions: the percent of students who qualify for
free lunch and the percent of minority students. We construct our data for this analysis by aggregating the
micro data slightly differently from our analysis above. Each observation in the micro-data corresponds to
an individual teacher in the SASS survey, and for each individual teacher, the data records the percent of
  46
      Corresponding event study plots for the specifications that show insignificant effects in Table 3 are found in Appendix Figure
A3. These results are also imprecise. For the high-to-low sample effect on the average, we observe placebo effects that are only
marginally insignificant, underscoring that the effect on the average is less of a robust finding than the effect on the left tail. We
detect no significant pre-trends for the 90th percentile in either sample, and a significant positive effect two years after the treatment
in the low-to-high treatment sample.
   47
      A teacher quoted in the New York Times in 2000 defended the choice to avoid a job in a high-poverty district: "You have to
be a combination of a social worker and Mother Teresa to work in those schools. Those kids deserve a decent education, but we as
teachers deserve a decent work atmosphere. We deserve to be safe. I worked so hard to get my license, I did all this schooling, and
the last thing I heard, America was a country of free choice." See https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/01/nyregion/newly-certified-
teachers-looking-for-a-job-find-a-paradox.html, cited in Prince (2003).


                                                                   29
students qualifying for free lunch at that teacher's school. We classify a micro-data observation as high-
poverty if the percent of students qualifying for free lunch for that micro-data observation is above the
median level of this variable within a given state-by-year cell. We then compute the mean, 10th percentile,
and 90th percentile of quality separately for high-poverty districts and for low-poverty districts within each
state-by-year cell, aggregating the data to the state-by-year-by-poverty-status cell.48 We follow this same
procedure to create a high-minority indicator within each state-by-year cell and aggregate the data to the
state-by-year-by-minority-status cell.
    Let HighPoverty st j be an indicator variable denoting whether cell j  {0, 1} in state s and year t contains
high-poverty ( j = 1) or low-poverty ( j = 0) districts. We analyze regressions of the following form:


                             q st j =  +  s + t + S tringency st  + W st  + HighPoverty st j 

                                  + S tringency st × HighPoverty st j  +  st j ,                                                    (2)


where q st j here is the statistic of interest of teacher quality within the state-by-year-by-poverty-status cell.
This regression constitutes a grouped quantile regression, as in equation (1), but aggregated to a finer level.
The parameter of interest is , the parameter on the interaction term, which captures the differential effect
of increased stringency on the quality distribution for high-poverty vs. low-poverty districts. We estimate a
similar version of equation (2) with an indicator HighMinority st j replacing HighPoverty st j .
    Table 4 displays the results from estimating equation (2), where the outcome is either the average quality
(columns 1­3), the 10th percentile of quality (columns 4­6), or the 90th percentile of quality (columns 7­9).
We examine each outcome separately for all teachers, elementary school teachers, and secondary school
teachers. All columns include all state-by-year controls (as in column 7 of Table 2) except that regressions
in panel A do not include the continuous measure of the fraction of students qualifying for free lunch,
and regressions in panel B do not include the continuous measure of the percent of minority students, as
these features are controlled for separately with the binary variables HighPoverty st j and HighMinority st j .
Appendix Table A10 shows results that are nearly identical using an alternative specification with a full set
of state-by-year fixed effects; this is feasible because in this analysis we have two observations (high-poverty
vs. low-poverty) in many state-by-year cells, unlike in equation (1).
   48
      Relative to our main analysis in Section 5.1, this approach should yield two observations per state-year pair as opposed to one.
In practice, the percent of students qualifying for free lunch is constant within some state-year cells, and this leads to only a single
observation in these cells in our aggregated state-by-year-by-poverty-status data. Another reason we end up with less than double
the number of observations from our main analysis is that NCES does not allow reporting data from a cell size smaller than 3. Our
minimum cell size at the state-by-year level is 6, and when split into high-poverty vs. low-poverty observations, this cell size shrinks
to 3 except in cases where more than half of the observations in a state-by-year cell have the same value for the percent of students
qualifying for free lunch. In these cases, to comply with reporting requirements, we drop any state-by-year-by-poverty-status cell
with fewer than 3 observations. In the empirical analysis in Appendix Table A10, these cases are absorbed through the inclusion of
state-by-year fixed effects. This same reasoning applies when we consider high- vs. low-minority observations.

Notes: Table presents heterogeneous effects of licensing stringency on teacher quality, estimated from equation (2). Each observation in the
underlying regressions is a state-by-year-by-poverty-status cell (for panel A) or a state-by-year-by-minority-status cell (for panel B). The outcome
is the mean (in columns 1­3), 10th percentile (in columns 4­6), or 90th percentile (in columns 7­9) of teacher quality. High Poverty and High
Minority are indicators of whether the cell contains high-poverty districts or high-minority districts within a given state and year, and "Str." stands
for stringency. Each column in each panel represents a separate regression. Columns 1, 4, and 7 show results for all teachers; columns 2, 5, and 8
restrict to elementary school teachers; and columns 3, 6, and 9 restrict to secondary school teachers. All regressions include all controls from the
preferred specification (column 7 of Table 2). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **:
p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.


     To interpret the coefficient on the interaction term, note that, if the main effect of stringency is positive,
then a negative interaction means that high-poverty or high-minority districts benefit less from increased
stringency. On the other hand, if a main effect of stringency is negative, then a negative interaction implies
that these districts suffer more from increased stringency. The majority of estimated effects for the interaction
terms in Table 4 show negative point estimates, and we cannot reject the possibility of meaningful negative
interaction effects, offering weak evidence consistent with the possibility that vulnerable districts may not
benefit from increased licensing stringency as much as affluent or white-dominated districts (and may even
be harmed). However, none of these potential disparate effects are statistically significant. Importantly, for
the left-tail effect on secondary school teachers (column 6), the total effect of stringency (the combination
of the S tringency main effect and the interaction effect) is positive and statistically significant even for high-
poverty and high-minority districts. The total effect is 0.12 (with a t-statistic of 2.51) for high-poverty
districts and 0.106 (with a t-statistic of 2.09) for high-minority districts, suggesting that even these districts


                                                                          31
benefit from increased stringency. Together with our main findings in Sections 5.1­5.3, we view the results
in Table 4 as suggesting that increases in licensing stringency lead to a statistically significant improvement
in the left tail of the secondary school teacher quality distribution without leading to any detectable harm to
high-poverty or high-minority districts.49
        We conclude this section by examining whether increased licensing stringency has any negative impact
on the diversity of teacher supply as measured by the teacher race. We are motivated by previous findings in
the education literature that certain forms of teacher certification requirements may have negative impacts on
the entry of minority teachers, as well as by mixed findings in the broader occupational licensing literature
showing both negative and positive effects of stricter licensing for minorities (see Section 1). If our key
finding that stricter licensing tends to raise the lower tail of quality is accompanied by decreased teacher
diversity, this benefit may be questionable, especially given that previous studies have demonstrated positive
benefits of minority teachers on students (Gershenson et al. 2016).

Notes: Table presents the effects of licensing stringency on teachers' racial composition, estimated from a two-way fixed effects model similar to
equation (1). Each observation is a state-year cell. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different regression and each row represents a different
outcome: the fraction of black, Asian, Hispanic, and non-white teachers in each state-year cell. The coefficient before S tringency is reported.
Column 1 shows results for all teachers, column 2 restricts to elementary school teachers, and column 3 restricts to secondary school teachers. All
regressions include all controls from the preferred specification, as in column 7 of Table 2. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and
reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.

        Table 5 presents the effects of licensing stringency on teachers' racial composition, estimated from a
two-way fixed effects model similar to equation (1) but with the outcome variable replaced with the fraction
of black, Asian, Hispanic, or non-white teachers in each state-year cell. We find a significant positive impact
of increased stringency on the fraction of Hispanic elementary school teachers. The effect size, about 0.013­
0.017, is economically meaningful given that the average fraction of Hispanic teachers is 0.07 (see Table
1).50 Importantly, we find no significant negative effects of increased stringency on minority participation.
    In Appendix E we extend this analysis to examine effects on the quantity of teachers.
   49

    This result differs from the negative effect on the fraction of Hispanic teachers documented in Angrist and Guryan (2008),
   50

potentially due to the fact that we focus on different years and on a different measure of licensing stringency.


                                                                         32
These results, together with those in Table 4, suggest that the increases in licensing requirements captured
by our stringency measure lead to increases in the left tail of teacher quality without significantly negatively
affecting potentially marginalized subgroups of students or teachers.


5.5     Other Dimensions of Licensing Requirements

As highlighted in Section 3, our stringency measure is the first component from the principal factor analy-
sis on all 37 certification dimensions, and places the most weight on requirements of academic coursework
(math, English, social science, natural science, and humanities). This first component explains much more of
the overall variance in licensing requirements than does each of the subsequent components (see Appendix
Figure A6, panel B). Here we examine how the second and third components from the principal factor anal-
ysis relate to the quality distribution. As a rough, partial characterization, the second factor loads heavily on
special training requirements (nutrition, special education, computer education, health/drug/alcohol train-
ing) and performance evaluation, and the third factor loads heavily on certification exams (see Appendix
Figures A4­A5).

Notes: Table presents the preferred specification (corresponding to column 7 from Table 2) but with the stringency metric replaced with the second
factor (in columns 1­3) or third factor (in columns 4­6) from the principal factor analysis. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different
regression and each row to a different outcome. Columns 1 and 4 use all teachers, columns 2 and 5 use elementary school teachers, and columns 3
and 6 use secondary school teachers. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and
***: p < 0.01.


      In Table 6, we apply our main regression analysis using the second factor (in columns 1­3) or third
factor (in columns 4­6) of licensing stringency. While the confidence intervals are large enough that we
cannot reject substantial effects on the distribution, none of the estimates allow us to reject a zero effect at
the 0.05 level.51 This null result suggests that the interesting and effective variation in teacher certification
   51
      While some effects in Table 6 show statistical significance at the 0.10 level, Appendix Table A11 shows that this marginal
significance is dependent on whether state-by-year controls are included, unlike the results in Table 2 using the main stringency
measure.



                                                                        33
requirements--the variation that truly affects the composition of teachers--consists primarily of the course-
work factors weighted heavily in our primary stringency measure. This result also has important policy
implications: if compliance with these other certification requirements burns real resources (for teachers,
government agencies, and teacher preparation programs) without affecting the distribution of teacher quality,
the effectiveness of these requirements is particularly questionable.


6    Discussion and Conclusion

Our key empirical finding is that stricter licensing requirements lead to a significant increase in the left tail of
teacher quality for secondary school teachers. This finding arises in a two-way (state and year) fixed effects
model, and we demonstrate that this finding is robust to the inclusion of a number of different state-by-year
controls for student and school characteristics, the labor market in and out of the teacher market, political
conditions, and a variety of education-related policies. We also find evidence, in a staggered-adoption event
study, that our results are not driven by differential pre-trends in states adopting stricter licensing. Fur-
thermore, we find that this increase in the left tail is not accompanied by negative effects for marginalized
subgroups of students (high-minority or high-poverty districts) or negative effects on teacher diversity. Inso-
far as policymakers are interested in raising the left tail of the distribution of teachers' academic ability--and
policy discussions over many decades suggest they are--our findings suggest that increases in teacher li-
censing stringency may be effective.
    Our model offers a framework for explaining these empirical findings, as well as for other findings in the
literature and policymakers' reactions to concerns over teacher quality. In particular, our model demonstrates
that stricter licensing will lead to a weak increase (i.e., an increase or no change) in the left tail of quality and
a weak decrease in the right tail of quality. The model demonstrates moreover that these effects can lead to a
result where the average quality--the focus of some previous empirical studies on teacher certification--can
be relatively unaffected, despite shifts in the tails.
    While our study focuses on only one notion of quality--the impressiveness of a teacher's academic
qualifications--the empirical framework we introduce is amenable to other measures of quality. We have
made our raw certification requirement data publicly available, and one contribution of our analysis is to
highlight the precise natural experiments that have occurred (i.e., those states that have increased or de-
creased their stringency) during this time frame. A natural next step would be to apply our methodology
using different teacher quality metrics, such as parental satisfaction or teacher value-added. However, col-
lecting data on these other dimensions of quality across states and across time would be a costly endeavor,
as these measures are typically only available within a single state.


                                                         34
    We see our contribution of examining the tails of the quality distribution rather than just the average as
a key idea for the study of teacher certification laws as well as occupational licensing laws more broadly.
These laws are ostensibly intended primarily to weed out low-quality candidates from a given profession (or
prevent low-quality service outcomes). Evidence of regulatory effectiveness is therefore likely to be found
in how these laws affect the left tail of the quality distribution rather than how they affect the average.

A       Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1

Proof. Denote the two distinct roots of f (r, qi ) as qL (r ) < qH (r ), i.e., f (r, qL (r )) = f (r, qH (r )) = 0. Note that
                                                                                                       

qL and qH can differ from qL and qH ; the former are roots on the real line and can lie outside of [0, 1], while
        

the latter are the lowest and highest worker types who choose to become teachers, where worker types have
support on [0, 1]. When a positive mass of workers choose to be teachers, we have qH (r ) > 0 and qL (r ) < 1
                                                                                                   

The strict concavity of f (r, qi ), which follows by Assumption 1, implies that f (r, qi )  0, qi  [qL (r ), qH (r )]
                                                                                                              

and f (r, qi ) < 0, qi       [qL (r ), qH (r )]. Define qL (r ) = max{qL (r ), 0} and qH (r ) = min{qH (r ), 1}. Then
                                                                                                     

0  qL (r) < qH (r)  1. All workers with qi  [qL (r), qH (r)]  [qL (r ), qH (r )] choose to become a teacher and
                                                                         

the rest do not, proving the first part of the proposition.
                                                              f (r, qL (r ))          f (r, qH (r ))
    For the second part of the proposition, note that                        > 0 and                 < 0. Implicitly
                                                                  qi                      qi
differentiating f (r, qL (r )) = 0 with respect to r and using the chain rule yield


               f (r, qL (r ))    f (r, qL (r )) qL (r )
                                                           qL (r )     f (r, qL (r ))  f (r, qL (r ))
                                                                                              
                              +                         =0         =-                /                > 0.
                   r                 qi          r          r              r               qi

Similarly, implicitly differentiating f (r, qH (r )) = 0 with respect to r and rearranging, we have


                                     qH (r )     f (r, qH (r ))  f (r, qH (r ))
                                                                        
                                             =-                /                < 0.
                                      r               r              qi

Thus, qL strictly increases with r and qH strictly decreases with r . When qL > 0, we must have qL = qL and
                                                                                                      

qL strictly increases with r. When qH < 1, we must have qH = qH and qH strictly decreases with r .

    If instead qL = 0, then qL , the lower root, is less than zero, and hence qL will be weakly increasing in r

rather than strictly increasing. And if qH = 1, then qH , the upper root, is greater than 1, and hence qH will

be weakly decreasing in r rather than strictly decreasing.

Proof of Proposition 2

Proof. For this proof, we only need to show that the mean-preserving property is satisfied for some parametriza-
                                                   r
tion of the model. We consider here c(r, qi ) =        for some finite  > 0, which satisfies Assumption 1.
                                                1 + qi
This cost function is only one example satisfying this property. Other examples can be derived as well, as
long as c(r, qi ) is such that f (r, qi ) can be written as a quadratic equation q2 + bq
                                                                                      ~ +c       ~ does not depend
                                                                                         ~ where b
on r.
    Let  be small enough that some workers choose to become teachers. The two real roots of f (r, qi ) are


                                                             41
                                    w-1
symmetrically distributed around        :
                                     2

                            w-1         (w + 1)2 - 4r        w-1              (w + 1)2 - 4r
                     qL =       -                     , qH =     +                          .
                             2               2                2                    2

Consider some parameterization (w, r, ) such that the model yields a support of quality distribution satisfy-
ing 0 < qL = qL < qH = qH < 1. Then it follows that qL + qH = w - 1. By Proposition 1, because qL > 0
                   

and qH < 1, a small increase in r will result in a strict increase in qL and a strict decrease in qH , but these
                                                                w-1
support points will still be symmetrically distributed around          . If the distribution of qi is symmetric,
                                                                   2
the change in r will result in a mean-preserving contraction of the quality distribution.

Proof of Proposition 3

Thus, qH will decrease weakly more in the low-paying district than in the high-paying district.
    To see that the sign of the differential effect on qL is ambiguous, consider first the cost function c(r, qi ) =

                                                        42
  r                                             (r, w) = w - 1 - (w + 1)2 - 4r
       , where  > 0. We can solve for q    as q                                . The cross-derivative with
1 + qi                                   L      L          2          2
respect to w and r is
                            2 q L (r, w)
                                          = -(w + 1)((w + 1)2 - 4r)-3/2 < 0.
                               rw
In this case, qL will increase weakly more in the low-paying district than in the high-paying district.
         Now consider the cost function c(r, qi ) = r(1 - qi )2 , where  > 0. When qL  [0, 1], we can write it as

follows:52                                                          
                                                         1          1 + 4r(w - 1)
                                        qL (r, w)   =1-    -                      .

The cross-derivative with respect to w and r is

                                      2 qL (r, w)
                                                  = 2(w - 1)(1 + 4r(w - 1))-3/2 .
                                        rw

                    2 q L (r, w)
Consider w > 1, so               > 0. In this case, qL will increase weakly less in the low-paying district than
                       rw
in the high-paying district.


B         Teacher Attrition and Estimated Licensing Stringency Effects

As outlined in Section 5, our estimation approach relies on a state-by-year panel from 1991­2007 formed
using four different SASS survey years by grouping together teachers who started teaching in the same
year and same state (and who thus faced the same requirements when initially licensed). For example,
observations for the year 1993 in our state-by-year panel correspond to teachers who are in their first year
of teaching when observed in the 1993 SASS survey; observations for 1999, 2003, and 2007 similarly
contain first-year teachers. Observations for years 1992, 1998, 2002, and 2006 in our state-by-year panel
correspond to teachers observed in a SASS survey in their second year of teaching. Forming our dataset
in this fashion could potentially lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect of licensing stringency if
teachers of different quality levels differ in their likelihood of exiting the profession. If this is the case,
differences in the quality distribution may be driven in part by teacher attrition. We offer a simple theoretical
description of this potential bias here and demonstrate that it does not appear to be an issue in our empirical
analysis.
         We consider a comparison of two states for simplicity, which we refer to as states A and B, where A has
a lower level of licensing stringency than B. We examine the quality difference between a cohort of teachers

The object ,1 measures the difference in the th percentile in states A and B solely due to the difference in
licensing stringency faced by the teaching cohort when initially entering, whereas ,2 measures differences
due both to the direct effect of licensing stringency and to attrition. The difference between ,1 and ,2
thus measures a potential bias introduced by comparing teachers observed in their second year rather than
their first, given by

This expression in (4) implies that the bias will be zero if the attrition rate is constant across percentiles of
quality (i.e., if a = a) or if the upper boundary of the support of the distribution is unchanged by the licensing
  53
     We treat attrition as a function of q as the same in both states.
  54
     Lankford et al. (2002) offers some evidence of teacher attrition being higher for teachers with greater earnings potential, and
Wiswall (2007) builds this feature into his model. Other studies also offer evidence suggesting that pursuit of a higher-salary option
is one of the main reasons why teachers leave the profession (Kirby et al. 1999; Prince 2003; Hanushek et al. 2004).

thus ,2  ,1 , meaning that using experienced teachers to measure the effect of higher stringency would
potentially overstate the actual effect of the policy on the th percentile for newly entering teachers (biasing
the estimate toward more positive numbers).

In (5), the bias will be zero if the attrition rate is constant across percentiles or if the left boundary of the
                                                      B = qA ). If, instead, a > a, we have 
support is unaffected by the policy change (i.e., if qL    L                                ,2 > ,1 if and only
    B > qA , and 
                  ,2 < ,1 if and only if qL < qL . By Proposition 1, we expect higher stringency to lead to
if qL                                     B    A
         L
 B  qA , and thus 
qL   L             ,2  ,1 , meaning again a potential bias toward more positive numbers. Thus, for upper

percentiles, where Proposition 1 suggests that higher stringency would result in a drop in quality, estimation
using experienced cohorts may understate the quality decrease. These arguments extend immediately to
other cohorts beyond first- and second-year teachers: the more years a cohort has been teaching, the more
biased an estimated effect can be toward positive numbers.
     Our empirical analysis in the body of the paper entails some experienced-cohort comparisons such as
those described above. These comparisons do not introduce bias if the attrition rate is relatively constant
across the quality distribution. We now examine this empirically by modifying equation (1) to include
an interaction of S tringency with the number of years a teacher cohort has been teaching when observed
in a SASS survey. The results are shown in Table A1. The specifications in panel A interact stringency
with a linear trend denoting the number of years teaching for a given cohort, and the results in panel B
interact stringency with dummy variables for the number of years teaching. The columns are as in Table 4,
   55
      By extension, this bias will be small if the attrition rate does not differ much across the quality distribution (i.e., a is close to a)
                                                                                                                B
or if the upper boundary of the support of the distribution does not change much under the policy (i.e., qH       is close to qAH ).

Notes: Table presents heterogeneous effects of licensing stringency on the teacher quality interacted with the number of years a teacher cohort has
been teaching when observed in SASS data. This is estimated by modifying equation (1) to include a linear interaction with the number of years a
cohort has been teaching in panel A, and with dummies for the number of years teaching in panel B. "Str." stands for stringency. Each column in
each panel corresponds to a separate regression. The outcome is the mean (in columns 1­3), 10th percentile (in columns 4­6), or 90th percentile
(in columns 7­9) of teacher quality within the cell. Columns 1, 4, and 7 show results for all teachers; columns 2, 5, and 8 restrict to elementary
school teachers; and columns 3, 6, and 9 restrict to secondary school teachers. All regressions include all state-by-year controls, as in column 7 of
Table 2. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.


with columns 1­3 showing effects on average quality, columns 4­6 showing effects on the 10th percentile,
and columns 7­9 showing effects on the 90th percentile. For each outcome, we display the results for all
teachers, elementary school teachers, and secondary school teachers separately. All regressions include all
state-by-year controls from our preferred specification (column 7 of Table 2).56
        In both panels, we do not observe any significant differences across cohorts for the effects of stringency
on the secondary school teacher quality distribution (columns 3, 6, and 9). We cannot rule out the possibility
that the effect of stringency on the left tail for secondary school teachers when measured using second-year
teachers is twice as large as that of first-year teachers (the main effect in panel B, column 6 is 0.126, and the
coefficient on the interaction of stringency with the second-year teacher cohort is 0.127). However, the point
estimates for the other interaction terms in column 6 of panel B are negative, as is the interaction term in
column 6 of panel A, and the confidence intervals do not rule out the possibility that the effects are the same
   56
     Note that panel A does not include a main effect for the linear trend for the number of years teaching and panel B does not
include a main effect for the indicators of the number of years teaching, as year fixed effects absorb these main effects in both cases.
In panel B, the omitted years-teaching category dummy is that of first-year teachers.


                                                                         46
across cohorts. We also find that the estimated coefficient on S tringency for the left tail of the secondary
school teacher distribution is similar to our primary results in Table 2. We therefore do not find evidence
that the potential teacher-attrition bias outlined above is driving our primary results. Column 2 of panels A
and B demonstrate that the effect of stringency on average quality for elementary school teachers, on the
other hand, is statistically significantly larger for more experienced cohorts (and column 1 of panel B shows
that this differential spills over into a differential for the all-teachers sample in the most experienced cohort),
consistent with potential teacher-attrition bias. We do not find these results for elementary school teachers
concerning for our main results, as we do not find robust results for elementary school teacher effects in our
analysis in the body of the paper.

cell in the table corresponds to a different regression and the coefficient before S tringency is reported. Column 1 shows results for all teachers,
column 2 restricts to elementary school teachers, and column 3 restricts to secondary school teachers. Standard errors are clustered at the state
level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.


     An issue that is distinct from the discussion above is that the attrition rate as a function of quality may
potentially vary across states. If this is the case, states may have different trends in the th percentile of qual-
ity solely due to attrition across cohorts. This is not problematic for our empirical approach unless changes
in the quality distribution due to attrition coincide systematically with changes in licensing stringency. The
event study design in Section 5.3 tests for this possibility, as it tests whether pre-trends in quality across
cohorts are different in treated vs. non-treated states. As another test, Table A2 replicates column 8 of Table
2 but controlling for linear state-specific cohort trends (the years teaching of a given cohort), rather than a
state-specific time trend across all years 1991­2007 as in Table 2. We find similar results to those in Table
2, consistent with cross-state variation in attrition rates not being the driver of our findings.

C       Technical Details of de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020)

A number of recent studies have demonstrated that a traditional event study--i.e., replacing S tringency st in
equation (1) with a vector of leads and lags of year-by-year changes in stringency, potentially with some pre-
treatment and post-treatment years aggregated into bins--is problematic in two-way fixed effects settings.
These studies include Borusyak and Jaravel (2017), Athey and Imbens (2018), Goodman-Bacon (2018), Sun
and Abraham (2018), Callaway and Sant'Anna (2019), and de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020). The
key takeaway from this literature is that a traditional event study is a weighted average of average treatment
effects across state-by-year cells, with potential negative weights, which can lead to incorrect estimates
and inference. These studies offer alternative proposals for aggregating treatment effects in ways that do
not suffer from this negative-weight critique and that are robust to heterogeneous treatment effects. Some
of these recent proposals also address possible ways to incorporate state-by-year covariates (e.g, Sun and
Abraham 2018 and de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille 2020), but these approaches are not yet developed
enough to handle a large number of controls such as we have in our preferred specification. We adopt
the primary event study design proposed by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) (DCDH), which
effectively controls for state and year fixed effects but no other state-by-year controls. In this sense, this is a
pure event study, comparing only the differences in outcomes between states that change treatment vs. those
that do not change in particular pairs of years.


C.1      de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020) Event Study

We consider here a binary treatment with a staggered adoption design (meaning that, for a given state, the
treatment status only changes monotonically and at most once over time), which is the case in which DCDH
obtain their most powerful results. Following the notation of DCDH, let g  {1, ..., G} denote a group and
t  {1, ..., T } denote time.57 Dg,t is the treatment and Yg,t is the outcome of interest. In our setting, g is
a state, t is year, Dg,t is licensing stringency, and Yg,t is some moment of the quality distribution within a
state-year cell. Let Ng,t denote the number of observations in group g and period t. Let Di,g,t , Yi,g,t (0), and
Yi,g,t (1) denote the treatment status and the potential outcomes without and with treatment of observation i
                                                                                                                                     Ng,t
in group g at period t. Let Yi,g,t = Yi,g,t (Di,g,t ) denote the realized outcome. Define Dg,t =                              1
                                                                                                                             Ng,t    i=1     Di,g,t ,

homogeneous, so Di,g,t = Dg,t , i.
       Let NS =       (g,t):t2Dg,t Dg,t-1   Ng,t . For t  {2, ..., T } and d, d  {0, 1}2 , let Nd,d ,t denote the number of
observations with treatment d at period t - 1 and treatment d at period t, or Nd,d ,t =                                g:Dg,t =d,Dg,t-1 =d    Ng,t .

     Note that DCDH use the term group differently from Chetverikov et al. (2016a): in the Chetverikov et al. (2016a) nomenclature,
a group is a state-by-year cell, whereas in DCDH a group is a state. For this section we follow the DCDH use of the term.

    The t = 0 estimates in Figure 6 in the body of the paper correspond to estimates of DIDM . Given that a
change in a group's treatment status may affect the outcome for more than one period, the researcher may
be interested in not only the treatment effect at the period when the group receives treatment (t = 0), but
also the lasting effects at later periods (t > 0). The DCDH estimator estimates these dynamic effects through
comparing the changes in outcomes from t - 1 to t + 1 in groups that switch and do not switch treatment
between t - 1 and t.58

The dynamic estimator for other periods can be defined similarly. The t > 0 estimates in Figure 6 in the
body of the paper correspond to these dynamic effect estimates.
    Similar to the standard two-way fixed effects model, the consistency of DIDM relies on the common-
trends assumption, as it uses groups whose treatment is stable across two periods to infer the trends that
would have affected switchers if their treatment status had not changed. This assumption could fail if
switchers experience different trends than groups whose treatment is stable. To test the validity of the
common-trends assumption, the authors propose the following placebo estimator that compares the changes
in outcomes from t - 2 to t - 1 in groups that switch treatment and in groups that do not switch treatment
between t - 1 and t, analogous to the pre-period placebo tests in a standard event study analysis, but adapted
to the DIDM estimator.

the common-trends assumption (and other conditions detailed in their paper), E(DIDM ) = 0, and thus this
placebo estimator can be used to evaluate the validity of the common-trends assumption. The t < 0 estimates
in Figure 6 in the body of the paper correspond to these placebo effect estimates.




                                                                           50
C.2      Diagnostic Tests from de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020)

In the body of the paper, we use a two-way fixed effects estimator as our main approach because it allows
us to increase power by pooling across years following changes in stringency rather than only estimating
a treatment effect at the time of a stringency change, which is what the DIDM (t = 0) estimator captures.
The two-way fixed effects regression (written here with no state-by-year controls, for simplicity) is Yg,t =
 + g + t +  f e Dg,t +        g,t , where 
                                             fe   is the coefficient of interest. The first-difference regression is Yg,t = t +
 f d Dg,t +     g,t ,   where Yg,t = Yg,t - Yg,t-1 , Dg,t = Dg,t - Dg,t-1 , and  f d is the coefficient of interest. DCDH
show that ordinary-least-squares estimates of ^ f e or ^ f d can be written as a weighted sum of the treatment

effects in each group and time, with some of these weights potentially being negative. If the treatment
effect is constant across groups and time, it can be identified under the standard common-trends assumption.
However, if the treatment effect is heterogeneous across groups or time, both ^ f e and ^ f d can potentially

be negative even if all group-time treatment effects are in fact positive, due to these negative weights. The
authors suggest two diagnostic exercises to evaluate whether potential heterogeneity in treatment effects is
indeed problematic in a given application.
     The first test compares the two-way fixed effects estimator, ^ f e , to the first-difference estimator, ^ f d.

The authors demonstrate that this comparison serves to test whether the weights attached to these estimators
are uncorrelated with the treatment effect in treated cells (testing Assumptions 7 and 8 in DCDH). If ^ fe

and ^ f d are not significantly different, treatment-effect heterogeneity may be present without biasing ^ f e . In

Table A3 we compare the two estimators for our main robust findings from the paper (the left-tail effect for
secondary school teachers). We find that the two estimators do not differ substantially and their confidence
intervals overlap, consistent with treatment-effect heterogeneity not being problematic for our main findings.

Notes: Table compares the two-way fixed effects estimator and the first difference estimator. The estimates show the effect of licensing stringency
on the left tail of the quality distribution for secondary school teachers. All regressions include state and year fixed effects. Columns 1 and 2
include no additional controls. Columns 3 and 4 include all state-by-year controls, as in our preferred specification. Columns 1 and 3 show the
fixed effects estimator, corresponding to the specification from columns 1 and 7 of Table 2, Panel C, Row 2. Columns 2 and 4 show the
first-difference estimator. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***:
p < 0.01.

       The second test quantifies the degree of treatment-effect heterogeneity that would invalidate the esti-
mated treatment effect. The authors define  f e as the minimal value of the standard deviation of the average
treatment effects across treated cells that is compatible with the true average treatment effect being zero.
This quantity can be calculated as the ratio of the absolute value of ^ f e divided by the standard deviation of

the weights. We compute this quantity in our preferred specification for the left-tail effect among secondary
school teachers. We find that  f e is 0.116, suggesting that treatment-effect heterogeneity would need to be
quite large (compared with our point estimate of ^ f e , 0.140) in order for the true average treatment effect to

be zero even though the two-way fixed effects estimator yields a significant estimate of 0.140.
       The authors also define  , which is the minimal value of the standard deviation of the average treat-
                                     fe
ment effects across treated cells that is compatible with all treatment effects being of a different sign than
^ f e . If this measure is close to 0, then ^ f e and the true average treatment effect in the treated cells can

be of opposite signs even under a small and plausible amount of treatment-effect heterogeneity, indicating
that treatment-effect heterogeneity would be a serious concern for the validity of the two-way fixed effects
estimator. On the contrary, if this measure is large, ^ f e and the true average treatment effect in the treated

cells can be of opposite signs only under an implausible amount of treatment-effect heterogeneity. We find
that           = 0.570 in our preferred specification for the left-tail effect among secondary school teachers, much
          fe
larger than the point estimate of ^ f e . We see these tests as suggestive evidence that potential treatment-effect

heterogeneity does not invalidate our main two-way fixed effects design.59


D        Exploring Variation in Stringency

In this section, we estimate a number of univariate regressions. In each regression, we regress licensing
stringency on one state-level or state-by-year-level variable. In any regressions with state-by-year variation,
we also include state and year fixed effects. We view this analysis as exploratory, informative only about
possible correlates of licensing stringency. For each right-hand-side variable we analyze, we divide the
variable by its standard deviation in order to put the variables on a similar, interpretable scale in Figure A1.
       In panel A of Figure A1, we explore historical (pre-1991) or contemporary (1991) correlates across
states of the level of stringency in 1991, the first year in our sample. For this analysis, we collect a number
of variables related to early progressive movements or teacher certification requirements within a state. The
indicator for whether a state is an early adopter in requiring teachers to have a high school degree comes
from data collected by Law and Marks (2009); for some states, this happened more than 100 years ago.
We first find the median year across states that have a year recorded for the adoption of this law in Law
  59
       We find similar values of  f e (0.102) and  (0.531) when we examine the specification from column 1 of Table 2.

state granted women voting rights prior to the 19th Amendment from six different internet archives.60
       We also explore cross-state variation in education conditions and demographics, including the percent
of people with a high school degree in 1990 (from NCES)61 and the percent change in student enrollment
(from CCD data used in the body of the paper) and teacher supply (from CCD data used in Appendix
E) from 1987­1990. The party winners in that state for the 1988 and 1992 presidential elections come
from Wikipedia. These are coded similarly to other political variables used in the body of the paper (see
Appendix G). The last two variables in panel A are the state's legislature party and governor party from
Klarner (2013a,b), averaged within a state across years from 1983 to 1990.
       The majority of the coefficients in panel A are insignificant, demonstrating no detectable relationship
between these factors and states' level of licensing stringency in 1991. The growth of student enrollment in
the late 1980s is significant and is negatively correlated with stringency in 1991. This is consistent with the
possibility that states may decrease stringency in response to increases in teacher demand (due to increased
quantities of school-age children). While insignificant, the point estimates on political party variables are
negative, as are the point estimates on early women's suffrage and the number of historical normal schools,
suggesting that states with more Democratic or progressive leanings tend to have lower stringency in 1991.62
We observe no correlation between the 1980s growth in teacher supply and the 1991 level of stringency. We
examine possible pre-trends in teacher supply more thoroughly using an event study design in Appendix E.
       In panel B of Figure A1 we analyze the correlation between teacher union strength and stringency, which
Kleiner and Petree (1988) suggest may be positively related. We employ five measures of union strength
constructed via a detailed procedure described in Appendix A of Northern et al. (2012). These are cross-state
measures aggregated from many different data sources collected by Northern et al. (2012) between 2000 and
2011, with many of these data sources coming near the end of our sample period (2007). In panel B, we
examine how these union strength measures correlate with state-level stringency in 2007, the last period in
our sample. We find no significant relationship between any of these metrics and our licensing stringency
measure.
       Panels C and D offer an analysis using panel data, with each estimate corresponding to a regression of
stringency on a single variable of interest and on state and year fixed effects. In panel C, we analyze the

relationship between stringency and various measures of the teacher market from SASS survey data: the
fraction of teachers in the union, median earnings of teachers with a bachelor's degree, median earnings of
teachers with a master's degree, median earnings of public school teachers, and median earnings of private
school teachers. In this panel, we limit our analysis to SASS survey years only (1993, 1999, 2003, and
2007); thus, these results correspond to correlations for the teachers who appear in SASS surveys in their
first year of teaching. We find no significant relationship between any of these teacher-market measures and
stringency.
         In panel D, we use all states and years, with one exception: the variable pension contribution, collected
from Public Plans Data, contains state-by-year data on state pension plans for teachers only from 2001
onward and only for 32 states.63 All other variables are available for all state-year cells used in our main
analysis. The log of the number of teachers comes from CCD and is also used in the analysis in Appendix
E. All other variables in panel D are described in the body of the paper and are included as controls in the
preferred specification in Section 5. In Panel D of Figure A1, we find no significant relationship between
these variables and licensing stringency other than a significant negative relationship between stringency
and the indicator that the governor is a lame duck, suggesting that lame-duck governors (those who are in
states with term limits and who are in their final term) are less likely to increase licensing requirements than
non-lame-duck governors.


E         Teacher Supply

Table A4 displays results from a regression of the log of the number of teachers in a state-year cell (from
CCD) on licensing stringency.64 We find a significant negative effect of -0.03 in column 1, which controls
only for state and year fixed effects, consistent with the idea that stricter licensing can decrease teacher
supply, as in the model in Section 2. The point estimate is smaller and no longer significant in column 2
when additional state-by-year controls are included. Note that the outcome in these regressions is the log
of the total number of teachers (as this is the only teacher quantity variable available in the CCD database),
rather than only first-year teachers--those who would directly be affected by changes in initial licensure
requirements. This feature of the data may mute the effects of licensure on teacher quantity and makes the
available data less ideal for focusing on quantity effects than on quality effects.
         Figure A2 repeats this analysis using the DCDH event study design similar to Figure 6, but where the
outcome is the log of the number of teachers. The results in states moving from low to high stringency

    Given that this outcome is based on the actual number of teachers in a state-year cell in the CCD data, not a SASS survey
measure, we do not use SASS sampling weights in the regressions reported in this section, and we use only non-SASS controls.
This yields 867 state-by-year cells rather than 857, as the minimum cell size applied to the SASS data no longer applies.

(panel B) show no significant pre-trend in teacher supply prior to changes in stringency. States moving from
high to low stringency (panel A), on the other hand, do show a potential pre-trend: supply appears to be
higher in these states 2­3 years prior to their decrease in stringency. This suggests that these treated states
may have been on a decreasing supply trend relative to other states, which could be a driver in the decision
to decrease stringency. Importantly, our primary event study results (Figure 6) suggest that pre-treatment
changes in supply do not lead to significant pre-trends in quality.

Note: Figure shows the results of the staggered adoption event study following the method proposed in de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille
(2020), with the outcome variable being the log of the number of full-time equivalent teachers in a state-year cell. "Treatment" is defined as a
change from high to low stringency in the left panel and from low to high stringency in the right panel. 95% confidence intervals are shown with
dashed lines, computed from 200 bootstrap replications, with clustering at the state level.


     In Table A5, we replicate the high- vs. low-poverty and high- vs. low-minority analysis from Section
5.4 using the log of the number of teachers as the outcome. Our motivation for this analysis is the possibility
that high-poverty or high-minority districts may suffer differentially from teacher shortages in response to
increases in licensing stringency. The CCD database records data at the school level for every state and year
on the percent of students qualifying for free lunch and on the percent of minority students (but provides no
identifiers for linking this to SASS data). We aggregate this school-level data to the district level and, as in


                                                                           56
Section 5.4, we construct above-median and below-median indicators for the poverty and minority status of
district observations within a state-year cell. We then aggregate data to the state-by-year-by-poverty-status
level and the state-by-year-by-minority-status level.
     Column 1 of Table A5 includes only state and year fixed effects, column 2 includes all non-SASS state-
by-year controls from the preferred specification, and column 3 includes state-by-year fixed effects, which
is feasible because we generally have two observations in a given state-by-year cell in this regression. In
both panels A and B of Table A5, the point estimates for the interaction effects are negative in all specifica-
tions, consistent with the possibility that high-poverty and high-minority school districts experience a larger
decrease in supply than less-vulnerable districts. In column 2, which corresponds most closely to our main
specification in the body of the paper, the 95% confidence interval on the interaction effect for high-poverty
districts rejects decreases of more than 0.2 log points or increases of more than about 0.11. The correspond-
ing confidence interval for the high-minority interaction term is (-0.23,0.15). In all cases, the confidence
intervals on interaction terms also contain zero.

F     Cross-State Mobility

Teachers are required to satisfy the licensing requirements in the state in which they are working, and it is
possible that changes in licensing stringency may affect the state in which teachers choose to work. For
example, college students planning to become teachers may choose a state in which to teach based on the
ease of states' licensing requirements. This type of cross-state mobility could potentially alter the teacher
quality distribution in a treated state (one that increases stringency) as well as in a control state (one that
leaves stringency unchanged). For example, suppose two states are initially equivalent--in stringency level,
teacher pay, quality distribution, and any other aspect--and suppose one of these states (call it the treated
state) increases its stringency and the other doesn't, and labor is mobile across states. Some potential
teachers at the upper-tail and lower-tail may be driven out of teaching in the more-stringent state and become
teachers in the less-stringent state, widening the distribution in the less-stringent state, and making the
relative comparison of the distribution of quality between the treated state and untreated state even starker.
This suggests that part of the effects we measure in the body of the paper may be driven by such cross-state
moves.
    We can analyze this issue empirically in two ways. First, we can examine whether licensing stringency
affects the fraction of teachers working in a different state than the one in which they attended college. We
can construct this fraction in each state-year cell using the SASS data. We find this fraction to be 23% on
average, suggesting that most teachers teach in the same state in which they attended college. Treating this
23% level as the natural level of in-migration for teachers, we then examine whether this fraction changes
systematically when a state increases its licensing stringency. In panel A of Table A6, we show results from
regressions analogous to those in equation (1) but with this fraction being the dependent variable. We find
no significant effects of stringency on the fraction of teachers teaching in a given state who did not attend
college there, and the confidence intervals are small enough to rule out meaningful effects.
    Second, we examine the frequency of the in-migration of teachers into a given state who were previously
teaching in a different state. The SASS data suggests that such moves are very rare to begin with: only 2%
of teachers report having taught in a different state in the previous year. In panel B of Table A6, we use this
fraction as our dependent variable and we use the stringency in the SASS survey year as the right-hand-side
variable of interest.65 We find negative point estimates that are statistically significant, consistent with the
possibility that in-migration is indeed reduced when a state increases licensing restrictions.
    In panel C, we examine whether states with higher in-migration rates differ in their teacher quality
   65
      We use the survey-year stringency because a state's licensing requirements in the survey year are those that a newly arriving
teacher would need to satisfy. Similarly, for any non-SASS controls in this regression (such as controls coming from the CPS), we
use the values corresponding to those in the corresponding SASS survey year.



                                                               58
distribution. Here we use regressions similar to those in equation (1) but with the fraction of movers into the
state (from panel B) as the right-hand-side variable of interest rather than stringency. Note that the estimates
in panel C represent the effect of this fraction changing from 0 (no movers) to 1 (100% of teachers being
movers). To interpret these changes in terms of percentage points, the estimates must be divided by 100.
For example, the point estimate on the 10th percentile in column 3 suggests that an increase of 1 percentage
point in the fraction of movers (which corresponds to a 50% increase in the move rate relative to the mean)
is associated with an increase of 0.005 standard deviations in the left tail of quality for secondary school
teachers. This number is small and is also statistically insignificant. We also find no significant relationships
in other specifications in panel C. Thus, while a state's stringency level does indeed appear to affect the
rate of in-migration of teachers, it does not appear to affect the distribution of quality. Given these results,
and given that the fraction of teachers who cross state borders after they begin teaching is small to begin
with, we do not think cross-state migration in response to stringency changes poses a major problem for the
interpretation of our main results.

Notes: Panels A and B present the results of equation (1) where the left-hand-side variable is the fraction of teachers working in a state different
from their undergraduate institution in panel A and the fraction of teachers teaching in a different state than they taught in last year in panel B.
Panel B uses stringency in the survey year as the right-hand-side variable of interest. Panel C shows regressions with the same outcomes as in
Table 2 but with the right-hand-side variable of interest being the fraction of teachers in a state-year cell who taught in a different state in the
previous year. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different regression. Column 1 shows results for all teachers, column 2 for elementary school
teachers, and column 3 for secondary school teachers. All regressions include all state-by-year controls, as in the preferred specification (column 7
of Table 2). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.


     This finding is consistent with a number of other papers that have demonstrated that teachers do not
tend to move across state lines. Strauss et al. (2000), studying Pennsylvania teachers, document that 80% of
teachers work within 70 miles of where they attended college, and 40% teach in the precise district where


                                                                        59
they attended school as a child. Goldhaber et al. (2015), studying teachers in Washington and Oregon,
demonstrate that teachers are very unlikely to travel across states, and they argue that this may be attributable
to pensions structures (i.e., teachers have already invested in a given state's pension program) or to state
licensing requirements that teachers have already invested in satisfying in their current state (Kim et al. 2017
offer similar findings). This latter argument would suggest that, if anything, stricter licensing requirements
in a given state would be expected to reduce cross-state mobility, consistent with other findings in the
occupational licensing literature more broadly (Johnson and Kleiner 2017). One study (Hirsch 2001) does
document a case of teachers moving across state borders for higher pay (moving from Oklahoma to Texas
in 1999).


G     Additional Details on Data Construction

Table A13 lists the sources for each of the 37 teacher licensing requirements for each year. The table
demonstrates that data on some of the 37 certification requirements are missing in some years; additional
requirements beyond the 37 we focus on are also recorded in some manuals but are missing for more years.
For any of the 37 requirements with missing data in 1991 (which only applies to two of the 37 requirements),
we fill in these missing requirements with the next available year. We fill in any other missing requirement-
year cells with the most recent year's information. Note that when data is available for a given requirement
in a given year, it is always available for all states. Table A13 also displays the mean and standard deviation
of each requirement, computed by taking the mean and standard deviation within each state over time and
then averaging over states.
    The Bartik labor demand variable is constructed as follows. For state s and year t, this variable is given
                 1
by Bs,d(t)    100,000   k   L sk gkd , where L sk is industry k's share of employment in state s in 1990 and gkd is the
national wage growth rate of industry k from decade d - 1 to decade d. The notation d(t) denotes the decade
surrounding year t. Therefore, this Bartik measure varies by decade within a given state: for all years from
1991­2000, the Bartik variable is set to the 1991­2000 decade value, and for years from 2001­2008, the
Bartik variable is set to the 2001­2008 decade value. Data for constructing this variable come from the 1990
and 2000 U.S. Census IPUMS data and the 2006­2008 American Community Survey (Flood et al. 2020).
    The Klarner (2013a,b) data is coded as follows: for the executive branch, 0 = Republican, 1 = Demo-
cratic, and 0.5 = Independent or other. For the legislative branch, 0 = Republican control of both houses;
0.25 = Republican control of one house, split control of the other; 0.5 = Democratic control of one house,
Republicans control of the other; 0.75 = Democratic control of one house, split control of the other; 1 =
Democratic control of both houses. The Klarner (2013a,b) data, as well as the collective bargaining data,


                                                            60
do not contain information on Washington, D.C.; we manually collect these variables for D.C., primarily
from Wikipedia, where we consider the mayor as the executive branch and the Council of the District of
Columbia as the legislative branch.

Notes: Figure shows the results of the staggered-adoption event study following the method proposed in de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille
(2020), with the outcome variable being the average quality (in panel A) or the 90th percentile (in panels B and C) of teacher quality among
secondary school teachers within a state-year cell. "Treatment" is defined as a change from high to low stringency in panels A and B, and from low
to high stringency in panel C. 95% confidence intervals are shown with dashed lines, computed from 200 bootstrap replications, with clustering at
the state level.

Notes: Table reports most coefficient estimates from column 7 of panel A of Table 2. The full set of unemployment rate controls is omitted to save
space. Each column represents a different regression, where the outcome is a different statistic of the distribution: the mean (column 1), the 10th
percentile (column 2), or the 90th percentile (column 3). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *:
p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.

Notes: Table reports most coefficient estimates from column 7 of panel B of Table 2. The full set of unemployment rate controls is omitted to save
space. Each column represents a different regression, where the outcome is a different statistic of the distribution: the mean (column 1), the 10th
percentile (column 2), or the 90th percentile (column 3). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *:
p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.

Notes: Table reports most coefficient estimates from column 7 of panel C of Table 2. The full set of unemployment rate controls is omitted to save
space. Each column represents a different regression, where the outcome is a different statistic of the distribution: the mean (column 1), the 10th
percentile (column 2), or the 90th percentile (column 3). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *:

Notes: Table presents heterogeneous effects of licensing stringency on the teacher quality, estimated from equation (2) but with state-by-year fixed
effects included. Each observation in the underlying regressions is a state-by-year-by-poverty-status cell (for panel A) or a
state-by-year-by-minority-status cell (for panel B). The outcome is the mean (in columns 1­3), 10th percentile (in columns 4­6), or 90th percentile
(in columns 7­9) of teacher quality within the cell. High Poverty and High Minority are indicators of whether the cell contains high-poverty
districts or high-minority districts within a given state and year. "Str." stands for stringency. Each column in each panel corresponds to a separate
regression. Columns 1, 4, and 7 show results for all teachers; columns 2, 5, and 8 restrict to elementary school teachers; and columns 3, 6, and 9
restrict to secondary school teachers. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and
***: p < 0.01.

Notes: Table presents the baseline specification (corresponding to column 1 from Table 2, where only state and year fixed effects are included) but
with the main stringency metric replaced with the second factor (in columns 1­3) or third factor (in columns 4­6) from the principal factor
analysis. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different regression and the reported coefficient is the effect of licensing stringency. Columns 1 and
4 use the all-teachers sample, columns 2 and 5 use elementary school teachers, and columns 3 and 6 use secondary school teachers. Standard
errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *: p < 0.10, **: p < 0.05, and ***: p < 0.01.

Notes: Table presents the equivalent of columns 1 and 7 from Table 2 but using only state-by-year cells with at least 10 teacher observations in the
SASS micro data. Each observation is a state-year cell. Each row represents a different statistic of the distribution: the mean, the 10th percentile,
or the 90th percentile. Each cell in the table corresponds to a different regression and the reported coefficient is the effect of licensing stringency.
Columns 1­2 show results for all teachers. Columns 3­4 restrict to elementary school teachers and columns 5­6 restrict to secondary school
teachers. All regressions include state and year fixed effects. Columns 1, 3, and 5 include no additional controls. Columns 2, 4, and 6 include all
additional state-by-year controls (as in column 7 of Table 2). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. *:

Notes: Panel A displays a local quadratic regression fit between average earnings (in 2007 dollars) six years after entering college (vertical axis)
and average SAT score of admitted students (horizontal axis). An observation is an undergraduate institution observed in collegescorecard.ed.gov
data. Panel B, referred to as a scree plot, shows the eigenvalues of each factor from the principal factor analysis of the teacher licensing
requirements. Panels C and D show histograms of the effect of licensing stringency on the 10th percentile of teacher quality for secondary school
teachers, estimated from equation (1), leaving out one state at a time. Panel C regressions use only state and year fixed effects and panel D
regressions include all controls from the preferred specification.

     Notes: Table shows the sources for the raw teacher certification requirements for all states for each year. Cells with three numbers or a number followed by a letter (e.g., "B4" or "157") indicate the table
     from a physical NASDTEC manual (from 1991, 1994-95, 1996-97, 1998-99, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004) or online cached versions of these manuals from 2006­2007 (NASDTEC Knowledgebase
     2006­2007). Note that NASDTEC only produced one manual biannually from 1994­1999. Cells with a letter indicate the corresponding code from a physical Teacher Certification Requirements manual
     (Goddard 1993 or Boydston 2005­2007). Cells with "DOE" indicate data from the U.S. Department of Education Secretary's Sixth Annual Report on Teacher Quality (Duncan and Madzelan 2009). We
     also consulted AACTE (1990, 1991, 1993­1996), Boydston (1995-1999, 2001­2010), Goddard (1983­1993), and other reports from the U.S. Secretary of Education. Cells with "NA" (or years not shown,
     namely 1992) indicate that no information is available for that year. The second-to-last column reports the mean of the requirement dummy across all states and year, and the last column reports the
     average, across states, of the within-state standard deviation over time.
