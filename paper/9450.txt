                                           ABSTRACT


       After outlining characteristics of Japan's distribution sector, a comprehensive international
comparison of it to those of other nations is presented and analyzed for underlying differences. This
leads to an explanation of Japan's retail store density, which is then related to the structure of

wholesale channels. Next, some details on the Large Store Law of Japan and regulatory distortion,
including empirical evidence on its extent are offered. Data on the structure of the retail sector by

store format and on differences among prefectures in density and format are then presented.

        Japan's distribution sector employs about one-sixth of the nation’s labor
force and accounts for around one-eighth of GDP, large enough to matter for any
economy-wide assessment of barriers to growth and efficiency. Moreover, the phrase
“inefficient distribution” has been repeated so many times in reference to Japan
that one might suppose the evidence of gross distortion is overwhelming. It is not.
        Certainly regulatory limits on large stores have had an effect on the numbers
of stores of differing formats, but the undeniable peculiarities of Japan’s
distribution sector can be explained by fundamentals: car ownership, size of dwelling,
and geography. Accounting for such fundamentals explains much of the variation in
retail density between Japan and other countries, as well as across prefectures within
Japan. Moreover, changes in these factors can be related to changes in the structure
of retailing.1
        This paper does three things. First, it compiles facts on the state of
Japan's distribution system and puts them in historical and international context.
This includes an explanation of retail store density and its relation to wholesale
channels. Second, the chapter describes the logical framework behind the still widely
held view that regulation, in particular the Large Store Law (repealed in 2000), is
the key determinant of the structure of Japan’s distribution system, and derives
some testable predictions about what this implies. Third, it provides new evidence
on whether the testable predictions are true. This includes looking at differences
among prefectures and over time in retail density and format.


1   Characteristics of Japan’s Distribution Sector

The peculiarities of Japan’s distribution sector include the myriad of small stores
and lack of large stores, multiple wholesale steps, and ubiquity of vertical
restraints. Some relevant data are in Table 1.
         In the late 1990s Japan had 11 stores per thousand inhabitants, almost twice
the US, and four times the UK, levels. The typical US supermarket in 2000 was almost
five times the size of a Japanese equivalent, which was not quite the size of two
basketball courts. Many stores in Japan are family enterprises with even smaller floor
space. The average number of workers per store in Japan is half the US figure.
         Fragmentation of the retail sector in Japan is accompanied by long and complex
wholesale marketing channels. This is evident in several statistics. Japan’s
distribution sector employment is disproportionately concentrated in wholesaling
compared to the United States, and the fraction of wholesalers’ revenue from sales
to other wholesalers is much higher in Japan.
         Finally, the ubiquity of manufacturer-imposed pricing rules, customer
assignments, and stipulations of exclusivity can be judged from the large fraction
of wholesalers reporting participation in manufacturer-initiated “distribution
keiretsu”: 45% in 1992, although this is down from 70% in 1986 (Chusho-kigyo-cho
1994, p 180 table 9). No direct comparison with the United States can be made, but
such practices frequently run afoul of US antitrust laws and thus undoubtedly are
less widespread.

  Other investigators who argue that factors besides regulation are important in discussions of
Japan's distribution system include Nariu (1994), Maruyama et al (1991), and Miwa and Ramseyer (2002).

2   International Perspective

This section presents a comprehensive comparison of Japan’s distribution sector with
those of other nations. Table 2 depicts statistics for OECD countries on density of
retail stores, employment per store, and value-added and employment in wholesaling
and retailing.
         The countries are listed in ascending order of stores per thousand inhabitants
in the mid 1990s. Japan is in the bottom third of the list, having moved up since
1982 when it had 14.3 stores per thousand.
         A simple index of the average productivity of labor employed in the
distribution sector relative to the average productivity of labor in the overall
economy can be obtained by dividing the share of distribution sector value-added in
GDP by the share of distribution sector employment in the total labor force. Countries
with higher standards of living (relatively high GNP per person in PPP units) tend
to have wider discrepancies in average labor productivity between distribution and
other sectors. (The United States is a regression outlier, but Japan is not). This
has a simple interpretation: it reflects the generally slower pace of technical change
in services compared to manufacturing, something first noted by William Baumol.2
         Japan’s index stands at 0.69, which is below the 0.75 average for all the
countries. This is expected, given high standard of living. (The United States does
not fit the pattern; its index of 0.92 is above the international average.) The upshot
is that the variation in the index across countries probably is more reflective of
international differences in average productivity of manufacturing than of
distribution.
         Countries with lower standards of living tend to have more stores per person,
and smaller average store size (measured as average employment per store). The
association many have made between Japan’s ubiquity of small stores and economic
backwardness is based on this pattern.


3   Explaining Retail Store Density

There are two broad types of economic model for explaining the overall density of
retail stores, those that presume the density of stores attains the economic optimum
but without explicitly modeling how prices are set, and those that presume the density
of stores is the maximum consistent with positive profits given some explicit model
of pricing by firms. Flath (1990) and Matsui and Nariu (2001) adopt the social
optimality approach. Heal (1980) and Gabszewicz and Thisse (1986) model pricing
explicitly and presume free entry.
         The comparative statics of store density are qualitatively the same for both
types of model. A proliferation of stores shifts some costs of storing and transporting
goods from households to the distribution sector.


2
  A simple OLS regression of the natural logarithm of the labor productivity index (for 1996-97)
on the natural logarithm of GNP per person measured in purchasing power units (for 1998) is:
ln (Index) =       4.1 - 0.45 ln (GNP per person in PPP units)
(t-stat = -3.8); number of observations = 20; R2 = 0.44.
        Thus, it is appropriate to base empirical analysis of international variation
in retail density on factors associated with the costs of transporting and storing
goods of both households and firms. This is exactly the approach taken by Flath and
Nariu (1996) using data from the early 1980s. Here that exercise is repeated with
more recent data.
        Table 3 presents data on some variables associated with the costs and benefits
of a proliferation of stores for various OECD nations, mostly from around 1996. The
variables are proxies for things that affect the relative efficiency of households
and firms at storing and transporting goods.
        Crowded living space (CRWDNG) increases willingness to pay a premium to shop
nearby. Car ownership (CARS) lowers household costs of shopping, and thus lowers the
premium. The more urbanized an economy (URBAN), then, for any given expansion in the
number of stores per person, the smaller the effect on the average distance between
stores and residences, and so, the smaller marginal benefit from proximity. If a nation
is geographically compact (LENGTH) like Japan, rather than dispersed over half a
continent like the United States, the added costs of restocking a multiplicity of
stores is reduced. A proliferation of trucks (TRUCKS), and the infrastructure of
roads that make it worthwhile to use trucks, lowers the added costs of restocking
a multiplicity of stores as opposed to a smaller number of larger ones.
        Table 4 shows that all of these contribute to the cross-country variation
in number of stores per person in the expected way. The estimates in the first two
columns include as an explanatory variable the average number of persons per room,
a proxy for the dearness of household storage space. This variable is available only
for some of the countries. Excluding it, and thus enlarging the sample, narrows the
standard errors of estimates of the other coefficients. This possibly reinforces
confidence that the results are qualitatively valid.
        Japan is not a regression outlier. Stores per thousand persons predicted by
regressions excluding Japan are 11.8 with crowding and 11.7 without, statistically
indistinguishable from the actual value of 11.3. These results very much resemble
those obtained in Flath and Nariu (1996) for a slightly different set of countries
using data from around 1980.
        The conclusion remains that Japan’s relatively high density of retail stores
is due to its paucity of private cars, confined household living space, geographic
centricity, and super-abundance of trucks.
        All of this pointedly leaves regulation out of the picture. Partly this
reflects the lack of a suitable proxy for regulation that can be included in the
regression equation. But it also reflects a judgement that regulation is a corollary
of economic variables like the ones already in the equation. I return to this point
later.


4   Wholesale Channels

The focus so far has been on the density of stores. A related issue is the extent
to which Japan's complex wholesale marketing channels are induced by its high retail
store density, as opposed to reflecting some idiosyncrasy.
        Proliferation of stores induces branching of logistical arteries to economize
on transport costs. Such branching does not by itself imply a multiplicity of
wholesale steps, but would seem to lower the costs of a profusion of wholesalers.
        Evidence suggests Japan’s high retail density and wholesale complexity are
intertwined. Nariu and Flath (1993) construct estimates of the average number of
steps in matched wholesale industries of Japan and the United States for the early
1980s. Besides confirming that Japanese wholesale channels have on average more
steps (1.8) than US ones (1.4), we also showed that the variation in number of steps
across wholesale marketing channels is highly correlated between Japan and the United
States, and for consumer products is also related to the relative density of stores.3
        In other words, there are common influences operating on the length of
wholesale channels in both countries. Also, the number of wholesale steps in Japan
is greater for products (such as food) that have particularly many retail stores
compared to the United States. This suggests that Japan’s elephantine wholesale
sector is to some extent due to its proliferation of stores.


5   The Large Store Law

The regulation that bears most directly on the density of retail stores in Japan is
the Large Store Law. It is the essential reason why Japan, at least historically,
has far fewer department stores and general merchandise super stores, and far more
of most other kinds of stores, per person than the United States. McCraw and O'Brien
(1986) were early recognizers of this.
        Bureaucratic obstacles have been placed on establishment of large stores
since the Department Store Act of 1937. Suspended in 1947 but reinstated in 1956,
it required approval of the national government for the opening of new department
stores anywhere in Japan. In 1974 the Large Scale Retail Store Law replaced the
Department Store Act. It made the extent of floor space, rather than the nature of
the store, the criterion for necessitating approval. The cut-off was 3000m2 in the
largest cities and 1500m2 everywhere else. At the time, almost all stores larger than
the cut-offs were department stores. In 1978 the law was completely revamped to
broaden coverage to include all new stores over 500m2, which meant it would apply to
many grocery stores.
        The process of securing approval to open a large store was torturous,
typically requiring two years or longer. The process, directed by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), involved hearings before local panels that
included owners of existing stores that would suffer if the proposal was approved.
The panels tended either to recommend against approval or propose restrictions on
the hours or days the store could operate. In many cases they proposed such onerous
requirements as requiring offering of classes in cultural activities such as
calligraphy or floral arrangement at prices that did not cover costs. MITI tended
to adopt these recommendations and proposals. Larke (1994) offers further detail
on the process.
        Unsurprisingly, following adoption of the 1978 amendments, applications to


3
  In Nariu and Flath (1993, p 94 table 6-3) we present an OLS regression.
Number of steps in Japanese wholesale industry =
0.30 +
0.60 (number of steps in matching US wholesale industry) +
0.09 (stores per household in Japan divided by stores per household in
in the US for retail category corresponding to the wholesale industry).
(t-stat = 4.1), (t-stat = 3.3); number of observations = 24; R2=0.57.
open new stores dropped to a trickle: in 1984 there were fewer than 500.
         In 1989, the US government identified the Large Store Law as a "structural
impediment" to the sale of US-made consumer products in Japan, arguing in negotiations
with Japan for repeal or relaxation of the law. Japan responded first by amending
the law in 1992 to shorten the process for reviewing applications then, in 1994, by
raising the cut-off to 1000m2, which is about one fourth the size of the typical US
grocery store.
         As shown in Table 5, the number of large stores in operation did increase
after 1994. However the overall number remains low compared to the United States.
In 1997 there were only around 24,000 stores in all of Japan larger than 1000m2.
         In May 1998, the Diet replaced the old law with a new one (actually with three
new laws) that place details of the regulation of large stores under control of
prefectural governments but mandates that they consider only environmental factors
such as noise and traffic, not any economic harm to incumbent owners of small stores.
The line between environmental factors and economic ones is sufficiently fuzzy that
some prefectures may actually enact more severe restraints than existed under the
previous regime (though I consider this unlikely). Other prefectures may remove the
restraints on large stores altogether.


6   Regulatory Distortions

Regulatory distortions definitely exist in Japan’s distribution sector. Table 6
summarizes them.
         The sparseness of large stores clearly is the result of regulations.
Restricting the number of large stores may have had a secondary, distorting effect
on Japan’s foreign trade insofar as imported consumer products until the 1990s were
mostly products more effectively distributed through large, upscale department stores
such as Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya.
         The multiple wholesale steps and disproportionately large employment in
wholesaling may in large part also be a secondary effect of the proliferation of small
stores, and thus an indirect result of regulatory protection of small stores. For
example, Nariu and Flath (1993) offer a regression equation linking multiplicity of
wholesale steps and proliferation of stores.
         Regulations regarding inward foreign direct investment (FDI) may have had
a relatively large effect on distribution. A disproportionately large share of FDI
in Japan (and elsewhere) is in wholesaling. Japan’s vanishingly small stock of
inward FDI in comparison with the United States and EU has been linked to Japanese
government restrictions relaxed around 1980.              The relative absence of
foreign-affiliate wholesalers in Japan could inhibit competition and protect
inefficient domestic incumbent producers and distributors. (For a close investigation
of FDI in Japan’s wholesale industry and its effects on import penetration, see Flath
2001.)
         Enforcement also matters. Vertical restraints are often presumptively in
violation of the antimonopoly law of Japan, but they nonetheless appear to be
widespread. Penalties for violations are notoriously weak and the resources devoted
to enforcement are quite parsimonious.
         Large stores do not necessarily compete only with small ones: they also
complement them, perhaps offering agglomeration economies. In other words, there
are possible negative effects on small stores from regulatory limits on large ones.
Empirical analysis is needed here.

6.1 Evidence Regarding Regulatory Distortion

As a first pass at assessing whether the distorting effects of these regulations might
be significant, consider some data from McKinsey Global Institute (2000). The authors
construct estimates of value-added per hour of labor across stores of different kinds
in Japan and the United States in the mid 1990s. They conclude that traditional
“papa-mama” stores in Japan have lower average labor productivity than do large
stores in Japan and that they account for a disproportionately large share of total
labor input compared to the United States (Table 7).
         Overall average labor productivity in Japan’s retail sector is only about
half that of the United States. Closing that gap would increase Japan’s GDP
measurably. How much? Here is a rough calculation. Suppose, for the sake of argument,
that only regulatory barriers limit the number of general merchandise stores and
supermarket groceries, and that eliminating those barriers would double the labor
hours that each group employed in 1997 (to roughly match the US pattern), shifting
workers from traditional stores. Also suppose that as this occurred, value-added
in traditional stores fell in proportion to the withdrawal of labor, while value-added
in other stores remained unchanged as wages displaced their profits. Each year this
would eliminate a deadweight loss equal to about 0.25% of Japanese GDP.4
         Now suppose further that as a result of the changes in retailing, Japan’s
wholesale sector also evolved to more resemble US wholesaling in terms of labor
productivity. Employment would fall by 2% to 4% of the labor force, freeing millions
of workers for employment elsewhere in the economy.
         If this thought experiment holds any validity, the distortions afflicting
Japan’s distribution sector are enormous. But the calculation is highly suspect.
         Set aside the obvious difficulties in measuring labor hours and productivity
in small, family-operated stores. The calculation accepts that any differences
between Japan and the United States in allocation of labor across store types and
between the retail and wholesale sectors are wholly the result of distortions and
could be eliminated by an act of government policy. If this were true, then large
stores of Japan ought to be immensely profitable. They are not. The bankruptcies
of the Sogo department store chain and MyCal supermarket chain are reminders of this
fact.

6.2 Vehicle Inspections

Although the analysis to follow suggests that the distorting effects of the Large
Store Law may have been less than often supposed, it also indicates that regulations
not specifically focused on that sector may have a distorting effect. Regulations
that unnecessarily or wastefully increase the cost of owning and operating a private

4
  If labor hours in general merchandise stores and supermarkets doubled from the 1997 levels with
no change in value-added (as wages displaced profits), value-added per hour would fall by half in
each. The deadweight loss thus eliminated equals the area of a Harberger triangle with right sides
equal to the initial labor hours and half the initial value-added per labor hour. In other words,
the recovery of deadweight losses amounts to about 25% of initial value-added: 0.25(2.2+3) = 1.3
trillion yen, which is around 0.25% of Japan’s GDP.
car indirectly favor small stores over large ones by enhancing household willingness
to pay for proximity to stores.
         Japan does indeed have such a regulation, the requirement that private car
owners submit their vehicles to comprehensive inspections every two years beginning
with the car’s third year on the road. These vehicle inspections (shaken, in
Japanese) are made unnecessarily expensive by the limited number of shops licensed
to conduct them and by the onerous requirement that numerous working parts be replaced
if an older car is to pass (Beck 1993). This is widely cited as the reason why the
average vehicle age in Japan is 5.8 years compared to 8.3 years in the United States,
and the average annual mileage per car in Japan is only about half that of the US
(JETRO 2002).
         As recently as 1990 Japan had a mere 291 cars per thousand persons. As a first
pass at assessing whether increasing car ownership may have run its course, consider
a simple regression of cars per thousand persons on GNP per person in purchasing power
units, using 1998 data. The predicted value for Japan is 450.1, while the actual number
is 395.1. The 12% difference is not statistically significant.5
         My guess is that a further dramatic increase in car ownership in Japan is
unlikely, but a lagged response of retail structure to the past increase in car
ownership may still play out over the coming decade and beyond.


7   Retail Formats

Japanese statistics define eight store formats (Table 8). Format is determined by
whether a store is self-service and by the mix of merchandise it offers in three broad
categories (clothing, food, and living (jun-kanren)).
        Large stores are primarily department stores, general merchandise super
stores, and specialty super stores. Similarly, these formats tend to be large stores.
The essential difference between general merchandise super stores and department
stores is that the former are self-service stores while the latter are not.
        Table 9 provides time-series on the numbers and average scale of stores in
each format. Note the 1997 changes in the definitions of specialty super stores and
convenience stores. Before 1997, the specialty super store category included stores
larger than 500m2, which meant they were all subject to the Large Store Law. Then,
stores as small as 250m2 were reclassified from other super stores to specialty super
stores if their product-mix concentration met the specialty requirement. This tripled
stores in the category. Department stores and general merchandise super stores have
decreased in number from 1997 to 1999, their travails documented in numerous news
accounts.
        There is no category for small family-owned stores as such: most are either
specialty or semi-specialty stores. Two-thirds of them are sole proprietorships.
Only 5% of specialty super stores are sole proprietorships and no large stores is.
        Between 5% and 10% of specialty and semi-specialty stores are contained within
the premises of large stores (that is boutiques within larger stores). The total


5
  The log linear OLS regression is:
ln (cars per thousand) =
-2.9 + 0.9 ln (GNP in PPP units) - 0.13 (dummy equal to one for Japan)
(t-stat = 6.6) (t-stat = 0.5); number of observations = 26; R2 = 0.65.
number of such stores (not themselves large but, contained within the premises of
ones that are large) has remained around 100,000 since 1991.
        Table 10 shows the time-series for composition of total sales across the types
of store. These data reflect the same trends in numbers of stores.

7.1 Influences on the Number of Stores by Format

The Large Store Law has limited the number of stores with large floor space. Almost
all of these are department stores, general merchandise super stores, or specialty
super stores. The law also ought to have induced increased numbers of stores of other
formats. These include small family-owned, non-self service stores that are mostly
classified as specialty stores or semi-specialty stores. Our next task is to measure
these effects.
        In measuring the effect of regulatory change on the number of stores, it is
necessary to control for changes in other factors influencing retail density. These
include increasing ownership of passenger cars, increasing average space per person
in dwellings, and declining population density in cities as the suburbs expand.
Increasing car ownership favors evolution towards a retail sector with fewer, larger
stores. Declining population density per se has the opposite effect on retail density
but is probably itself an inevitable accompaniment of the move toward car ownership
and larger dwellings.       All three trends can be placed under the heading
"suburbanization". Tables 11, 12, and 13 document them.
        More living space means that storage space is less constrained, enabling
households to shop less frequently for daily necessities and to maintain larger stocks,
eroding the value to households of proximity to stores selling nondurables. The
effect of larger, less crowded dwellings on the numbers of stores selling durables
is possibly the opposite, leading to more such stores. But stores selling nondurables
such as food and daily necessities are more numerous than the ones selling durables
such as furniture.
        As population density becomes less, the marginal benefit to households of
a proliferation of stores becomes greater. This effect arises because, as households
are more diffuse, any given number of stores per household entails a greater average
distance from each household to the nearest store, and the reduction in that distance
with each given increase in number of stores becomes correspondingly greater. See
Flath (1990) for an algebraic treatment of this phenomenon. The point here is that
the gradual decline in average population density that has accompanied the
proliferation of cars and increased spaciousness of dwellings has possibly in and
of itself slowed the push towards fewer, larger stores in Japan.


8   Results from Analyzing Prefectural Differences

Regulatory effects should vary among prefectures because, although a national statute,
the Large Store Law was implemented through locally administered advisory panels in
each municipal jurisdiction. To measure these regulatory effects, I ran a set of
regressions (detailed in Box 1). The results are in Table 14.
Box 1 Prefectural Regressions
To explain the numbers of stores per person of different kinds, I ran OLS regressions
using data for each of Japan’s 47 prefectures from five consecutive Census of Commerce
of Japan (1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, and 1997). The dependent variable is the natural
log of the number of stores per 1000 persons. There is a different equation for each
different format of store and for all stores.
         The independent variables are the same in each equation and as in Matsui and
Nariu (2001) include a dummy variable for each prefectures. I do not report the
estimates of coefficients on these dummies.
         The independent variables of interest include the natural logs of the three
variables being discussed, observed for each prefecture: passenger cars per 1000
persons, dwelling floor space per person, and 1000 persons per km2 in densely inhabited
districts. To further control for the diffusion of population, I included the
fraction of each prefecture’s population residing in densely inhabited districts.
It was necessary to log linearly interpolate between, or extrapolate from, housing
census years and population census years respectively. Annual data are available
for passenger car registrations.
         The natural logarithms of the number of Class 1 large stores and of Class
2 large stores are included to measure the severity of regulation of large stores.
So, for example, after 1994, large stores with floor space between 500m2 and 1000m2
were automatically approved by MITI, but in the Census of Commerce these were still
classified as “large stores”.

        An examination of the first column estimates in Table 14 reveals that car
ownership and urban population density have influenced the overall density of stores
in the expected way.        Disappointingly, size of dwelling has not exerted a
statistically significant effect on overall density of stores (nor a coherent effect
on numbers of stores of particular formats).
        The number of Class 1 large stores (floor space of 3000m2 or more, except in
the central parts of major cities where it is 6000m2 or more, and a proxy for regulation)
has no measurable effect on the overall number of stores. However, the density of
Class 2 large stores (those that are not class 1, and another proxy for regulation)
is, as expected, inversely related to the overall number of stores. Possibly this
reflects the much greater temporal variation in the number of Class 2s than in Class
1s (shown in Table 5).
        All of the variables, including the number of Class 2s, have inelastic effects
on the overall number of stores. Over the period 1985-97 the number of Class 2s grew
about 5% per year, while the overall number of stores shrank about 1.1%. Given the
estimated elasticity of overall number of stores with respect to number of Class 2s
of -0.10, expansion of these large stores by itself accounts for a little less than
half of the constriction in overall number of stores.
        Relaxed regulation is a contributing factor to reduction in number of stores,
slightly less important than increasing car ownership. The inelasticity of overall
number of stores with respect to number of (Class 2) large stores (=-0.10) generally
argues against regulatory limits on large stores as being in any way crucial in
explaining the proliferation of small stores.            For example, quadrupling or
quintupling the number of class 1 and class 2 stores would roughly match the density
of such stores per person in the United States, but based on these estimates would
still not dramatically reduce the overall number of stores in Japan.
         If regulation mattered greatly, one would expect that in prefectures where
the large store law was more loosely applied, overall retail density would be
dramatically smaller than elsewhere. This does not appear to have been the case.
         Fundamentals, including those embedded in the prefecture by prefecture fixed
effects, account for far more of the variation in overall density of stores both across
prefectures and over time than does the regulatory-determined number of large stores.
         The influences of the regulation variables and car ownership on density of
stores of each format further instill confidence in the economic model underlying
the specification and the interpretation of results just offered. The positive
influence of the regulation-determined number of Class 1 large stores on the number
of department stores is evident, as is the positive influence of the number of Class
2 large stores on the number of general merchandise super stores and specialty super
stores. This comports with the fact that most of the department stores have very
great floor space and so are in Class 1.
         Car ownership is generally undercutting specialty stores and semi-specialty
stores and promoting convenience stores, department stores and self-service (that
is, super) stores of all kinds. The very large and positive influence of increasing
car ownership on the number of convenience stores may be an important reason for their
recent very rapid growth.
         The size of the effect of car ownership on overall number of stores shown
in Table 11 (elasticity=-0.17) is quite a bit less than in the cross-country regression
of Table 4 (elasticity =-0.3) (The larger coefficient estimate, -0.6, from Table 4
is perhaps biased by exclusion of the variable CRWDNG pertaining to size of dwelling.)
There is a simple explanation for this: The regulatory limit on the number of large
stores in Japan is dampening the response of number of stores to increasing car
ownership.
         If this is true, then it suggests a way of quantifying the likely ultimate
effect of deregulation on the overall number of stores: It might be roughly equivalent
to the effect of doubling the responsiveness of overall numbers of stores to increased
car ownership from an elasticity of 0.17 to 0.30. That is, one might expect the
overall number of stores in Japan ultimately to fall by about 15% from its 1997 level
(11.3 per thousand persons) to around 9.6 per thousand.
         The picture that emerges is one that matches the earlier analysis of
international data; regulatory distortions account for little in explaining Japan’s
high density of stores.


9   Conclusion

The Japanese distribution sector certainly exhibits peculiarities. It has vastly more
stores per person than most other rich countries. It also has particularly complex
wholesale marketing channels, with multiple steps and ubiquitous vertical restraints.
This chapter has explored the reasons and found them to relate more to economics than
to regulation. It also has shown how the peculiarities are complementary.
        Scarcity of living space and the inconvenience of owning and operating a car
has enhanced Japanese households' willingness to pay for nearby shopping. Japan's
geographic centricity has facilitated development of a transport system and complex
logistical arteries that lower the costs of continually restocking the many retail
outlets. These factors combine to make a proliferation of stores in Japan not only
inevitable but efficient. Given this, regulations protecting small stores from
competition by large ones (mostly in the form of the Large Store Law and its successor,
the Large Store Location Law) imply only minor economic distortions and encounter
little effective political resistance.        But as car ownership has grown, the
distorting effects of regulations limiting large stores have become greater and
politically less tenable.
         A proliferation of small stores increases the economic advantages of
logistical arteries with many branches, which in turn lowers the costs of a
multiplicity of wholesale steps. The implied ubiquity of retailers and wholesalers
increases the horizontal externalities that arise in promoting and marketing goods
and that are the target of vertical restraints such as customer assignments and
exclusive dealing stipulations. The distortions that are an unwanted consequence
of these sorts of stipulations lead to further manufacturer- and wholesaler-initiated
stipulations on pricing and shipment quantities, which are tolerated by lax
enforcement of antimonopoly laws.
         Some of the fundamental forces accounting for Japan’s proliferation of small
stores are changing. For example, car ownership increased dramatically during the
1990s and the average size of dwelling also is steadily increasing. Probably as a
result, in the 1990s grocery supermarkets and general merchandise super stores
increased in number in Japan even as the overall number of stores steadily declined.
Changes in implementation of the Large Store Law introduced in 1994 and its ultimate
repeal and replacement with the Large Scale Retail Store Location Law in 2000 also
have contributed to changes in the number and composition of Japan’s stores.
         Government policies shape the economy, but the reverse also is true.
Regulations emerge from a political process in which economic forces operate (Becker
1983). In Japan as elsewhere, the economy has shaped regulations, and regulation
has reinforced inherent tendencies rather than fundamentally altered them.
