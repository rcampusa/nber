                                           ABSTRACT

Obesity is associated with serious health problems, and it can generate adverse economic outcomes.
We analyze a nationally-representative sample of young American adults to investigate the interplay
between obesity, wages and self-esteem. Wages can be impacted directly by obesity, and they can
be influenced by obesity indirectly through the channel of obesity to self-esteem to wages. We find
that female wages are directly influenced by body weight, and self-esteem has an impact on wages
in case of whites. Being overweight or obese has a negative impact on the self-esteem of females and
of black males. The results suggest that obesity has the most significant impact on white women’s
wages.

                               Obesity, Self-Esteem and Wages

I.      Introduction

        Starting with the seminal work of Mincer (1974), economists have developed theoretical

models and empirical procedures to investigate the determinants of wages. In addition to the

analysis of the impact of schooling, job tenure and experience, a huge literature investigated the

impact on wages of market characteristics and establishment attributes, ranging from industry

structure to firm-size (Ferrer and Lluis 2008, Guadalupe 2007, Parent 2004, Troske 1999,

Nickell and Wadhwani 1994, Abowd and Lemieux 1993, Main and Reilly 1993, Kruger and

Summers 1988). More recently, economists have identified the importance of non-cognitive

factors in wage determination. These studies are primarily motivated by the fact that a

significant portion of the variation in wages across individuals remains unexplained even after

controlling for human capital characteristics as well as job and industry attributes. For example,

it has been shown that beauty has a positive impact on wages (Mocan and Tekin, forthcoming,

Harper 2000, Biddle and Hamermesh 1998, Hamermesh and Biddle 1994). Mocan and Tekin

(in press) argue that the impact of beauty on criminal activity and wages works partly through

human capital formation while in high school. They provide evidence indicating that less

attractive high school students accumulate less human capital in comparison to their attractive

counterparts, which has an influence on wages and labor market activity later in life, and that the

impact is stronger for females. Persico, Postlewaite and Silverman (2004) demonstrate that taller

workers receive higher wages. This effect can be traced back to their height in high school, and

it can be attributed to the impact of height on participation in high school sports and clubs.

Similarly, Kuhn and Weinberger (2005) show that leadership skills in high school generate

positive wage effects later in life.

                                                  2
         The rate of obesity among children aged 6 to 11 in the United States more than doubled

in the past 20 years, rising from 6.5% in 1980 to 17.0% in 2006. The rate among adolescents

aged 12 to 19 more than tripled, increasing from 5% to 17.6% (Ogden, Carroll, and Flegal,

2008). These epidemic proportions of obesity pose serious social and health problems for both

these children and the society. For example, children who are obese are at greater risk for bone

and joint problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems such as stigmatization

and poor self-esteem (Daniels et al., 2005; U.S. Surgeon General, 2001). About 61% of young

people who are obese have at least one additional risk factor for heart disease, such as high

cholesterol or high blood pressure (Freedman, 1999). Obese young people are more likely than

their normal weight counterparts to become overweight or obese in adulthood, and therefore they

are at greater risk for associated adult health problems, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes,

stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis (U.S. Surgeon General, 2001).1 Because of the

public health significance of the problem, significant effort has been devoted to the investigation

of the causes and consequences of obesity.

        In addition to the health consequences, obesity and overweight are also associated with

adverse economic outcomes, such as lower wages. Although research in this area has not

reported uniformly robust results, the existing evidence indicates that obesity is usually

associated with a wage penalty, especially for white females (Wada and Tekin 2007, Cawley

2004, Baum and Ford 2004, Averett and Korenman 1996). Obesity or overweight may impact

wages through different channels. First, in some occupations obesity may have a direct

detrimental impact on labor productivity. Second, obesity may cause discrimination by


1
 As a result, Healthy People 2010 - a document developed by leading federal agencies to set the health
objectives of the United States for the first decade of the 21st Century - identifies obesity and overweight
as one of the ten leading health indicators. The target is to reduce the prevalence of obesity among
children and adolescents to less than 5% by 2010.

                                                      3
employers or by customers, which may generate a wage penalty even if there was no

productivity difference between obese and non-obese individuals. Third, obesity may lower

productivity through its impact on poor health. Furthermore, as obese individuals tend to be less

healthy the incremental health care costs associated with obese workers may be passed on to

these workers by their firms in the form of lower wages (Bhattacharya and Bundorf 2005).

Fourth, obesity may influence cognitive function, which in turn would impact productivity and

wages. There is recent research which shows that obesity is associated with diminished

cognitive function later in life.2

        Obesity can also impact wages through self-esteem. Mobius and Rosenblat (2006) find

that physically attractive workers are more confident, and confidence impacts wages positively.

If higher self-esteem increases wages, and if obesity impacts self-esteem, then obesity can have

an indirect effect on wages through its impact on self-esteem. As summarized by French, Story

and Perry (1995), the relationship between self-esteem and obesity has not been investigated

using strong research methodologies. Much of the earlier work relied on associations identified

off of cross-sectional and small or non-representative samples. For example, Sallade (1973)

analyzed 120 obese and 120 non-obese children in grades 3, 5, 8 and 11. She found that there

was no difference between obese and non-obese children in terms of social adjustment, but obese

children had poorer self-concept. Wadden et al. (1984) studied 210 obese and normal-weight




        2
           For example, Whitmer et al. (2005) used data on more than 10,000 members of the Kaiser
Permanente medical care program of northern California who underwent detailed health evaluations from
1964 to 1973 when they were aged 40-45. The results showed that obesity is associated with increased
risk of future dementia. Cournot et al. (2006) analyzed more than 2,000 healthy workers aged 32 to 62
years at baseline in 1995 who lived in three southern French regions. In 1996 and 2001 data were
collected, among other items, on cognitive function. The results showed that higher BMI was associated
with lower cognitive function at baseline, and that higher baseline BMI was related to a greater decline in
word-list recall at follow-up, after adjusting for confounding factors.


                                                     4
children in grades 3 to 8, and did not find significant differences in self-concept between obese

and normal-weight children.

       More recently, researchers utilized prospective longitudinal designs to determine the

temporal sequence of obesity and self-esteem. Gortmaker et al. (1993) used a nationally-

representative sample of 10,039 individuals who were 16 to 24 in 1981, and were followed-up in

1988. They could not find a relationship between overweight and self-esteem. Strauss (2000)

analyzed the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and found that the global self-esteem

scores were not significantly different among 9-to-10 year old obese and non-obese children.

However, over a 4-year period obese Hispanic females and obese white females demonstrated

lower levels of self-esteem in comparison to their non-obese counterparts; and small decreases in

self-esteem were observed for boys. Biro at el. (2006) used data on 2,379 girls ages 9 and 10

who were recruited into the National Heath, Lung and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study,

and who were followed to age 22 years. They found that BMI was an important predictor of

self-esteem. Similarly, Hesketh, Wake and Waters (2004) reported that overweight/obesity

precedes low self-esteem in a prospective cohort study of 1,157 elementary school children in

Australia.

       Although conceptually plausible, empirical evidence on the impact of low self-esteem on

the development of obesity in children has not been established convincingly. As described by

Hesketh, Wake and Waters (2004), longitudinal research on the causal impact of self-esteem on

obesity is extremely limited. For example, in a small sample of white children, who were

observed for three years after the baseline assessment, Klesges et al. (1992) reported that self-

esteem did not predict future body fat levels. Along the same lines, Hesketh, Wake and Waters




                                                 5
(2004), found that after accounting for baseline BMI, poorer parent-reported baseline self-esteem

did not predict higher BMI scores at follow-up.

          In this paper we investigate whether obesity/overweight has an impact on the self-esteem

of young adults. We also investigate the extent to which self esteem and obesity influence

wages. Section II describes the empirical specifications employed in the paper. Section III

provides information about the data. Section IV presents the results, and Section V is the

conclusion.



II.       Empirical Specification

The benchmark specification we estimate is of the following form:

          (1)    Si = α+δBi+ Xi β + εi,

where Si stands for a measure of self-esteem for person i, Bi is a measure of obesity, and X

stands for a vector of personal characteristics that may impact self-esteem. As explained in the

data section below, we define self-esteem in a number of alternative ways. Similarly we employ

multiple measures of obesity. Versions of Equation (1) will be estimated using data on young

adults.

          Although research could not identify an impact of self-esteem on body weight for

children, we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse-causality from self-esteem to obesity. To

address this potential confounding, models as depicted by equation (2) below are estimated

          (2)    Si = α+δBi,t-5+ Xi β + εi,

where Bi,t-5 stands for obesity measured 5-to-6 years earlier (baseline obesity). In this

specification, past obesity impacts current self-esteem, but current self-esteem does not influence

the extent of obesity five years earlier.


                                                  6
       Equation (3A) below conjectures that the level of self-esteem in year t (Sit) is determined

by obesity in the past (Bi,t-5), and the extent of obesity in more distant years. If λ<1, then the

influence of past obesity is getting smaller in more distant past.

       (3A)    Sit = α+ πBi,t-5+ λ πBi,t-6+ λ2 πBi,t-7 + λ3 πBi,t-8+…

       Multiplying (3A) by λ and lagging by one period gives

       (3B)    λSi,t-1 = λα+ λπBi,t-6+ λ2 πBi,t-7+ λ3 πi,t-8 +…

       Subtracting (3B) from (3A) and re-arranging the terms yields a formulation where self-

       esteem depends on its lagged value and past BMI.

       (4)     Sit = γ + λSit-1 +πBi,t-5 + ωi

where γ=α(1-λ), and ω captures the impact of very distant obesity. We augment equation (4) by

individual-level control variables. As will be explained in the data section below, self-esteem is

measured five years apart; thus we estimate equation (5) below.

       (5)     Sit = γ + λSi,t-5 +πBi,t-5 + Xi Ω +ηi

Finally, we estimate Equation (6),

       (6)     Wi = μ+φSi+ξBi+ Xi Ψ + νi,

where W stands for the wage rate of the young adult. This specification analyzes the extent to

which self-esteem has an impact of wages, controlling for the impact of obesity. As mentioned

above, models will be estimated using different measures of self-esteem and obesity.

       Convincing causal inference on obesity-wages relationship could be obtained from

analysis of experimental data. However, in this context such data do not exist because it is

obviously unethical to design such an experiment where obesity and self-esteem are exogenously

manipulated. In the absence of an experimental design, potential endogeneity issues can be

addressed in different ways. An instrumental variable that is correlated with the explanatory



                                                       7
variable, but uncorrelated with the outcome variable is one potential solution. However, it is

difficult to find an instrument which is conceptually and empirically feasible. For example, it is

plausible to think of a sibling’s body mass index (BMI) as an instrument for the other sibling’s

BMI as they are likely to be correlated. However, if BMI is influenced by unobserved family,

school and contextual factors that affect both siblings, then one sibling’s BMI might proxy these

factors and therefore would have a direct impact on the outcome (e.g. wages) of the other sibling,

raising questions about the validity of the instrument.

       Other potential instruments of BMI include school-based variables. For example, the

existence of certain school programs and facilities, such as nutrition classes and athletic

facilities, can be thought of as being correlated with the students’ BMI but uncorrelated with

their future economic outcomes. But even in this case it can be hypothesized that children are

not distributed randomly across schools and certain difficult-to-observe family attributes, which

may be correlated with school characteristics, may also have a direct impact on children’s future

wages. Nevertheless we tried school characteristics as instruments for obesity. Unsurprisingly,

the first-stage regressions did not have power, indicating that school characteristic are poor

instruments for obesity in our data set.

       An alternative procedure to control for unobserved heterogeneity that may be correlated

with obesity is to include a large number of control variables in vector X. Following this

strategy, our regressions includes variables such as age, gender, race and ethnicity, education,

health status of the individual, whether the person was born in the U.S., the number of siblings,

family income, mother’s age at birth, mother’s education and whether the respondent’s father

was ever jailed. Also included in some specifications are the scores obtained from the Add

Health Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. We control for state fixed effects that would capture



                                                 8
any differences across states in policies towards children that may be correlated with both

obesity and self-esteem. Controlling for these characteristics and using lagged obesity as an

explanatory variable should diminish the concerns for bias, although it is possible that some

unobserved heterogeneity remains.



III. Data

        The data are drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent

Health (Add Health). Add Health was specifically designed to study adolescents’ health and risk

behaviors and it is considered to be the largest and most comprehensive nationally representative

survey of adolescents ever undertaken in the United States.3 An in-school questionnaire was

administered to 90,118 students in grades 7 through 12 between September 1994 and April 1995.

All students who completed the in-school questionnaire and those who did not complete a

questionnaire but were listed on a school roster were eligible for a more detailed in-home

interview, which constituted the Wave I of Add Health. The Wave I in-home interviews were

conducted with 20,745 adolescents and 17,700 parents between April 1995 and December 1995.

Wave II was implemented with about 14,738 Wave –I respondents between April 1996 and

August 1996. Between July 2001 and April 2002, a third wave was conducted with the original

Wave I respondents who could be located and re-interviewed as well as a sample of the partners

of the original respondents for a total of 15,197 young adults. 4 Our primary sample is drawn

from Wave III respondents.

        We construct multiple measures of self-esteem. Our first measure is based on replies to a

series of questions that the respondents were asked about their self-image in Wave III. These

include questions about how satisfied the respondent was with his/her life as a whole, whether

the respondent agreed or disagreed that he/she had many good qualities, whether the respondent

agreed or disagreed that he/she had a lot to be proud of, whether the respondent agreed or

disagreed that he/she liked himself/herself just the way he/she was, and whether the respondent

agreed or disagreed that he/she felt he/she was doing things just about right. The answers to the

first question included the following values: (1) if very satisfied; (2) if satisfied; (3) if neither

satisfied nor dissatisfied; (4) if dissatisfied; and (5) if very dissatisfied. The possible responses to

the other four questions were (1) if strongly agree; (2) if agree; (3) if neither agree nor disagree;

(4) if disagree; and (5) if strongly disagree. We created a single scale from these items after

reverse coding each of them, scores ranging from 5 to 25. Higher scores indicate higher self-

esteem. The items used in constructing this scale are either identical or very similar to the

Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, which is a 10-item self-report measure of global self-esteem

(Rosenberg, 1965).5 We constructed a binary indicator that takes on the value of 1 if the

respondent falls into the top 90th percentile in the distribution of this scale, i.e., the respondent is

in the top 10 percent with the highest self-esteem. This variable is called Very High Self-Esteem.

We also created a binary indicator, called High Self-Esteem, to represent whether the respondent

falls into the top 75th percentile. We created one additional binary indicator to measure self-

  Finally, Wave IV is being conducted with the original Wave I respondents in 2007-2008. The data from Wave IV
have not been released yet.

  The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale is one of the most extensively used instruments to assess self-esteem (Swallen et
al. 2005; Martin-Albo et al., 2007; Galliher, Rostosky, and Hughes, 2004; Russell et al., 2008).

                                                        10
esteem. Each respondent was asked to assess his/her own confidence in a question “How

confident are you of yourself?” Possible responses to this question included “very confident”,

“moderately confident”, “slightly confident”, and “not confident at all”. We constructed a binary

variable for being “very confident”.

           In some of our specifications, we use self-esteem measures from Wave II of the Add

Health. Similar to Wave III, Cut-off values for the 90th and 75th percentiles of the Rosenberg

Self-Esteem Scale are constructed using responses to the relevant questions asked in Wave II.

These include questions about the respondents’ assessment of whether he/she has a lot of good

qualities, feels socially accepted, feels like he/she is doing everything just about right, feels loved

and wanted, likes himself/herself just the way he/she is, and has a lot to be proud of.6

           Our obesity measure is based on Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a universally accepted

measure of obesity, defined as the ratio of weight in kilograms to height in meters squared.                       The

main reason for the wide-spread use of BMI is its ease of calculation since most data sets used in

socio-economic research contain the necessary information on height and weight. The World

Health Organization (WHO) sets the universally accepted cut-off points for classification of

overweight and obesity. An individual with a BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight,

a BMI between 25 and 30 classifies the person as being overweight, while an individual with a

BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. Both self-reported and measured values of height and

weight of respondents are available in Wave III of Add Health. Although the BMI values

derived from self-reported and measured height and weight exhibit high correlation in our

sample, we use the BMI derived from the measured height and weight. This allows us to avoid

any spurious correlation that may result from respondents’ misreporting their height and weight

due to their self-esteem.
6
    We could not construct a variable for being “very confident” because this question was not asked in Wave II.

                                                          11
          Note that for children and teens, the ranges of BMI that pertain to above a normal weight

are defined so that they take into account normal differences in body fat between boys and girls

and differences in body fat at various ages (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008).

Therefore, the criteria used to categorize individuals under age 20 are different from those used for

adults. Specifically, for children and teens, BMI values are plotted on growth charts from the

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to determine the corresponding BMI-for-age percentile. Then

children and teens at or above the 85th percentile of the gender- and age-specific BMI distribution are

coded as overweight, while those at or above the 95th percentile of the BMI distribution are coded as

obese. These growth charts take into account the fact that the amount of fat changes with age and

differs between girls and boys.7 The Add Health respondents are between ages 18 and 26 in Wave

III. Therefore, we limited our sample to those who are older than 20 when we employed data

from Wave III. To classify the respondents by their weight when they were younger (in Wave

II), we used the CDC growth charts for each person.

          Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics. Test Score1-5 stand for dichotomous variables

to indicate the quintile that the Peabody Vocabulary test score belongs. For example, if the test

score of the person is at the bottom 20% of the Peabody Vocabulary test score distribution, Test

Score 1 takes the value of 1, and zero otherwise. Healthy takes the value of one if the respondent

indicated that he/she is in good health or better. Father Jailed is equal to one if the father was

ever jailed, and zero otherwise. U.S. Born is equal to one if the individual was born in the

United States. No Sibling, 1 Sibling, etc. are a sequence of dummy variables indicating the

number of siblings of the person. Family Income-1 is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1

  For additional information on the CDC growth charts, see http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/resources/growthchart.pdf.
Also, see http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/. Until recently, this nomenclature differed across children (ages two to 19) and adults.
Children with BMIs above the 95th percentile of the gender- and age-specific distribution were considered “overweight,” and those above
the 85th percentile were considered “at-risk-for-overweight.” However, an expert committee convened by the American Medical
Association (AMA) in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration
(HRSA) and the CDC recently endorsed the use of “overweight” and “obese” for children. See this link for more information on the
adjustment: http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/433/ped_obesity_recs.pdf.

                                                                 12
if the individual’s family’s income was greater than or equal to 50% the poverty threshold

(adjusted for family size), but less than 100% of the poverty threshold. Family Income-2 is equal

to 1 if family income was greater than or equal to 100% of the poverty threshold but less than

200%., and zero otherwise. Family Income-3 identifies the case where family incomes was

greater than or equal to 200% of the poverty threshold. Other control variables include mother’s

education and mother’s age at birth.

       Table 1 also reports the means of the variables by self-esteem category. The stars next to

the means indicate that the means are different between the groups. For example, the average

hourly wage for the with very high self-esteem is $11.78, while the average wage for those who

do not have very high self-esteem is $11.13 and the difference is statistically significant.

Males have higher self-esteem than females, regardless of the self-esteem measure.



IV. Results

BMI and Self-Esteem

       Table 2A displays the results obtained from the model depicted in equation (1), where

self-esteem of young adults (ages 21 to 26) is explained by BMI and other explanatory variables.

Each specification reported in this table and in all other tables includes state fixed-effects.

Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses under the coefficients. Column 1 reports the

results of the model where Very High Self-esteem is the dependent variable. This is a

dichotomous variable that takes the value of 1 if the person is ranked in the top 10% of the self-

esteem distribution, and zero otherwise. Age and race have no statistically significant impact on

self-esteem. However, Hispanic ethnicity increases the probability of having high self-esteem

and confidence. Those with a high school degree or junior college degree are 3 and 4



                                                  13
percentage points more likely, respectively, to have very high self-esteem in comparison to those

with a GED or with no high school diploma. The impact of bachelor’s degree on very high self-

esteem is twice as large as the impact of a high school diploma or a junior college degree, and

the impact of a Master’s degree on very high self-esteem is twice as large as that of a bachelor’s

degree. Males and healthier individuals are more likely to have very high higher self-esteem.

An increase in BMI is associated with a decrease in high self-esteem. One-standard deviation

increase in BMI (6.13) lowers the probability of having very high self-esteem by about 1

percentage point, which represents a 9% decline from the baseline.

       Column 3 displays the results of the model where High Self-esteem is the dependent

variable, which is a dichotomous variable which takes the value of 1 if the if the person is ranked

in the top 25% of the self-esteem distribution, and zero otherwise. The results are very similar to

those reported in column 1. In alternative specifications, displayed in columns 2 and 4, we

estimate models by including linear and quadratic BMI terms to investigate potential non-linear

impact of BMI on self-esteem. The coefficients are not significantly different from zero.

However the hypothesis that linear and quadratic BMI terms are jointly zero is strongly rejected

in each case. Columns 5 and 6 present the results obtained from the models where the dependent

variable is whether the person has very high confidence. As column 5 shows, an increase in

BMI has a negative impact on confidence with the same magnitude as the ones reported in case

of self-esteem.

       To estimate a more flexible functional form, we classified BMI into 4 mutually-exclusive

categories and used three of these indicators as explanatory variables. In table 2B we report

estimation results obtained from these specifications. Underweight takes the value of 1 if the

person’s BMI is less than 18.5, and zero otherwise. Overweight is one if BMI is between 25 and



                                                14
30, inclusive; and Obese takes the value of 1 if BMI is greater than 30. The results demonstrate

that the most significant impact on self-esteem is obtained from belonging to the Obese category.

Specifically, being obese (BMI>30) decreases the probability of having high or very high self-

esteem by about 2.4 percentage points. Being obese also reduces the probability of being very

confident by 2.2 percentage points.

        To investigate the sensitivity of the results to the manner in which individuals are

classified into high self-esteem and low self-esteem categories, we estimated two ordered-probit

models. Each model contains the same set of explanatory variables as employed in Tables 2A

and 2B. The first model categorizes self-esteem into four groups: i) if the person self-esteem

score is less than 20, ii) if the self-esteem score is 20 or 21, iii) if the self-esteem score is 22 or

23, iv) if the self-esteem score is 24 or 25. Twenty-three percent of the observations belong to

the first category, about 34 percent are in the second group, 21 percent are in the third group, and

23 percent are in the fourth group. In the second specification we categorized the young adults’

self-esteem onto three groups: i) those with self-esteem score less than 20 (23 percent of the

sample), ii) those with a score of 20, 21 or 22 (44 percent of the sample) and iii) those with a

score greater 23 or greater (33 percent of the sample).

        Table 3A presents the marginal effects of the continuous measure of BMI (the top panel)

and the marginal effects of the dichotomous BMI indicators (the bottom panel) that are

calculated after estimating the ordered-probit models where self-esteem is classified into four

categories. An increase in BMI increases the probability of belonging to the bottom two self-

esteem categories, and it decreases the probability of being in the top two groups of self-esteem

distribution. The same result in obtained when using the dichotomous BMI variables, and the

statistically significant impact stems from being obese.



                                                   15
       Table 3B displays the same information with one difference: the dependent variable is

based on a 3-way categorization of self-esteem. As in Table 3A, an increase in BMI reduces

the probability of having high self-esteem (being in the top 33% of the self-esteem distribution),

and it increases the probability of belonging to low-self-esteem groups.

       In Table 4 we display the results obtained from estimating versions of Equation (2).

Here, to minimize the concern of reverse causality from self-esteem to BMI, we explain the

current self-esteem of the young adult (measured in the third wave of the survey) with his/her

BMI measured 5-to-6 years ago (in the second wave of the survey). Columns 1, 2 and 3 reveal

that past BMI has a statistically significant impact on current self-esteem. Furthermore, the

magnitude of BMI coefficient is the same as those reported in Table 2A.

       Columns 4 and 5 of Table 4 display the results of the models depicted in Equation (5),

where current self-esteem is expressed as a function of past self-esteem and past BMI. This

specification cannot be estimated when Very Confident is the dependent variable because the

variable Very Confident is not available in the second wave of the survey. Having high self-

esteem (very high self-esteem) in the past increases the likelihood of having high self-esteem

(very high self-esteem) in the present. Keeping constant past self-esteem, an increase in BMI in

the past is associated with a decrease in self-esteem today. The impact of past BMI on current

self-esteem is smaller in specifications which control for past self-esteem (columns 4 and 5) in

comparison to the models that do not control for past self-esteem (columns 1, 2 and 3).

       The bottom panel of Table 4 presents the results obtained from models where self-esteem

and confidence indicators are explained by weight indicators in the past (5-6 years earlier) as

well as past self-esteem indicators. Past weight indicators are based on height and weight

measured in Wave II when the subjects were 15 to 20 years of age. Thus, the classifications are



                                                16
based in CDC growth charts. Here, underweight indicates that the teenager belonged to the

bottom 5% of the distribution for age in wave II. He/she is considered overweight if the BMI

was between 85th and 95th percentiles; and the teenager is considered obese if the BMI was equal

to greater than the 95th percentile. The left-out category in the regressions is healthy weight

(BMI between 5th and 85th percentiles). The results demonstrate that obesity in the past has a

negative impact on current self-esteem. Being overweight in the past has a negative impact on

current self-esteem. The impacts of being underweight and being at risk on self-esteem are also

negative, although the significance of the coefficients is spotty.



BIM and Wages

        Equation (6), which formulates the relationship between wages, obesity and self-esteem

is estimated using the logarithm of wages reported by young adults in wave III.8 Table 5 reports

the benchmark specification where wages are explained by human capital attributes of the young

adults as well as by their self-esteem. The results show that higher levels of education have

bigger impacts on wages. A GED degree increases wages by 8.5 percent in comparison to

having no high school diploma; and high school diploma has an 9.5% wage premium. The

impact of a junior college degree on wages is an 18 percent increase in comparison to no high

school diploma. Those with a bachelor’s degree earn about 33 percent higher wages in

comparison to those who have no high school degree and the premium associated with a master’s

degree is 46 percent. This result is not surprising, and it is consistent with the large literature in

economics on the returns to education. However, these models do not control for potential


8
  It is not advisable to include in these regressions occupation dummies to control for the impact of
individuals’ occupations in their wages. This is because occupational choice may been determined, in
part, by BMI. Nevertheless, we also ran regressions that included 22 occupation dummies. The results
did not change.

                                                  17
endogeneity of education, therefore the magnitudes of the education variables should be

interpreted with caution.9 In fact, columns 4-6 show that, controlling for the vocabulary scores

reduces the magnitude of the education coefficients. Holding constant education, higher

vocabulary test scores have a positive impact on wages. This suggests that this dimension of

ability, measured by Peabody Vocabulary test scores, is rewarded in the market in addition to the

level of education acquired. In columns 1-3 we observe that having been born in the U.S. is

associated with a 2.8 percent wage premium. However, controlling for the vocabulary test score

in columns 4-6 eliminates the statistical significance of the coefficient of U.S. Born, suggesting

English proficiency may be captured by the U.S. Born variable. Being healthy generates an 8

percent wage premium, but other variables are not significantly associated with wages.

        Table 5 also shows that holding all else constant, having high self-esteem is associated

with higher wages. This result is consistent with recent research that has demonstrated the

important of non-cognitive skills in wage determination. Table 6A estimates the same models

with one difference: in these models we include BMI as an additional explanatory variable. The

results imply that a one-standard deviation increase in BMI is associated with a 1.2 percent

reduction in wages. A comparison with Table 5 shows that adding BMI does not impact the

coefficients of most variables meaningfully. When the impact of BMI is controlled for, the

coefficients of self-esteem decline slightly. Specifically, the impact of self-esteem is 11-to-15

percent smaller when the model includes BMI. Table 6B is similar to table 6A, but instead of

employing BMI as a continuous measure, we use three dichotomous variables that classify

individuals into 4 weight categories, as was done before. This specification does not alter the

 For example, individuals with higher ability are more likely to acquire more education, and they are also
more likely to earn higher wages, regardless their level of education.

                                                   18
estimated impact of self-esteem on wages, and the results show that the negative impact of BMI

on wages is primarily due to being in the Obese category.

       Table 7 displays the results that are obtained from the models where logarithm of wages

are regressed on the same set of explanatory variables, including current self-esteem measures,

but that also control for past BMI (BMI measured 5-to-6 years ago). Past BMI has a negative

impact on current wages and the positive impact of self-esteem on wages remains robust.



Race and Gender-specific Analyses

       To investigate how the relationship between BMI, self-esteem and wages differ by race

and gender, we estimated the models for the following four groups: black females, black males,

white females, and white males. Each model contains the same set of explanatory variables as

used in other models, including the indicator variable for Hispanic ethnicity. Such a breakdown

is potentially important because previous research failed to find a consistent relationship between

BMI and wages for groups other than white females, suggesting that the strength of the

association between self-esteem, BMI and wages may differ between race and gender groups.

        Table 8 summarizes the results of the race and gender-specific self-esteem regressions.

The models include full set of controls as in previous regressions, but they are not reported in the

interest of space. In each panel we report the estimated coefficients of BMI and the

corresponding standard error. The top panel demonstrates that BMI has a negative and

statistically significant impact on self-esteem in case of black females. BMI has a negative

impact of Black men’s self-esteem as well, although most of the estimates are not statistically

significant at conventional levels. The bottom panel displays the BMI effects for whites. In case

of while females, there is a negative association between BMI and self-esteem in every



                                                19
specification. For white males, BMI has no impact on self-esteem. When BMI is measured by a

set of dichotomous indicators in the bottom panel, it exhibits an unexpected positive coefficient

for white males.

       Table 9 reports the BMI and self-esteem estimates obtained from the specifications where

self-esteem is explained by past BMI and past self-esteem as depicted by equation (5). The

results of this specification are largely consistent with those reported in Table 8. The impact of

BMI is estimated with less precision for black females in comparison to the specifications

reported in table 8. But, the point estimates of BMI in the models for High Self-Esteem are

almost the same as those reported in Table 8, and the coefficient of Past BMI is borderline

significant (p=0.13) in the first column. In case of black males, the specifications reveal a

negative impact of BMI on self-esteem and confidence that is significant in almost every

specification. The same is true for white females. In case of white males, on the other hand, the

estimated coefficients of BMI are mostly positive, small in absolute value and never statistically

significant. Thus, taken together, the results reported in Tables 8 and 9 indicate that BMI has a

negative impact on self-esteem in case of females (both white and black), as well as black males.

BMI does not seem to influence the self-esteem of white males in a meaningful way.

       Table 10 presents the results obtained from estimating wage regressions, separately for

race and gender groups. As before, each regression includes a complete set of control variables

and state; but in the interest of space, we only report the BMI and self-esteem coefficients

obtained from eight separate regressions. In each regression, the dependent variable is the

logarithm of the wage rate of the young adult reported in Wave 3 of the survey. In the top two

panels of the table the BMI and self-esteem variables pertain to those reported in Wave 3. The




                                                20
bottom two panels of the table report the specifications which employ past BMI or weight

category dummies based on past BMI.

         Columns 1 and 3 of Table 10 indicate that there is evidence that deviations from

“normal” body weight has a negative impact on wages of black females as well as white

females. Similar to the coefficients of obese, the coefficients of underweight are negative in the

regressions reported in table 10, indicating a wage penalty for being underweight, although the

effect is statistically significant for black males only in the top panel. It should be noted that

these race-and-gender specific samples are not large, and therefore most of the coefficient are

borderline significant at the conventional levels.

         There is no strong evidence of an impact of obesity on wages in case of black males, and

there is no statistically significant relationship between body weight and wages for white males.

Consistent with the results reported in tables 5-7, there is evidence of an impact of self-esteem on

wages. This impact is weaker in case of black males, and non-existent in case of black females.



V. Conclusion

         In addition to being a serious health problem, obesity can have a variety of labor market

implications. Obesity can impact wages by influencing worker productivity directly (through

cognitive function or physical conditioning), indirectly through poor health, or because of

employer or customer discrimination. Obesity can also influence self-esteem, which may impact

wages.

         We analyze a nationally representative sample of young American adults who were in the

age range of 21 to 26 in 2001-2002. The results indicate that body weight has an independent

impact on self-esteem controlling for a host of personal attributes, including education, health



                                                 21
status and family background characteristics. Specifically, being overweight or obese has a

negative influence on self-esteem for females and black males. There is no strong evidence of an

impact of body weight on self-esteem in case of white males.

         Wages of women are influenced by their body weight. There is a wage penalty for being

obese in case of both white females and black females. Men’s wages are not impacted by their

body weight. The results also indicate that self-esteem has an impact on wages in case of whites

(both men and women). White women’s wages are also influenced by their bodyweight. Thus,

the results suggest that obesity has the most serious impact on white women’s wages, because

their wages are affected directly by obesity and indirectly through the impact of obesity on self-

esteem, although the magnitude of the wage penalty that emerges through this second channel is

small.

    Regressions include state-fixed effects and variables used in Tables 2A and 2B. Robust standard errors are
    in parentheses. . ***, ** and * indicate p-values less than 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. Underweight
    in the Past, Overweight in the Past and Obese in the Past are based on the BMI of the person in Wave
    II, when he/she was aged 15-20. For these classifications, underweight indicates that the person
    belonged to the bottom 5% of the distribution for age. Overweight indicates that the BMI is
    between 85th and 95th percentiles; and obese indicates that if BMI is equal to greater than the 95th
    percentile. See the text for further details.

Regressions include state-fixed effects, and variables used in other specifications. Robust standard errors are
reported in parentheses. ***, ** and * indicate p-values less than 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. a: significant at
the 10.5% level, b: significant at the 14.7% level. Underweight in the Past, Overweight in the Past and Obese in the
Past are based on the BMI of the person in Wave II, when he/she was aged 15-20. For these classifications,
underweight indicates that the person belonged to the bottom 5% of the distribution for age. Overweight indicates
that the BMI is between 85th and 95th percentiles; and obese indicates that if BMI is equal to greater than the 95th
percentile. See the text for further details. ‡: the coefficient is significant at the 11% level. ♠: significant at the 13%
level. ♦: significant at the 12% level.
