     ASPECTS OF OPTIMAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE: SEARCH,
           LEISURE AND CAPITAL MARKET IMPERFECTIONS



                                  I



     Unemployment Insurance (UI) can be seen as redistributive with a

trade—off between equality and efficient 'search' to be set beside

the existing 'effort' and 'education' models of optimal taxation

(e.g., Mirrlees (1971), Atkinson (1973)). The redistributive role of

UI is accentuated by capital market imperfections which tend to make

consumption vary more closely with current income.

     In this paper UI will be assumed to take the form of a propor-

tional pay—roll tax used to pay a subsidy to all the unemployed.1

However the analysis here, and elsewhere, raises a number of questions

aoout this form of UI. The loss of a given amount of income will

involve a larger utility loss (given a perfect capital market) for an

older man who has fewer years over which to make the adjustment. Should

he be given higher benefits? Shavell and Weiss (1977) argue that if

benefits decline over time their disincentive effect is reduced; however

Flemming (1977, b) has shown that if there is a progressive income tax

on annual income, there is an efficiency argument for benefits increas-

ing with duration. The incentive effects of UI depend on the mix of

benefits in the traditional form of periodic payments conditional on

continued unemployment, redundancy payments (either lump sums or

unconditional payments fr a set number of periods) (Hamerniesh (1977))

and loans (the natural response to an imperfect capital market).

Finally, as Baily (1977) mentions, subsidising search activities by the

unemployed is another element in the potential policy mix.

     Baily (1977) presents a two period model of the redistributive

(insurance) argument for UI which involves a curious mixture of perfect

and imperfect capital market assumptions. On the one hand, the
unemployed can apparently not borrow at all against future earnings

(i.e. earnings beyond the second period); on the other hand, the second

period is not homogeneous and borrowing from the second (employed)

section of it to finance consumption during unemployment is not only

possible but costless. The framework is unsuited to the analysis of

unemployment at the beginning of a career and is also inadequate for the

identification of that part of a UI scheme justified by capital market

imperfection.

       The object of tils paper is to examine the importance of capital

market assumptions. A special continuous—time model is developed in

sections II —    IV   which is applicable to the perfect capital market case.

It can also be used when there is no capital market at all (section IV).

For 'reasonable' parameter values the optimal replacement rate (ratio

of benefits to gross wage) appears to be less than 20% when capital

markets reperfect but over 70% when they are non existent (i.e. no

saving or dis—saving).

       These models follow Baily in ignoring leisure; however, in the

perfect capital market case this produces some rather surprising results, e.g.

the   unemployed spend almost as much money on searching as they would
earn if employed (and sometimes more). This result might be more
plausible if    the   opportunity cost of an unemployed man's time   were

included   in the costs of search, i.e. if leisure is valued. Sections

VI and VII present results for a similar model with leisure (which has

to enter in a rather special way). The result is that in the perfect

capital market case the optimal replacement ratio falls to less than 5%,

while when there is no capital market it falls from 75% when leisure

has   zero value, to 45% when it is valued at one quarter of the wage,
25% at half the wage and 0% at three quarters of the wage.

    Just as portfolio theory with its multiplicative random rates of

return is facilitated by the assumption of an iso—elastic or constant

relative risk aversion utility function, so the analysis of a random

additive labour income stream is simplest if there is constant aclnte

risk aversion. We therefore assume



                           U(C) = — cte8C               > o    (1)



    As an example of the stochastic dynamic programming techniques to

be used subsequently we examine the following problem: given

     (i) initial wealth W;

    (ii) the utility function (1);

   (iii) a constant interest rate r;

    (iv) labour income y generated by a stationary Wiener process

         so that (undiscounted) income over any interval h has mean

          and    variance    proportional to h;

     (v) additive separability over an infinite horizon with pure time

         preference at the rate p.

    What is the optimal consumption strategy?

    Let W) be the indirect utility function of wealth. Then


         ct(W)    = Max    Lim {hU(C(W)) + (1 —
                    C(W)   ho

If '/4,"     and 4"/4"            were constants then C' =                      r   and     C" = 0,    in

which case                  =   —r      and          4'/c" —              which     re indeed

is   a solution to our problem (although we have not proved its unique-

ness).

      Equation (8) implies that negative financial wealth, which has not

been ruled out, might involve negative consumption. This reflects the

fact that the utility function (1) does not have the property that

U' + +       as C -- 0       (U' (0) =   a;      U' goes to plus infinity only as C

goes to minus infinity). To impose a non—negativity constraint on C

without changing U(C), C >               0,   would be both arbitrary and mathematically

difficult but the present tractable model is certainly deficient in this

respect.

      Despite this deficiency equation (8) does enable us to identify a

number of distinct potential effects of UI on welfare through its effects

on the distribution or level of consumption.

       (a) For a given distribution of wealth UI, if it raises unemploy-

      ment, tends to lower mean labour income (m) but the effect of

      this on consumption may be offset by a reduction in the variance

       (v) of net income.

       (b) In the longer run the distribution of wealth itself depends

      on m and v; a reduction in the latter will reduce the inequality

      of wealth and consumption. Moreover by reducing savings a smaller

              v reduces mean wealth and mean consumption unless offset by

      macro—policy.

      (c) In a general equilibrium context, and in the absence of off-

      setting macro—policy, UI induced changes in accumulation and labour

      supply   will   lead   to changes in interest rates and wages similar to
      the   effects   of other aspects of social security (see Flemming
      (197k)).    If the budget is used to insulate capital accumulation
      from these ef2ects UI 1ich raises unemployment must also lower mean
      Consumption.
     (d) As r +   0   the dependence of consumption on wealth and on

    the variance of labour income both decline. This suggests, as we

    shall see in subsequent calculations, that the level of optimal

    UI will be an increasing function of the real intet rate

     tending to zero with the interest rate. However, UI does not, in

     the absence of offsetting macro—policy, increase monotonically

    with r. The effect of UI on savings, and thus wealth, has an

    effect on consumption proportionate to r.



                                   It'


    The model of equations (1)—(8) cannot be used as it stands since

it cannot easily admit of search activity undertaken by the unemployed.

In the absence of search it is hard to obtain a disincentive effect of

UI (indeed if one simply pcstulates that unemployment rises with UI

replacement rates the optimum may be a tax on unemployment). Both

search and compensation for the unemployed require that there be an

identifiable unemployment state.

     Consider therefore the following model, in which we follow Baily

in ignoring labour/leisure choice; at any one time part of the popula-

tion is employed and earns a gross wage of 1, part is unemployed and

earns nothing. UI changes these numbers to (1 —   t)   and d (for

'dole'). Balance of the UI fund implies


                            t(1 —   u)   du                    (9)



where u is the unemployment rate.

    A proportion X of those employed lose their job per unit time

while a proportion C of the unemployed find jobs. We assume here

that A is given by technological change etc. and is independent of
                                             —7-.

UI.   C depends on search strategy which is influenced by UI. Note

that in the absence of population growth the steady state value of u

is A/(X + c)       so that (9) becomes


                                         =   Xd/c.                                          (10)



      We initially retain the infinite horizon assumption of the previous

section in which case there are two indirect utility functions, of wealth,

one for each employment state, and two consumption functions. Using

subscripts e and u for the states the following equation, comparable

to (3) above, can easily be derived


  P(W) = U(Ce(W))        +       . (rW + (1 —        t)   —             +   A((W)       —
                                                              Ce(W))

and                                                                                                 (11)


          =   U(C(W))    +   '   . (rW   + d — s —        C(W))     + c(     (W)    —       (W))



where   s is the amount of           resources expended in search.

      Differentiating (11) w.r.t. W and C,


                         U'(C1(W)) =         (W)              I =   e,u

and

               —   q') = — (rW         + (1 —   t)    —
                                                          Ce(W))
                                                                    +     (p —   r)          (12)

Initially we would expect Ce(W) >               C(W) with           less than perfect

insurance and positive interest, thus we                  expect ' >                and the LHS

of (12) positive while           4" is   always negative. (12) therefore implies,

 in the case in which          p =

                                  C(W) + 8 > rW + d J


As one would expect, the employed save while the unemployed dissave.

      Differentiating.(11) w.r.t. s gives


                                   C       =

      Arguments similar to those used above show that a solution to the

optimal consumption problem takes                  the   form

       Equations (32) imply that search, and the duration of spells of

unemployment, are both independent of wealth. This independence

enormously simplifies the dynamics of wealth.

       Some idea of the structure of the model can be obtained if we

consider the case of p =   r    = 0.    As was suggested in relation to

equation (8), and is confirmed below, the optimal dole is zero if

dissave 1.92 times their wage, spending half of this on search and

consuming the other half; as mentioned in the introduction, this

implausible result is modified in the model of sections VI. and VII

which includes leisure.

       At 0.96 the consumption of the unemployed is identical to that of

the employed. This reflects the fact that in the absence of discounting

and with an infinite horizon the unemployed have the same human capital

as the employed while financial assets/liabilities are irrelevant. It

        Social Welfare (S), our maximand, depends on the level and

distribution of consumption. Suumiing the individual instantaneous

utilities (1) gives


s = — of exp (—          . C(W))   .    f(W)dW


     = cz((1—    u)f   exp (—          Ce(W))

        If the distributions f(W), f(W) were both normal, Ce(W) and

C(W) would also be normal so that individual utilities would be log—

normally distributed and the aggregate welfare could be written as



     S =           {c    exp e + 2r2V/2)                 +   A       e       + 2r2V/2)}         (35)

           It is thus necessary to establish the distributions fe(W)                            and

infinite means         and   variances since both are proportional to time.

Indeed eventually the tw distributions become indistinguishable with

             course individuals donot have infinite lives. If we consider

finite lives the- consumption optimization conditions change in three

ways: where we have rW- alone we will find W • a                   (r,t) — the annuity

value of W at r for the T years to the horizon; the savings rates
       and    y      though still independent of W vary with T, as also does

optimal search s — search, like saving, being less worthwhile the

nearer the agent is to his horizon. These features of the finite horizon

case make the dynamics of wealth very much more difficult to handle than in

the infinite case.

       For tractability, therefore, we are restricted to the latter for

which we evaluate below the instantaneous social welfare of a population

of immortals at an arbitrary date T after they set out on the process

with equal wealth W(O) and the equilibrium distribution of unemployment

(which depends on the U[ regime). If T is large enough we can

substitute from (36) into (35) to get

       Equation (21) gives ; as a function of the parameters 8,                   r

                                           — 15 —


and   p are parameters. Thus suitable substitution enables us to solve

(21), (32) and (19) for                ,     6       (and s); (21) can then be solved

for 'e and then, given T and                         we can evaluate (37) for S(T).

      The optimal value of d was found by searching over a 1% grid; in

addition to the values of y., C,                     s, u, and t the variance of
wealth factor V e — y               )2Xc/(A +        c)3    was calculated and also the

contribution (x) of accumulated risk induced savings (remember r = p

throughout), x           Tr(CYe +   Xy)/(X       +   c) and    also the ratio of the

consumption of the employed to that of the unemployed (at W = 0)

      As described above we took A =                 0.2,      =   0.5 and gp =   10   as the

standard values of those parameters. Since most people work for about

40 years we took T = 20             for the standard case although with a mean

duration of five years for employment spell it is rather short for our

asymptotic approximation of the wealth distribution. The standard value

of r     ( p) was taken as 10% per annum; as a net real rate this is on

the high side but it should be biased upwards to make some allowance for

finite lives. Given our wage unit consumption is near to unity so that

8 measures both absolute and relative risk aversion; we take 8 = 2

as standard.

      Most parameters were also tried at half and twice the standard

value; with three alternative values of each of six parameters we would

have 729 (= 36) combinations. This number reduces to 13 if only one

parameter at a time is allowed to deviate from its standard value.

       In the standard case average ring in response to earnings

uncertainty is, in the absence of UI, 0.15% of the gross wage, accumulated

for 20 years this adds 3.0% of the wage to mean wealth (remember that the

accruing interest is all consumed) and thus at the 10% standard interest

rate, adds 0.3% of the wage to mean                  consumption.     In this case the error
                                           16


introduced by our partial analysis is trivial. However when r = 50%

this factor adds a non—trivial 8% of the wage to mean consumption in

the absence of UI which falls to 5% when d             30%. For this reason x

is included in the table below, it represents the addition to mean

consumption japardized by UI. x(d*) is also reported; if

x(O) —   x(d*)   > 0.2%   of the wage the savings effect is likely to have a

significant impact on the estimate of the optimal level of UI. In these

cases we also evaluate the optimal UI when its effect on private savings

is suppressed.

       The results of these calculations are set out in table 1 below.

Section (1) of the table sets out the different combinations of parameters

in rows 1—13 (rows 14 and 15 repeat rows 4 and 5 but the optimization

(in section (iii)) is with the savings effect suppressed). Section (ii)

gives the values of c, s, u, z, x, V etc. in the absence of UI C

while    section (iii) gives the optimal values of d etc. for these

parameters while the impact of optimal UI on search, unemployment and

the   variance of wealth is set out in section (iv).

        Row 3 of the table is the standard case. In the absence of UI
                              A
is 9.7 so that u          =       =        = 2%.   e = 9.7    implies a mean dura-

tion of spells of unemployment        of   5.4 weeks while the unemployed spend

94% of the gross wage on search and consume the same amount. The high

search    expenditures    are more sensitive to r than to gp (see rows

10, 11, 13). In the standard case the optimal 'dole' is 9% of the

gross    wage, this raises unemployment by 5%        to 2.1% and can be financed

by a 0.2% tax on the employed. The 'dole' raises the consumption of the

unemployed    from 94% to 95% of the wage and reduces the variance of
wealth by 7%.      This reflects the fall of 'e —            'u   from 192% to 178%

of the wage,     half of the reduction coming from a cut in search expendi

tures    and half from the direct effect of the dole on dissaving.

        Comparison of rows 14 and 15 with 4 and 5 reemphasizes the

importance of the savings effect when r is high. Suppressing this

effect doubles the optimal tdole' at r = 20%.               Rows 3, 8 and 9 show

that changing A changes only the unemployment rates (proportionately).

     In practice leisure rather than wealth is what is used up in search

as mentioned in the introduction. It is important for the tractability

of the model that the intensity of search be independent of wealth;

since consumption depends on wealth this means that we need a utility

function with constant relative risk aversion in consumption and the

marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure independent

of the level of consumption.

     The function must be


                             U(C,h) =            — -(C+O(1h))                                           (46)



where the consumer is endowed with one unit                           of   useful time           (per   period)

and h is the proportion of it devoted to work                                  (9..)     or search (s).

With a wage rate of unity labour income is £ so that it follows from

(46) that    9.,* =   0,1, as e             i.


     We assume 0 < I           so that given the opportunity people work full

time. Search, unlike work, is subject to diminishing returns so that
                                                                                                 (or search)
s* will be interior. With a dole for the wholly unemployed, work/is

only worthwhile if       I —    t   >0+           d    for which d <             1
                                                                                       — 0   is necessary

but not sufficient.

     With this change equations (II) become

and find that although the exponents in equation (17) now involve the

term — 0(1 — s)       equations (18), (20), (21) and (22) are unchanged

except that 6 (in equation (19)) is now given by


                       6 =        1
                                          —   t   —

Using the utility function (46) (49) becomes

                          —r0/(1—e

whence, using the modified version of (17)


                                                      —   cO/                                  (51)
       Equations (24)—(3J) describing the search process are unchanged

though s is now interpreted as a time input.                 (51) and (31) imply


                          s =   mm    (-    Tfl'/O,   1)




If s were equal to      I d should be raised, as it raises the consump

tion of the unemployed without increasing their number, until either s

falls from unity or the constraint

With the three changes (50) for (19), (52) for (32) and (53) in (35),

the previous computations can be repeated with suitably amended parameter

values.

       Consider again r = p = d =      0;    using (50) and (52)

          The results of these calculations are set out in table 3. The

highest replacement rate is 4% in row 11 cn= .8). The reason for the

even lower replacement rates in this case seems to be that with —

less      than unity in all the cases considered, the variance of wealth is

much smaller        than in the previous model (indeed                       for p =   r   =   d   = 0     it

falls       from .72 to .05); moreover with more of the utility of the

                                       Conclusions


        Within   the family of rather special models considered here it seems

that current levels of replacement (50—80% in the U.S. and Western

Europe) could only be rationalised by invoking extreme capital market

imperfections. This naturally raises the question of modifying the

beefit structue tc introduce a loan element. As with student loans it

would probably be necessary to relate repayments to subsequent earnings.

As this would have further disincentive effects some combination of

loans and grants is probably called for.

        Although modelling intermediate cases of capital market imperfec-

tion would be difficult, variation of the benefit formula to include

lump    sum payments on job loss and subsidies on search would be fairly
simple. Less easy, but also feasible, would be the introduction of a

distribution of skills (gross wages) and the integration of UI with a

redistributive   wage tax.

     The models presented here relate to a population homogeneous both

with respect to the wage and parameters (A) of job—loss and (gp and

Ti) representing the productivity of job search. Cripps and Tarling

(1974) have suggested that the distribution of the length of completed

spells of unemployment implies that C is not constant in the popula-

tion. In our model c would vary with the UI replacement rates but it

is plausible that gp and r also depend on the characteristics of the

individual and the market for his particular skills. Creedy and Disney

(1977) have inferred from the distribution of the frequency of spells of

unemployment that A is also distributed in the population.

     If the population were divided into identifiable groups each

characterized by its own w, A, T, and gp, then in principle, we could

identify the tax and dole appropriate to that group. However our know-

ledge is more likely to be represented by a joint distribution of these

parameters and prescribing for that case is considerably more difficult.

One possible feature of it is that we would expect the parameters

applicable to the unemployed to vary with the duration of their unemploy-

ment, introducing yet another reason for relating UI benefits to duration.

1.     To avoid temporary lay—off unemployment the pay—roll tax is payable

by fully experience—rated employers (see Feldstein (1976)).



2.     We assume here that population and participation are constant. If

the active population grows at the rate V             and all new entrants join

the unemployed


                          = (A +   v)(1    —   u) —

Thus in steady stawhere i          0

                                       A +v
                             u=A+V+e
so that A can be reinterpreted as the sum of the rates of job—loss

and population growth.



3.     This behaviour probably involves varying th.i real wage rate (which

we have assumed constant) as the equilibrium unemployment rate changes

with      which is a function of the policy variable d.



4.     Note that this implies s <      fl/s.


5.     This argument ignores saving effects. Raising d reduces

aggregate savings even if search and unemployment are unaffected.

For this reason the results of table 3 show several optima characterized

by full time search.

         A NOTE ON EFFICIENT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE UNDER
                     PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAXATION



     Recent theories of unemployment such as those in Phelps et.al. (1969)

emphasize the search activity of the unemployed. Expenditure of time or

money in search is of the nature of investment. As with other investments

one can ask whether the tax system is neutral with respect to the returns

to search.

     Time spent searching rather than working for current income reduces

taxable income and tax paid, to this extent the Revenue subsidis search.

On the other hand, if search leads to the finding of a better paid job

the Revenue takes a share of the gain. If the tax is progressive the

Revenue's share in the gain will exceed its share in the costs thus

discouraging search. At the same time the explicit taxation of the

interest returns on other investments reduces the opportunity cost of

capital used up in search and thus encourages search.

     In this note we formalise these statements and use them as the basis

for the specification or a system of unemployment benefits designed to

make the fiscal treatment of search neutral. We consider three separate

cases:

     (a) progressive taxation of earned income only (no interest income

     tax) on a continuous basis —   the   tax liability accrues as a

     progressive function of the instantaneous rate of earnings;

     (b) a similar tax on the sum of earned income over a period such

     as a year;

     (c) the continuous case (a) with income, including interest, as

     the tax base.


     In each case we consider an unemployed person who has the opportunity

to earn at the rate W, this represents the opportunity cost of continued

search. The person believes that search for an irirvl of time St would
                                         —2—

lead to an employment offer at the earnings level W +                (SW.   Both the

present opportunity and the enhanced offer are expected (correctly) to

provide employment at the respective wages for a period of T years

after which the employee's prospects are independent of the preceding

wage.


(a) On these assumptions the gain from further search is


                         V(r,T)[N(W +       (SW)
                                                   — N(W)]


where V(r,T) is the present value of .1 p.a. for T years at the tax

free interest rate r and N(.) is the net of tax wage. The cost of

obtaining this gain is assumed to be only the net income foregone; this

is the net wage N(W) arising from the available offer, less the net

benefit N(B) for which he is eligible.

        Thus the private return on searching for the extra period (St is                I)

              V(r,T) .   (N(W +   (SW)
                                         — N(W))/(St(N(W) — N(B))              (1)



while in the absence of any other distortion (i.e. wages equal marginal

social product, r is the marginal social product of capital) the

social return is


                               V(r,T)(SW/6t . W                                (2)



If search is not to be distoitd we need (1) and              (2)   to be equal, which

implies

                                      — N(W)       N(W) — N(B)
                     N(W +    (SW)             -                               (3)
                                (Sw                     W



N(W) can he written      as   W(1 — a(W))          where a(W) is the average tax

rate.     Then, if m(W) is the marginal rate, the limiting value of (3)

is
                                         —3—

                          I — m(W)   = I — a(W) — N(B)/W

                                                                       (4)
                               N(B) =
                                      tn(W)       a(W).


      (4) is easily applied to a system, like that in the U.K., where

there is a personal allowance (P) of exempt income above ich a wide

band of income is taxed at a constant 'basic' marginal rate b. For

all levels of W taxed at the basic rate


                     N(B) = — b      .   (W —   P)/W = bP/W

whence


                                     N(B*) = bP.                       (5)



Since b <   I,     bP <   P   and the benefit will not be taxed. Thus the

optimal gross benefit B* = bP;             B.*/W has a maximum value of b (about

1/3) at W = P       and declines steadily thereafter.

      If the tax schedule were linear throughout, i.e. incorporated a

negative income tax, and was not progressive in the marginal rate,

N(O) = bP   and no specific unemployment benefit is called for. Thus

this analysis calls for positive unemployment compensation on efficiency

grounds alone under any income tax progressive in the marginal rate.

However, the income tax which gives rise to this case presumably

reflects a concern for redistribution which would probably raise the
                                  Baily (1977) and Flemming (1977).)
optimal benefit ratio above the level required for efficiency. (See /


(b)   The analysis of this case is simplified if we ignore spells of

unemployment     which stretch over two financial years. We consider a man
who, having lost his job at the beginning of the year, finds himself in

the position described above after a fraction u of the year has passed.

      If u = 0 no compensation is called for as the marginal tax rate
in the current year, which represents the Revenue's share in the cost of

search, is the same as the marinal rate in future fully employed years

which is the Reverue's share in the fruits of search. If                        u =   I       C

and benefits at the rates B(t)                  (0 <   t < 1)     are taxable (3) becomes

Thus over the course of a year's unemployment the tax—free benefit rate

should rise from zero to m(W) if m(O) = 0.

     The result, that benefits should increase with the duration of

unemployment, is contrary to the analysis of Shavell and Weiss (1977)

which points out that falling benefits provide for current consumption

while lending urgency to search by not underwriting future consumption.

The result of the present argument would be reinforced by any tendency

of W to rise during unemployment as a result of search turning up

opportunities superior to the previous ones but still below the

(Notice that since income (Y =                 W   +    rK)     is now the tax base we cannot

write a and in as depending simply on W.)

        Since r(i — m)        could be either greater or less than s, given

capital market imperfections, a could be either greater Or less than

unity.

     Some light can be thrown on the implications of (8) by considering

the following special cases.


        (i) r(I — m) =       s, a = I.        The gross interest rate r exceeds s

     by the aunt of the marginal income tax.

            Inthis case the previous result (at (a) above) is unchanged.
            This case is special but not entirely absurd. The corporation
     tax with 100%    investment relief (expensing) and interest deduct—

     ilility may   raise r to s/(I —                     c) where c is the corporation
     tax rate (see Flemming (1976)), thus the case occurs when c = in.

    (ii) T ,         a   =    s/r(1     —    in), N(B)/W         = I — a —   s/r.
            If also s =          r    N(B)/W = — a, in this case the interest tax

     overstimulates      search in proportion to (1 —                      rn)1     while

     progressivity inhibits it only in proportion to (m — a)                                so that
                                 —6—

 a negative rep1acenat rate of a is required for 'neutrality'.

(iii) As T + 0     cx +   I   and the results of section (a) go through

 for all r and s.

      If T =   5   years and r = s =        10%   while m = 50Z


               a = 1.12        and   N(B)    .44 — a              (10)


 This suggests that for realistic parameter values interest income

 taxation is less important than the progressivity of the tax

 schedule.
