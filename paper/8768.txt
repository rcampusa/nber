        The purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, we characterize the Fed's systematic response
to technology shocks and its implications for U.S. output, hours and inflation. Second, we evaluate the
extent to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary policy rule (including the
optimal one) in the context of a standard business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can
be described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across periods in the response of the
economy (as well as the Fed's) to a technology shock. Second, the Fed's response to a technology shock
in the Volcker-Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary policy rule. Third, in the
pre-Volcker period the Fed's policy tended to over stabilize output at the cost of generating excessive
inflation volatility. Our evidence reinforces recent results in the literature suggesting an improvement in
the Fed's performance.

1     Introduction

Since the seminal work of Taylor (1993), many macroeconomists have shifted their attention to the

analysis of the endogenous component of monetary policy, and its role in shaping the responses

of nominal and real variables to diﬀerent shocks. The contribution of the present paper to that

research program is twofold. First, we study the behavior of the Federal Reserve (Fed) in response

to a speciÞc source of ßuctuations: technology shocks. Second, we evaluate the extent to which

that policy response approximates the optimal one, using a standard dynamic sticky price model

as a reference framework.1

    We provide evidence on the economy’s response to a technology shock that is based on a struc-

tural VAR, estimated using U.S. quarterly data for the period 1954-1998. Following the strategy

adopted in Galí (1999), we identify a technology shock as the only source of the unit root in

labor productivity. We analyze the estimated dynamic responses of a number of real and nominal

variables to that shock, and assess how the observed Fed reaction may have inßuenced the econ-

omy’s response. Furthermore, and motivated by recent evidence pointing to signiÞcant changes

over time in the Fed’s monetary policy rule, we analyze the diﬀerences across two subperiods: the

pre-Volcker period and the more recent Volcker-Greenspan era.2

    Our theoretical analysis focuses on three alternative monetary policy rules. First, we derive

and characterize the optimal policy. In the context of our model that policy is the one that fully

stabilizes prices. Second, we derive the equilibrium responses to a technology shock of a number of

variables under such a rule, and compare those responses to the ones generated by two alternative

speciÞcations of monetary policy: a simple Taylor rule and a constant money growth rule. We

then confront the three sets of theoretical responses with the empirical ones, and try to ascertain

which rule—if any— provides a better approximation to the systematic response of the Fed to the

omy’s response to any type of shock.

supply shocks under consideration.

        Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, we detect signiÞcant diﬀerences across

periods in the response of interest rates, prices, and output to a technology shock. Second, the

Fed’s response to that shock in the Volcker-Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal rule.

Third, in the pre-Volcker period the Fed’s policy tends to overstabilize output, thus generating ex-

cessive inßation volatility. Hence, our evidence reinforces recent results in the literature suggesting

an improvement in the Fed’s performance.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we derive and characterize

the economy’s equilibrium under the three rules considered. In section 3 we present our evidence

on the Fed’s systematic response to technology shocks, and compare the empirical responses with

the theoretical counterparts. Section 4 concludes.


2         Technology Shocks and Monetary Policy in a Sticky Price
          Model
2.1        A Baseline Sticky Price Model

In this section we lay out a simple version of the Calvo (1983) model with staggered price setting,

which we take as a reference framework for the analysis of monetary policy. Next we describe

brießy the main ingredients.3

        We assume a continuum of Þrms, indexed by subscript i ∈ [0, 1], each producing a diﬀerentiated

good with a technology

                                                Yt (i) = At Nt (i)

where (log) productivity at ≡ log(At ) follows the exogenous process:


                                              ∆at = ρ ∆at−1 + εt


with ρ ∈ [0, 1). For simplicity, and given our objective, we assume that such variations in aggregate

productivity are the only source of ßuctuations in the economy. For the sake of simplicity, the
    3   A detailed derivation can be found in Woodford (1996) and Yun (1996), among others.

analysis that follows ignores capital accumulation. As discussed below, most of the qualitative

results stressed in the present paper as well as the implications for optimal monetary policy are

not aﬀected by that simplifying assumption.

   The representative household is inÞnitely-lived and seeks to maximize

     Ct (i)  ε  di      is a consumption index and N denotes hours of work.

   The log-linearized Euler equation associated with the consumer’s problem, combined with the

market clearing condition Yt = Ct , yields:



                                     1
                            yt = −     (rt − Et {πt+1 } − rr) + Et {yt+1 }                        (2)
                                     σ

where yt denotes (log) aggregate output, rt is the nominal interest rate, πt+1 is the rate of inßation

between t and t + 1, and rr ≡ − log β represents the steady state real interest rate.

   The labor market is perfectly competitive, with the labor supply schedule associated with the

solution to the consumer’s problem being given by wt − pt = σ ct + ϕ nt , where wt denotes the

(log) nominal wage, pt is the (log) aggregate price level, and nt ≡ log(Nt ). Hence, all Þrms face a

common real marginal cost mct = wt − pt − at . Clearing of goods and labor markets implies



                                   mct = (σ + ϕ) yt − (1 + ϕ) at                                  (3)

   Each Þrm faces an isoelastic demand for its product (generated by the solution to the con-

sumer’s problem), and takes the path of aggregate variables as given. If all Þrms adjust prices

optimally each period (ßexible prices), the price-marginal cost markup is common across Þrms,
                                    ε                                ε
constant over time, and equal to   ε−1 .   Accordingly, mct = − log ε−1 ≡ mc, for all t. Hence, under

ßexible prices, the equilibrium processes for output, employment, and the expected real rate are

independent of monetary policy and given by:


                                                   yt∗ = γ + ψ at


                                                n∗t = γ + (ψ − 1) at

                                               rrt∗ = rr + σρψ ∆at

               1+ϕ               mc
where ψ ≡      σ+ϕ   and γ ≡    σ+ϕ .   We refer to the above equilibrium values as the natural levels of

output, employment, and the real interest rate, respectively.

      If, on the other hand, Þrms can adjust prices only infrequently, the markup (and, hence, the

real marginal cost) will no longer be constant. As a result a gap between actual output and its

natural level may emerge. We denote that gap by xt ≡ yt − yt∗ and refer to it as the output gap.

It follows from (3), together with the previous deÞnition, that the output gap will be proportional

the deviation of real marginal cost from its frictionless level, i.e., its level under ßexible prices.

                 c t = (σ + ϕ) xt , where mc
Formally we have mc                       c t ≡ mct − mc.

      The exact form of the equation describing aggregate inßation dynamics depends on the way

sticky prices are modeled. Here we follow Calvo (1983), and assume that each Þrm resets its price

in any given period only with probability 1 − θ, independently of other Þrms and of the time

elapsed since the last adjustment. Thus, each period a measure 1 − θ of producers reset their

prices, while a fraction θ keep their prices unchanged. In that case, the aggregation of optimal

price-setting decisions can be shown to yield the familiar new Phillips curve:



                                             πt = β Et {π t+1 } + κ xt                                (4)

              (1−θ)(1−βθ)(σ+ϕ) 4
where κ ≡             θ       .

      Finally, we can rewrite equilibrium condition (2) in terms of the output gap and the natural

rate of interest:
  4   See, e.g., Galí and Gertler (1998) for a derivation.

      Equations (4) and (5), together with a speciÞcation of monetary policy (i.e., of how the interest

rate is determined), describe the equilibrium dynamics of the model economy in the presence of

exogenous variations in aggregate technology. Next we analyze the economy’s response to such

disturbances under alternative speciÞcations of monetary policy.

2.2      The Dynamic Eﬀects of Technology Shocks

In this section we consider three alternative speciÞcations of the systematic component of mon-

etary policy: the optimal monetary policy, a simple Taylor rule, and a constant money growth

rule (henceforth, a money rule). Our analysis focuses on how the nature of that systematic pol-

icy component aﬀects the equilibrium responses of diﬀerent variables to a permanent shock to

technology.

2.2.1     Optimal Monetary Policy


The model economy described above may be plagued by a variety of distortions (market power,

valuable money, etc.). We follow a number of recent papers in the literature and maintain the

assumption that all such distortions, with the exception of the existence of nominal rigidities, have

already been corrected by means of appropriate non-monetary interventions.5          Accordingly, the

natural level of output and employment coincide with their eﬃcient levels. In such an environ-

ment monetary policy should aim at replicating the allocation associated with the ßexible price

equilibrium. Hence, the monetary authority focuses on correcting a distortion that is monetary

in nature. The optimal policy requires that


                                                 xt = πt = 0
  5   See, e.g., Rotemberg and Woodford (1999), among others.




                                                       4
all t. While the presence of other distortions (in addition to staggered price setting) may lead to

deviations from the previous policy, recent analyses based on calibrated models have suggested

that those deviations are likely to be quantitatively small.6

   Our baseline model turns out to have a simple and appealing property: the allocation associated

with the ßexible price equilibrium can be exactly replicated with an appropriate policy, at least

under the assumption that productivity can be observed contemporaneously by the monetary

authority. Using (5), such allocation can be implemented in practice using the interest rate rule


                                        rt = rr + σρψ ∆at + φπ π t

for any φπ > 1.7 Hence, the equilibrium behavior of the nominal rate rt (as well as the real rate

rrt ) can be represented by the process


                                    rt = (1 − ρ) rr + ρ rt−1 + σρψ εt

   The equilibrium response of output and employment will match that of their natural levels:

                                          ∆yt = ρ ∆yt−1 + ψ εt

                                       ∆nt = ρ ∆nt−1 + (ψ − 1) εt

   Thus, as in the ßexible price case, a permanent technology shock leads to a proportional change

in output under the optimal policy, while the sign of the response of employment depends on the

strength of the wealth eﬀect, as determined by the size of σ. The lack of strong evidence of a unit

root in hours in postwar U.S. data suggests a value for σ (and hence ψ) equal or close to one.

That property motivates the calibration used below.

   Notice also that the equilibrium behavior of the interest rate depends on the persistence of

productivity growth. Thus, when productivity is a pure random walk (ρ = 0) both nominal and

real interest rates remain constant.
   6 See, e.g., Goodfriend and King (2001) and Woodford (2001) for an extended discussion of the case for price

stability and its robustness to the presence of a variety of distortions.
   7 The presence of the inßation term with a coeﬃcient greater then unity guarantees the uniqueness of the

equilibrium. See, e.g., Woodford (2000) for a detailed discussion.


                                                      5
      While the above analysis has been restricted, for the sake of exposition, to a model economy

with labor as the only productive input, it is important to realize that allowing for capital accu-

mulation would not aﬀect the basic principle for optimal monetary policy principle emphasized

above, namely, the desirability of price-level stabilization. In the presence of capital, however, the

equilibrium dynamics for output, hours, and the interest rate under the optimal policy will diﬀer

somewhat from the ones derived above. In particular, their representation will include an addi-

tional state variable (the capital stock), and will correspond (by construction) to the equilibrium

dynamics of a standard stochastic growth model with a nonstationary technology.8

2.2.2     A Simple Taylor Rule


Suppose that the central bank follows the rule



                                              rt = rr + φπ πt + φx xt                             (6)

i.e., the nominal rate responds systematically to the contemporaneous values of inßation and the

output gap. This is a version of the rule put forward by John Taylor as a good characterization

of U.S. monetary policy, and analyzed in numerous recent papers.9

      Substituting out (6) into expressions (4) and (5) the equilibrium dynamics can be represented

by the system:

       As is well known, there exists a range of values for coeﬃcients (φx , φπ ) such that the equilibrium

is indeterminate, giving rise to the possibility of sunspot ßuctuations. If we restrict ourselves to

non-negative values of φx and φπ , a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the previous dynamical

where Γ ≡ [Γx , Γπ ]0 = [I − ρAT ]−1 BT . Given the equilibrium path for xt it is straightforward to

solve for the corresponding trajectories of output and employment:


                                                  yt = γ + xt + ψ at



                                               nt = γ + xt + (ψ − 1) at


with the equilibrium behavior of the nominal rate given by (6). Notice that only in the case of a

random walk process for technology (ρ = 0), will the Taylor rule supports the optimal allocation

(for BT = 0, in that case).

       The line with squares in Figure 1 represents the equilibrium responses of diﬀerent variables

to a technology shock under a simple Taylor rule. We calibrate the inßation coeﬃcient using the

value suggested in Taylor (1993), namely, φπ = 1.5. The output gap coeﬃcient φx is set to zero.11

 For comparison purposes we also show the corresponding responses under the optimal policy,
  10   See, e.g., Bullard and Mitra (2001).
  11  As argued by Galí (1999), the notion of output gap used in conventional Taylor rules does not generally
correspond to the model-based concept of output gap used here. The latter, deÞned as the deviation of output
from its natural level, is an unobservable variable, which motivates its omission from any simple rule. None of our
results hinge on that assumption, however.

represented by the line with triangles. The remaining parameters were set at the following values:

σ = 1, β = 0.99, ϕ = 1, ρ = 0.2, and θ = 0.75.

    We observe that under the assumed Taylor rule output and employment increase beyond their

natural levels in response to a positive technology shock, which leads to a temporary rise in

inßation. Hence, the policy response implied by the Taylor rule appears not to be suﬃciently

contractionary. This is reßected in the fact that the path of the real rate under that rule lies

uniformly below the path associated with the optimal policy.

    Notice, however, that the deviations from the optimal policy are quantitatively small. Further-

more, they could be reduced further by choosing a more aggressive response (higher values for φπ

and φx ). Yet, it should be clear that no Þnite values for those parameters could possibly replicate

the optimal responses. The reason is straightforward: supporting the optimal response requires

that prices remain stable and that the real rate increases. Accordingly, the nominal interest rate

should also increase. But the rule will not generate a rise in the nominal rate unless a deviation

from the optimal response occurs (in the form of positive inßation or output gap).12

2.2.3    A Monetary Targeting Rule


Suppose next that the monetary authority targets the rate of growth of the money supply. For-

mally,

                                                mt − mt−1 = γ m                                                  (7)

where m denotes the quantity of money in circulation, expressed in logs. Henceforth, and without

loss of generality we set γ m = 0, which is consistent with zero inßation in the steady state.

    The demand for money holdings is assumed to take a conventional form:


                                              mt − pt = yt − η rt
  12 It would take setting either φ or φ equal to inÞnity to achieve the optimal allocation. Such a rule would
                                     π     x
potentially lead to huge instrument-instability: any small deviation of inßation or the output gap from zero (perhaps
resulting from small measurement errors or imperfect credibility) might imply inÞnite changes in the rate. The lack
of credibility of such a policy might be more than warranted since it would be inconsistent with the zero-bound on
nominal rates.

   Letting m∗t ≡ mt − pt − ψat we can rewrite the money demand in terms of stationary variables

only:

                                              m∗t = xt − η rt

   Furthermore, it follows from the deÞnition of m∗t and (7) that

   The line with squares in Figure 2 represents the equilibrium responses of diﬀerent variables to a

technology shock, under the assumption that the central bank keeps the money supply unchanged.

Again, the line with triangles displays the responses under the optimal policy.

   A comparison of the responses under the two rules makes clear that, in the face of a favorable

productivity shock, money targeting implies a monetary stance that is too tight: the resulting

path for the real interest rate lies uniformly above the optimal one. As a consequence, output

does not increase as much as would be eﬃcient, and employment declines.



                                                      9
    Notice also that the nominal rate remains unchanged under constant money growth. That

result, however, is not general: it hinges on our speciÞc calibration of σ. More generally, constant

money growth implies that the interest rate is given by:13
                                        µ          ∞ µ
                                                  ¶X             ¶k−1
                                            σ−1             η
                            rt = rr +                                   Et {∆yt+k }                         (8)
                                            1+η            1+η
                                                   k=1

    Hence, if utility is logarithmic in consumption, the nominal rate is constant, and independent

of output dynamics.14 Furthermore, it is easy to show that constant money growth will generally

lead to a suboptimal response of the economy to a technology shock. The reason is simple: the

optimal response requires that ∆yt = ψ∆at and rt = rr + σρψ ∆at , for all t. But the latter

conditions are not consistent with (8), except for a particular conÞguration of parameter values.15



    How signiÞcant are the deviations from the optimal responses that follow from adherence to a

strict money targeting rule under our calibrated model ? The results shown in Figure 2 suggest

that they are far from negligible: thus, a one percent shock to productivity leads to a change of

about 150 basis points in the rate of inßation, and more than 50 basis points in employment and

the output gap (the three variables remain constant under the optimal policy). On that basis one

should conclude that a money targeting rule is likely to be less desirable than a simple Taylor

rule, at least when technology shocks are the dominant source of ßuctuations.


3     The Fed’s Response to Technology Shocks: Evidence

This section provides evidence on the Fed’s systematic response to technology shocks and its

implications for U.S. output, hours and inßation. We also discuss the extent to which those

responses are consistent with any of the rules considered in the previous section.
  13 To see this, diﬀerence the money demand equation (imposing ∆m = 0), combine it with (2), and solve the
                                                                  t
resulting diﬀerence equation forward.
  14 The reader may notice the connection of that result with the literature on the liquidity eﬀect. A detailed

analysis along those lines can be found in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1997) and Andrés, López-Salido,
and Vallés (1999).
 15 See Galí (2000) for a more detailed analysis of the deviations from optimality implied by money targeting as

well as other policy rules.

3.1      IdentiÞcation and Estimation

The empirical eﬀects of technology shocks are determined through the estimation of a structural

VAR. The latter is partially-identiÞed: given our limited objective we do not attempt to identify

sources of ßuctuations other than exogenous variations in technology. Our identifying restriction

is that only technology shocks may have a permanent eﬀect on the level of labor productivity, as

originally proposed in Galí (1999). That restriction is satisÞed by a broad range of business cycle

models, under standard assumptions.

      Our VAR model contains four variables: labor productivity, hours, the real interest rate and

inßation. We specify labor productivity in log Þrst diﬀerences, in accordance with the maintained

hypothesis of a unit root in that variable. Hours are measured in log deviations from a Þtted

linear trend. Both the real rate and inßation enter in levels.16

      Our hours series is the log of total employee hours in nonagricultural establishments. Labor

productivity was constructed subtracting the previous variable to the log of GDP. Both, hours and

GDP were normalize by working age population. The nominal interest rate is the three-month

Treasury bill rate and the price is measured with the log of the CPI. All the series used are

quarterly and were drawn from CITIBASE.

      Our analysis covers the sample period 1954:I-1998:III. A number of authors have argued that

U.S. monetary policy has experienced important structural changes over that period. The existing

evidence suggests splitting the sample into two subperiods: the pre-Volcker years and the more

recent Volcker-Greenspan era.17 In addition, we remove the period 79:III-82:II from our analysis,

because of the unusual operating procedures that were eﬀective during that episode.18

      Table 1 reports some summary statistics on the estimated reduced form VAR system (with

four lags). The third and fourth columns of the Table report the p-values for the null that the
  16 We have also estimated the VAR model with Þrst diﬀerenced hours and inßation. None of the main qualitative

results reported below were aﬀected.
 17   See, e.g. Taylor (1993) and Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000).
 18   See Bernanke and Mihov (1998) for formal evidence of the idiosincracy of that period.



                                                        11
coeﬃcients on the dependent variable’s own lags (third column), or those associated with the

remaining variables (fourth column) are zero. The next two columns report the R2 and the

Durbin-Watson statistics for each equation and subsample.

   In order to assess the plausibility of our identiÞcation scheme we compare our estimated tech-

nology shocks with the alternative measure constructed by Basu, Fernald and Kimball (BFK,

1998) using conventional growth accounting methods. The latter generalizes the Solow residual

by allowing for increasing returns, imperfect competition, and variable input utilization rates.

The BFK measure is only available until 1989 on an annual basis; hence, and for the sake of

comparison, we annualize our VAR-based technology shock measure (by averaging across quarters

within a calendar year), and adjust the sample period accordingly. Figure 3 displays both the

VAR-based and the BFK technology shock measures. While far from being identical, the series

display a strong positive comovement which is apparent in the Þgure, with an associated correla-

tion coeﬃcient of 0.59. Given that the methodologies used to construct both series are unrelated,

we view the previous evidence as reinforcing the plausibility of our identiÞcation scheme.

   Next we describe the evidence on the eﬀects of technology shocks and the associated policy

response, starting with the most recent subperiod.

3.2     The Volcker-Greenspan Era

Figure 4 displays, for the 1982:3-1998:3 period, the estimated response of a number of variables to

a positive technology shock, together with associated two standard errors conÞdence interval. The

size of the shock is normalized to one standard deviation. The Figure also shows the corresponding

impulse-responses under the optimal policy.19 Figure 5 supplements that evidence by displaying

the 95% acceptance interval for the null hypothesis of a zero response of all horizons for hours

and inßation, together with the estimated responses themselves.20 That null corresponds to the
  19 In order to match the observed response of productivity as closely as possible, the optimal responses shown

in the Figure are constructed under the assumption of a random walk process for technology, with the size of the
shock chosen so that the implied long run response of productivity matches the estimated one.
  20 The darker bars represent the point estimates of the impulse responses and the lighter bars represent a ± 2

standard deviations conÞdence intervals.


                                                      12
optimal policy outcome in our model.

      In Figure 4, we observe an impact jump in the level of productivity of about 0.3 percent. That

variable stabilizes at slightly lower level later on. The output response is of a similar magnitude and

sign. As a result, hours are hardly aﬀected by the shock even though the point estimates suggest

a delayed positive eﬀect, but one which is quantitatively very small. Similar muted responses can

be observed for inßation and interest rates (both nominal and real). Thus, while the estimated

impact eﬀect on real interest rate is slightly positive, we cannot reject the null of a zero response

at all horizons for both hours and inßation, as shown in Figure 5. The latter result suggests that

the Fed’s response to technology shocks in the Volcker-Greenspan period is consistent with the

optimal one, as implied by our simple sticky price model.21

3.3      The Pre-Volcker Period

Figures 6 and 7 display the corresponding evidence for the pre-Volcker period (1954:I-1979:II).

In Figure 6, the proÞle of the estimated response of productivity suggests the presence of some

positive autocorrelation in its Þrst diﬀerence, in contrast with the near random walk behavior

observed in the Volcker-Greenspan period. Accordingly, the responses under the optimal policy

that are also displayed in Figure 6 are based on a calibration of the technology process that seeks

to mimick the estimated productivity response.22

      Notice that the initial output response is slightly negative; only after Þve quarters the eﬀect

becomes positive and keeps building up gradually. The response of hours on impact is signiÞcantly

negative and quite large; that eﬀect is reversed only after two years.23             The existence of a large

deviation between those responses and the ones associated with the optimal policy is clearly

apparent. In particular, the persistent negative output gap that arises in the wake of the shock

is behind the negative eﬀect on inßation, which contrasts with the requirement of price stability
  21 As discussed in the previous section, and given our assumption of a random walk process for technology, that

optimal response could indeed be supported by a Taylor rule.
 22   To approximate the observed path of productivity we set ρ = 0.7 in our calibrated model.
 23   Similar Þndings were obtained by Galí (1999) and Basu, Fernald and Kimball (1998).



                                                       13
implied by the optimal policy. Formal evidence of the signiÞcance of the deviations in hours and

inßation from their optimal path is shown in Figure 7.

       Underlying those results is the response of real interest rate. The latter lies above the optimal

response at most horizons which might explain the gap between the actual and optimal output

responses. Even though the nominal rate is shown to decline in response to the shock, the size of

the reduction falls short that of inßation, which translates into a persistently higher real rate. In

other words, changes in nominal rate are insuﬃcient to counteract the eﬀect of technology shock

on inßation.24

       We Þnd it worth stressing here that the allowance for capital accumulation would hardly help

reconcile the estimated response of hours for the pre-Volcker period with one consistent with the

optimal policy. Indeed, for standard calibrations of the capital-augmented model, the response of

hours to a technology shock has the opposite sign to the one estimated for that period (i.e., the

model predicts that hours should increase in response to a positive technology shock).25

       A comparison of the estimated responses for the pre-Volcker period and those generated by the

money rule (see Figures 2 and 4) may be suggestive of some qualitative similarities. In particular,

both imply an excessively tight policy in response to a positive technology shock, which tends to

destabilize hours and inßation (while over-stabilizing output). In order to assesss empirically the

plausibility that the Fed followed a monetary targeting rule (conditional on technology shocks) we

have also estimated our VAR for the pre-Vocker period including M1 and M2 growth as additional

variables. Figure 8 displays the estimated response of those monetary aggregates (in growth rates

and levels) to our identiÞed technology shock. As the Figure clearly shows, we detect a signiÞcant

deviation from a policy that sought to insulate the path of monetary aggregates from the eﬀects

of the shock. That evidence thus calls into question the tentative interpretation given above,
  24 This is consistent with the estimates of the unconditional interest rates rule for the same period obtained by

Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000).
  25Nevertheless, it is possible to generate a short run decrease in hours in the face of a positive technology shock
under a calibration of preferences implying a suﬃciently strong wealth eﬀect (i.e., a high σ). See, e.g., Rotemberg
and Woodford (1996).



                                                         14
and is not in disaccord with descriptions of monetary policy in the pre-Volcker period as one

characterized by frequent misses of monetary targets.26


4      Conclusions

In this paper we have estimated the Fed’s systematic response to technology shocks and its impli-

cations for U.S. output, hours and inßation. The analysis of that evidence allows us to evaluate

the extent to which the Fed has sought to stabilize prices in response to such shocks, as would

be prescribed by the optimal policy in an environment in which the presence of staggered price

setting is the main distortion to be corrected by the monetary authority. Our key results can be

summarized as follows. First, we detect signiÞcant diﬀerences across periods in the response of the

economy (as well as the Fed’s) to a technology shock. Second, the Fed’s response to a technology

shock in the Volcker-Greenspan period appears to be consistent with a rule that seeks to stabilize

prices and the output gap. Third, estimates for the pre-Volcker period suggest that the Fed’s

policy tended to over-stabilize output, thus generating excess volatility in inßation. Our evidence

reinforces recent results in the literature suggesting an improvement over the postwar period in

the way the Fed has conducted monetary policy.
