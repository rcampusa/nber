We examine the role of state and local policies to encourage social distancing, including stay at
home orders, public school closures, and restrictions on restaurants, entertainment, and large
social gatherings. Outcomes come from cell phone records and include foot traffic in six
industries (essential and nonessential retail, entertainment, hotel, restaurant, and business
services) plus the fraction of cell phones that are home all day. Structural break models show
mobility series at the national and state levels start to change dramatically in a short window from
March 8-14, well before state or local restrictions of note are in place. In difference-in-difference
models, declarations of state of emergency reduce foot traffic and increase social distancing.
Stay at home restrictions explain a modest fraction of the change in behavior across outcomes.
Industry-specific restrictions have large impacts. For example, restrictions on dining in
restaurants reduce traffic in restaurants, hotels, and nonessential retail. Private, self-regulating
behavior explains more than three-quarters of the decline in foot traffic in most industries.
Restrictive regulation explains half the decline in foot traffic in essential retail and 75 percent of
the increase in the fraction home all day. In this latter result, public school closings have a
substantial effect.

I.      Introduction

        In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, many state and local governments

have adopted a series of orders that encourage social distancing. A variety of scholars have examined the

impact of these orders, including Alexander and Karger (2020), Abouk and Heydari (2020), Dave et al. (2020a

and 2020b), Gupta et al. (2020), and Goolsbee and Syverson (2020). The focal point for many has been stay

at home (henceforth, SAH) restrictions that ask people to shelter in place unless it is necessary to go out.

Necessary trips could include shopping for food, medical supplies or other necessities, going to work, seeking

medical attention, or using essential services such as the post office, gas stations, car repair, etc. Forty-three

states and 294 counties have adopted SAH restrictions, though many have since been relaxed.

        The SAH restrictions have been the center of intense political debate. Many see SAH restrictions as

a key regulatory intervention to reduce the spread of the virus. The American Medical Association sent a

letter to all governors urging states to adopt SAH restrictions.1 At the same time, many consider SAH

restrictions to be the cause of recent wide-spread economic dislocation. Protests against SAH restrictions

have occurred in a number of states.2

        In this paper, we use foot traffic data from cell phone records provided by SafeGraph to estimate the

impact of state and county SAH restrictions on foot traffic in six key industries (nonessential and essential

retail, entertainment, hotel, restaurant, and business services), plus an aggregate measure of social distancing

(the fraction of cell phones home all day). The former six declined substantially as the pandemic aged while

the latter increased considerably. However, individuals started to shelter in place before governments

adopted these behavioral restrictions. Using structural break models from macroeconomics, we find that in a

seven-day period from March 8-14, industry-specific foot traffic measured at the national level dropped

dramatically, well before any state or local restrictions of note were in place. For most mobility measures we

analyze, the structural shift occurs in most states in a very short period. For example, during the three-day

window from March 10-12, 45 states saw a structural break in the fraction of people who stay at home all day.

The similarity of these dates across states and the fact that these dates predate most regularity interventions

suggests that individuals and business responded to new information about the pandemic and engaged in self-

regulation.

        The window when most mobility series break is also a period when many states declared a state of

emergency (henceforth, SOE) in anticipation of local infections. We say “in anticipation” because 45 states

made declarations before recording their first COVID-related death. These declarations typically grant state

governments certain powers and make them eligible for federal funds; however, they impose no restrictions

on the behaviors of firms or individuals. Despite this, our results indicate that SOE declarations generated

sharp increases in social distancing and declines in foot traffic. Most state and local social distancing orders

come one to four weeks after the SOE declaration, after foot traffic has declined precipitously. Our models

suggest that SAH orders had modest impacts on mobility, and in most situations, the majority of the decline

was a private response to health concerns rather than a response to regulation.

        We exploit state and county variation in the adoption date of specific social distancing orders to

estimate their impact on the mobility measures outlined above. The orders we consider are declarations of a

SOE, public school closings, bans on dine-in restaurants, restrictions on entertainment, bans on gatherings

above 50 people, and SAH restrictions. In the business services industry, employers’ decisions about

employee remote work likely drives the response. In all other industries, foot traffic contains a mix of

individual customer responses and supply responses such as business closings.

        We highlight five key findings. First, SOE declarations reduce foot traffic and increase social

distancing by statistically significant amounts in all models. Between seven and 28 percent of the total decline

in mobility is due to SOE declarations. Second, SAH restrictions explain between three and 26 percent of the

decline, depending on the mobility measure. Third, restrictions on particular industries have predictable and

measurable impacts, similar in magnitude to the SAH restrictions. For example, restrictions on dining in

restaurants reduce traffic in restaurants, hotels, and nonessential retail. Entertainment bans reduce traffic in

that sector, as well as in restaurants. Fourth, bans on gatherings of 50 or more people have little impact on

most sectors. Finally, private, self-regulating behavior explains over three quarters of the decline in foot


                                                        2
traffic in discretionary industries (i.e., restaurants, hotels, entertainment, and nonessential retail). Regulation

plays a larger role in reducing foot traffic in essential retail, accounting for just under half of the overall

decline. Regulation, and the closure of public schools in particular, have a substantial effect on the fraction of

the population staying at home all day, accounting for just under three quarters of the overall increase.

         We contribute to an expanding economics literature on the impact of government policies to

encourage social distancing in the wake of COVID-19. Using a variety of econometric techniques, authors

have argued that SAH restrictions increased social distancing by roughly 40% 2-3 weeks after implementation

(Abouk and Heydari, 2020; Dave et al., 2020a), which reduced consumer activity (Alexander and Karger,

2020) and case incidence rates (Friedson et al., 2020; Dave et al., 2020a, 2020b). However, Gupta et al. (2020)

show that SAH restrictions, which occur late relative to other policies, account for a small share of the total

decline in mobility.3 These authors attribute early mobility declines to SOE declarations, (local) first case and

death announcements, and school closures. We extend Gupta et al. (2020) by studying heterogeneity in policy

effects across industries and by using event study models that simultaneously account for a number of state

and local COVID-19 orders. Finally, Goolsbee and Syverson (2020) also use SafeGraph data to estimate the

impact of SAH orders on mobility across industries but use an identification strategy that takes advantage of

states in the same commuting zone that impose SAH orders at different times. The authors found that SAH

orders account for just 11 percent of the total drop in foot traffic across industries. The authors also show

interesting substitution patterns between high and low volume stores, as well as essential vs. nonessential

stores in response to the SAH order. We extend Goolsbee and Syverson’s (2020) industry-level analysis by

estimating the effect of additional local COVID-19 orders and by allowing for policy effects to change over

time.

         Others have pointed out the rapid decline in economic activity that occurs in the early part of March.

Baker et al. (2020) and Cox et al. (2020) show a marked decline in consumer spending that occurs right after




3Both Dave et. al (2020) and Gupta et al. (2020) use SafeGraph data and (slightly different) event-study models to
estimate the impact of stay at home restrictions on the share of the population staying at home on a given day. Both
estimate significant increases in stay at home rates between 1.5 and 4 percentage points.

the national emergency is declared on March 13. Rojas et al. (2020) show a massive increase in

unemployment insurance claims starting the week of March 15-21.

         Our paper is unique to these in two dimensions. First, our time series models indicate that the timing

of the structural break in mobility was incredibly concentrated across industries, suggesting information at the

national level was a critical factor in individual decision-making. We also show that structural breaks within

industries are concentrated across states. These models indicate that industries specializing in more

discretionary items experienced reductions in foot traffic earlier than those selling necessities. Second, we are

the first to aggregate policy effects, that allows us to determine the share of the total mobility decline that is

due to policies designed to limit mobility and social distancing. An important finding from this work is that

between 74 and 83 percent of the drop in mobility to discretionary locals is due to non-regulatory responses

by individuals and businesses, while restrictive regulation is effective at inducing more extreme behaviors,

such as staying home all day or reducing essential retail shopping.



II.      Data

         There are two sets of data for this project. The first is from SafeGraph and contains aggregated,

high-frequency geolocation data collected across 40 million cellular devices that have opted-in to location

sharing services. This data has been used extensively to measure various aspects of the pandemic.4

         The SafeGraph data contain two data series. The Weekly Places Patterns series (V2.1) has hourly

counts of foot traffic to about 4 million points of interest in the US. The data identify a location’s NAICS

code, which we aggregate to the county-by-industry level. We consider three industries likely impacted by

social distancing, including entertainment (NAICS 2-digit code 71), hotels (4-digit code 7211), and restaurants

(which includes 7225 for restaurants and 7224 for drinking places). We generate two measures of retail

traffic. The first we call essential retail, which includes building material (4441), lawn and garden (4442),

grocery (4451), specialty food (4452), and auto part (4413) retailers, as well as car dealers (4411), other general



4A short list includes Allcott et al. (2020), Goldfarb and Tucker (2020), Anderson et al. (2020), Dhave et al. (2020a and
2020b), Nguyen et al. (2020), Simonov et al. (2020), Gupta et al. (2020), and Goolsbee and Syverson (2020).

                                                            4
merchandising5 (452319), and pharmacies (446110). We label the second group nonessential retail and it

includes any establishment in the 2-digit sector of 44 or 45 not in the first group.

         Any pandemic-related decline in foot traffic to the establishments above would be a combination of

demand and supply factors. On the demand side, people may be less willing to visit restaurants or other

establishments as the pandemic takes hold. Likewise, this could be supply driven as some establishments,

either voluntarily or because of legal restrictions, close down or reduce hours during the pandemic.

Therefore, the declines would be a combination of employees not heading to work and customers not visiting

these establishments

         A final group we consider is labeled business services, which includes the following 2-digit NAICS

industries: information (51); finance and insurance (52); real estate (53); professional, scientific, and technical

services (54); and management of companies and enterprises (55). Declines in foot traffic in this industry are

most likely related to declines in employees heading to work, as the industries are service driven and technical,

meaning business can be conducted remotely/virtually.

         We use a second SafeGraph series constructed specifically for the pandemic called the Social

Distancing Metrics (V2.1) and it includes an omnibus measure of social distancing -- the fraction of cell

phones that stay at home all day. A “home” is the common nighttime location at the Geohash-7 level

granularity (~153 m x ~153 m) for the device over a 6-week period.

         We combine the cell phone data above with a second data set containing the passage date of a variety

of state and local orders that encourage social distancing and possibly restrict the activities of individuals. We

gathered these data from a variety of sources: the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 web page;6 the

National Association of Counties;7 Wikipedia,8 and Education Week.9 These sources had considerable

variation across them in detail and dates that we reconciled with web searches. We collected passage dates on

Family Dollar, to name a few.

seven orders: SOE declaration, SAH restriction, and prohibitions on in-person public K-12 education, dining

in restaurants, certain entertainment venues, and gatherings of over 50 people.10 The first three orders we

collect at the county and state level, while the last three (which were rare at the county level) we collect only at

the state level. For SOE, SAH, and school closure, we use the earlier date of either the state or the county

restriction.11

         In Figure 1, we report the fraction of the population in the US covered by these orders. We measure

population at the county level. There is variation across counties for SOE, SAH, and school closings but only

state variation for the other orders. The horizontal axis contains individual days and the vertical axis contains

the percent of the population covered by that day. In the graph, we also report the percent of the population

that lives in a county that has reported its first COVID-19 case and death.

         Twenty percent of the population lives in a county with a case by March 5. This number increases

rapidly and is 93 percent by the end of the month. The first regulatory action is typically the declaration of

SOE and that number moves from five percent on March 3 to 100 percent by March 16. These declarations

impose few, if any, restrictions on individuals and firms. States and local governments can declare a SOE for

a variety of reasons including such events as disasters, public health emergencies, climatic events, or civil

unrest. The declaration identifies certain rules and regulations that are waived or suspended during the

emergency. It also gives the governor, mayor, or county authority to expend funds or deploy personnel,

equipment, or supplies. In some cases, a SOE qualifies the state for resources from the Federal Emergency

Management Agency.

         Washington was the first to declare a SOE, on February 29, the day they experience their first

COVID-19 death. Forty-six states then declare emergencies in the nine-day period from March 5 through




10 Many jurisdictions also imposed bans on gatherings of 500 or more, but we examine this more restrictive measure in
this paper.
11 County SOE declarations commonly follow the state’s SOE, meaning the state’s SOE takes precedence. Of the 865

local SOE declarations we identify, only 22 precede the state declaration. County SAH restriction are more likely to
precede the state. Of the 428 county SAH restrictions we identify, 294 precede the state’s restriction. 485 counties closed
their public schools prior to the state forcing them to do so. SAH restrictions and public school closures are most
common in the largest counties. While just 9 (15) percent of counties passed a SAH (public school closure) prior to their
state, the counties contain roughly 30 (29) percent of the US population.

March 13. The last state to declare was West Virginia on March 16. The declaration of a SOE usually comes

after states have their first case but before their first deaths. The SOE precedes the first death in 45 states, by

an average of 9.5 days.

         Public school closures occur at the local level first then gravitate to the state level. We define a

county as having a school closure if one public school closes within the county. Almost 500 counties closed

schools prior to the state closing all schools. School closures happen as quicky as SOE’s but with a lag. Ten

percent of the population is covered by a closure on March 12. This increases to 50 percent just 3 days later

and 99 percent by the 22nd. State-wide bans on restaurant dine-in, large gatherings, and entertainment venues

follow the SOE and over 90 percent of the population is covered by all three by March 23.12 The last action

is the passage of SAH restrictions. No county or state has a SAH restriction on March 15 but 50 percent of

the country is covered by March 24 and 80 percent by March 29. About four percent of the population is

never covered by a SAH restriction.13 Of the counties that faced SAH restrictions, they occur on average

15.8 days after a SOE declaration and three days prior to the first death.


III.     Some Basic Times Series Data about Social Distancing and Foot Traffic

         We outline the basics of our results in a set of four figures. In Figure 2a, we graph the natural log of

daily foot traffic in the nonessential retail sector in the US from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Note that traffic

was declining slowly through early March, then falls by 60 percent over the next month, and rebounded some

after mid-April. In Appendix Figure A1 we report daily foot traffic for the five other industries outlined

above (essential retail, entertainment, hotel, restaurant, and business services) and the daily at home rate, an

omnibus measure of social distancing, over the same time interval,. These mobility series mirror that of

nonessential retail several with commonalities. First, there is a pronounced weekly pattern. Second, most

series seem to “break” the week prior to March 15, a topic we return to below. Third, all series bottom out in



12Delaware passed a dine-in restaurant ban and entertainment ban the day before their SOE. Both Maine and West
Virginia announced the closure of their public schools the day before their SOE. A total of 132 counties, representing 7
percent of the population, closed public schools prior to the SOE. Of these, 73 closed public schools the day before the
SOE.
13Nebraska, the Dakotas, Arizona, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Utah never passed state-level SAH restrictions, though

populous counties in the latter four states passed their own restrictions.

                                                           7
a short window between April 15-19. Fourth, the magnitudes of the declines are dramatic. From the seven-

day period ending March 13 through the minimums of seven-day moving averages, declines range from 39

percent (essential retail) to 76 percent (hotels).

           Figure 1 indicates that most social distancing orders occurred after March 15 while the results in

Figures 2a and Appendix Figure A1 suggest that most series start declining before that date. We can date

when these seven national time series break using techniques from macro times series analysis that identify

when a likely regime switch occurred.14

           We use data ranging from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Let yt be the mobility measure of interest. For

a time-series that breaks at period c, we generate a dummy variable Atc that equals 1 if t  c and zero

otherwise. Let timet be a linear time trend that equals 1 on New Year’s Day and increases by 1 each day and

DOW ( j )t be a dummy variable for the day of the week (j=1 to 6). The model is cubic in time before and

after the break point c and we allow the day of week effects to vary before and after the break. The equation

is of the form

                   6                                                    3                          3
(1) yt    [ DOW ( j )t (1  Atc )bj  DOW ( j )t Atcaj ]   timetk (1  Atc ) bk   timetk Atc ak   t
                  j 1                                                 k 1                       k 1



where  t is a random error. We vary the break point from February 15 to April 15 and select the date c that

maximizes the F test for the joint hypothesis that H0 : aj  bj , ak  bk for all j=1, 2, … ,6 and k=1,2,3.

           We report in Table 1 the results for the seven national series we consider. The first column lists the

series and the second column lists the date when the regime switch occurred nationally. The F-statistic

outlined above and the critical value for the F-test is from Andrew (1993).

           The table contains three important results. First, the structural breaks all occur in a short window

from March 8 to 14, well before most restrictions occur in Figure 1. Second, the order in which industries

experienced structural breaks in their foot traffic makes sense. Industries specializing in more discretionary




14   Quandt (1960) first outlined the methods and Hansen (2001) provides an informative survey.

                                                            8
items are the first to switch (e.g., entertainment, restaurants) and less discretionary items are the last (e.g.,

essential retail). Third, in all cases, we can easily reject the null hypothesis.

         The timing of the structural break is sharp. In Appendix Figure A2 we report the actual time series

(black line) and the OLS estimate of equation (1) at the optimal break point (dotted light gray line) for two

series: the natural log of non-essential retail visits and the at home rate. On each graph, we also produce the

F-statistic when the model is evaluated at different break points. The time series model fits the data well in

both cases. The graph of the F-statistic demonstrates there is a sharp break in both series at the break point.

         The clustering of the trend breaks across series is mirrored by a clustering of trend break dates across

states for a particular series. For each of the outcomes in Table 1, we estimate equation (1) for each state. In

the right-hand side of the table, we report the number of states that break on particular days in March. For

most outcomes, the breaks are clustered in a small set of dates. The at home rate breaks in a three-day period

from March 10-12 for 45 states. Forty-nine states break for restaurants over a six-day period from March 8-

13. On March 7 and 8, 30 states break for entertainment and 24 break for hotels. On March 13 and 14, 48

states break for business services, 32 break for nonessential retail, and 44 break for essential retail.

         The similarity across states in the break points and the timing of these changes relative to the

adoption of social distancing restrictions suggests that individuals and firms reacted to the same set of

information across states. This is not surprising. In Appendix Table 1, we produce a timeline of major

events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Note the events occurring the week before March 15 that

illustrate the potential scale of the pandemic, including the WHO declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, the

cancellation of the, the NBA, NHL, Premier League suspend operation, and a federal foreign travel ban.

         Most of these regime changes are occurring when states are declaring SOEs, potentially providing

evidence that governments expect the crisis to be problematic locally. The impact of the SOE on mobility is

illustrated in Figure 2b where we aggregate foot traffic data for nonessential retail to the county level, then

center the data on the SOE declaration, where the earliest declaration (i.e., state or county) is day zero. We

report data starting 20 days before and continuing 30 days after the declaration. This series is relatively flat

before the SOE but declines precipitously afterwards suggesting the information provided by the SOE altered


                                                           9
behavior. In Appendix Figure A3, we report similar graphs for the five other foot traffic series and the at

home rate, in the same order as in Appendix Figure A1. This exercise illustrates there was a dramatic drop in

foot traffic across industries following the SOE (Figures A3a-A3f) and an equally large increase in the at

home rate. In some cases, there seems to be a slight pre-existing downward trend in foot traffic (e.g., for

hotels), but in other cases, the trend is moving opposite expectations (e.g., for the at home rate and essential

retail).

           In Figure 2c, we center the nonessential retail foot traffic data around the earliest state or county

SAH restriction faced by the jurisdiction, excluding counties with no such restriction. This figure

demonstrates that much of the decrease in traffic began well before any SAH restrictions were in place. In

Appendix Figure A4, we report the data for the other mobility measures. In all cases, large mobility declines

are observed prior to any SAH restrictions.

           Despite the results in Figure 2c and Appendix Figure A4, SAH restrictions appear to play a role in

encouraging social distancing. In Figure 2d, we re-center the nonessential retail data around the earliest

declaration of a SOE and graph an index of the outcomes for counties that had and never had a SAH

restriction in effect. We use the index to remove scale differences across sectors and set the index to 1 on

day -1. Note that as there is a 1-4 week delay between SOE declarations and SAH restriction; the two series

track well for about 12 days after SOE declarations but ultimately diverge, with less foot traffic for people in

counties under SAH orders. This figure suggests that for this mobility measure, SAH played a limited role.

We reproduce this finding in Appendix Figure A5 for the six other mobility measures. These graphs suggest

that SAH orders enhanced the decline in foot traffic, with strongest effect in entertainment, essential retail

and the at home rate, but with limited impact on business services, restaurants, and hotels.



IV.        Main Empirical Specification

           We consider next whether the intuitive results from the figures above hold up under a more

structured econometric analysis. The problems are two-fold. First, Figures 2b and Appendix Figure A3

suggest that SOE declarations potentially have an impact on mobility. At the same time, that the drop in


                                                          10
economic activity across states occurred in a narrow window of time indicates the possibility of a national

response. Second, Figures 2c and Appendix Figure A4 indicate there are key pre-treatment trends in

outcomes before SAH were adopted. We attempt to control for these factors in an event study design within

a difference-in-difference specification that exploits the variation across states and counties in the timing of

the various social distancing orders.

        Let 𝑌𝑐𝑡 denote the mobility measure of interest in county 𝑐 on day 𝑡. The variable is logged for all

foot traffic measures and is linear for the at home rate. Define 𝑋𝑐 as the date that policy 𝑋 was passed in

county 𝑐. We then define 𝑃𝑂𝐿𝑋𝑐𝑡 = 𝑡 − 𝑋𝑐 , which measures the days since the policy’s passage – e.g.,

𝑃𝑂𝐿𝑋𝑐𝑡 = −7 a week before policy 𝑋 passes, 𝑃𝑂𝐿𝑋𝑐𝑡 = 0 the day policy 𝑋 passes, and 𝑃𝑂𝐿𝑋𝑐𝑡 = 7 a week

after policy 𝑋 passes. Our econometric specification is then

                                −1                      8    𝑇ℎ
(2)                    𝑌𝑐𝑡 = ∑ 𝛽𝑘1 1{𝑃𝑂𝐿1𝑐𝑡 =𝑘} + ∑ ∑ 𝛽𝑗ℎ 1{𝑃𝑂𝐿ℎ =𝑗} + 𝛼𝑐 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜖𝑐𝑡
                                                                        𝑐𝑡
                              𝑘=−10                   ℎ=1 𝑗=0


where 𝛼𝑐 is a county fixed effect, 𝛿𝑡 is a date fixed effect, and 𝜖𝑐𝑡 is the econometric error. We measure the

impact of six policies, denoted by ℎ, and estimate separate policy effects, 𝛽𝑗 , for each day post-passage.

County and state policies are not passed in a vacuum. Local infections and deaths influence policy timing as

well as individual decision making. As such, we also control for the time since first COVID-19 case (ℎ = 7)

and time since first COVID-19 death (ℎ = 8) in the county. The date fixed effects control for the common

response across all counties to the information shocks outlined in the timeline in Appendix Table A1

        Since SOEs, ℎ = 1, were the first COVID-19 policy in nearly every county, we allow for differential

pre-policy effects, 𝛽𝑘1 , in the ten days preceding the SOE declaration. For each county, we include all days

between February 15 and 30 days post-SOE, meaning the reference period for SOE effects is the time

between February 15 and eleven days prior to the SOE declaration. Because our panel is unbalanced,

different counties are exposed non-SOE policies for different lengths of time. As a result, the total number of




                                                        11
estimated post-policy effects varies by policy.15 In all models, we weight observations by the number of

devices in a county. We cluster standard errors at the state level.



V.       Event Study Results

         We present the event study estimates in Appendix Figures A6-A12. Each figure corresponds to one

of our seven mobility measures and each panel within a figure corresponds to one of the six policies plus the

days in relation to the first death and the first case. Consider, for example, Panel A of Appendix Figure A6.

This panel plots a subset of regression coefficients from Equation 2 where the dependent variable is the log

of nonessential retail foot traffic. The plotted coefficients measure, relative to baseline, the daily impact of the

SOE on foot traffic. The dashed grey lines measure the 95% confidence interval for each parameter estimate.

         Given the sheer number of coefficients, in Table 2, we summarize our estimates across mobility

measures by reporting regression coefficients 7, 14, and 21 days post-policy. There are several important

findings. First, we find that banning gatherings of 50 or more people had little impact on foot traffic across

industries. Second, the SOE declaration and SAH restriction significantly reduced mobility by 7 days after

passage for all mobility measures. For SAH, 14-day effects remain statistically significant across mobility

measures, while for SOE, after 21 days, results remain significant for retail, hotel, restaurant, and business

services traffic. Appendix Figures A6-A12 show that SOE effects generally grow over time, while the SAH

response tends to be large immediately following the policy, but grows little over time. For all mobility

measures other than hotel foot traffic, the two-week SAH effect is larger than the two-week SOE effect.

         We find that restaurant dine-in bans have large effects on restaurant foot traffic. In fact, two weeks

post-policy, the dine-in ban had a larger effect on restaurants than any other policy – the ban yielded a

roughly 15 percent reduction in traffic. Results are similar for entertainment bans on the entertainment

industry. The dine-in and entertainment bans lead to large reductions in foot traffic in complementary

industries as well. For example, the dine-in ban reduced foot traffic in nonessential retail and hotels, the latter


15For the SOE, we estimate policy effects up to 30 days post-policy. For the remaining policies, we estimate the
following number of post-policy effects: stay at home order, 19; ban on gatherings greater than fifty, 26; entertainment
and gym ban, 26; restaurant dine-in ban, 27; and public-school closure, 28.

                                                           12
of which often contain restaurants; i.e., some of the foot traffic categorized as hotel traffic is truly restaurant

traffic. Moreover, the entertainment ban reduced restaurant traffic, which is sensible. If the entertainment ban

prevents evenings out for events, then people also avoid restaurants in the process.

            Closing public schools reduces foot traffic across industries, while having a substantial effect on the

at home rate. That public school closures have the largest effect on the at home rate is unsurprising. A large

fraction of cell phone carriers are students, parents of students, or school employees. For these individuals,

staying at home all day is virtually impossible when schools are in session, but feasible when not. The fact that

public school closures significantly reduced foot traffic in business service and hotel industries highlights the

role that parents play as full-time caretakers in the absence of school, as going to the office, much less

conducting business travel, becomes difficult once children are home.

            Finally, the first death in the county has a very large and statistically significant impact on all mobility

measures. In most cases, the impact of the first death is larger than any single policy effect and it grows over

time. Importantly, when population weighted, the average county experiences their first death just three days

after their SAH restriction; thus, the estimated effect of SAH on mobility is sensitive to the inclusion of time

since first death. Though not shown, SAH effects increase by 60 percent on average when we exclude time

since first death and case from the model.



VI.         Private Precaution vs. Public Restrictions

            Next, we use our estimates from the previous section to determine the degree to which COVID-19

mobility changes are attributable to private precautions vs. public restrictions. We begin by predicting the

aggregate change in mobility from a baseline period 11 to 17 days prior to the SOE declaration until 25 days

after the SOE.16 We report the aggregate change in the outcome of interest from this baseline period in

column (1) of Table 3. This is either the percent reduction for the foot traffic measures or the percentage

point change for the at home rate. Next, we predict mobility in the absence of state and county orders, which

allow us to calculate what fraction of the total change in mobility is attributable to SOE declarations, SAH


16   Figure A3 shows that 25 days post-SOE is when foot traffic trends flattened.

                                                             13
restrictions, and all other policies, reported in columns (2)-(4), respectively. In the final column, we report the

fraction of the aggregate change due to a private response which is the simply 100% minus the percent

changes in columns (3) and (4).

         The key result is in the final column. For industries specializing in discretionary goods and services

(i.e., nonessential retail, entertainment, hotel, restaurant, and business services), 74 to 83 percent of the

decline in foot traffic is due to a private response on the part of citizens and is not a behavioral change due to

regulation. About half the decline in essential retail is due to regulation, despite the fact that all restrictions

explicity allowed for this sort of shopping. This finding suggests that the SAH (as well as other restrictive

orders) served as an informational treatment, warning citizens of the severity of the virus locally, in addition

to formally restricting mobility. In that sense, the proportion of the overall mobility decline that we attribute

to restrictive policy in column 5, which is relatively small, is likely an over estimate. Finally, restrictive

regulation has the largest impact on the fraction of individuals staying home all day, accounting for nearly

three quarters of the total change. Though not shown, a the most effective policy for keeping individuals at

home all day is closing public schools, which alone, accounts for 27 percent of the total change in the at

home rate.



VII.     Discussion

         We find that self-imposed, precautionary behavior accounts for a large fraction of the overall decline

in discretionary mobility following the arrival of COVID-19. Restrictive regulations explain half of the

decline in foot traffic in essential retail, despite the fact that regulations allowed such shopping, suggesting

that even the most restrictive policies had important informational effects that also altered private behavior.

Restrictive regulation explains a majority of the increase in individuals staying at home all day; in particular,

we find that closing public schools materially changes this outcome.

         That precautionary behavior plays a large role is not surprising. Individual businesses were well

ahead of most state policy interventions in their response to the pandemic. Google, Twitter, Amazon,




                                                          14
Facebook and Microsoft told their workforces by March 6 to work from home.17 The University of

Washington was the first university to move to remote classes on March 6,18 but by March 13, 300

universities had suspended in-person classes.19 Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Nordstrom closed all stores

nationwide on March 17,20 while the largest mall operator in the country, Simons Property Group, closed all

its malls the next day.21

         This paper also contributes to a broader literature in health economics that examines the importance

of behavioral responses to external health shocks as a way of mitigating individual risk. Theoretical models

have demonstrated that modest changes in avoidance behavior can have important implications for the

spread and incidence of an infectious disease (Kremer, 1996; Geoffard and Philipson, 1997; Funk et al., 2009;

Chen et al., 2011). At the same time, a large empirical literature demonstrates that individuals respond to

external events and adopt avoidance behavior. For example, individuals respond to high pollution level by

spending less time outside (Bresnahan et al., 1997; Neidell, 2009;) and purchase particulate-filtering facemasks

(Zhang and Mu, 2018). There is some evidence of a reduction in high-risk sexual activity in response to the

AIDS epidemic (McKusick et al., 2011; Ng’weshemi et al., 1996; Bloom et al., 2000), although some argue the

response was modest at best (e.g., Oster, 2012). Individuals with contaminated town water switch to bottled

water (Zivin et al., 2011). Previous viral pandemics provide substantial evidence of avoidance behavior. A

summary of 26 surveys from previous pandemics shows broad changes in avoidance behavior across many

counties including increased mask wearing, more frequent hand washing, and social distancing (Bish and

Michie, 2010). This literature of course has its antecedents – e.g., the classic work of Peltzman (1975) argues

rising automobile safety encouraged drivers to take more risks.

         We do not intent to suggest that regulation in this context is of little value. Indeed, restrictive

policies that encourage social distancing do alter outcomes. Such policies are particularly effective in eliciting

extreme behaviors, such as preventing essential retail shopping and inducing individuals to stay at home all

day. Instead, our findings suggest that governments are well positioned to induce precautionary behavior by

informing citizens of the risks they face, as evidenced by the impact of SOEs and the occurring of initial

incidence of mortality at a local level on social distancing and mobility.

Notes: The at home rate is the percentage of residents that stay home all day on a given day. Foot traffic is
measured as the number of individuals visiting industry-specific firms on a given day. Firms are classified
into industries via NAICS code. Baseline mobility is calculated using predicted average mobility in the 11-
17 days prior to a state of emergency order. Other orders include bans on indoor dining, gatherings of
more than 50 people, gyms and entertainment, and public school closures.
