        When should a government       provide a service inhouse and when should it contract out

provision?   We develop a model in which the provider can invest in improving the quality of service

or reducing cost, If contracts are incomplete, the private provider has a stronger incentive to engage

in both quality improvement and cost reduction than a government employee. However, the private

contractor’s incentive to engage in cost reduction is typically too strong because he ignores the

adverse effect on non-contractible   quality.    The model is applied to understanding   the costs and

benefits of prison privatization.

1. Introduction.

        As a general rule, government employees provide most services paid for with

tax revenues,       such as the police,         the military,      operation    of prisons,       fire

departments and schools, collection of garbage, and so on.                     Yet in some cases,

these senices       are privatized through government contracting out their provision

to private suppliers.        The choice between Lnhouse provision and contracting out

has proved to be quite controversial.            Advocates of government contracting point

out that private suppliers deliver public services at a lower cost than public

employees (Savas 1982, 1987, hgan          1990).      The critics of government contracting,

while quibbling with these figures, stress that the quality of public services

that    private   contractors    deliver    is     inferior   to    that   delivered     by   public

employees    (AFSCME 1985, Shichor 1995).             In this paper, we develop a theory of

government ownership and contracting that may throw lighten                 the cost and quality

of service under alternative provision modes.

        The perspectivewe     adopt is thatof         incomplete contracts (Grossman and Hart

1986, Hart and Moore 1990, Hart 1995).           Suppose that apublic-spirited          politician

chooses between having a senice          delivered by a public agency and contracting it

out .   In the first case, the politician has to hire some public employees, and

give them employment contracts specifying what they need to do.                       In the second

case, the politician has to sign a contract with a private supplier who in turn

contracts    with    his   employees.      If    the politician      can   sign   a    complete    or

comprehensive contract (with either employees or a contractor), he can achieve

the same     outcome   in each   case.      From      the traditional      incentive    viewpoint,

motivating the contractors and the public employees presents the same problem to

the politician even in the presence of ❑oral hazard and adverse selection.                         TO

understand    the costs and benefits        of contracting         out, we need to consider a
                                                    2

situation where contracts are incomplete and where residual rights of control in

uncontracted for circumstances are important in determining agents’ incentives.

         The assumption of contractual incompleteness is not hard to ❑otivate once

it is recognized that the quality of semice                  the government wants often cannot

be fully specified.          Indeed, critics of privatization            frequently appeal to the

argument that private contractors would cut quality in the process of cutting

costs because        contracts     do not adequately        guard    against   this possibility.

Critics    of private       schools     fear that such schools,          even if paid for by the

government     (e.g., through vouchers),          would find ways to reject expensive-to-

educate children, who have learning or behavioral problems, without violating the

letter of their contracts.          Critics also worry that private schools would replace

expensive teachers with cheaper teachers’ aides, thereby jeopardizing the quality

of education.        In the discussion of public vs private health care, the pervasive

concern is that private hospitals would find ways to save ❑oney by                         shirking on

the quality of         care or rejecting the extremely sick                and expensive-to-treat

patients.       In    the   case    of   prisons,       concern   that   private     providers     hire

unqualified    guards to save costs, thereby undermining                  safety and security of

prisoners,    is a key objection          to privatization,          Fear that contracts         cannot

assure    adequate     quality     is    at   the heart     of    many   debates    over     government

contracting,

         In some cases, the problems of contractual incompleteness make the case for

in-house provisionby         the government straightfomard.              For example, a gove~ent

would    not contract       out   the conduct    of its foreign policy             because    unforseen

contingencies    are a key part of foreign policy, and a private contractor would

have enormous power to ❑aximize its own wealth                    (by, for instance, refusing to

send troops somewhere) without violating                 the letter of the contract.             If the
                                                   3

government wants such a contractor to do something different, it would have to

pay possibly huge amounts to renegotiate the contract.                    Put differently, getting

the right level of quality out of a private contractor might be very expensive,

On the other hand, for senices           provided on a routine basis, with relatively few

surprises, contracts can be made relatively complete.                     For example, contractual

incompleteness does not play an important role in garbage collection or towing                             ‘

of automobiles, and great sacrifices of quality are not likely to come from cost-

cutting by private contractors.            On the other hand, the efficiency                gains from

cost-cutting may be substantial.              For these services, therefore, the normative

case for privatization        is compelling.       It is also important to recognize that,

for many activities, such as just about any industry, private contractors deliver

both lower costs and higher quality.            As a general rule, government ownership is

a mistake     on    both   margins.     Our    ❑odel     tries     to   explain   both    why   private

contracting is generally cheaper, and why in some circumstances                         it may deliver

a higher, while in others a lower, quality level than inhouse provision by the

government.

      Many discussions        of privatization         lump together the issue of public or

private ownership with the issue of competition.                    That is, those who advocate

privatization       often do so on the grounds            that private      ownership      allows    the

benefits   of competition       to be reaped.      We believe that the identification                 of

privatization with competition is misleading.                 In principle,        it is possible to

have several government-owned          firms competing to supply the public, or several

❑anagement teams competing for the right to run a government enterprise                          (e.g. ,

a prison).         It is also possible        to have     a private       firm with      no effective

competitors (a monopoly).        Our analysis is based on the idea that the fundamental

difference    between      private    and public       ownership    concerns      the   allocation    of
                                                 4

residual     control    rights,     rather    than   the    degree     of    competition       per   se.

Competition may strengthen the case for privatization--in                    fact we show that it

does under some conditions- -but only because the allocation of residual control

rights is different under privatization.             In this paper we deal with the role of

competition only briefly, although we believe that this is a very important topic

for future research.

        In the next      section    of   the paper,    we present        a model      of    government

contracting which focuses on these quality issues.                The basic idea of the model

is that the provider of the senice           -- whether a government employee or a private

contractor    -- can invest his time to improve the quality of the service or to

reduce its cost.       The cost reduction, however, has an adverse effect on quality.

Neither innovation is contractible ex ante.                However, both types of innovation,

to be implemented,       require the approval of the owner of the asset, such as a

prison, a hospital, or a school.             If the provider is a government employee, he

needs   the government’s        approval     to implement     either    improvement,         since   the

government retains residual control rights over the asset.                      As a result, the

employee     receives    only   a   fraction    of   the    returns     to   either    the     quality

improvement or the       cost reduction.       Moreover, there may be a limit to how well

a goveruent      employee can be compensated          for either        improvement        because   the

employee is replaceable.

        In contrast, if the provider is a private contractor, he has the residual

control rights over the asset,             and hence does not need to get the government

approval for a cost reduction.           At the same time, if he wants to improve quality

and get a higher price, he needs to negotiate with                     the government        since the

government is the buyer of the senice.               However, he is no longer replaceable.

As a consequence, the private contractor generally has a stronger incentive to
                                                    5

engage    in either       qulity    improvement     or cost     reduction   than the government

employee.     But, the private contractor’s incentive to engage in cost reduction

is typically ~        strong since he ignores the adverse impact on quality.

         We analyze       this ❑odel   in Section        3 and establish    several propositions

concerning     the    relative       efficiency     of     inhouae   provision    and    government

contracting.         In    general,    the    bigger     the   adverse   consequences        of   (non-

contractible)    cost cutting on (non-contractible) quality, the stronger is the

case for inhouse provision.            The efficiency of inhouse provision also turns on

the strength of the incentives of government employees, and on the importance to

the government of generating quality innovations.                 We show in Section 3 that the

conclusions emerging from the model are generally extremely intuitive, including

the result that private provision is generally cheaper, but may generate either

higher or lower quality. Section 3 also briefly addresses a key omission from the

model, namely the possibility of ex post competition between contractors, which

typically strengthens the case for privatization.

      The basic ❑odel in Section 2 deals with a benevolent government.                        Many of

the concerns about government contracting, however, deal with the reality of a

less than perfect government, in which politicians are corrupt or interested in

favoring their political supporters to attract votes.                    In section 4, we argue

that public corruption creates a bias toward excessive privatization, whereas an

interest in votes of public employees creates the reverse bias.                        With selfish

politicians,    the efficiency of alternative arrangements turns on which failure

of the public sector is the most important.

      In    section       5,   we   apply    the   framework    of   sections    2-4    to    discuss

privatization of prisons.           Should the government contract out the operations of

prisons to private firms, who then have power over incarceration and treatment
                                                     6

of convicts?       Private prisons have been growing rapidly in the United States,

although    they still hold only about 3 percent of prisoners,                        Critics voice a

strong concern about the quality of private incarceration,                       including the quality

of prisoner life, the incidence of prison violence by inmates and use of force

by guards, escapes, and to a lesser extent rehabilitation.

      The    analysis      of prison      privatization         fits nicely      into our    framework.

Although    many     aspects    of quality       can in fact be contracted           for, and prison

contracts    tend     to   be    rather       elaborate    documents,      significant      contractual

incompleteness remains.           For example, it is hard to write a contract completely

specifying     the     conditions       for    the   use   of      force    by    guards,    since   the

circumstances      under which         force is justified        are subject       to interpretation.

Private contractors, then, might use force excessively to restrain prisoners if

this reduces costs.             Even more important, it is difficult               to specify in the

contract the quality of employees, such as guards and managers, that a private

contractor    hires.       Hiring      cheaper    employees      (within   the limits       set by   the

contract) can save a private contractor              ❑oneybut     is likely to reduce the quality

of prisoner treatment.           hst    but not least, some recent evidence indicates that

the government’s ability to write and enforce the best possible contract should

not be taken for granted.           Overall, the theoretical results of sections 3 and 4,

when combined with         the available evidence,          suggest some skepticism          about the

wisdom of prison privatization.

      Our results ❑ay help in thinking about other government services as well.

In particular,       the parameters of the ❑odel, namely the adverse quality effects

of cost reduction, the importance of quality innovation, and the incentives                          of

government employees,           as well as possibilities          of competition which we do not

formally model, may shed light on the wisdom of privatization of such activities
                                                  7

as defense procurement, garbage collection, police and armed forces, education,

and health.         In section 6, we discuss in         ❑ ore   general terms the applicability

of our framework to the study of government contracting.

      Ours     is    certainly    not     the   first    normative     analysis    of   gover~ent

contractin~.        Some of the issues addressed in our paper are raised in the now-                  ,

classic book by Wilson (1989).            Economists working in this area have generally

focused on traditional       adverse selection and moral hazard problems                raised by

contracting (hffont       and Tirole 1993, Tirole 1994), as well as on competitive and

anti-monopoly problems following privatization                  (Vickers and Yarrow 1988).    Some

recent studies have examined contractual incompleteness                  (Schmidt 1996, Shapiro

and Willig 1990, bffont      and Tirole 1993), Unlike our work, they have emphasized

informational losses from contracting or the costs of having multiple bosses.

Theoretically, our paper is new primarily in reemphasizing the role of incomplete

information in contracting, and emphasizing the critical importance of quality

issues.     In this regard, our paper           is related       to the work of Holmstrom       and

Milgrom   (1991, 1994) who, in a comprehensive contracting                 framework, note that

providing    an agent with       strong   incentives      to pursue one objective,        such as

profits, can lead to his shirking on other objectives,                   such as quality.       Our

framework is different from theirs, although at a very general level the issues

we are interested       in are similar.         In addition,        the existing   literature    is

primarily theoretical, and does not go into too much detail about the problems

of specific sectors, such as prisons3.


     ‘There is also a considerable literature on positive aspects of
contracting; see e.g. Shleifer and Vishny (1994) and Savas (1982, 1987).

     %ere   are some exceptions.  For example, Vickers and Yarrow (1988)
discuss the possible decline in quality at British Telecom following
privatization and price cap regulation. Domberger, Hall and Li (1995) examine
the consequences for price and quality of contracting out cleaning se~ices.
2.     The Model

Basic Assumptions

         In this section we present a simple model of the choice between the public

and private provision of a good, such as prison, hospital, or school services.

        Suppose that society, represented by the government, wants a certain good

or semice        to be provided.        We assume   that consumers         cannot buy    this good

directly    in     the   marketplace,     e.g.,   because   it   is    a    public    good.4     One

possibility is to contract out the provision of this good, e.g., the government

can write a contract with a private company to run a prison for five years.                        A

second possibility       is to provide the good ‘in-house,” e.g. , the government can

arrange for public employees to run the prison.             The ❑odel is based on the idea

that the crucial distinction between these arrangements concerns who has residual

rights of control over the nonhuman assets used to provide the service--we call

these assets       the “facility     F“ (e.g., the prison).           If the good is publicly

provided,    then    the government      (represented   by a bureaucrat),            as owner,   has

residual control rights over the facility.              If the good is privately provided,

then    the private      provider,   as owner,    has   residual   control      rights    over   the

facility.     Residual control rights matter because they determine who has the

authority    to approve changes         in procedure or innovations         in uncontracted      for

contingencies.5



     4This assumption ❑akes good sense in the case of prisons but is more
controversial in the case of schools or hospitals.

     ‘See Grossman and Hart (1986). What may be ❑ ore important is not who
owns the physical prison, but who has the right to use it (perhaps for a
restricted period of time). For exemple, the government ❑ay own the prison,
but sell the right to operate it to a private company for n years (a
franchising arrangement).  In this case, the private company has residual
control rights during the n year period. In this paper, we do not distinguish
between physical ownership and possession of the right to use the prison.

       We   suppose   that    the    facility--public   or private--is     run by    a   single

manager/worker, M.        There is also a single bureaucrat or politician, represented

byG.   We start by considering the case where the bureaucrat perfectly represents

the interests of society, i.e., there is no agency problem between the bureaucrat

and society. 6     hter    we consider self-interested bureaucrats and politicians.

       We assume that G and M are able to write a long-term contract specifying

some aspects of the good or service to be provided and the price.                  In fact, we

suppose that a long-term contract is required in the case where F is private in

order to support relationship-specific             investments. 7    We call the good thus

described in the contract the “basic” good and denote its price by PO.                   PO has

different   interpretations      according   to whether    the facility    F is private      or

public .    If F is private,        i.e., M owns F, then PO is the price that M as an

independent contractor receives for providing the basic good.                  If F iS public,

i.e., G 0-S       F, then PO is the wage that M receives as an employee.                 In the

latter case provision        of the basic    good can be regarded       as part of M’s job

description, i.e., M does not get paid unless he provides the good.

       Although    G and M can specify        some aspects    of    the good    or senice    in

advance, we suppose that there are others that they cannot specify.                 We have in

mind that various contingencies can arise which call for some ❑edification of the


     %0 be more precise, we assume that G’s utility function is given by the
welfare of the rest of society, excluding M. A justification for this is that
the political process aligns G’s and society’s interests (since M has
negligible voting power his interests receive negligible weight). As will
become clear, if G’s utility encompassed M’s interests as well, the first-best
could be achieved.

     ‘We do not ❑odel these relationship-specific investments explicitly.
However, they might correspond to physical investments, e.g. , building the
prison. We have in mind that the owner ❑ ust incur these investment costs
since if a non-owner incurs the cost he can be held up by the owner. For the
idea that a long-term contract is required to support relationship-specific
investments, see Kleinet al. (1978) and Williamson (1985).

basic good.     For instance, H can suggest a way to modify the prison to increase

security.     Alternatively, H may find a way to reduce costs by hiring cheaper (or

fewer) guards.     Our assumption is that there are so many possible contingencies

ex ante that it is impossible to anticipate them all and contract on how to deal

with them in advance. *     Instead the parties revise the contract ex post once it          ,

is clear what     the relevant     contingencies   are.     We refer   to the basic   good

modified to allow for relevant contingencies as the “modified good.”

         The modified good yields a benefit B to society and costs the ❑anager C to

produce.     C is a cost borne directly by M.       For example, B might be the social

benefit from having a prison with few fights between inmates and well fed and

healthy prisoners.      Although B camot    be measured or verified (it does not show

up in any accounts), we suppose that it can be represented by a dollar amount.

Similarly, C can be represented in dollars.

         The manager can ❑anipulate B andC    through prior effort choices.     We assume

that M can devote effort to two types of “innovation” relative to the basic good:

a cost innovation and a quality innovation.            We suppose that a cost innovation

leads to a reduction in costs C but is typically accompanied by a reduction in

quality    (i.e., B).    Similarly,    a quality   imovation    leads to an increase   in

quality, but is typically accompanied by an increase in costs.           Specifically, we

write:



                            B-BO      - b(e) + ~(i),

                            C-CO-c(e),




     8     For a further discussion, see Hart (1995).
                                                  11

where e, i denote effort devoted to the cost innovation and quality innovation,

respectively;        c(e)>    O   is the   reduction      in cost    corresponding         to    the   cost

innovation;     b(e)z     O   is the reduction      in quality       corresponding         to the cost

imovation;      and ~(i) z O is the quality increase net of costs from the quality

innovation.          The function b plays a key role in this model:                  it   ❑ easures     how   ,

much (non-contractible) quality might fall because of a (non-contractible) cost

cut , and hence se~es         as the variable that critics of privatization                     focus on.

       We     make     standard     assumptions    about     the    convexity,       concavity,         and

monotonicity of b, c and ~: b(0) -O,              b’ zO,     b“     zO;   c(O) -O,        c’(O) -=,      C’

>0,   C“<o,          C’(m) -o;     p(cj)-(), p’(o) --,       p’ >(), p“     <cl, p’(m) -o;             c’ -

b’    z O.     Note that the assumptions          c’-b’ z 0, ~’ > 0 say that the quality

reduction from a cost innovation does not offset the cost reduction; and the cost

increase from a quality            innovation does not offset the quality             increase. The

former, in particular,            is an important substantive         assumption,     since one can

imagine in principle that cost cutting by a contractor (e.g., failing to train

prison guards) produces social damage in excess of cost savings.                      Our assumption

rules out these cases, although they can be easily analyzed.

       The manager’s ex ante effort cost must be added to C to get M’s overall

costs . We write total effort costs as e + i, and assume a zero interest rate (no

discounting) .       Hence H’s overall costs are



               C+e+i-CO-c(e)+e                    +i.10


     %e need to keep track of the separate cost and quality components of the
cost imovation  (c and b), but not of the quality innovation.

     10 In an earlier version of this paper, we assumed a more complicated
cost-of-effort function in which e and i were substitutes (along the lines of
the ❑ulti-tasking work of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991)). The current ❑odel
generates simpler and easier-to-interpret results.
                                                 12

         One   important   assqtion      we    make    is    that both         the    cost     and   quality

innovations canbe      introduced without triggering a breach of the contract for the

basic good.      That is, although each innovation leads to a change in quality (in

the case of the cost innovation, a reduction in quality), the initial contract

is sufficiently vague or “incomplete” chat neither innovation violates it.

         We also assume that i, e, b, and c are obse~able                 to both G and H, but are

not verifiable       (to outsiders)     and hence        camot      be    part       of   an    enforceable

contract.       Similarly,   G’s   benefits     and    H’s    costs      are    obsenable,           but   not

verifiable      or   transferable,     which     means       that     revenue         and      cost-sharing

arrangements are infeasible.ll

         We suppose that G and M are at least partially locked into each other once

their relationship is underway.          Specifically, there is no facility other than

F available that can supply society and there is no other potential customer for

the service (e.g., a prison) apart from G,                  However, H’s labor semices                may be

partially substitutable       (see below).      Finally, we assume that M and G are risk

neutral and that there are no wealth constraints.                   A time-line is presented in

Figure 1.




Default Payoffs

         As noted, the parties want to renegotiate the contract at date 1 once they

learn the nature of potential          quality    improvements           and cost reductions.              we

assume    that G and M divide         the gains       from renegotiation             according       to Nash

bargaining, i.e., they split the surplus 50 : 50.                   This means that the parties’

default payoffs- -that is, what occurs in the absence of renegotiation-- influence

and revenue and cost-sharing arrangements, see Hart (1995).
                                                 13

final payoffs.

       We take the point of view that any cost or quality innovation requires the

agreement of the owner of the facility F, since iqlementing                   these innovations

involves a change in the way F is used.               Only the owner (the possessor of the

residual control rights) has the right to approve such a change.                      Thus, in the

case of a public facility, G needs to agree to any cost or quality innovation,

whereas, if the facility is private, M can implement these innovations without

G’s agreement.          However,   even   if the facilty      is private,     it is not    in M’s

interest to Introduce a qwlity            innovation without the approval of G since no

payment will be forthcoming for an uncontracted-for               quality improvement unless

G agrees to ❑ake it, i.e., unless a new contract is written.

       It remains to discuss the extent to which the fruits of M’s efforts e and

i are embodied in M’s human capital,            Suppose that if M has an idea about how to

reduce costs or increase quality then a fraction of the benefits of this idea

requires M’s participation but the remainder can be realized without M because

some   aspects     of    M’s   ideas   become   public    knowledge     (at   least   within     the

organization) . In particular, assume that, in the case where F is public, G can

realize a fraction O s (1 - A) s 1 of the net social gains -b(e) + c(e) + B(i)

from imovation      without M by hiring a different manager and paying him at cost.

If F is private, G can obtain none of these benefits since M has the residual

control   rights    and can prevent       any innovations.         The parameter       1 is very

important,   since      it effectively     measures      the weakness   of the    incentives     of

government   employees.         In the case 1 - 1, the public            employee     (warden)    is

irreplaceable, and hence can command the same share of the total rents in the

negotiation with G as a private manager.

       We can sum up the above discussion as follows:
                                                        14

        (A)   If     F   is    privately      owned,         then,    An    the   absence     of

                                       the cost innovation is implemented (since

              it is in H’s            interest to implement                it and M has the

              residual control rights) but the quality imovation                              is

              not (since no payment from G will be forthcoming).                            That

              is, G’s default payoff is BO - PO - b(e) am~’s                             default

              payoff is PO - CO + c(e) - e - i.



        (B)   If     F   is    publicly       owned,      then,      in     the   absence     of

              ~ene~otiation,           both   cost and quality              innovations      are

              implemented.            However, G       ❑ ust   replace M and hence gets

              only       a    share     (1    -   i)     of    the    gains       from    these

              imovations.             That is, G’s default payoff is BO - PO +

              (1 - A) [c(e) - b(e) + ~(i)] and H’s default payoff is

              Po - co - e - i“



me   First -Best

        It is useful to consider as a benchmark the first-best situation where e

and i are contractible (or equivalently, where long-term contracts describing the

modified good can be written).                In this case G and H would choose e and i to

maximize the total net surplus from their trading relationship, and divide the

surplus between them using lump-sum transfers.                       That is, in the first-best, G and

M solve:



(2.1)         Max (c(e) -b(e)           +~(i)      -e-i),
              e,i
                                             15

Given our assumptions,       (2.1) has a unique solution (e*, i*), characterized by

first order conditions:



(2.2)                  -b’(e*) + c’(e*) - 1,




(2.3)                  fi’(i*) -1.

At the social optimum, the marginal social           benefit of spending extra effort to

reduce costs, measured to take account of marginal quality deterioration, must

equal the marginal cost of that extra effort, which equals 1.             Similarly, the

marginal social benefit of spending extra effort to improve quality           ❑ ust   equal

the ❑arginal cost of that extra effort, which again equals 1.




Fauilibriwuner d       private OwnershiD

        Suppose Mowns    F. Then in lightof       (A), the renegotiation takes place over

the quality innovation.         The gains from renegotiation are ~(i), which are split

50 : 50.    (There is symmetric information about i.)         Thus, the parties’ payoffs

are



(2.4)         UG-BO-      PO + 1/2 O(i) - b(e),



(2.5)         u“-Po-      CO+    1/2 P(i) + c(e) - e - i.



Note that because M can reduce costs without seeking G’s approval, G bears              the

full brunt of quality deterioration resulting from cost reduction.

        Since the parties are assumed to have rational expectations, M chooses e

and i to maximize UH, that is, to solve
                                                 16

(2.6)          W   (1/2 P(i) + c(e) - e - i).
               e.i


Denote the (unique) solution by (eH, iM) (where H stands for ovnership by H).

The first order conditions for (2.6) are



(2.7)                        c’(eH) - 1,



(2.8)                        1/2 p’(i”) - 1.



There    are   two   deviations     from   first-best     here.      First,    M   ignores   the

deterioration of quality resulting from cost reduction, and hence exaggerates the

social benefit of cost reduction.              Second, because M   ❑ ust   get G’s approval to

implement a quality improvement, on the ❑argin he gets only half the benefits of

that improvement, which stunts his incentive to improve quality.

        The total surplus, SH, under M’s ovnership is then given by



(2.9) SM -U6+UM-B0          -CO-    b(eM) + c(eM) + P(iM) - eN - i~.



The price PO is chosen to allocate this surplus between the parties according to

their relative bargaining positions at date O.             The formula for S“ reflects the

fact that the parties bargain efficiently ex post, but there is a distortion in

relationship-specific      investments e and i.




Equilibrium un der Public OwnershiD

        Suppose G ovns F.    Then in light of (B) the renegotiation takes place over

the   fraction   1   of   both    the   cost    and   quality   innovations    that   G   cannot
                                            17

appropriate:    A[-b(e) + c(e) + ~(i)].      The gains are split 50 : 50, and so the

parties’ payoffs are




(2.10)         UG-BO-PO+(l         - A/2) [-b(e) + c(e) + ~(i)],



(2.11)         u“ - P. - CO+A/2     [-b(e) +c(e)   + ~(i)] - e - i.



Note that, in the case A - 1, when the ❑anager is completely irreplaceable, the

parties split the gains from innovation 50 : 50.           M chooses e and i to solve



(2.12)                -   (A/2 [-b(e) + c(e) + $(i)] - e - i).
                      e,i


Denote the (unique) solution by (eG, i~) (where G stands for ownership by G).

The first order conditions for (2.12) are




(2.13)                1/2 (-b’ (eG) + c’(e~)) - 1,



(2.14)                1/2 p’(i) - 1.



In contrast to the private ownership case, because the publicly-employed M needs

to negotiate the cost reduction with G, he takes account of quality reductions

that   may   result   from   cost-cutting   innovations.       However,   there   are   new

distortions in the case of public ownership.           First, for both quality and cost

innovation, the public manager needs the approval of G and hence surrenders half

the gains from trade.        Second, if Z< 1, the public ❑anager can be replaced, and

hence has even weaker        incentives to innovate.     Both of these factors stunt a
                                            18

public manager’s incentives.

         The total surplus, SG, under G ownership is then given by



(2.15)         SG -U6+UM-B0        -CO-   b(e~) + c(e~) + P(iG) - e~ - i~.



Again    the price PO is chosen     to allocate   the surplus at time O according       to

relative bargaining power.




Be   choice of WershiD        Structure

         The optimal ownership structure is the one that produces the largest total

surplus (the division of surplus can always be adjusted through po).            mat   is,




               G ownership is superior to M ownership

(2.16)         - SG > SH

               - -b(eG) + c(e~) + #(iG) - e~ - i~>     -b(eM) + c(e”) + p(i~) - eM - ‘“.



Renegotiation under symmetric information ensures that all ownership structures

yield an ex post efficient outcome.        The only difference between the ownership

structures concerns the choice of the ex ante investments e and i.



3.   Analysis of the Optimal Ownership Structure.

         A comparison of (2.1) and (2.6) shows that private ownership leads to two

distortions relative to the first-best.       First, M ignores the fact that e reduces

noncontractible    quality b(e);     in other words,    that he damages G through his

effort to reduce costs.       Second, M places 50% weight on the gains from quality

innovation    ~(i) as opposed     to 100% weight.      It follows immediately   from the
                                              19

first-order   conditions    (2.2),   (2.3),    (2.7),    (2.8) and   concavity    that e   is

inefficiently high and i is inefficiently 10U under private ownership.




~.                  ~>e*,     iM<    i*.




The private ownership equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 2.

        Consider next public ownership.        A comparison of (2.1) and (2.12) shows

that under public ownership, M does worry about the damage b(e). The reason is

that M cannot implement the cost reduction without G’s permission and so they

bargain about the net surplus -b(e) + c(e) from the cost-reducing                innovation.

However, H places weight A/2 on the gains from cost innovation -b(e) + c(e) and

on the gains from quality innovation ~(i), as opposed to 100% weight in the first

best,   It follows from the first-order conditions (2.13)-(2.14) that e and i are

both inefficiently low under public ownership.           Moreover i is lower under public

than under private ownership unless i - 1, i.e., unless M is irreplaceable.



~ronosition ~.   e~ < e*, IG s iM < i* (with IG < iH unless 2 - 1).




The public ownership equilibrium      is also illustrated in Figure 2.

        The trade-off between public and private ownership is now fairly clear.

Private ownership   leads to an excessively strong incentive to engage in cost

reduction   (eM > e*) and to moderate-- although          still   too weak--incentives     to

engage in quality improvement (IH < i*).           Public ownership removes the excessive

tendency to engage in cost reduction but replaces this with a weak incentive to

engage in both cost reduction and quality improvement.               Which arrangement     is

superior    therefore depends on which distortion is less damaging.
                                               20

      The next two propositions provide conditions under which private ownership

and public ownership can be ranked.




proposition 1.    (1) Suppose the function              is replaced byeb(e),         wheree    >0.

Then for O sufficiently small private ownership is superior to public ownership.

               (2) Suppose the function             is replacedby       Oh(e) and the function

c(e) is replacedby    ~(e),    where 6, # > 0.      Then, for 0, ~ sufficiently small and

A < 1, private ownership is superior to public ownership,




      Part (1) of Proposition 3 follows from the fact that, as O - 0, the damage

to quality    from cost reduction        disappears.        Under   these conditions,    private

ownership    leads to the efficient choice of e (since c’(e) = -b’(e) + c’(e)).

Since the level of i is always closer to the first-best under private ownership

than under public ownership, private ownership dominates public ownership.                     Part

(2) follows from the fact that, as 0, ~ - 0, e*, eM and e~ all converge to zero.

Thus # only the choice of i ❑atters; private ownership                  is better    than public

ownership because it yields a level of i closer to i*.

      Proposition 3 has a very natural interpretation.                There are basically two

cases when private ownership is unambiguously superior.                 The first case is when

the deterioration    of quality from cost reduction is small.                  In this case, the

stronger incentives that a private contractor has to reduce costs ~                      improve

quality are both desirable.           The second case is when the opportunities for cost

reduction     (and hence    the damage       to quality      as well)    are    small    and    the

government employees have relatively weak incentives (1 is small).                  In this case,

the private    contractor     would    not do much     of    the potentially      damaging     cost

reduction, and his stronger incentive to make quality innovations gives him the
                                             21

edge over inhouae provision.        Both of these are extremely intuitive cases.

         The cases where inhouse provision is superior are given by the following

result:




~.                   (1) Suppose    -b(e) + c(e) - od(e), where          o > 0.    Then   for o

sufficiently small and A sufficiently close to 1, public ownership is superior

to private ownership.

               (2) Suppose -b(e) +c(e)     -ad(e),   where 0>0.        suppose also that the

function ~(i) is replacedby        t~(i), where f>O,       nen   for a, t sufficiently small

public ownership is superior to private ownership.




          Part (1) follows from the fact that as a - 0 the social gains from cost

reduction converge to zero: the quality damage fully offsets the cost savings.

Thus the weak incentives for cost reduction under public ownership are socially

efficient.      In   contrast,   the   incentives    for    cost   reduction   under   private

ownership are inefficient, since the private owner ignores the substantial damage

b(e) .    If 1 is close to 1, the incentives for quality innovation under public

ownership are similar to those under private ownership, and so public ownership

dominates private ownership.

         Part (2) replaces the condition A close to 1 with the condition that t is

small.     In this case i*, i“ and ic are all approximately            zero and so only the

choice    of e matters.     For a small public        ownership      is superior   to private

ownership because it delivers a socially more efficient level of e.

         Proposition 4 as well has a very natural interpretation.            Public ownership

is most likely tobe     better when the adverse effect of cost reduction on quality

is large.      But that is not enough.        For public         ownership   to be definitely
                                                  22

superior it   ❑ ust   also be the case that either quality improvement is unimportant

or that government employees do not have weaker incentives in quality improvement

(1 is large).      If one of the latter conditions holds, then private contractors

are not significantly superior at improving quality, and hence public ownership

is preferred.12

      Finally, we consider thecost/qualitycomparison                 between private and public

ownership:




Proposition 5:        costs are always lower under private ownership.              Quality may be

higher or lower uncler private ownership.




      We    know   that   e   is higher    under       private    ownership   than under    public

ownership    (eM >     e* >   eG) and     hence    costs    are   always   lower   under   private

ownership.    Quality     -b(e) + ~(i) ❑ay be higher or lower since, although e iS

higher, so is i.        One case where quality is higher under private ownership is

when b’(e) is small (more precisely, we replace b(e) by 6b(e) and let 9 - O);




     12We have analyzed private ownership under the assumption that the
private owner actually manages the firm. This is not a bad assumption for the
case we are most interested in--prisons.   In future work, however, it would be
useful to extend the analysis to situations where there is a separation
between ownership and control.   Some of the most important trade-offs that we
have identified are still likely to be relevant. Note in particular that it
will still be the case that the owners and managers of a private firm have an
excessive tendency to reduce costs, since they can collectively divide the
gains from cost reduction among themselves, ignoring the adverse quality
impact on society. The implications for quality innovation are more
complicated.   To the extent that the manager of a private firm is less
replaceable than the manager of a public firm (because the private company’s
shareholders are dispersed, say), the private company manager’s incentives to
innovate will be greater than the public ❑anager’s. However, to the extent
that the manager of a private firm must share the fruits of his innovation
with both his owner(s) and the government, as opposed to just the government,
the private manager’s incentives to innovate will be smaller (on the latter
effect, see kffont and Tirole (1993) and Hart and Moore (1990)).
                                           23

then quality is determined by differences in i and not differences in e.      On the

other hand, if P’(i) is smll,      quality is higher under public ownership; in this

case quality is determined by differences in e rather than differences in i,

      Proposition   5 explains what we believe      to be the basic stylized facts,

namely that private contracting       typically yields greater cost efficiency, but

there is ambiguity about quality.        Note that we could not get ambiguity if we

had a simpler model, in which there is no investment in quality improvement.      In

that ❑odel, there would be a straight tradeoff between quality and cost, with

public provision delivering more quality at a higher cost.        That ❑odel (i.e.,

one without ~) would resemble the comprehensive contracting treatment of Laffont

and Tirole (1993, chapter 4), who argue that higher powered incentives        (which

mightbe   associated with private ownership) lead to both lower costs @     quality.

Our model, in contrast, explains why in some -- arguably most -- cases private

provision leads to both lower costs and higher quality.



Competition

      Perhaps the single   ❑ ost   important issue that our ❑odel does not deal with

is ex post competition between the suppliers of the good.       Competition may not

always be a relevant option. For example, letting prisoners choose their prison

and having prisons compete for inmates is probably a bad idea.     However, in other

cases, competition might be very beneficial.

      To take the simplest case, suppose that the consumers buy the good, or

senice,   directly from a contractor, without any government intervention, even

in financing.   Suppose also that the consumers can assess the quality on their

own (a good assumption with most goods, a plausible assumption for education, and

probably the wrong assumption for health).       Suppose finally that the suppliers
                                             24

are perfectly    competitive      at every quality     level.     In this case,    a private

contractor would face exactly socially optimal incentives, since, on the margin,

he gets a lower price for any quality shortfall resulting from a cost reduction,

and a higher price for any quality improvement through imovation                 (that is, he

receives -b(e) + c(e) + ~(i)).         Private supply in this case delivers the first            .

best.   On the other hand, a public manager needs to negotiate any innovation with

the government,     and might be replaceable,        so his incentives to innovate are

stunted.     In this extreme case -- where there is no need for the government at

all   -- the private     sector delivers    the first-best       and   public provision     is

inefficient.    Competition makes the choice between the           ❑ ode   of supply trivial.

        Of course, in   ❑ ost   interesting cases, the situation is more complicated,

and some government role is needed, at least in financing.                   For example,   in

education, even if the suppliers        are private and competitive, most arrangements

would allow for the government to pay for the senice            of at least some consumers

(e.g., through vouchers).         The idea is that the government needs to participate

in the financing of these se~ices          to reduce inequality of consumption         across

consumers.     In these arrangements, as long as consumers can assess quality, it

is still likely that, to the extent that there is consumer choice and competition

between    suppliers,   private    suppliers would pay for deterioration          in quality

resulting from cost reduction because the consumers can go elsewhere.                 In this

case, competition again generally strengthens the case for contracting out.

        The objections    to private,    competitive    supply    typically    focus on more

subtle distributional      issues.     One argument is that private         suppliers paid a

fixed sum by the government would refuse to supply consumers who are expensive

to senice     (e.g., they would not educate difficult children).             Another argument

is that, under private arrangements, sorting that is inefficient from the social
                                                     25

viewpoint would result            (e.g., good schools would only accept smart children,

leaving other children            to bad      schools).           As we argue         in section     6, it is

sometimes -- though not always -- possible to come up with private, competitive

contractual         arrangements      that    can   successfully            address    these   distributive

concerns.      However, we leave a full discussion of competition and regulation to                             .

a separate paper.



4.   Alternative views of government.

         In this sectionwe        relax the assumption that thebureaucrat/politician                     acts

on behalf of society, that is, we allow for the possibility that the politician

is self-interested.            This self-interest can express itself in a number of ways.

First, the politician ❑ay be corrupt, in the sense of being willing to use his

control rights to extract ❑oney (or campaign contributions) for himself from the

contractor.          Second,    the   politician         may    use   his    control     rights    to pursue

political objectives other than the public interest, such as catering to interest

groups       that    ❑ight      support      him    in     the     election.           These      alternative

characterizations        of political behavior have significant                       implications    for the

optimality of alternative ownership structures.



Corruption

         A corrupt politician overseeing the delivery of a government senice                              can

benefit himself in many ways.              If the service is contracted out, the politician

can try to award the contract to a supplier who does not ❑ake the lowest bid or

who delivers a lower quality, in exchange for a bribe.                          The politician can also

write a contract that is disadvantageous,                      e.g. , one that intentionally ignores

important quality issues or pays excessive prices.                          When such a contract needs
                                                          26

to be renegotiated,          the politician can renegotiate it on terms advantageous                        to

the contractor.       bst     but not least, once the contract is awarded, the politician

may accept the violation of its terms, and fail to enforce important provisions.

In short, a corrupt           government        official        can use a variety        of powers    at his

disposal to reduce the qwlity             and raise the cost of senrices to the government,

and collect bribes in exchange”.

        We do not analyze all these models of corruption in this paper.                              Instead,

we describe one simple -- but possibly important --                            case, in which corruption

leads   to an excessive         tendency        to privatize.          That      1s, a corrupt       official

privatizes when in-house provision is socially preferred.

        Suppose the privatization decision is made by a higher level politician at

some date before date O (see Figure 1).                        That 1s, assume that the time line is

as in Figure 1 except that the ownership decision is made at date -%.                                 Suppose

also    that    the    politician        is    not        involved    in   F’s    operations       after   the

privatization decision, that is, contracting decisions pass to a bureaucrat who

is assumed      to be honest.        In contrast,               the politician     is corrupt      and takes

❑onetary bribes.

        Under      these    conditions        the    politician      has   a   simple    choice.      He   can

privatize      F (a prison)      --in which case he arranges                   to sell it to a private

company owned by M (the future owner-manager of F).                        Suppose that the politician

can    set   the    price    artificially           low   and    extract   a bribe      from M,     i.e.   the

politician can avoid selling F through competitive bidding.                             Alternatively,     the




     13A very similar set of issues arises when the politician is lazy or
unmotivated.   Such a politician, like his corrupt counterpart, may write bad
contracts that fail to protect the public, award contracts to inefficient
suppliers, pay excessive prices, fail to supervise contractors, etc. Because
privatization locks the government into these bad arrangements, laziness of
politicians, like corruption, tends to point against privatization.
                                                 27

politician can keep F public and appoint M as the future manager (the warden).

In this situation ve suppose that the politician can extract a bribe from H in

return for M’s future benefits as manager.

         Under reasonable assumptions the politician can extract amuch higher bribe

if he privatizes F than ifhe         does not.    If the politician privatizes F then, at

date O, H is in a bilateral bargaining position vith the bureaucrat G concerning

the terms of the contract.         The total surplus to be divided is given from (2.9)

by SM .     Under the assumption of Nash bargaining, M receives hSM          through the

price PO.     Now   ❑ ove   back to date -k.     At this date, as long as there are many

potential (identical) firms and managers who can run the prison, the politician

can offer to sell F to whomever pays the highest bribe: the highest bribe is of

course %SN and so this is the politician’s payoff.

         Now consider the case where the politician keeps F public.       How much would

M pay for the privilege of being the warden?           The problem M faces is that prior

to a contract with G being written he has no job security, i.e., if the prison

is   publlc there is nothing to stop the bureaucrat from replacing M with another

manager at date O (no relationship-specific            investments have yet been made).

Hence N’s future payoff is zero, which means that this is also the politician’s

bribe!    The conclusion is that the corrupt politician always wants to privatize

F even if this is socially inefficient.

         Even if the politician can force the bureaucrat to retain the manager whom

the politician has selected, the bribes that a politician can extract from this

❑anager are lower than those from a private contractor.              If   A <1, a public

sector warden gets less than 1/2 of the benefits resulting from cost reductions

or quality improvements that he makes, in contrast to a private contractor, who

gets half    the gains from quality       improvements,    and all the gains   from cost
                                                     28

reductions.        As a consequence,         the ex ante bribe that a public sector manager

would pay for his job is lower than the bribe that a private contractor would

pay.       To   the    extent    that    a politician     maximizes    his    bribe,   he    privatizes

excessively.



Patronage

       An equally important consideration ignoredby               assuming that politicians act

in the public          interest    is that politicians       often cater        to special      interest

groups, such as labor unions,                to win elections    (Stigler 1971, Becker              1983).

Politicians ❑ay choose to use public money to provide jobs for the workers who

then favor them in the elections, or to pay such workers wages above ❑arket

levels.     If spending public resources to transfer wealth to such interest groups

is easier with in-house provision than with contracting, then politicians would

have   a    bias      toward    too     little   privatization   (Shleifer       and   Vishny       1994).

Patronage       thus has       the opposite      effect   to that of corruption:          it leads      to

excessive bias toward in-house provision.                  Interestingly, excessive employment

in public       firms may lead to excessively             high quality       (if having     ❑ ore   people

increases quality).            For example, the quality of senice            in some European state

airlines,       such as Air France and Lufthansa,             may be excessively          high,     and a

possibly lower quality at private airlines is no evidence of lower efficiency.

       Avoiding excessive public spending on politically powerful interest groups

is indeed one of the principal goals of privatization throughout the world.                             In

the United States, public sector unions are a powerful special interest group

that has delivered some of the most vocal opposition to government contracting,

including privatization of prisons (AFSCME, 1985).                    Some evidence suggests that

the presence of strong public sector unions, as well as soft budget constraints
                                                 29

of the government, are important obstacles to privatization of local government

senices      in the United States (Lopez de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny 1996).

          Positive   considerations     thus     suggest      an    important        tradeoff     between

privatization and inhouse provision,            To the extent that corruption is a serious

problem,     the case   for privatization        is weaker         than   it is under          benevolent

government. But to the extent that political patronage is a severe problem, the

case for privatization         is stronger.     A reformer considering privatization must

have a clear idea as to whether corruption or patronage                    is    a   bigger problem in

his polity,



5.     Privatization of Prisons.

Overview

        Privatization of prisons refers to the contracting out by the government

of the operations of prisons to private companies.                  In the ❑iddle ages, prisons

were   typically private, but by the 20th century, governments in                      ❑ ost   countries

had taken over their operation.             In the U.S. today, while private companies by

law are restricted from ❑eting out punishment, and public employees are usually

present    even   in private      prisons     to make   decisions         on    issues   that    can   be

interpreted as changes in the severity of prisoners’ punishment, almost all the

other activities      related     to incarceration      can    in principle          be privatized,

Private prisons have grown rapidly in the United States in the last decade from

a capacity of about 1200 prisoners in 1985 to almost 50,000 prisoners at the end

of 1994 (Thomas 1995),         Still, private prisons house only about 3 percent of the

total prison      population.     Despite     their quantitative          insignificance,        private

prisons    have   stimulated    an extensive     debate addressing             the cost and quality

aspects of private incarceration            (e.g. , AFSCME 1985, Donahue 1988, 1989, bgan
                                               30

1990, 1992, Shichor 1995 and others).         Although there are no large sample studies

of   either   cost   or   quality    comparisons    of   public    and   private    prisons,    the

available literature       is   informative enough for us to assess the relevance of the

incomplete contracting approach to the study of prison privatization.

       Private prisona are perhaps 10 percent cheaper, per prisoner, than public                      .

prisons14.    The major reason for the lower costs appears to be the roughly 15

percent wage premium for public @ards         over private guards (Donahue 1988).              Part

of labor cost difference is that private contractors do not pay the public union

wage premium, another part is that they hire lover quality workers.                  Since labor

accounts for two thirds of the incarceration              costs, the differences        in labor

costs can roughly account for the 10 percent cost saving from private prisons.

      The most controversial         and interesting issues raised by private prisons

concern the quality of senice.          Quality covers order in the prisons (security

of prisoners, escapes, staff conduct toward prisoners, violence by guards and

between prisoners, disciplinary procedures etc), amenities that prisoners receive

(q~lity   of food, health care, dental care, mental care, clothes, quality of

facilities,   prison      work,    entertainment,    access   to    legal   help,     etc),    and

rehabilitation   (vocational training, other education, parole procedures, etc).

Objections to prison privatization typically focus on quality.               To quote DiIulio

(1987) , “The history of private sector involvement in corrections isunrelievedly

bleak, a well-documented tale of inmate abuse and political corruption.                  In many

instances, private contractors worked inmates to death, beat or killed them for


     l~e   comparisons are often disputed by critics of prison privatization,
since private prisons apparently get somewhat less violent prisoners (Donahue
1988, Shichor 1995), and since some of the costs of private incarceration   --
such as the continued need for public oversight -- are often ignored in the
comparison. On the other hand, some of the costs of public prisons, such as
foregone tax revenues and often even capital costs, are also often ignored in
the comparisons.
                                              31

minor rule infractions,      or failed   to provide       inmates with    the quantity    and

quality of life’s necessities (food, clothing, shelter, etc.) specified in their

often meticulously-drafted     contracts.” This account is not extreme among those

by critics of private prisons, such as Webb and Webb (1963) and                Shichor (1995,

Chapter 2).     On the other hand, Logan (1992) reports the results of a suney             of

three women’s prisons in New Mexico that point to superior quality of the private

prison.    The central question of prison privatization is whether the poor history

is a good guide to the present and the future.

      Our theoretical analysis helps organize some of the thinking about prison

privatization    around the questions    of what contracts          can and do accomplish.

Accordingly, we show first that many of the quality problems in incarceration can

actually be addressed through contracts.           Nonetheless, we also show that serious

and unavoidable     incompleteness   remains even       in the “best practice”      existing

contracts.     Moreover, the incompleteness takes the form described in the model:

contractors have    an opportunity    to reduce costs       in ways    that may lead to a

substantial deterioration     of quality.      We also address        the highly pertinent

problems   of corruption   and poor enforcement         of contracts.     We conclude     the

section with    some tentative   recommendations       concerning     the privatization    of

prisons,



What contracts can accomplish

      To   assess   the possibilities    of    contracting,    we    examine   ❑odern   “best

practice” in the United States, which surely overestimates the average practice.

First, some private prison contracts have obligated the contractor to adhere to

the standards of the American Correctional Association,              a pseudo-public     body

that issues standards for good prisons (e.g. , ACA 1990) and accredits prisons
                                                  32

that   ❑ eet   them.    Second, the American Bar Association has ❑ade a tougher set of

proposals for what a good contract should look like (Robbins 1989).                    Finally, we

briefly examine a real contract between Davidson county                   in Tennessee and the

Corrections       Corporation    of American     (CCA).   The State of Tennessee has taken

privatization of prisons          more seriously than any other state, and CCA is one of

the   ❑ ost    reputable contractors       in the private prisons business.         By examining

these documents, we hope to look into what contracts if enforced can accomplish.

         The American     Correctional      Association   proposes   463 standards      for adult

correctional institutions dealing with virtually all aspects of prison life. The

standards cover administration           and ❑anagement of prisons        (including personnel

policies, staff training and development, bookkeeping, fiscal ❑anagement, etc.),

physical plant (including building and safety codes, security, inmate housing,

prison    size,     etc.),    operations     (including   rules   and    discipline,     security

procedures, inmate rights, special confinement, etc.), services (including inmate

classification,        food, hygiene, health care, social semices,          etc.), and inmate

programs (work, education, recreation, mail, visiting, library, religion, etc.).

Of these standards,          thirty eight are mandatory      and cover such key issues as

training and staff development, building and safety codes, security and control,

safety and emergency procedures,            inmate rights, classification,         food senice,

sanitation and hygiene, health care, and work in correctional industries.                  To get

ACA accreditation, which is renewed every three years, an institution must meet

all thirty eight ❑andatory           standards and ninety percent         of the nonmandatory

standards,        In general, only a small percentage of either public or private

prisons get ACA accreditation.             However, even if a private prison does not get

ACA accreditation,        a prison    contract    can use some or       many ACA   standards   as

contract provisions.
                                                      33

       ACA     standards     tend     to   be    process        rather    than     outcome     oriented,

Specifically, ACA standards typically insist that a facility have a written set

of rules or a policy manual dealing with various ❑atters, as well as staff to

attend to these matters.            ACA standards usually do not specify the content of

these rules.        Presumably,     the i&a     of having a manual is to help train prison                   ,

staff, as well as to enable inmates to complain (or sue) if the w-ritten rules are

violated -- something they could not do without a manual to point to.                            On some

matters, however,       such as food and health, ACA does specify ❑inimum quality

standards     that would     be   relatively     difficult        to get around.          On   food, ACA

specifies the number of meals that            ❑ ust   be served, caloric intake, time between

meals, conditions for preparation and keeping of food, as well as palatability.

It also refers to the standards of the American Dietetic Association                            on food

quality.     If a government writes a contract obligating a private contractor to

receive ACA accreditation, it can address ❑any of the standard quality concerns,

      Robbins (1989), in a document endorsed by the American Bar Association,

proposes    a tougher approach        to contracting          than that of the ACA.            Robbins’

approach    is to adhere     to ACA standards              in substance, but       then to introduce

draconian     liabilities    for    contractors        who    either     violate    the    contract     or

prisoners’ civil rights.          For example, Robbins wants private contractors to meet

100 rather     than 90 percent        of ACA non-mandatory             standards.        He also wants

contractors    to carry      $25 ❑illion of           liability      insurance     per   occurrence     of

violation    of inmate rights, which would perhaps protect                       the government       from

liability,    but    would   almost    surely    put       private    prisons    out     of business.’s



     15 Robbins also wants to mandate that private contractors hire the
former employees of facilities previously run by the government at or above
their previous wages. This would eliminate the cost advantage of the private
contractors.
                                               34

 Robbins’ proposal iS similar to contracting for the highest quality in all states

 of the world, which in general is not efficient16.

       A look at a 1990 contract between the Corrections Corporation of America

 (CCA) on the one hand, and the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson

County, Tennessee on the other, suggests that ACA standards can play a pivotal

role in contracting.    This contract covers the construction and three years of

operation of a prison by Cm,       to be compensated by a fixed construction fee plus

a per diem rate for prisoners,         The contract clearly specifies that CCA                ❑ ust


achieve accreditation of the prison by the ACA within two years of the service

commencement   day, and more       generally   relies very heavily           on ACA     standards,

particularly   in the   ❑ atters    of amenities       and    se~ice.        The   contract   also

specifies   that three gove~ent        employees must be permanently               present at the

premises,   including   the   Contract    Monitor,       in    order    to    monitor    contract

performance as well as review disciplinary and appeals reports17.

      Overall, the impression conveyedby            the ACA standards, Robbins’ proposals,

and the actual contract is that -- if best practice is followed -- ❑any aspects

of the quality of incarceration can be addressed through contracting.


     l%e   key assumptions of the ❑odel of Section 2 -- that quality cannot be
contracted on -- really stands for something ❑ ore subtle, namely the idea that
it is too costly to specify the Pfficien t quality level corresponding to every
possible state of the world.   It is not a contradiction of the model if -
quality level can be specified in all circumstances; the point is that this
quality level may be too high or too low. Robbins’ (1989) proposal illustrates
this point. His approach can be thought of as an attempt to make quality
contractible.  The problem is that it does so by choosing quality so high that
it is arguably uneconomic to supply it, e.g., the prison may be forced to take
so ❑any precautions to avoid escapes that it cannot make a profit.    In other
words, it would be as if someone who wanted a secure house built were to
“solve” the contracting problem by specifying that the house should be
impregnable against all disasters, including nuclear attack. Not
surprisingly, no public prison satisfies Robbins’ criteria.

     17Robbins wants public employees to play a more active role in discipline
and appeals than the Tennessee contract envisions.

Contractual Incompleteness

      Although contracts can address some quality issues, in several important

areas incompleteness is evident, and can in principle compromise the quality of

eiervice&livered     by a private contractor,      The two crucial areas we concentrate

on are use of force and quality of personnel.          These areas have been the focus

of much of the criticisms of private prisons.           In both of these areas, “best

practice” contracts appear to be seriously incomplete in ways that can easily

lead to quality deterioration,

      A famous court case, Hedina v. O’Neill (1984), illustrates the persistent

concerns about both the excessive use of force and the poor quality of personnel

in private     prisons.    According    to Shichor   (1995),”In   1981,    in Houston,   26

stowaways were detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At first,

20 of the detainees were held at the local jail and 6 of them were placed with

a local private security firm.         The private firm placed them in a cell designed

to hold six people.       A day later 10 of the 20 detainees held in the jail also

were transferred to the private firm for custody, and they were placed in the

same cell, which was already filled to its capacity           (bgan,      1990).   In this

situation 16 illegal immigrants were held in a 12 ft by 20 ft holding cell.              A

day after the transfer of the 10 aliens to the private facility, the detainees

tried to escape from the facility and a private guard in his attempt to prevent

the escape accidentally killed one of them with a shotgun and seriously wounded

another one.    The private guard apparently was untrained in the use of firearms,

and his intention was to use his gun as a cattle prod to force the detainees back

to their cell (p. 104).”       Interestingly, when ruling on this case, the Fifth

Circuit Court of Appeals overturneda        lower court ruling against the INS and held

that “(1) INS officials had no statutory duty to provide appropriate detention
                                                       36

facilities for excludable aliens, and (2) aliens’ due process rights were not

violated” (Logan 1990, p. 183).              In short, guards can use excessive force, guards

may be untrained, and still courts see no violation of law (or contract).                               AFSCME

(1985) and Donahue (1988) offer additional examples of the poor training and low

human capital of private prison personnel.

       An     examination      of   other     sources       on    contracts    points     to    significant

incompleteness.       The ❑andatory ACA standardon                the use of force is not especially

detailed:     “Written policy, procedure, and practice restrict the use of physical

force to instances of justifiable self-defense, protection of others, protection

of property, and prevention of escapes, and then only as a last resort and in

accordance with appropriate statutory authority.                      In no event is physical force

justifiable as punishment.               A written report is prepared following all uses of

force and is submitted to administrative                    staff for review.”          A separate, but

equally vague, mandatory standard governs the use of firearms.                          Even the Robbins

suggestion     on    the use      of non-deadly        force      is brief:     “any    jailer       shall    be

authorized     to use only such non-deadly force as circumstances                        require in the

following     situations:      to prevent      the commission         of a felony or misdemeanor,

including     escape;   to defend         oneself   or others        against    physical       assault;       to

prevent serious damage          to property;        to enforce institutional            regulations          and

orders; and to prevent or quell a riot.mla                       Robbins is tougher on contractors

In some respects (damage to property has to be serious), although he opens a very

wide   door    for    the   use     of    force   by    allowing      the     contractor       “to    enforce

institutional regulations and orders’ , which covers just about anything.                               These




     ‘aSpecifying the circumstances when the use of @-.     force is allowed is
typically easier, since such force is normally used only in the event of
escapes and riots, both of which are verifiable.   See Shichor (1995, p. 101)
for a discussion.
                                                  37

standards suggest to us that, whether the contractor Is ACA accredited or even

restrained by the w,        his discretion in the use of non-deadly force is enormous.

         The Tennessee contract allows even wider latitude in the use of force.

First, In contrast to either the ~              or ACA, use of deadly force iS allowed to

prevent escapes.       Second, in the use of non-deadly force, the Tennessee contract

follows    Robbins’     recommendations       (without     specifying   his   penalties),        which

probably does not restrict the use of force in significant ways.                     In sum, even

the best practice contract allows wide latitude in the use of force.

         Perhaps even greater contractual incompleteness prevails in the area of the

quality of personnel.       The ACA (non-mandatory) standards require that a procedure

be used to determine staffing needs, and that the vacancy rate be kept under 10

percent for any 18 ❑onth period.              Correctional    officers are also required to

receive 120 hours of training in their first year, and 40 hours in subsequent

years.     Little is said about the quality of the training                   (except for topics

covered)    or   the   quality     of   the   officers,      Robbins    generally    follows      ACA

standards.       The   Tennessee    contract     follows    the ACA     on   training,     but   also

specifies that “at the time the facility opens and during the first year of the

contract, a minimum of 25 percent of contractor’              s   security employees will have

at least one year of corrections security experience.                Davidson County residents

will be given a hiring        preference       in staffing    the facility” .       What    is   ❑ ost


interesting about these standards is how few there are, and how much discretion

the contractor has in saving costs on personnel.

         Does contractual    incompleteness       lead     to the deterioration      of quality?

Unfortunately,     no systematic evidence is available on this matter.                   We can get

a glimpse of the issues by looking at two (very small sample) reports.                     The first

is a comparative evaluation of two public prisons and one private (CCA-managed)
                                             38

prison in Tennessee, done by that state’s government (State of Tennessee 1995).

Although     this evaluation has concluded that all three prisons are overall of

extremely hi@     quality, with the implication that a cheaper private prison is a

good deal for the state (see also the NYT, 9/19/1995), it is clear from the body

of the report that the level of violence is higher in the private prison: “The

number of injuries to staff and prisoners is a measure of the security and safety

of the facility.         During the fifteen ❑onth period, the private prison reported

significantly    ❑ ore   (214) injuries to prisoners and staff, compared to 21 and 51

for the two state prisons, respectively.          The private prison also reported 30

incidents of the use of force, compared to 4 and 6, respectively, for the state

prisons” .    The Temessee      report minimizes this evidence because of the possible

differences in reporting practices, but it is suggestive nonetheless.

        All three Tennessee prisons had ACA accreditation.          However, they did not

❑ eet   100 percent of non-man&tory       ACA standards,      and the areas in which the

prisons failed to    ❑ eet   the standards were different for the private and public

prisons.     One of the public prisons seems to have been        ❑ ost   lacking in meeting

food senice     standards: it met only 44 percent of them on the first inspection

and 67 on the second.        The second state prison   ❑ et   only 64 percent of fire and

occupational safety standards on the first inspection, although it was up to 97

percent in the second inspection.       The private prisonon     the first inspection had

the largest problem with personnel standards, of which it met only 73 percent,

and with     food senice,     where   it met 67 percent of standards.          It also had

problems with health care, health records, and mental health senice              standards,

where it had about 75 percent compliance.         By the time of the second inspection,

the private prison was up to 92 percent compliance on personnel standards (still

below state prisons), and had straightened out most of its other failures.               It
                                                  39

iS difficult to gauge from the report whether the reason that the three prisons

look   exemplary     on    the   second     inspection    is   that    they   were      expecting    the

evaluation.    However, the inferior performance of the private prison on personnel

matters is consistent with the view that the area of personnel is where the non-

contractible savings lie in private prison management,                  The higher incidence of

violence   in the private prison might well be a consequence of inferior staff,

since undertrained        guards may be more likely to use force to prevent violence

between inmates.

       CCA private        prisons   in Tennessee       are widely     regarded        as a success   of

private prison ❑anagement.          ESHOR’S detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey,

operated for the Immigration and Naturalization SeNice                 (INS),    is    widely regarded

as a failure, in part because a riot broke out at that facility on June 18, 1995.

The highly critical INS report on this facility, as well as newspaper accounts,

provide some additional information about a private prison -- although we should

stress that this piece of evidence might represent the worst case.                       The facility

housed foreign nationals who were caught attempting to enter the US illegally

through Kennedy and Newark airports, and who were awaiting deportation                         -- not

exactly a hard core criminal crowd.           ESMOR won the INS contract by significantly

underbidding another private competitor, in part because it assumed in its bid

lower wage rates for prison staff.           The contract actually specified the t~es                of

workers that ESHOR was supposed to hire, but it turned out to be possible within

the contract      to hire    as guards      individuals who previously           guarded     goods   in

warehouses . With training, ESMOR evidently just violated the contract:                        the INS

reports that ESMOR “did not         ❑ eet   requirements of the contract= in this area,

       Overall,    the ESMOR facility was seriously understaffed,                      guards did not

receive enough training, guards were implicated in incidents of physical abuse
                                                       40

 of prisoners, and supenision               of staff by management was lacking.              When the riot

 broke    out,    the guards        immediately      ran away,         and   called    the police     from     a

 payphone.       INS attributed manyof         the problems at the facility to ESMOR’S cutting

corners,     principally       on    labor.      The    evidence        in the report       points    to the

possibility of cost savings by private contractors at the expense of quality,

although     this     particular       episode       raises     the     equally       important     issue    of

gOve~nt’f3          failure    to     respond     to    explicit        contract      violations     by     the

contractor.

         In sum, while        systematic      evidence        on the quality       of incarceration          by

private and public prisons             is not available, the existing shreds of evidence

suggest that in important dimensions, such as prison violence and the quality of

personnel, prison contracts are seriously incomplete.                          This incompleteness can,

and   evidently      sometimes      does,     give     rise    to quality       shortfalls        in private

contracting.



Contract Supervision and Oversight

         Our discussion so far has stuck to the ❑odel of a benevolent government

writing and enforcing a contract, limited only by the difficulties of writing

good contracts.       The history of private incarceration, however (like ❑uch of the

rest of history of government), points to the co~on                          incidence of corruption in

allocating contracts, as well as to deficient contract enforcement.                                  Shichor

(1995) , for      example,     tells    a    disquieting        tale    of    corruption    and     prisoner

❑altreatment in private prisons in California in the 19th century.                                 The first

private prison contract went to Jemes Estell, a politically powerful ❑ember of

the legislature, who used his authority to enrich himself and his friends with

lucrative subcontracts while abusing prisoners (Shichor, 1995, p. 40). How does
                                            41

the present practice compare with the past7

        The examination   of ESMOR and other evidence      indicates   that the issues

analyzed in Section 5 remain germane to actual prison contracting. First, private

prison companies     are very active politically.     For instance, ESMOR evidently

lobbies politicians and makes political contributions to receive contracts (New

York Times, 7/23/1995).     The wife of Tennessee governor -r      Alexander invested

early and profitably in the stock of Corrections Corporation of Merica,           which

subsequently got Involved very deeply in the privatization of Tennessee prisons

with the governor’s endorsement (The New Republic, 3/4/96, p. 9).

        Second, contract enforcement cannot be taken for granted.       The INS report

concludes that ESMOR’ s changes in policies “hindered INS ability to effectively

perform its oversight functions” .       The report also notes that ESMOR told its

guards not to share information with the INS officials working on the premises,

and in one instance encouraged       the INS to reassign an officer who complained

about the performance of the Elisabeth, N.J. facility several months prior to the

riot.   The report indicates that ESMOR violated the contract in some instances,

and also pursued policies preventing INS from enforcing the contract.         But it is

also clear from the report that INS did not do what it could to enforce this

contract,    The INS report vividly illustrates how a government bureaucracy with

relatively   weak   incentives has    trouble enforcing   a contract   with   a private

supplier determined to reduce its costs, even if this involves violations of the

contract and not just the issues on which the contract is silent.

        Third,   the INS contract    imposed no or light penalties     for performance

failures (e.g., as far as we can tell, $80 as a penalty for an escape, of which

there were dozens from the start), and was generally extremely soft compared, for

example, to the Tennessee contracts.        ESMOR is even negotiating with the      INS
                                                  42

about the resumption of operations in the Elizabeth, N.J. , facility.                    The costs

of contract violations to the private contractor, therefore, do not appear to be

very high.

        In the case of prisons, then, the benevolent government perspective might

give an excessively optimistic picture of private contracting.



Should prisons     be privatized?

       Prisons seem to fit reasonably well into our framework.                  Although in some

respects prison contracts are very detailed, they are still seriously incomplete.

There are significant opportunities for cost reduction that do not violate the

contracts.       These   cost    reductions,     at    least    in principle,    can   lead    to a

substantial deterioration of quality,             Moreover, from the available evidence we

have   the impression     that the world may not be              far from   the assumptions      of

proposition 4.      First, the welfare consequences of quality deterioration might

be of the s-e     magnitude as those of cost reduction.             Second, the opportunities

for quality      innovation     are   limited.    Under    these conditions,      proposition     4

suggests that public ownership is superior.                That is, private contractors ❑ay

seriously reduce quality in the process of reducing costs, and,                   ❑ oreover,    the

benefits from the potential quality innovation by the private contractors are

limited.     We also note that, without prisoner choice, ex post compet~t~on,                 which

addresses    the quality      problems    that ❑ay result        from privatization      of other

activities, does not play a large role in incarceration.                    Finally, corruption

seems to be a more severe problem in this business                  than patronage,      since the

union premium as of this writing is not large.              For all these reasons, our theory

suggests significant skepticism about private incarceration.

       One    instance   in which      the case       against   prison   privatization    is even
                                              43

stronger    is maximum     security   prisons,     where   the prevention     of violence    by

prisoners against guards and other prisoners is one of the            ❑ ost   important goals

of incarceration (~ew Yor~es                       , November 26, 1995).       In many cases,

the principal strategy for preventing such violence is the use of force by the

guards.     We have shown that it is very difficult to delineate contractually the

permissible     circumstances    for the use of such force.         Moreover,    hiring   less

educated guarda and undertraining          them -- which private prisons have a strong

incentive to do -- can encourage the unwarranted use of force by the guards.                 As

a result, our arguments         suggest   that maximum security prisons        should not be

privatized as long as limiting the use of force against prisoners is an important

public objective.     Consistent with this view, only 4 of the 88 private prisons

in Thomas’s (1995) census of private adult correctional institutions in theU.S.

are maximum security.      In contrast, private halfway houses and youth correctional

facilities, where violence problems are much less serious, are extremely common

(Shichor 1995).




6. Other activities.

      In some ways,      the model we presented was constructed             to fit prisons.

However, our model helps us to analyze other activities as well, as we show in

this section.     In the process, we also examine some of the ❑odel’s limitations.



Garbage Collection

      Garbage collection illustrates a case where our model clearly points to the

benefits of privatization.        In this case, the damage to quality resulting from

the private    contractor   hiring    inferior employees     or failing     to maintain     the

equipment    is probably    trivial   (b(e) is low). Our analysis       then implies that
                                                        44

 private   provision     is superior.            This    result obtains        even   though   in garbage

 collection ex post competition is extremely expensive, since it iS essential that

 the same company pick up garbage from neighboring houses (Donahue 1989).                              The

 superiority of private provision in garbage collection is documented by several

empirical studies (Donahue 1989).



Weapons Procurement

       Weapons     procurement      is    another        case   where    our    model   points    to   the

superiority      of private provision.             Although      the damage     to quality      from cost

reduction might be significant, to a large extent this damage couldbe                          contracted

around,    since    weapons    ❑ us t    ❑ eet    well-specified         performance        requirements ,

Moreover, quality innovation is enormously important in weapons design, and the

incentives of private suppliers are probably significantly stronger than those

of public employees.       As a consequence, ifb(e)              canbe   limited through contracts,

Proposition 3 points to the superiority of private ownership,



Foreign Policy

       In ❑any situations, the nature of the senice                     that the government wants to

be   performed     is   extremely   complex        and       unpredictable,      so   any   contract    is

inherently extremely incomplete.             Most actual decisions of the contractor have

to be renegotiated at the government’s initiative, which exposes the government

to the high costs of paying up to the contractor who has a lot of power.                               For

example,   as Wilson      (1989) shows,          it is virtually         impossible     to describe     in

advance what semices       need to be performed to carry out American foreign policy,

a task now assigned to the State Department.                    Suppose that the State Department

were to be privatized, and a set of policies toward different countries specified
                                          45

in the contract.     In this case, when the government wants to change its policy

toward a country     (say because   Russia renounces communism),   it would have   to

pursuade the private contractor to change what it does.      In this renegotiation,

the government presumably would have to pay the private contractor more than it

would pay an employee, who is totally replaceable when no ex ante investments are

needed.     Inhouse provision in this case of few investments and enormous ex post

holdup opportunities    seems clearly superior,

      A skeptic can respond to this analysis by suggesting that perhaps ex ante,

the government should auction off the foreign policy contract for a vast amount

of money with an understanding that it is going to be regularly held up ex post.

What is wrong with this arrangement?      In our theory, we have assumed that M is

wealthy enough to pay up front for the right to own F when private ownership is

optimal.    However, in some cases, such as the conduct of foreign policy, M may

not be wealthy enough. This creates a further argument for public ownership when

H’s ex post holdup power vastly exceeds the amount he can raise ex ante for the

contract,    If M cannot compensate G in advance for all the future holdups when

G changes the contract, then the extraction of surplus from G by M is socially

wasteful.    Hence   the government may wish to own F simply to avoid having       to

compensate H when it changes its mind at date 1’9.        This logic thus confirms

the conclusion that foreign policy shouldbe    conducted by government bureaucrats.




     l~is   argument is developed further in Trinh (1996). One may ask why M
couldn’t borrow against the receipts from his future hold-up opportunitie~.
The answer Is that a bank ❑ay be unwilling to lend to M, since there is
nothing to stop M from “holding up” the bank by refusing to hold up the
government.   That is, having received his loan, M can threaten not to hold up
the government at tite 1 and use this threat to renegotiate downwards his
repayment to the bank (Hart and Moore 1994), Anticipating this, the bank will
refuse to lend to M.

Schools

          An important example that goes outside of our basic ❑odel is the provision

of schooling.        For schools, the damage to quality from cost cutting, b(e), may

be large, but innovation is probably important and the incentives of publicly

employed teachers, especially when they are protected by unions, are weak.                    Our

propositions,     therefore, do not give a clear answer as to which arrangement                is

superior.       The key aspect of schools, however,           is the potential       for ex post

competition.      In voucher arrangements combined with school choice, for example,

the government pays        for each child’s education, but children and parents can

select schools.      While we have not analyzed our ❑odel in this case in detail, our

conjecture is that the case for such private arrangements             is extremely strong.

School choice would force private schools to compete for students by providing

higher quality, since schools cannot compete in prices when students pay with

vouchers.      This competition     should significantly      reduce the incentive to cut

quality while cutting       costs, as well       as increase    the incentive     to innovate

quality.       Indeed,   the available   evidence seems to suggest           that competition

between schools is associated with a higher quality             of education (Hoxby 1994).

       Critics of vouchers and school choice often point to a particular aspect

of quality that they believe would fall as a result of privatization,                    namely

reduction of access of some students to           good education.    Specifically, critics

fear that sorting of students by ability would             increase as a result of such

arrangements , which they regard as socially undesirable. Such sorting can take

two forms.     First, good private schools paid with vouchers would select the best

students, leaving the not-as-good         students to not-as-good          schools.     Second,

private schools would avoid expensive to educate children altogether, who would

then   get   stuck    in residual   government    programs.      Critics    charge    that   such
                                                   47

outcomes are less socially desirable than those involving less sorting.                           Some

school districts have tried to solve these sorting problems contractually by, for

example, using courts to allocate students to private schools that wish to be

paid with vouchers        (tie, ed. 1995). Whether contracts can successfully address

the concerns of the critics of school choice, and whether these concerns are

actually justified        from the social welfare viewpoint,             are question requiring

further inquiry.



Healthcare

         In the case of healthcare, as with education, the government wants to pay

for   the senices        of   at   least   some   consumers,    and    needs     to design    a good

arrangement for doing so.          One aspect of this design concerns whether hospitals

should be private or public.            In the analysis of optimal ownership, there are

some similarities between schools and hospitals, as well as some differences.

To begin, fn healthcare, as in education, gains from innovation are enormous, but

so is the damage to quality from cost-cutting.                  Moreover,      the distributional

aspect of quality        is extremely      important    in both      services:       the danger   that

expensive-to-treat       consumers would be denied care if the government pays less

than it costs to treat them is always present.

         he   further similarity is that ex post competition between hosptials                      --

letting patients choose their hospital -- can play a role in healthcare, and we

argued    above   such    competition      may    strengthen   the    case     for    privatization.

However, a crucial difference is the limited ability of consumers to assess the

quality of healthcare         they receive.       Consmers     generally cannot tell whether

hospitals have failed to provide care to save costs, and hence would not as

readily change suppliers           in response to poor quality.           For this reason, the
                                                  48

combination of private ownership            and competition would not be nearlyas            effective

in healthcare      as in education, ❑aking the case for some government ownership

stronger.

       Perhaps     because     of   all    these concerns      about    private    provision,       most

countries have responded to the need to provide healthcare to all their people

through government provision.             The United States has been different in relying

on both private and public hospitals, with the latter taking care primarily of

indigent patients.       Historically, private hospitals have been paid on the cost

plus basis -- an approach that our ❑odel does not accommodate (since we assume

that costs     are nonverifiable)         but which, unsurprisingly,        has proved extremely

expensive.     More recently,        the form of compensating providers has shifted to

fixed fees for serv~ces, a contract very similar to that analyzed in our model.

Not   surprisingly,     these       contracts    have    increased      concerns     about    quality

deterioration, particularly          in the so-called Health Maintenance Organizations.

An analysis     of healthcare       would require a significant           generalization       of our

model, especially since verification of costs and cost-plus contracts have played

an essential role in paying for this senice.              This is a very important topic for

future research.



Police and Armed Forces

      As     our last example,       we consider       some basic      se~ices     provided   by    the

government that nobody seriously thinks of privatizing: the police and the armed

forces.      Our   framework    helps     to explain     why   these    senices     should    not    be

privatized.

       If the police or armed forces were privatized, the owners of the resulting

private companies would have enormous power.              Part of this power would stem from
                                            49

the direct ownership of weapons that are currently in public hands.           The owners

could use this power to hold up the government and society.      For example, suppose

as an extreme case that nuclear weapons were sold off to a private company and

an (incomplete) contract was written with the company as to how these weapons

should be used in the event that the country is threatened with attack.              The

concern is obviously that the private company would wriggle out of the incomplete

contract and either threaten to withhold the weapons in the event of an emergency

to extract a huge side-payment from the government, or even       threaten to use the

weapons against the country itself unless it receives such a side-payment.

      We stress that keeping the nuclear stockpiles -- or armed forces -- public

does not eliminate the possibility of attempted holdup.      A general who is a state

employee could use his access to nuclear weapons to attempt to hold up society.

After all, coups and rebellions by the armed forces do sometimes occur.         However,

there is a difference between the private and public cases.           If nuclear weapons

or the armed forces are publicly controlled, the government can take early action

to prevent a potential holdup.       If it suspects that an errant general is engaged

in treasonous activities, it can fire the general.       In contrast, in the private

case, it would have to wait until a clear breach of contract occurred; this ❑ight

be too late.   In our model, a public general can be kept replaceable almost at

all times, whereas a private M can ❑ake substantial investments to make himself

costly to replace.



 7. Conclusion.

      We have examined the conditions that determine the relative efficiency of

inhouse   provision   vs   outside    contracting   of   government     services.    Our

theoretical arguments suggest that the case for inhouse provision is generally
                                              50

stronger when non-contractible cost reductions have large deleterious effects on

quality , when   quality   imovations        are   unimportant,   and     when   corruption      in

government   procurement   is   a   severe    problem,       In   contrast,      the   case    for

privatization is stronger when quality-reducing cost reductions canbe controlled

through contract or competition, when quality innovations are important, and when

patronage and powerful uions        are a severe problem inside the government.

      We then applied this analysis to several government activities using the

available evidence on the importance of various factors.            We concluded that the

case for inhouse provision      is very strong in such senices             as the conduct of

foreign policy and maintenance of police and armed forces, but also can be                    ❑ ade


reasonably persuasively for prisons.         In contrast, the case for privatization is

strong in such activities as garbage collection and weapons production, but also

can be made reasonably persuasively for schools.            In some other senices,            such

as provision of h~althcare, an analysis of efficiency of alternative arrangements

is a great deal more complicated        and requires a much       ❑ ore    detailed model of

competition and regulation than we could provide in this paper.                  We defer such

analysis to future work.
