                                              ABSTRACT

We use micro data from the European Social Survey to investigate the impact of “culture of leisure”
and taxes on labor force participation and hours worked of second-generation immigrants who reside
in 26 European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and they have been exposed to institutional,
legal and labor market structures of their countries, including the tax rates. Fathers of these individuals
are first-generation immigrants who migrated from 81 different countries. We construct measures
of “taste for leisure” in the country of origin of each immigrant father. We employ average and marginal
taxes for each country of residence, and control for a large set of individual characteristics, in addition
to attributes of the country of residence and country of ancestry. The results show that for women,
both taxes and culture of leisure impact participation and hours worked. For men, taxes influence labor
supply both at the intensive and the extensive margins, but culture of leisure has no impact.

             The Impact of Taxes, and Culture of Leisure on Labor Supply in Europe



I. Introduction


        There are substantial differences between people around the world regarding how many

    hours they work in the labor market. For example, in 2012, the average annual hours worked

    by American workers was 1,750. The average worker in Germany worked 17 percent fewer

    hours than an American worker in that year, and a French worker worked 15 percent less. A

    worker in Belgium spent about 9 percent less time at work in comparison to an American

    worker. Similar disparities are observed when hours per person is analyzed, instead of hours

    per worker.1 Annual hours worked per working age population (ages 15 to 64) are 10

    percent lower in Germany, 19% lower in France, and 17 percent lower in Belgium than in the

    U.S.


        In an influential paper, Edward Prescott (2004) employed a growth model with a

    representative household and calibrated the model to show that the difference in hours

    worked between the United States and Europe in two points in time can be explained almost

    entirely by the differences in the tax rates on labor and consumption. A large literature that

    followed provided a number of nuanced extensions and modifications to Prescott‟s

    framework, regarding the preferred labor supply elasticities to calibrate such macro models,

    modifications to the model to incorporate the ability for the household to self-insure through

    asset accumulation, the role of productivity growth, and so on (e.g. Ljungqvist and Sargent

    2006, Ohanian et al. 2008, Rogerson 2008, Olovsson 2009, Chetty et al. 2011, McDaniel

 This measure incorporates both the willingness to participate in the labor market (the decision on
whether or not to work) and the decision on how many hours to work.

                                                    1
2011). In a different framework, Algan and Cahuc (2005) showed that family labor supply

attitudes were important in explaining the variation in the employment rates of different

demographic groups in OECD countries.

    The finding that taxes are a major factor in explaining cross-country differences in

market work is important because it implies that reductions in taxes can generate significant

increases in economic activity. Alternative, or at least complementary, hypotheses have been

proposed to explain the differences in hours worked between Europe and the U.S. These

include the importance of regulations and labor unions (Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote

2006), and the role of home production (Olovsson 2015). An important aspect of this

discussion, and the key component of our paper, is the role of preferences for leisure. The

assumption of identical preferences between countries, and in particular between Europeans

and Americans has been questioned (Blanchard 2006). This point is also emphasized by

Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote (2006) who suggested that an initial decline in market work

might increase individuals‟ utility from leisure and this process can be amplified by a social

multiplier (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman 2003) if there exist complementarities in

leisure – individuals‟ utility from leisure is enhanced when more people are consuming

leisure.

    The argument that Europeans have stronger taste for leisure than Americans (Blanchard

2004) is perhaps intuitive, and fits well with many people‟s pre-conceived image of longer

vacations and shorter work weeks in most European countries. That image was brought to

life in a Cadillac TV advertisement in the U.S., where the main character in the

advertisement, an American middle-age upper-income male, first asks the question: “Why do

we work so hard?” In answering his own question, he declares:



                                             2
              ”[In] Other countries, they work, they stroll home, they stop by the café,

              they take August off. Off! Why aren‟t you like that? Why aren‟t we like

              that? Because we are crazy, driven, hard-working believers. That‟s why.

              Those other countries think we are nuts. Whatever! “2



          Although tastes for leisure can impact labor supply, no systematic analysis has been

      conducted on this subject.3 In this paper, we focus on European countries and investigate the

      impact of taxes and the culture of leisure on labor supply. Using a large micro data set

      consisting of individuals from 26 European countries we analyze people‟s labor supply

      decisions both at the extensive and the intensive margins.4 While there are significant

      differences between Americans and Europeans in hours worked, there are also substantial

      differences in market work between European countries. To demonstrate the extent of

 Standard empirical models of labor supply include a vector of worker attributes including racial and
ethnic background, if available, in an effort to control for pre-market factors that can impact labor supply,
but explicit adjustment to taste for leisure has not been done so far.
4
  The conjecture is that some countries have stronger preferences for leisure, and people in those countries
would have worked fewer hours even if they faced lower marginal tax rates. On the face of it, this
argument does not seem to explain the increasing wedge between labor supply of Americans and
Europeans over the last three decades or so, because culture is not expected to change rapidly. Even
though the goal of our paper is not to explain the divergence of hours worked between countries over
time, we should still emphasize that cultural attributes are malleable, and they change in reaction to
external factors. For example, Fernández (2013) shows that social attitudes towards women‟s work
endogenously change over time. Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln (2007) find that individual preferences are
shaped by the political regime in which the individual lives. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) show that
individuals‟ political preferences and support for government redistribution are impacted by whether or
not they grew up during recessionary periods. Giavazzi, Petkov and Schiantarelli (2014) show that while
some cultural values evolve slowly, others change rapidly. Cannonier and Mocan (2012) find that women
in Sierra Leone whose education is improved by an education reform are more likely to disapprove the
cultural practice of female genital mutilation. Mocan (2013) finds that the intensity of vengeful feelings
depends on the economic environment of the individual.

variation between countries in hours worked, we use OECD data and calculate hours worked

per population ages 15 to 64 in 2012, in a sample of European countries, which is displayed

in Table 1. This measure contains two dimensions of market work: the fraction of the

working age population that actually works and the number of hours of those who work. The

entries in Table 1 are standardized to portray average hours worked in each country relative

to the U.K. For example, hours worked per person in France, Germany and Greece are 19

percent, 10 percent, and 3 percent lower, respectively, than in the U.K. Swedes work 4

percent more than the working age population in the U.K. Importantly, as we will show later

in the paper, there is also substantial variation in the effective marginal tax rates between

European countries.

   The critical issue for the purposes of our paper is how to measure the “taste for leisure,”

and how to identify its impact on market work. We focus on second-generation immigrants

who reside in various European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and being

residents of different European countries, they have been exposed to institutional, legal and

labor market structures of their countries, including the marginal tax rates on labor and

consumption income. Their fathers had migrated from somewhere else in the world, and we

know these fathers‟ countries of origin. We use immigrant father‟s country of birth to

determine the ancestral roots, and assume that culture of leisure in father‟s country of origin

is transmitted from the immigrant father to the offspring. We focus on the father, rather than

the mother because most of the literature uses the birth place of the father to assign country

of origin to second-generation immigrants (Alesina et al. 2015, Alesina and Giuliano 2011,

Alesina and Giuliano 2010, Fernández and Fogli 2009, Card et al. 1998). By exploiting a

separate data set that asks people around the world various questions to gauge their taste for



                                              4
leisure, we connect these second-generation immigrants in Europe to the culture of leisure in

their father‟s country of origin.

    We have data from about 7,000 individuals who live and work in 26 European countries.

These individuals have ancestral origins in 81 different countries. Thus, we are able to

identify the impact of taxes in the country of residence on hours worked, holding constant

observable attributes of individuals, various attributes of the country in which they live, and

attributes of their father‟s country of origin, including the taste for leisure in that country of

origin. Similarly, we can identify the impact of culture of leisure on labor supply, holding

constant all personal attributes and various characteristics of the country of residence,

including the tax rates.

    We find that both taxes and culture of leisure impact labor force participation and hours

worked for women. For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the

extensive margin, but culture of leisure has no impact. The magnitude of the estimated

effects indicates that while taxes on labor income are a significant determinant of aggregate

hours worked, culture of leisure is important as well.

    Our work is also related to a growing new literature that investigates the interplay

between culture and economic outcomes. Some recent examples include Fernández and

Fogli (2009) who investigate the impact of female labor force participation and fertility rates

in the country of origin on work and fertility decisions of second-generation American

women; Alesina and Giuliano (2011) who investigate the impact of family ties on political

participation, labor force participation and trust. Luttmer and Singhal (2011) report that

immigrants‟ redistributive preferences are impacted by the average preference in their

country of birth. Ljunge (2014) analyzes the transmission of trust to immigrant children.



                                               5
Alesina et al. (2015) find that people who inherit strong family ties are less mobile and have

lower wages and higher unemployment. A detailed description of this literature can be found

in Alesina and Giuliano (2014) and Fernández (2011).



     II. Theoretical Framework

     To motivate the empirical model, we follow the framework of Prescott (2004) and

consider a representative agent who is endowed with one unit of time that can be divided

between labor and leisure. Preferences over consumption and leisure are represented by the

utility function in Equation (1):


1)        ∑


     where ct stands for consumption and ht represents hours worked; implying that (1-ht) is

the amount of leisure. The discount factor β represents the degree of patience, where

              . The parameter γ is the value attached to leisure. The aggregate production

function of the economy is that of Cobb-Douglas type, with an output elasticity of capital θ,

and elasticity of labor (1-θ). The production function converts labor (ht in Equation 1) and

capital into output, which can be consumed or invested.


     The budget constraint of the representative agent is:

2)

     where τc is the consumption tax rate, τx is the tax rate on investment, and τh is the

marginal labor tax rate; rt stands for the rental price of capital and τk is the capital income tax

rate. Tt represents government transfers at time t that are financed by taxes. wt is the price of

labor, therefore (wtht) represents labor income.

                                               6
      The standard first-order conditions indicate that the marginal rate of substitution between

leisure and consumption is equal to the ratio of their prices, and that labor is paid its marginal

product. The first-order conditions imply


(3)                       {                }

         where τ= (τh +τc)/(1+τc), which is the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. It

represents the combined labor and consumption taxes exerted on labor income, holding

investment constant. Equation (3) depicts the supply of hours worked. Because the effective

marginal tax rate on labor income, τ, is embedded in one of the first-order conditions, it is

also in equation (3): an increase in the tax rate τ reduces labor supply ht.

      Much attention has been devoted to the investigation of the impact of taxes on hours

worked at a cross-section of countries, or by using the variation in the tax rates of countries

over a period of time. On the other hand, the impact of marginal utility of leisure on hours

worked (which is depicted by γ in Equation 3), has not been investigated, despite the fact that

it has been postulated to be a potentially important factor to explain cross-country differences

in labor supply. An increase in γ has a negative impact on hours worked. As we describe in

the next section, we develop measures of γ to represent the value of leisure that can vary

between countries.

         Equation (3) provides a framework in which labor supply depends on taxes and tastes

for leisure. We will not estimate the specific structural parameters, based on the specific

form depicted by Equation (3). Rather, as shown below, we will estimate a linear

formulation of labor supply, which depends on personal attributes of individuals, country

characteristics including taxes, and measures of taste for leisure.




                                               7
       Although we use survey data on individuals from various years, there is no substantial

   variation in marginal taxes over the years in a country. Thus, our elasticity estimates can be

   interpreted as steady-state elasticities. As we explain in the next section, we estimate

   elasticities both at the extensive and intensive margins.



III. Empirical Implementation

       Consistent with the theoretical framework described in the previous section, we estimate

   the following specification to investigate the impact of taxes and taste for leisure on labor

   supply:

       (4)    hijnt = β0 + β1 τj + β2Ln+ XiΦ + Cj Ω + COn Ψ + δt + εijnt,

       where hijnt stands for the labor supply of person i who is a second-generation immigrant,

   living in country j, surveyed at time t. Labor supply is measured both at the extensive and

   intensive margins, allowing us to estimate models for labor force participation and for hours

   worked, conditional on participation. The subscript n represents the country-of-origin of this

   person‟s father (who migrated from country n to country j). The vector Xi includes personal

   attributes of individual i that may impact his/her labor supply decision such as age,

   completed years of education, marital status, whether the person perceives him/herself as an

   ethnic minority in that country, and the size of the city of residence. The vector Cj controls

   for the attributes of the country of residence that may influence labor supply through their

   impact on aggregate labor productivity, institutional factors and so on. The vector Cj

   includes GDP per capita, average educational attainment in the country, the extent of the

   individualistic culture in the country, index of ethno-linguistic fragmentation, size of the

   population, legal origin indicators, and number of years in which country experienced



                                                 8
democracy between 1930 and 1995. COn contains attributes of the country of ancestry, such

as the index of ethno-linguistic fragmentation, legal origin indicators, and a measure of

democracy in father‟s country of origin. Time fixed-effects, δt, account for the year in which

individuals are surveyed. Standard errors are clustered at the country of origin.

        The variable τ measures the effective marginal tax rate on labor income in country j

where person i resides and works. We follow closely the literature, and as detailed in the

next section, use country-specific tax rates generated by the previous research (Prescott 2004,

McDaniel 2011). Although we use surveys of individuals from different years, the two

measures of taxes we employ (the effective marginal tax rate, as well as the average tax rate

for a single person without a dependent) do not change appreciably within a country in the

sample period. Thus, the impact of taxes on labor supply is identified from cross-country

variation in tax rates.

        Ln stands for various measures of the culture of leisure in the country of origin,

constructed by using data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study.

For example, one particular question in these surveys is: “How important is leisure in your

life?” Possible answers range from 1 (not important) to 4 (very important). The average

value of answers to this question was 3.5 in Sweden, 3.3 in Uruguay, 2.9 in Morocco, and 2.6

in China, suggesting that people in Sweden value leisure more strongly in comparison to

those who live in Morocco or in China, for example. Other examples of indicators for culture

of leisure are responses to such statements as “People who don’t work turn lazy” (agree-

disagree on a scale from 1 to 5) and “Work is a duty to society” (agree-disagree from 1 to 5).

The details of these and other measures of culture of leisure in the country of origin are

explained in the data section.



                                              9
            The framework shown in Equation (4) is termed an “epidemiological” approach by

    Fernández (2008, 2007) because it aims to identify the impact of inherited, pre-existing

    factors on behavior, holding constant the context in which the decision takes place. Note that

    reverse causality from labor supply to “taste for leisure” is unlikely to be an issue here

    because the labor supply decision of the individual cannot have an impact on the extent of the

    taste for leisure in father‟s country of origin. Similarly, an individual‟s labor supply is not

    expected to have an immediate impact on the tax rate in her country of residence. Even if the

    government wanted to react to a variation in aggregate hours worked in the economy by

    altering the tax rates, it cannot do so quickly, because it is well known that the inside-lags are

    substantial in case of fiscal policy. In other words, changes in taxes necessitate negotiations

    both in the parliament and with different constituents including labor unions. Because of the

    lags in legislative implementation, it is implausible that tax rates would react

    contemporaneously to a change in the aggregate hours worked in the economy. Neither the

    tax rates nor aggregate labor supply vary significantly within a country from year to year.

    For example, in Germany average hours worked per working-age population were 1,065 in

    2008, 1,057 in 2010, and 1,067 in 2012. We display the aggregate hours worked and the

    effective marginal tax rate for France, Germany, the U.K. and Belgium from the OECD data

    over the period of 2000-2012 in Table 2.5 There is no systematic change in hours worked or

    in the tax rate in these countries over the course of these 13 years. When we calculate the

    year-to-year change in average hours worked and in the effective marginal tax rate over the

    same period for the 26 European countries used in the analysis, we find that the average

                                                    10
      annual growth rate is essentially zero for both hours worked and taxes (the average growth

      rate is -0.002 in case of annual hours and 0.0002 in case of taxes).

              It could be possible, however, that both country-level taxes and individual labor

      supply are driven by certain socio-economic and cultural attributes of the country. For

      example, societies can be rated on a scale ranging from “individualistic” to “collectivist”

      using the index of individualism, developed by Hofstede (2001) and Hofstede (2005).6 Lower

      values indicate the higher extent of collectivism of the society, which stands for the extent to

      which individuals are integrated into groups. In collectivist societies, people from birth

      onwards are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, often extended families (with uncles,

      aunts and grandparents) which continue protecting them in exchange for unquestioning

      loyalty. Higher values of the index represent individualistic societies where the ties between

      individuals are loose, and where people are expected to look after themselves and their

      immediate family. 7 There is substantial variation around the world in the extent to which

      countries are individualistic or collectivist. For example Australia is rated a highly

      individualistic country with a score of 90 (out of 100), and the most collectivist societies are

      Colombia with a score of 13, Indonesia with a score of 14 and Costa Rica with a score of 15.

      It could be the case that the extent of individualism in the country may be correlated with the

      peoples‟ desired level of government regulation and tax rates, as well as with the extent of

      the labor supply. We control for individualism in the country to account for such an effect.

              Similarly, we control for other potential factors that may impact both taxes and labor

      supply. They include per capita income in the country, the size of the population, the extent

      of ethno-linguistic fragmentation in the country, as well as the extent of democracy. We also

      control for the legal origin of the country. These indicators account for whether the country‟s

      legal origin is British common law, French commercial code, socialist or communist law,

      German commercial law or Scandinavian commercial law. These variables are explained in

      the descriptive statistics Table 4.

                First-generation immigrants are a self-selected group of people who chose to leave

      their country-of-origin and decided to migrate to another country. Thus, their unobserved

      attributes, including the propensity to work, may be different from the general population.

      This issue, however, is not relevant for second-generation immigrants who are born in the

      country of residence. Although these individuals have inherited the genetic attributes of their

      immigrant parents, including perhaps an attitude towards work, this is not expected to create

      a bias in our estimated coefficients unless one is prepared to argue that different countries of

      origin have identical distributions of taste for leisure but that first-generation immigrants

      from different countries are selected from different parts of this distribution.8 Note also that

      cultural assimilation of the second-generation immigrants would make it difficult to identify

      a statistically significant impact of culture of leisure on labor supply, even if it existed.

          We also estimate alternative versions of Equation (4) as shown below.


          (5)      hijnt = α0 + α1 τj + XiΘ + Cj Ξ + ξt +μn+ νijnt,

          (6)      hijnt = λ0 + λ1Ln+ XiΛ + COn Γ + θt +ωj+ uijnt,

          In equation (5) we replace all country-of-origin variables by country-of-origin fixed-

      effects (μn). This specification does not contain measures of culture of leisure, but it still

      includes country-of-residence attributes as well as the tax rate in the country of origin.

Analogously, in Equation (6), the country-of residence variables, including the tax rate, are

replaced by country-of-residence fixed-effects (ωj), whereas variables measuring country-of-

origin attributes, including proxies for culture of leisure, are retained. Equation (5) allows us

to investigate the sensitivity of the tax impact when we control for country-of-origin

differences by a set of country-of-origin fixed effects. Equation (6) does the reverse: it

allows us to analyze the sensitivity of the culture-of-leisure coefficient when we control for

the attributes of the countries of residence by a set of country-of-residence fixed-effects.


IV. Data and Descriptive Statistics

       The analyses are based on a number of different data sets. Data on labor supply and

personal attributes of individuals are from the European Social Survey (ESS). We use five

cross-sectional rounds of the ESS, conducted biennially between years 2004 and 2013. The

ESS covers 35 European countries that participated in at least one round of the survey. We

include in our analysis 26 countries for which the OECD tax data are available. The core

module of the ESS is administered in all rounds and contains information about respondents‟

socio-economic circumstances, including employment history and work-related variables.

Starting with the second round, the ESS asks its respondents the countries in which their

mother and father were born, in addition to asking about respondent‟s own country of birth.

Our sample consists of second-generation immigrants. These individuals were born in their

country of residence but their fathers have migrated from a different country.



Outcomes and Personal Attributes

       The two outcome variables are labor force participation and hours of work for the

individual. The labor force participation variable takes the value of one if the individual


                                             13
reported being engaged in any paid work in the last 7 days or has been unemployed and is

actively looking for a job. The second measure of labor supply measures the intensive

margin, where the outcome is hours normally worked in a week at the main job. This

information is obtained from individuals who are either working at the time of the interview

or have worked in the past. In the former case, hours worked pertains to hours at the current

job, while in the latter case, hours worked corresponds to the hours worked at the

respondents‟ last job. We know the year in which this last job was held and we limit our

sample to those who last worked in the year 2000 or later. The reason is twofold: first, the

OECD tax measure is only available after year 2000, and second, measurement error is likely

to increase as people have to recall their weekly work hours from further back in the past.

       Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics of the sample used in the hours worked

equation. The descriptive statistics of the sample used in participation regressions are

provided in the Appendix Table 2. Although the samples in the labor force participation and

the hours regressions are different by design, their descriptive statistics are similar. The first

panel of Table 4 presents the summary statistics by dividing the sample by gender of the

worker, as well as by the availability of the tax measure. Average weekly hours worked is

about 36 for females and 43 for males. Average age is about 40 for both sexes and average

years of schooling is around 13.5.



Tax Measures

       We employ two different tax measures. Our first tax measure comes from the OECD

Tax Database. It is the average personal income tax and the social security contribution rate

on gross labor income for a single person without a dependent. This tax measure is available



                                              14
      for 26 countries in the ESS for all years from 2000 to 2013. Our second tax measure is the

      effective marginal tax rate on labor income (τ) as used by others (e.g. Prescott 2004,

      McDaniel 2011). We use the average tax series updated by McDaniel (2014) to construct .9

      This tax measure is not available for all 26 countries and for all years for which the OECD

      average tax rate is available. In particular, Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, and Turkey

      have missing data for all years. Thus, the regressions that use τ are based on smaller samples.

      Table 3 displays the tax rates for countries in which the individuals in our sample reside. The

      two measures are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.75. The tax variables

      are merged with the individual-level data based on the year of work when the outcome is the

      weekly hours normally worked, and based on the year of interview when the outcome is labor

      force participation.



      Measures of Culture of Leisure in the Country of Origin

              To construct culture of leisure measures, we use data from the World Values Survey

      (WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS). We employ the five cross-sectional waves of

      the WVS (1981–1984, 1990–1993, 1995–1997, 1999–2004, and 2005-2009). The WVS

      coverage starts with 22 countries in the 1981-1984 wave, and reaches 87 countries by the

      time of the 2005-2009 wave. The WVS asks its respondents about their attitudes regarding a

      variety of topics, including religion, political preferences, family values and work ethics.

              The European Values Study (EVS) consists of four waves of cross-sectional surveys

      conducted in 49 predominantly European countries (1981-1984, 1990-1993, 1999-2001, and

      2008-2010). The formulation of EVS questions about attitudes to work and leisure is

9
    Our calculation of follows the formulation of Prescott (2004) and McDaniel (2011):
                     , where ,       and are taken from McDaniel (2014) data.

                                                    15
     identical to the WVS formulation. By pooling the WVS and the EVS, we are able cover a

     large number of countries around the world to gauge the beliefs about the importance of

     work and leisure in people‟s lives in these countries. When using WVS/EVS to measure

     preferences towards leisure, we have excluded immigrants whenever information on

     immigration status was available.

            The descriptions of the variables and their sample means and standard deviations are

     provided in Panel B of Table 4. We created five variables to measure the extent of culture of

     leisure. Higher values of each variable represent a higher appreciation of leisure in that

     country. The first variable “Leisure Important” is the average response in the country to the

     question “Indicate how important leisure time is in your life.” Potential answers range from

     1: Not at all important to 4: Very important. Table 4 shows that for individuals who enter the

     hours of work regressions the average value of this variable is 3.1. Appendix Table 1

     displays the average response to Leisure Important variable in each of the 81 countries that

     represented the country-of-origin of the immigrant father. For example, the value of Leisure

     Important is 2.60 in Albania.10 In comparison, the average value of Canada is 3.28,

     indicating that Canadians attach a higher value to leisure than Albanians do.11

            The second variable that gauges culture of leisure in a country is based on the

     question of “Do you agree or disagree with the statement: People who don’t work turn lazy.”

     Possible answers range from 1: Strongly agree to 5: Strongly disagree. A higher value

     indicates a more tolerant attitude towards not working. The third and fourth variables in this

     group are measured similarly, and they are based on answers to the following questions: “Do

10
 This number is the average response of 3,466 Albanians surveyed in various waves of the WVS and the
EVS between 1994 and 2008.
11
  The average Canadian response is based on 5,442 Canadians who were surveyed in various waves
between 1990 and 2007.

                                                  16
     you agree or disagree with the statement: Work is a duty toward society,” and “Do you agree

     or disagree with the statement: Work should always come first, even if it means less spare

     time.” A fifth variable is created to measure the extent of appreciation of leisure in a country

     by calculating the proportion of people in the country who believe that provision of generous

     holidays is an important aspect of a job.

            Finally, we created two other measures that capture the extent of labor market

     attachment in the country-of-origin. They are the labor force participation rates and average

     weekly hours worked in father‟s country-of-origin. Labor force participation in the country

     of ancestry has been used before as a cultural proxy for work (Fernádez and Fogli 2009,

     Fernández and Fogli 2006). We calculate these variables by gender. This allows us to

     conduct more nuanced analyses. For example, we can investigate how the labor supply

     decision of a female second-generation immigrant in Europe is impacted by the intensity of

     labor market activity of women in the country from which this person‟s father migrated.

     Furthermore, we fine-tuned this measure to connect it to the relevant age groups using the

     age bands of 15-24, 25-54 and 55-64.12

            Similarly, we obtained weekly hours actually worked per employed person in the

     country of origin. The data come from the International Labor Organization ILOSTAT

     Database. Because the annual data are not available for every year and country, we use

     averaged available values over the time period 2000 to 2013. The ILOSTAT indicator covers

     both employees and self-employed and it counts hours people have worked either on all jobs,


12
  For example, we connected the propensity to participate in the labor market of a female 2nd generation
immigrant in Europe who is 20 years old to the labor force participation rate of women ages 15-24 in her
father‟s country of origin. Country-age-and gender specific labor force participation rates were obtained
from the International Labor Organization ILOSTAT database. Because the annual data are not available
for every year, country, and age band, we use averaged available values over the time period 2002 to
2013.

                                                   17
     or, in some country-years, at the main and second job only. Both part-time and full-time

     employment hours are accounted for.13 Our measure of weekly hours in the country of origin

     is gender-specific, but not age-group specific, as the ILOSTAT does not provide age group-

     specific indicator.



     Country Attributes

            In each specification, we also control for country characteristics both in the country of

     respondent‟s residence and in his/her father‟s country of origin. These variables include

     ethno-linguistic fragmentation, the legal origin of the country, and the number of years in

     which the country was democratic from 1930 to 1995. Additionally, the models include per

     capita income, average country education, population size, and individualism index in the

     country of residence.



     V. Results

            Table 5 displays the summary results for females. Panel A presents the coefficients

     of tax and culture variables in the labor force participation equation, and Panel B presents the

     estimated tax and culture coefficients from the hours equation for those who reported

     positive work hours. All models include control variables pertaining to the individual,

     country of ancestry and country of residence. These variables are listed in panels A, C, and

     D of Table 4. The coefficients of these variables are not reported in the interest of space,




13
  In addition, the ILOSTAT provides a number of flags indicating data inconsistencies that can
complicate analysis across time and countries. For example, in China, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Egypt,
Pakistan, Panama, Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe only full-time employment hours are counted, and we
exclude these countries from our sample.

                                                  18
although in Appendix Table 3 we display the full set of coefficients of the model in column

(1) of Panel A in Table 5.

       Table 5 presents six specifications in six columns. Each specification includes a

different culture of leisure construct, which is displayed at the column header. For example,

in model of column (1) culture of leisure is measured by the mean value of the question that

gauges the importance of leisure in people‟s lives (Leisure Important). Similarly, in column

(2) culture of leisure is measured by responses to the statement of “People who don’t work

turn lazy” in the country of origin. Higher values of culture variables in columns (1) to (5)

indicate stronger preference for leisure. Thus, the estimated coefficient of culture of leisure in

these columns is expected to be negative. In column (6), culture is measured by the labor

force participation rate in the country of origin when we estimate models on the extensive

margin (Panel A), or as the average hours worked in the country of origin when we estimate

models on the intensive margin (Panel B). The coefficients of these variables are expected to

be positive to the extent that work effort in the country of ancestry is a cultural attribute

transmitted to the offspring.

       Both Panels A and B of Table 5 have two sections. The models in the top section of

each panel use the first tax measure (average tax), while the models in the bottom section

employ τ (effective marginal tax) as the measure of the tax rate in the country. Panel A of

Table 5 shows that taxes have a negative impact on female labor force participation in all

models when taxes are measured by the average tax. The same is true also in models where

taxes are measured by the effective marginal tax rate τ, although the point estimates are

significant only at the 12-15 percent level in models of columns (1) to (4).




                                              19
        Culture of leisure in the country of origin has a negative and statistically significant

impact on female labor force participation in models displayed in columns (1) and (5) where

culture is measured by people‟s valuation of leisure (leisure is important) and by valuation of

the generous holidays attached to a job; In the regression reported in column (6), culture of

leisure is measured by female labor force participation in the country-of-ancestry; and its

coefficient is positive as expected.

        Panel B presents the results where the dependent variable is hours worked for

females, conditional on working. Both higher taxes in the country of residence and higher

culture of leisure in the country of origin reduce female hours. Culture coefficients are

statistically different from zero in models 2, 3, and 4 when taxes are measured by average

personal income tax rate for a single person without a dependent, and in models 2, 4 and 5

with effective marginal tax rate on labor income. The picture that emerges in Table 5 is that

for females, taxes have a negative impact on labor supply both at the extensive and intensive

margins, and culture of leisure also negatively impacts labor supply, although the precision

of the estimated coefficients varies between specifications.

       Table 6 reports the results of the same models for males. In Panel A we observe that

taxes have a negative impact on labor force participation, regardless of the measure of culture

and regardless of the measure of taxes. On the other hand, the coefficients of culture

variables are never statistically different from zero. Panel B summarizes the models that

investigate hours worked for males, conditional on working. While there is evidence on the

impact of taxes on labor male labor supply, culture of leisure has no impact on hours worked

for males.




                                             20
            In Table 7 we summarize these results by reporting them in elasticity form. The

     elasticities with respect to taxes are based on median estimate of the effective marginal tax

     rate coefficients, and the elasticity with respect to culture is the median estimate within the

     relevant panels of Tables 5 and 6. The implied aggregate hours elasticity for taxes is -0.42

     for females and -0.27 for males.14 The impact of culture of leisure, expressed in elasticity

     terms, is smaller than the impact of taxes, but still sizable for female labor supply, while

     culture of leisure has no impact on men‟s labor market activity.

            To put these elasticities in perspective, note for example, that in Belgium average

     hours per working age population was 989 in 2012, and the effective marginal tax rate is

     57%. In Portugal, average hours worked in 2012 was 1,237 and the effective marginal tax

     rate is 41%. If the tax rate in Belgium goes down 16 percentage points to bring it down to

     the level prevailing in Portugal, this would be a 28 percent reduction and using the elasticity

     estimates for men and women in Table 7, and using the weights of men and women in

     employment, we find that aggregate hours would go up by 9% or by 93 hours per working-

     age person. This would help close the gap in hours of work between Belgium and Portugal

     (see Table 1) by about 45%. This is possibly an under-estimate because the elasticity we use

     is uncompensated, and it does not take into account the income effect.

            The mean value of the response to the question of “Work is Duty towards Society”

     (1: Strongly Agree, 5: Strongly disagree) is 2.3 in Belgium. If the tastes for leisure were

     weaker so that the mean response to this question was 1.91 (the level in Portugal), this would

     constitute a 17% decline in the intensity of tastes for leisure. This change in preferences

     would impact hours worked only through its effect on females, because in case of males
14
  These estimates are smaller than those summarized by Chetty et al. (2011) but the numbers reported in
Table 7 are uncompensated elasticities, while the ones reported by Chetty et al. (2011) are compensated
elasticities.

                                                   21
neither participation nor hours respond to changes in culture of leisure. The impact on

aggregate hours worked per working age population would be an increase by 39 hours (about

4%). This would close the gap in hours worked between Belgium and Portugal by 20%.

        Table 8 reports the same models reported earlier, but these models include country-

of-origin fixed-effects. As a result, we cannot identify the impact of leisure variables, but we

can investigate whether the impact of taxes is altered by this specification. Table 8 displays

the coefficients of the average and marginal taxes in both the participation and hours

equations. They are very similar to those reported in Tables 5 and 6.

        Tables 9 and 10 display the results of the analogous exercise, but in this case, we

replace the country-of-residence variables, including the tax rates, with country of residence

dummies. Country-of-origin variables, including leisure measures, are retained. Table 9

presents the results for females. The estimated coefficients of various measures of leisure are

consistent with the ones reported earlier in both participation and hours decisions, but the

statistical significant is spotty. The results for males, shown in Table 10, are also consistent

with those reported earlier: taste for leisure is not a statistically significant determinant of

men‟s labor market activity.



VI. Summary and Conclusion

        There are substantial differences in aggregate hours worked between countries. In an

influential paper, using a growth model Prescott (2004) argued that virtually all of the

difference in hours worked between the U.S. and Europe can be explained by the differences

in tax rates. A large literature that followed Prescott (2004) provided various extensions




                                               22
ranging from consideration of households‟ self-insurance through asset accumulation

(Ljungqvist and Sargent 2006) to incorporation of household production (McDaniel 2011).

        Taxes distort the margin at which the market labor supply decision is made and

higher taxes on labor income motivate people to shift away from market work to leisure. The

large magnitude of the labor supply response in the Prescott framework, however, prompted

the skeptics to suggest alternative or complementary mechanisms to explain the labor supply

differences between countries, including the importance of regulations and labor unions

(Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote 2005). One important point in this framework is the

assumption of homogeneous preferences between countries. While it has been explicitly

acknowledged that preferences for leisure may not be identical between countries (Blanchard

2006), no research has addressed the question of whether or not the “taste for leisure” has a

role in labor supply differences.

       In this paper we use micro data from European Social Survey that include

information on labor force participation and hours worked of second-generation immigrants

who reside in 26 European countries. These individuals are born in Europe, and they have

been exposed to institutional, legal and labor market structures of their countries, including

the tax rates. Fathers of these individuals are first-generation immigrants and our data allow

us to identify 81 different countries they migrated from. We follow the recent literature on

the impact of culture on economic behavior (Alesina et al. 2015, Alesina and Giuliano 2010,

Fernández 2011) and use immigrant father‟s country of birth to determine the ancestral roots,

and assume that culture of leisure in father‟s country of origin is transmitted from the

immigrant father to the offspring.




                                             23
       Using the World Values Survey and the European Values Study, we construct

measures of “taste for leisure” in the country of origin of each immigrant father. These

measures include average responses in a country to such questions as “How Important is

leisure time in your life?” “Do you agree or disagree with the statement: People who don’t

work turn lazy.” “Do you agree or disagree with the statement: Work is a duty to society.”

“Do you agree or disagree with the statement: Work should always come first even if it

means less spare time.” The details of these and other variables that aim to gauge the extent

of culture of leisure in the country of origin are provided in the paper.

       We employ two different tax measures. The first one is the average personal income

tax and the social security contribution rate on gross labor income for a single person without

a dependent. The second one is the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. We control

for individual characteristics such age, education, marital status, size of the city and ethnic

minority status. We also control for a set of attributes of the country of residence and

country of origin, ranging from per capita income to legal origin of the country. Thus, we are

able to identify the impact of taxes on labor supply (both at the extensive and intensive

margin), holding constant observable attributes of individuals, various attributes of the

country in which they live, and attributes of their father‟s country of origin, including the

taste for leisure in that country of origin. Similarly, we can identify the impact of culture of

leisure on labor supply, holding constant personal characteristics, and country attributes,

including taxes.

   The results show that for women, both taxes and culture of leisure impact participation

and hours worked. For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the

extensive margin, but culture of leisure has no impact. We find uncompensated aggregate



                                              24
labor supply elasticity of -0.42 for women and -0.27 for men. The elasticity for “taste for

leisure” is -0.24 for women and zero for men. These results suggest that while labor income

tax is a significant determinant of aggregate hours worked, culture of leisure in the country is

important as well.

   Although we do not address the question of “what determines the difference in culture of

leisure between countries?” we should emphasize that recent research has shown that cultural

attributes are malleable, and they react to external factors. For example, Fernández (2013)

shows that social attitudes towards women‟s work endogenously change over time. Alesina

and Fuchs-Schűndeln (2007) find that individual preferences are shaped by the political

regime in which they lives. Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) report that individuals‟

political preferences and their support for government redistribution policies are impacted by

whether or not they grew up during recessionary periods. Cannonier and Mocan (2012) find

that women in Sierra Leone, whose years of schooling is increased by an education reform,

are more likely to disapprove certain cultural norms and behaviors. Tastes for leisure, too,

are likely to evolve over time as a cultural attribute. A simple example is the one given by

Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote (2006) who suggest that an initial decline in market work

might increase individuals‟ utility from leisure and this process can be amplified by a social

multiplier (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman 2003) if there exist complementarities in

leisure. But, regardless of whether culture of leisure evolves gradually or slowly over time,

our results indicate that people would work less in a country if the taste for leisure is stronger

in that country.

Notes: Personal characteristics variables data come from the ESS survey. The question about hours normally worked in a
week refers to the respondent‟s current job if he or she is currently employed and to the most recent job if he or she is
unemployed at the time of the interview. We restrict our sample to second-generation immigrants who are either working
at the time of the interview or have held their last job in year 2000 or later and are/were between 16 and 64 years of age at
the time of working. We also exclude individuals who reported either zero hours normally worked or more than 100
hours. Survey weights are used.
