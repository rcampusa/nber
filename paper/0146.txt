            LEGAL PRECEDENT: A THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS*

                               I.   Introduction



     In a legal system such as ours, in which legislative bodies con-

fine themselves for the most part to prescribing general norms of conduct

rather than highly specific rules, the published decisions of courts

and administrative agencies interpreting and applying the legislative

enactments are important sources of the specific rules of law. When the

parties to a legal dispute are unable to agree on the meaning of the

governing statute as applied to their dispute, litigation may ensue in

which that meaning will be an issue for the court to resolve. The

court's resolution will define the specific requirements of the statute

in the circumstances presented by the case and thus create (subject to

a qualification noted below) a specific rule of legal obligation

applicable to like circumstances.

     The rules produced by the process of adjudication are distinctive in

being implicit rather than explicit rules.' The rule promulgated by a

decision is not the court's express statement, if any, of a rule; rather,

it is the court's holding, that is, .the minimum rule (whether or not

expressly articulated) necessary to explain the outcome of the case. The

rule created by a single decision will therefore tend to be extremely narrow

in scope; a broader judge—made rule will generally require a series of
                                                                     2




judicial decisions--a string of holdings—-for it is only from a series of

decisions, each determining the legal significance of a slightly different

set of facts, that a rule applicable to a situation common or general

enough to be likely to recur in the future can be inferred.

      A factor pushing in the same direction is that the authority

of a rule declared in a single decision is limited unless the

rule is declared by a higher court for the guidance of a lower one in

the same jurisdiction. Especially in appellate litigation, most of the

judge-made rules urged on the court are those of a coequal court, or those

declared in the earlier decisions of the same court; such rules have

persuasive force, but are not binding. Where, however, the rule has

been, as it were, solidified in a long line of decisions, the authority

of the rule is enhanced. The rule then represents the accumulated

experience of many judges responding to the arguments and evidence of

many lawyers and is therefore more likely to be followed in subsequent

cases.

     The distinctive attributes of decisional rules are captured in the

term that the legal system uses to describe such rules: "precedents."

In ordinary language, a precedent is something done in the past that

is appealed to as a reason for doing the same thing again. It is much

the same in law. The earlier decision provides a reason for deciding

a subsequent similar case the same way, and a series of related prece-

dents may crystallize a rule having much the same force as a statutory

 rule. Accordingly, legal precedents are more accurately described as
                                                                        3



 inputs into the production of judge-made rules of law than as the rules

 themselves; but this refinement will be ignored in this paper to

 simplify the exposition.

      The use of precedents to create rules of legal obligation has, to our

 knowledge, received little theoretical or empirical analysis.2 This paper

 presents and tests empirically an economic approach to legal precedent

 that is derived mainly from the analysis of capital formation and investment.

We treat the body of legal precedents created by judicial decisions in

prior periods as a capital stock that yields a flow of information services

which depreciates over time as new conditions arise that were not foreseen

by the framers of the existing precedents. New (and
                                                      replacement) capital
is created by investment in the production of precedents.

      The basic data for the empirical analysis are case citations appearing

in judicial opinions. An initial problem is that a case citation is not

the same thing as a precedent. Sometimes a case is not cited as a

precedent; an example is a citation of the decision of a lower court (or

courts) in the same case. Our samples exclude this obvious
                                                             nonprecedential

citation, and other (less obvious) ones.3 In some instances, counting

citations may result in underestimating the true number of precedents

by excluding the precedent that is so effective in defining the require-

ments of the law that it prevents legal disputes from arising in the

first place or, if they do arise, induces them to be settled without

litigation. In the limit, such a usuperprecedentht might never be cited

in an appellate opinion yet have greater precedential significance than

the most frequently cited cases. But such cases are probably rare.

If a case is highly specific, it will hardly qualify as a usuperprecedent;
                                                                     4




by definition it will control only those infrequent cases that present
virtually identical facts to those of the case in which it was originally

announced. If it is highly general, and therefore more likely to be an

important precedent, it is unlikely to decide so clearly as to prevent

disputes or litigation from arising, the specific form of the question

presented in subsequent cases.

      Citations   by scientists and other scholars to scientific and scholarly
books and articles (rather than by lawyers and judges to cases) have been
studied   extensively by historians of science, by sociologists, and by

economists.4 Scholarly citations, however, are not examples of the use of

precedent. The normal function of the scholarly citation is not to

adduce authority for a proposition but to give credit for prior original

work, to refer the reader to corroborative or collateral findings by

other scholars, and as a method of incorporating by reference relevant

theorems, proofs, etc. Since the second and third functions of scholarly

citation have counterparts in judicial citation, studies of scholarly

citation may have relevance to understanding judicial citation, but the

present paper does not explore the possible parallels between scholarly

and judicial citation.

      The idea of analyzing judicial citation practices for regularities

that might refute or support hypotheses derived from capital theory will

no doubt strike many lawyers, both practicing and academic, as a dubious

undertaking. Not only are many lawyers skeptical in general concerning

the use of economic models and quantitative methods to study the legal

system, but they assume that judges' citation practices are altogether

too idiosyncratic to be illuminated by general theory and statistical
                                                                        5




 aggregation. Whether a judicial opinion cites many cases or few, old

 cases or new, is, they believe, more a function of the judge's personal

 style, tastes, erudition, pedantry, etc. than of systematic characteristics

of the legal process. Yet this seems improbable. The extensive research

and writing that lawyers, judges, and law clerks devote to discovering,

marshalling, enumerating, and explaining precedents are not costless

undertakings, and would not be undertaken if precedent did not enter

systematically into the decision of cases. However, the question whether

or not the use of precedents is systematic does not have to be decided

on a priori    grounds; to the extent that judicial citation practices exhibit
regularities   explicable within a systematic analytical framework, a

statistical analysis of precedent should reveal them.

      The paper is organized as follows. Part II describes our case samples

and presents tables summarizing the princijal characteristics of citations.

The theoretical analysis is contained in Part III. There we formalize

the capital-investment model, derive hypotheses, and discuss the production

of precedents in the absence of an explicit market. Part IV develops

techniques for using case citations to study precedents empirically and

presents the results of our empirical analysis. The final part of this

paper, Part V. suggests some areas of further research utilizing the

approach developed here.

                              II. The Samples



      Our first and principal source of data on precedents is a random

sample of 658 decisions (an approximately one-in-ten sample) handed down

by the federal courts of appeals during an approximately 18-month period

beginning in January 1974 and ending in the sumer of 1975. Each decision

was classified by subject matter, and the number and age of citations

to both earlier Supreme Court and other-court decisions were recorded.

Two other data sources were also developed for this study: a random

sample of 223 decisions (again an approximately one—in—ten sample) by

the federal courts of appeals during 1960, and all of the decisions

handed down by the Supreme Court during its 1974 term.

      Table 1 presents a subject-matter breakdown of the decisions in

our three data sets. The subject—matter classifications we employ are

gross,5 but this is unavoidable because of the limited number of cases

included in our samples. Table 1 indicates the close comparability

between the subject-matter distributions of our 1960 and 1974-1975

courts of appeals samples and those reported by the Administrative Office

of the U.S. Courts for all cases commenced in the courts of appeals in

fiscal years 1960 and 1974 respectively.6

    To avoid becoming confused later on, the reader should be careful to

disting(ish between the cases in our three samples (hereafter "sample cases")

and our measure of precedents. The sample cases presented in Table 1 are

not the precedents that we studied; they are the source of our data on

precedents. It is the citations in the sample cases that are the precedents

(more precisely, the proxy for the precedents) used in the empirical analysis.

Thus, we study Supreme Court precedents by analyzing the citations to Supreme

Court decisions contained in both the courts of appeals and the. Supreme Court sample

cases, and courts of appeals precedents by analyzing citations

to courts of appeals decisions in both the courts of appeals and Supreme Court

sample cases. This is not the only way,to collect and analyze data on

precedents. An alternative approach, not used in this study, is to trace the

history of a case as a precedent by counting the citations to that case in

later judicial opinions.7

     Table 2 summarizes the data on precedents that we obtained from the

three sets of sample cases. The average ages, standard errors,.

and numbers of citations are presented by subject-matter classes for each

data set.8 Within each subject-matter classification there is a further

breakdown between citations to U.S. Supreme Court decisions and citations

to other court decisions. The reason for distinguishing empirically among

subject matters, and between Supreme Court and other-court citations, is

that theory (developed in the next part of this paper) suggests that

precedents will differ systematically both across subject-matter classes and

between the Supreme Court and other courts, in particular the U.S. courts

of appeals.9

     Two methods of calculating the age of citations are used in Table 2.
                                                                         9



 The column labeled "unweighted" is the mean across decisions of the average

 age of the citations in each decision. The column labeled weighted" is the

 average of all of the citations in the subject-matter class (i.e., the

 average age of the citations in each decision weighted by the number of

 citations).1° An example will help to clarify the difference between the

 unweighted and weighted method. In the 1974—1975 courts ofappeals sample,

492 cases cited Supreme Court precedents. For each of these 492 cases we

calculated the mean age of citations to Supreme Court citations.   The

unweighted age (18.5 years in Table 2) is the average of the 492 means

(i.e., in effect each of the 492 case means is given a weight of one). The

weighted average (19.1 years in Table 2) weights each of the 492 case means

by the number of citations contained in that case, and is thus equiv-

alent to the mean age of the 2,278 citations contained in the 492 sample

cases.

                               [Insert Table 2]

     Table 2 reveals some interesting regularities in the age of judicial

citations. Citations to Supreme Court decisions regularly tend to be twice

as old on average as citations to other courts' decisions--roughly, 20

years old compared to 10.11 Of further interest is the similarity of the

weighted and unweighted means and of the age distributions across subject-

matter classes among the 1960 and 1974-1975 court of appeals samples and

the 1974 Supreme Court sample. Another interesting statistic is the

"half life" (i.e., median age) of a precedent. In the 1974-1975 courts of

appeals sample, half of the citations to Supreme Court and other-court

decisions were less than 9.8 and 4.3 years old, respectively (compared to

weighted means of 19.1 and 9.9 years). In the 1974 Supreme Court sample,

Notes: w = weigkted average (see text for      explanation).

          No. per case =   average number of citations per case.
1.  In each subject-matter class there are three numbers per column under
the age columns: the top one is the mean age; the middle one (in paren-
theses) is the standard error of the mean; and the lowest one (in brackets)
is either the number of citations (weighted columns) or number of cases
with citations (unweighted columns).

2.  In the nO.-per-case column there are two numbers per column: the top
one is the mean number and the second one (in parentheses) is the stan-
dard error of the mean number.

the half lives of Supreme Court and other court decisions were 13 and

5.4 years respectively (compared to weighted means of 25.8 and 15.7 years).

The substantial skewness in the age distribution of citations

is due in part, as.we show later, to the growth over time in

the production of precedents. But this cannot be the complete explanation,

because it does not account for the skewness in citations to the Supreme

Court, where the production of precedents has remained relatively constant

over time. Other explanatory variables are the obsolesence or depreciation

of legal precedents, the generality or specificity of precedents, statutory

activity,   and other factors explored later.
       The half lifeof citations in scholarly journals appears to be generally
shorter than that of citations in judicial decisions-—for   example,

5.5   years in economic and in sociological articles and about four years in
physics and biomedical research)2 Another basis of comparison to scholarly
citations   is the number of citations per decision or article. Combining

citations to both the Supreme Court and other courts, we find that the average

number of citations per decision is 12.3 and 21 in the 1974-1975 courts of

appeals and in the Supreme Court samples, respectively. This compares to

approximately 11 citations per article in leading economic journals, 18

in chemical journals, and four or five in medical journals)3

       The data in Table 2 can be used to test a popular explanation of

differences in average ages of citations: differences in the individual

citation practices of judges. Arguably, whether a judge cites many or

few cases is largely a matter of personal preference or taste for citing

cases. 'This implies that the judge with little taste for citing
                                                                        15




 cases will tend to cite only the most recent cases—-because he lacks

 information on the relevance of earlier dedsions, wants to economize on

 his time, or believes that the more recent ones tend to have greater

 precedential significance. By the same token, the judge with a taste for

 citing many cases will cite those same recent cases plus others less recent

and hence the average age of his citations will be greater. Thus, if

taste is the principal determinant of the number of citations, there

should be a strong positive correlation between the number of

citations   per case and the average age of citations per case. We, of course,
question the premise that citation practice is largely a matter of
personal preference (and implicitly therefore not capable of being studied

scientifically). The economist expects citation practices to be basically

uniform across judges, just as he expects different business firms to

pursue similar investment policies in the face of similar economic condi-

tions. If a judge cites more cases, it is not because his taste for

citations is different but because the case before him is different--

perhaps it has more issues, or its issues are less clearly controlled by

some precedent. Accordingly, we would not expect to find a strong

positive relationship between the number of citations per opinion and their

average age.

     This issue can be illuminated by empirical analysis. A useful first

step is to compare the weightedto the unweighted average ages in Table 2,

since a positive correlation between average age and number of citations

implies tjiat the weighted method will yield a higher average age than the
                                                                          16




unweighted.4 For all subject-matter categories

taken together (the first row of Table 2), the weighted

exceeds the unweighted in all six possible comparisons. In our largest

sample, however, the 1974-1975 U.S. courts of appeals sample, the differences

are slight--.6 years and 1.1 years for citations to Supreme Court and

other-court decisions respectively. In the two smaller samples the

differences are somewhat greater, averaging about three years.

     A more powerful test of the importance of the number of citations on

age (and thus a more powerful test of the "taste" hypothesis) is to estimate

a regression of the form


                                                                           (1)



where    is the average age of citations in the ith case, C. the number of

citations in the ith case, and       a vector of subject-matter dummy

variables. Equations (3.1) -     (3.6)   in Table 3 present the results of simple

regressions of    on C. for Supreme Court and other-court citations for

                            [Insert Table 3]

our three data sets. The regressions show that the number of citations does

have a positive effect on the age of citations, but the effect is

statistically significant in only four of the six equations, and the mag-

nitude of the effect is small. For example, in the 1974-1975 sample of

citations to the Supreme Court (I-SC) an approximate doubling in the number

of citations in a decision, from the mean of 4.6 to 10, increases

the mean age of citations by only about .6 years (from 19.1 to 19.7 years),

and an increase in the number of citations to other courts (1-OC) from the

mean of 9.2 to 20 increases the average age by only about 1.3 years

(from 9.9 to 11.2 years). Even in the other two samples, the impact of the

number of citations on the average age is small; for example, in sample

11-SC, increasing the number of citations to Supreme Court cases from the

mean of 15 to 30 would increase average age only from 25.8 to 30.2 years.15

Although these results neither justify nor compel rejection of the
                                                                                 4
"taste"   hypothesis, they indicate it is a weak hypothesis.

Not only is the magnitude of the effect of number on age of citations small,

but the amount of variation in average age across cases that is explained by

differences in the number of citations is negligible; the adjusted R2's in

Table 3 range from 0 to .07 in equations (3.1) to (3.6).

     Equations (3.7) to (3.8) add 14 dummy subject-matter variables to

the 1974-1975 courts of appeals regressions. Each variable takes the value

1 if the case involves the particular subject matter and 0 otherwise.

This allows us to answer the question whether subject matter has a

significant effect on average age if the number of citations is

held constant. (Alternatively, equations (3.7) and (3.8) test the

partial effect of numbers on age, holding subject-matter constant.) An

F-test performed on the entire set of subject-matter variables indicates

that differences in subject matter generate significant differences in the

average age of citations)6 This result tends to undermine the "taste"

hypothesis, for there is no reason why tastes in citing cases should vary

systematically across subject-matter areas. Moreover, the "taste' hypothesis

supplies nb rationale for separating the samples into citations to the Supreme

Court and to other courts and we suspect that if the samples were not

separated in this way the observed positive effect of numbers on age would

be even weaker than we found it to be. Although we have not estimated

regressions based on a combination of these samples, the fact that citations
                                                                        19




 to the Supreme Court tend to be older, yet the number of citations to the

 Supreme Court tend to be fewer, than to other courts suggests that the positive

 effect of numbers on age would be even weaker if citations to the Supreme

 Court and to other courts were combined in the courts of appeals regressions.

       In sum, there appear to be regularities in the citation data (e.g.,

 the difference between citations to the Supreme Court and to other courts, and

 the effect of subject matter) that are not explained by assumed differences in

the individual citation preferences of judges. A more promising approach

is to ignore differences in tastes or preferences and instead utilize an

economic framework in which precedents are viewed as constituting a stock of

legal capital subject to depreciation and the production of precedents is

treated as a form of investment




              III. The Theoretical Framework: Legal Capital



     This part of the paper develops a capital-investment approach for the

analysis of legal precedent. We begin by formulating a model of optimal

investment in the production of precedents, and then use this model to

generate hypotheses concerning the rate of investment, the size of the

capital stock and its rate of depreciation, and the interaction among

these variables. Finally, we examine certain pecularities-in the

precedent-production process that result from the seeming absence of

market incentives on the part of participants in that process. Because of

the novelty of our approach to legal precedent, we develop the theory in

more detail than is necessary for the empirical analysis that follows.

In particular, although the determinants of investment and the capital

stock are discussed here, these variables are with one exception
                                                                           20




treated as exogenous in the empirical analysis. There we largely focus

on measuring investment and the capital stock, and combining these measures

with data on citations to estimate and test hypotheses concerning the

depreciation of legal capital.


                               A. Some Definitions


     Let L equal the stock of legal capital in a particular substantive

area of the law (the th area) in period t. The stock is defined as the

set of precedents that have accumulated from judicial decisions in prior

periods (t-l, t-2, etc.).17 This stock generates a flow of

services in period t that may be defined as bodies of information on the

types of behavior that will be subject to civil and criminal sanctions and

on the magnitude of these sanctions. One can write the stock of legal

capital in period t as


              L =   I+(l-S')L_1                                            (2)



where         is the gross investment (assumed to be nonnegative) in legal

capital that takes place in period t-l, and 51 is the depreciation rate

(assumed to be constant) of legal capital during the interval t-l to t.

        For purposes of empirical estimation of legal capital, it is useful to

express equation (2) as a function of investment and depreciation rates

in all previous periods. By substituting for L_1, L2, etc. we can

rewrite equation (2) as


        L =   'tl   + (l-5')I2 + (15i)211    +   ,   .   .,+   (15i)t111    (3)
                                                                          21




where I is the investment in legal capital in the base period 0. Equation

(3) illustrates the fundamental proposition that an investment in any

period increases the stock of legal capital in all future periods, although

the increments in the stock diminish with time due to the successive com-

pounding of depreciation rates.

     Although a precedent does not "wear out" in a physical sense, it

depreciates in an economic sense because the value of its information

content declines over time with changing circumstances.18 Changes in social

and economic conditions, in legislation, in judicial personnel, and in

other parameters of legal action reduce the value of precedents as a source

of legal doctrine. To illustrate, a decision involving a collision between

two horse-drawn wagons is bound to lose some of its precedential value

when wagons are replaced by cars and trucks, and a decision turning on the difference

between "trespass" and "trespass on the case" may lose all of its precedential

value when the comon-law forms of action are abolished by statute. In

general, passage of time reduces the flow of services of a precedent,'9 and

this reduction represents the depreciation or obsolescence of legal capital.

     The monetary equivalent of the information services generated by

the stock of legal capital in the th area in period t can be written as


          Vt =    V(Lt;Nt)                                                (4)


(The subscript i is now suppressed for notational convenience.) We assume

positive (i.e., the greater the stock, the greater the total value of the

information services) and diminishing returns to legal capital at each
                  20
moment in time.        The services from a given stock will also be greater

the greater is the number of users (Nt) of this type of legal capital.
                                                                       22



Since most activities involving two or more persons or firms are guided,

in part, by the legal consequences of the activity, one might approximate

   by the community's population, income, number of business transactions,

number of firms, etc.21 Our term "monetary equivalent" is simply a con-

venient index for measuring the value of the services (previously defined

as information on the types of behavior subject to sanctions and on the

magnitude of these sanctions) generated by legal capital.22

      The source of investment in legal capital in period t-l is the set of

judicial decisions in that period that create precedents--mainly published

appellate decisions. Although most legal disputes are terminated by out-

of-court settlements, we ignore the contribution of settlements to legal

capital since it is small: settlements, even when their terms are publicly

disclosed, provide little information about the content of legal rules.

Similarly, trials that occur only because of a disagreement over facts do

not generate significant legal capital since the outcome of such a trial

does not provide information about the content of legal rules. Since any

legal issue decided on appeal--and any legal issues in cases that are not

appealed--will have been decided either initially or finally at the trial

level, trial decisions can be a source of legal capital, but the fraction

of trials thatgenerates precedents is small, so we are justified in limiting

our empirical analysis to a sample of appellate decisions.    (Of course,

even at the appellate level, not all decisions contribute significantly to

legal capital; an example would be the decision of an appeal that involved

only issues of the sufficiency of evidence.)

      The creation of precedents through appellate decision-making consumes

the (valuable) time of judges, attorneys, law clerks, court clerks, jurors,

                                                                               D
                                                                                        23



witnesses, and litigants, plus resources associated with the construction
and maintenance of court houses, plus other scarce resources. Ignoring
for   the moment the underlying investment production function (discussed in

subpart D), we can write investments costs in period t as


                C. =   Cdt)                                                              (5)


where the marginal cost of             is both positive (since increases in It

require greater inputs) and nondecreasing.


                              B. Optimal Production of Precedents


         An optimal investment policy would be one that maximized the present

value (Tr) of the difference between the value of the flow of services and

the costs of investment with respect to investment in each period, subject

to the earlier conditions that Lt -
                                                1-   =
                                                         (1_6)Lt_i,       is constant and

   is nonnegative.23 This yields T first-order conditions (from t0 to

1-1) of the form


            =
                 R÷V + Rt+2V+2(l) + Rt+3V÷3(l-o)2 +                   .




                + RTV!J.(l_6)T_t_l - RtC.   =   0                                        (6)


where R÷ is the value (dollar equivalent) at the beginning of period 0

of the services of legal capital in periods t+j (i.e.,                       =


where the per-period discount rate, r, is assumed constant);                       is

the value of the marginal product of the service of legal capital in t+j,

and C is the marginal costs of investment. The optimality condition in

(6) represents the usual equality of marginal returns with marginal

costs.
                                                                           24




     It is more convenient to represent the equilibrium condition in terms

of the optimal stock of legal capital in period t+l. This is given by


     V1 = C(r+S_t)                                                          (7)



where      is the percentage change in the marginal costs of investment from

period t to t+l.      Equation (7), which states that in each period the

capital stock is expanded until the undiscounted value of the marginal

product in that period equals the marginal user cost of capital, has the

advantage of allowing us to convert the multi-period flow equilibrium

(equation (6)) into a single—period stock equilibrium. This is illustrated

in Figure 1, where we assume that the marginal cost of investment is constant

and equal in each period (i.e.,      =   0),   implying a single-period adjustment

to any discrepancy between actual and desired capital stock. To illustrate,

if the stock in t is below the equilibrium (or desired) stock in t+l because,

for example, a new statute is passed creating a demand for new legal

capital or destroying old legal capital, then investment in period t will

be sufficient to bring the stock up to its desired level in t+1. And

if the variables in equation (7) remain constant thereafter, future

investment will just offset depreciation and the capital stock will

remain at its stationary desired level.

                              [Insert Figure 1]

        A fundamental implication of equation (7) and Figure 1 is that the

stock of legal capital in any period will be greater, the greater the value

of its marginal product and the lower its marginal user cost (i.e., the

lower C(r+S)). Thus in areas of the law that affect more

people, legal capital should be relatively more valuable

and hence the optimal stock larger. However, the number of users of the legal

capital (Nt in equation (4)) must be weighted by the value that users attach to the

capital. Thus, a form of legal capital that has narrow applicability and hence a few

users may still be relatively large if the users attach a high value to this capital.

Similarly, in larger communities, the per capita amount of legal capital should be

greater. This follows from the public-good aspect of legal capital.         In the limiting

case, the entire capital stock is received by each member of the community. Hence a

larger community induces a shift in the demand curve in Figure 1 and a greater aggre-

gate and per capita capital stock. To take another example developed later, suppose

that legislative activity depreciates legal capital; one would then expect that in

those areas of the law where there was relatively greater statutory activity
depreciation rates of legal capital would be greater and the optimal

stock of legal capital smaller.25 The effect on gross investment, however,

is uncertain. Although a higher depreciation rate lowers the optimal stock,

it also implies faster replacement of the (smaller) stock.26 As a final example,

the stock of legal capital would tend to grow over time if, for example Nt was

growing secularly. Thus, the demand curve in Figure 1 would be shifting

to the right (provided V1 was a positive function of Nt), leading to a

secular increase in the capital stock. And assuming a constant rate of

growth of the capital stock and a constant 6, gross investment would grow

at a rate equal to that of the capital stock.27


                       C. Depreciation of Legal Capital


     In the previous subpart we considered the effect of different deprecia-

tion rates on investment and the capital stock. We did not, however,

explore the forces that affect the depreciation rate itself.   It is useful

to extend our analysis in this direction since, as indicated earlier,

it is possible to integrate data on investment and citations for the purpose
                                                                    27




of estimating depreciation rates on legal precedents by subject matter--estimates

that we believe are interesting in themselves as well as necessary in order to test

hypotheses derived from the capital-theory approach to legal precedent. What follow

therefore, is both the development of some testable hypotheses on depreciation and

some further discussion of the interrelationship among depreciation, investment, and

capital. We do not, however, explicitly incorporate depreciation as a decision

variable in the formal model developed in the previous subpart and attempt to derive

optimal depreciation rates. A preliminary attempt to do so indicated that such a

modification would be exceedingly complicated and would not alter substantively the

capital-investment framework used in the empirical analysis.

     1. General Versus Specific Legal Capital, Other things being equal,

a precedent can be expected to depreciate more rapidly the narrower

(more specific) it is in terms of the span of facts and issues that it

covers. Conversely, the broader (more general) a precedent is, the slower

should be its rate of depreciation. A general precedent is less likely to

be rendered obsolete by a change in the social or legal environment in

which the precedent is applied; for example, a decision laying down a broad principle

of tort liability should retain its precedential force--be cited--for a

longer period of time than one holding that railroads must station flagmen

at certain crossings. A general precedent is like a machine that, being

adaptable to a number of different uses, is less subject to technological

obsolescence than one specialized to a particular industrial task, or

like general human capital (e.g., schooling), which tends to depreciate

over the life cycle of an individual more slowly than investment in specific

capital (e.g., training specialized to a particular employer).

     The distinction between general and specific legal capital implies

that Supreme Court precedents will depreciate more slowly than those of

other courts such as the federal courts of appeals. The Supreme Court
                                                                        28



 ismore selective than any other court in its choice of cases to review,

 due in major part to its more limited capacity (which is due in turn to

society's evident reluctance to increase the number of Supreme Court Justices or take

other measures that would enable the. Supreme Court to increase its production of

precedents) compared to other courts. Thus, while the Supreme Court's output of

precedents has remained constant for many years despite the enormous

secular increase in the number of legal disputes within the Court's juris-

diction,28 the appointment of additional judges to the federal courts of

appeals has enabled those courts greatly to increase their output of

precedents.29 The more limited capacity of the Supreme Court compared to

that of the courts of appeals has made the opportunity cost of developing

new precedents and modifying old ones increase faster in the Supreme Court.

That is why the Supreme Court has had to become relatively more selective

over time in its choice of cases to review, and one might expect this

selection to favor cases of greater generality30 and hence more durability

as precedents. This implies, incidentally, that, other things being equal,

the depreciation rate of Supreme Court precedents should have declined

over time relative to that of the courts of appeals.

     In relying on the greater generality of Supreme Court precedents to

predict that they will depreciate more slowly than

courof appeals precedents, we may seem to be overlooking the obvious:

Supreme Court precedents depreciate less rapidly than courts of appeals

precedents because, being more authoritative, they are more valuable.

However, neither economic nor any other theory predicts that a capital good

will depreciate more slowly because it. is more valuable:

modern weapons systems and computers are examples of expensive capital

goods that depreciate rapidly (compared, say to lathes). The value of a

good does not dictate when it is replaced.
                                                                        29




     2. Statutory Activity and Depreciation. Precedents can be expected

to depreciate more rapidly in areas of law in which there is considerable

statutory activity, since a change in statutory law will tend to make

precedents based on earlier statutory language obsolete. If we could

reliably measure the levels of statutory activity across the various sub-

ject-matter areas in our sample, we could test this hypothesis rigorously.

At this stage, only a casual empirical analysis of the hypothesis appears

feasible. A further difficulty in testing this hypothesis arises from the

possibility that the legal system will anticipate statutory activity.

If statutory activity is anticipated in area A but not B, the courts may

adapt by making their precedents in A more general and hence more adaptable,

in which event the observed depreciation rate might not differ across

areas that differed in statutoty activity. Still another difficulty is

that legislatures may pass statutes in areas where legal capital depreciates

at a high rate precisely in order to compensate for the relative uncer-

tainty in those areas. In such a case, statutory activity and depreciation would

be positively correlated but the direction of causality would be reversed.

     3. Substantive Versus Procedural Citations. We have attempted to

disaggregate our 1974-1975 courtsof appeals sample into citations to

substantive and to procedural issues by subject-matter classes. Since

identical procedural issues can arise in different substantive areas,

cases in different areas might cite many of the same cases on procedural

questions. If so, one would expect less variation in depreciation rates

of procedural precedents across subject-matter classes than of substantive

precedents. The testing of this hypothesis, however, is hampered by the

conceptual difficulty of distinguishing between "substantive" and "pro-
                                                                            30




cedural" citations--for example, is the issue of damages in an antitrust

case a substantive or a procedural question?

      4. Uncertainty, Litigation, and the Production of Precedents. Suppose

that the stock of legal capital, and hence the flow of information on the

likely outcomes of potential legal disputes, were temporarily below the

desired (long-run equilibrium) level. This might be due to new legislation

or   other unanticipated changes in economic or social conditions that
rendered part of the existing capital stock obsolete. With        the resulting
increase in uncertainty, more disputes would arise, parties to a dispute
would find it more difficult to forecast the outcome of litigation, and

litigation would increase. The result would be a temporary increase in

the production of precedents (investment) until the discrepancy between
                                               31      .
actual   and desired capital was eliminated.        (This process is described

in greater detail in the next subpart.) Alternatively, suppose depreciation

were permanently higher in one subject-matter area of the law compared

to another, with other factors held constant. Although the capital

stock (and possibly gross investment) would be smaller in the area with
                                                                                  32
higher depreciation, the ratio of investment to capital should be greater.

Thus, a higher observed depreciation rate, whether caused by temporary

or permanent forces,should be associated with a greater investment-capital

ratio.

       This hypothesis can be tested in two possible ways. From estimates of

depreciation, investment, and the capital stock by subject matter, the

relationship between depreciation and the investment-capital ratio can

readily be determined. A difficulty with this test is the limited number

of subject-matter classes in our sample. A more powerful test (not
                                                                         31




performed in this paper, however) would be to apply the depreciation

rates calculated in this paper to other data sets containing more observa-

tions. Specifically, we could examine the trial-settlement ratios and

appeal rates across the more than 90 U.S. district courts as a function of

the depreciation rates in each subject-matter class weighted by the proportion

of cases in the district in each class and other variables such as the length

of trial queues. Since higher depreciation is a measure of relative

uncertainty, we should observe that, other things being equal, the higher

is the weighted depreciation rate of a district, the greater will be the

proportion of trials in the district.




                D. The Production Function of Legal Precedents


      The actual production of legal precedents combines two basic

inputs:   (1) the resource inputs of the parties to legal disputes in

litigating their disputes in the courts and (2) the inputs of judges

in writing judicial opinions that will operate as precedents in future

cases. A mysterious aspect of the production process is the apparent

absence of market incentives. Consider first the production of precedents

from the point of view of the disputants. The individual or firm that

brings a case that becomes an important precedent-—a Hadley v. Baxendale

or a Marbury v. Madison--receives no "royalty" or other compensation from

use of the case to decide subsequent cases. To be sure, some litigants

(e.g., railroads defending tort suits or the government prosecuting antitrust

violations) anticipate the recurrence, in future litigation to which they

will be parties, of the issues involved in the current litigation, and such
                                                                       32




litigants have an interest in the precedent produced by the litigation.

But most litigants do not anticipate a recurrence of the same or even of

similar issues in future litigation to which they will be parties, and from

their standpoint the precedent produced by the current litigation is a

worthless by-product of dispute resolution. This raises the question

how the demand for precedents shown in Figure 1, a good that accrues

primarily to the community as a whole rather than to individuals or firms

in the community, can be translated into a private demand which will induce

the private production of precedents.

      The answer lies in an understanding of why litigation, as

distinct from out-of-court settlement, ever occurs, given that

normally it is costlier than settlement. Economic analysis suggests

that, in general, litigation will occur only when the parties are

unable to agree on the likely outcome of the litigation, and more

particularly when one party (or both) significantly exaggerates the

probability that it will prevail.33 Thus the ratio of lawsuits to settle-

ments is mainly a function of the amount of uncertainty, which leads

to divergent estimates by the parties of the probable outcome of litigation.

The amount of legal uncertainty34 is, in turn, a function of the stock

of legal rules, a stock in most areas of the law composed largely of

precedents.

      The ultimate dependence of the litigation rate on the stock of legal

knowledge assures that at least one of the critical inputs into production

of precedents--the litigants' research and advocacy--will respond in a

manner at least roughly congruent with the social need for them. Absence
                                                                        33



or depletion of the relevant legal capital incites litigation, which

produces precedents as a by-product and thereby builds up the stock.

Suppose, for example, thata completely new statute has just been enacted.

There are no precedents indicating how the statute is to be applied to a

variety of specific disputes (we can assume that like most statutes this

one is ambiguously or at least generally worded). Initially, therefore,

there will be great uncertainty as to the practical meaning of the statute.

The uncertainty will increase the private costs of negotiating out-of-

court settlements of disputes resulting from attempts to apply the statute,

because the outcomes of litigation over the meaning of the statute will be

difficult to predict. Hence a good deal of litigation can be expected to

occur and, as a by-product, precedents defining the precise, meaning of the

statute will be generated. As the stock of legal knowledge relating to the

statute is built up, uncertainty will fall, and with it the amount of

litigation and hence the production of additional precedents. But uncer-

tainty will not be eliminated; as changing social or economic conditions

generate new kinds of disputes over the application of the statute

the stock of prior legal knowledge will depreciate, inducing litigation

that will produce fresh precedents.

    This analysis suggests how it has been possible for the Anglo-American

legal system to rely, for almost a thousand years, on the uncompensated

efforts of litigants to create most of the legal rules administered by the

legal system. There are, to be sure, alternative methods of inducing the

production of precedents. One is government subsidy--and since the end
                                                                        34




of the fee system of defraying judicial expenses, litigation has been (modestly)

subsidized by having the expense of judicial personnel, court facilities,

etc. defrayed by the taxpayer rather than by the litigants. Another

possibility would be to give the litigants property rights in the precedents

generated in any lawsuit to which they were parties. Just as a composer

receives a royalty every time a song he has written is played on a radio

station, so-—in principle anyway-—a litigant could be given a royalty every

time that a case he had brought (or defended35) was cited in the brief or

oral argument of a subsequent case.

     Before appraising these alternatives, we must consider the incentives

of the judges, the other critical input into the production of legal

precedents, to participate in that production. The independence of the

judiciary (especially of the federal judiciary, the focus of our attention

in this paper) from the political branches of the government36 makes it

extremely difficult to model judicial behavior in economic terms; the

outcome of a case seems unrelated to the judge's welfare. One approach

is to posit that the independent judge derives welfare by imposing his

policy preferences on the community. This approach,which is broadly

consistent with the ordinary assumptions of self-interested behavior

employed in economic analysis, is helpful in explaining why a judge might

want to create precedents rather than just resolve disputes: to the

extent it is followed in subsequent decisions,the precedent will affect more

behavior. Indeed, dispute resolution as such affects no behavior; it

merely redistributes the losses created by some past incident, and those

are sunk costs.

     Less obviously perhaps, this approach may also explain why judges
                                                                        35



follow precedents. It is the practice of deciding in accordance with

precedent that makes decisions operate as precedents. No matter how wilful

a judge is, he is likely to follow precedent .to some extent, for if he did

not the practice of decision according to precedent ("stare decisis," the

lawyers call it) would be undermined and the precedential significance of his own

decisions thereby reduced. To be sure, there is a potentially serious free-rider

problem. The judge who disregards all precedents but his own may gain more

utility in increased freedom to impose his personal preferences on the

community than he loses by contributing to a general erosion of the principle

of adherence to precedent. But the free-rider problem is held in check by

the structure of appellate review. Usually there is one court, with relatively

few members, who are supreme within any given jurisdiction. Their power

to reverse the decisions of lower courts checks any tendencies on the part

of lower-court judges to disregard precedent, and their own position in

the judicial hierarchy checks their own tendencies in that direction. If

the U.S. Supreme Court refuses to accord precedential weight to earlier

Supreme Court decisions, it thereby undermines the precedential weight

of its own decisions. To be sure, the trade-off is a complicated one,

and we would not expect--nor do we find--that the balance is always in

favor of adherence to precedent. Our argument, however, is not that

precedent is always adhered to, but that decision according to

precedent will often represent rational self-interested behavior to judges

who personally disagree with the precedent in question.

     If there is a judicial demand for legal advocacy that will assist

courts in adhering to old and formulating new precedents, the litigants will

supply such assistance even though their only interest is in resolving a
                                                                      36




dispute. However, although this point might seem to imply that the provision

of subsidy or ASCAP-type royalties may not be necessary to prevent under-

production of precedents, it ignores the availability of substitute modes

of dispute resolution-—such as private arbitration—-that do not involve

the production of precedents and hence are less costly to the disputants.

To avoid inefficient substitution away from the courts, a public subsidy

of ourt litigation may be justified after all. (An alternative would be to tax

private arbitration.) And since the identification of a case that will be

an important precedent may be difficult or impossible to make in advance, a general

subsidy of litigation may be more efficient than an attempt to subsidize

just those litigants who in fact contribute to the production of precedents.

      The question whether judges indeed follow the principle of stare decisis or

decision according to precedent can be approached empirically by asking what a re-

fusal to decide cases according to precedent would imply with regard to the citation

practices of judges. (A preliminary question might be, if judges do not follow precedent

why do they cite cases at all? The answer might be, to fool people into thinking they

were following precedent. But we distrust explanations that assume persistent

gullibility on the part of the community.) Such a practice would imply

that the observed depreciation rate of precedents was zero: the judge who

is indifferent to the precedential significance of the cases will tend to

pick cases to cite from past years roughly in proportion to the amount of

gross investment, implying (as we show in the next section) zero depreciation.37

     A more plausible rival to the hypothesis that judges

 decide in accordance with precedent, giving due weight to depreciation, is

 that judges, in some courts and some periods, disregard the

 precedents established by their predecessors; they try to change the law to
                                                                       37




make it conform to their own views of public policy. This practice, some-

times called "judicial activism" and frequently associated with the "Warren

Court" of the l960s, does not imply an indifference to precedent as such, and

hence does not imply a zero depreciation rate. Rather, it implies a desire

on the part of the judges to replace the precedents of an earlier period

with new, contrary precedents. Precisely what the citation practice of an

activist court would be is unclear. The court might cite few cases; or it

might reach back into the distant past for prececents, in which event the

observed depreciation rate of the precedents cited by it might'be low.

Presumably, as the activist court produced more and more of its own

precedents (i.e., by deciding cases), the measured depreciation rate of

precedents cited by it would rise, for it would tend to cite its own

precedents, which would be recent, and not to cite (many) precedents of

earlier judges. What seems unambiguous, however, is the impact of judicial

activism on the depreciation rate indeed of precedents in the decisions of a

lower court. If the Warren Court was indeed an unusually activist one, then the

depreciation rates of Supreme Court precedents should be lower in our sample of

1960 court of appeals cases (prior to the heyday of the Warren

Court) than in our 1974-1975 court of appeals sample. The courts of

appeals are bound by the precedents created by the Supreme Court and if the

Warren Court destroyed much existing legal capital, replacing it with its

own (necessarily recent) precedents, this would show up in an increase in the

depreciation rate of Supreme Court precedents in the courts of appeals.
                                                                         38


                                      IV. Empirical   Analysis


                                  A. Specification of the Model


     There are two basic techniques for using the age distribution of

citations to estimate rates of depreciation or obsolesence of legal capital.

The first makes exclusive use of the mean of the age distribution.     In its

crudest form, the rate of depreciation is inferred solely from the reciprocal

of the averag age of citations; thus, the older the average age, the lower

the depreciation rate. This procedure has a counterpart in the citation

analyses of sociologists of science, where the age of citations to scholarly

works is used to develop measures of the relative "hardness of different

scientific disciplines, the rate at which scientific knowledge diffuses,

its rate of obsolesence, and other phenomena., The second technique we employ,

a far more efficient one (as we show below), makes use of the entire

frequency distribution of citations to earlier decisions, not just the mean.

Using regression analysis, we are able to estimate depreciation rates and

extend the empirical analysis to the determination of the forces affecting

investment, depreciation, and capital, and the interrelationship among these

variables.

     1. Average Age of Citations. The reader will recall our earlier derivation

of the stock of legal capital in equation (3). By utilizing the assumption of a

constant nonnegative rate of growth of legal capital, equal to 0, which

implies an identical constant rate of growth of gross investment,38 we can

transform equation (3) into


             Lt -   I
                        t-l   L()
                              r
                                                                         8


                                                                                  D
                                                                         39



where y = 01(1+0) and the number of periods is sufficiently large so that

                 0.       The proportion of precedents in this stock that are

exactly one year old (It_i/Lt) equals (ól-y-5y); the proportion of two-year-

old precedents (1t2/Lt) equals (&f-'-6y)(l-S)(l-y); and, more generally, the

proportion of precedents that are A year old is given by


          f(A) =      (&4'—&y')[(l)(l—y)]i                                (9)



     Now assume that we have a random sample of type i cases to be decided

in period t and the stock of precedents relevant to these cases is given

by equation (8). Since each proportion f(A) can be interpreted as the

probability of selecting a precedent that is A years old, the mathematical

expectation or mean age of A is given by


                           =
          E(A.) =
             3
                      j 33
                      Zf(A.)A.
                                         jJ                              (10)


which simplifies to


          E(A) =                 ,                                       (11)

assuming again that t is sufficiently large.

     This result can be made clearer by an example. If today's capital stock

contained some precedents that were one year old, some two years old, etc.,

and these precedents had been produced over time at a constant (nonnegative)

growth rate of 0 and had in turn depreciated at a constant rate of 6, then

the mean age of precedents (citations) would be given by equation (11).

Therefore, if one were able to estimate the growth rate and the average

age, equation (11) could be used to calculate the depreciation rate. For

example, a 10-year mean age and a growth rate of five per cent per year would
                                                                          40



yield in the limit a 5.5 per cent depreciation rate. Finally, if either

 the depreciation rate or the growth rate were zero, equation (11) would

simplify to l/y or 1/iS respectively.

     There are two drawbacks to this procedure for estimating depreciation

rates. First, the assumption of a constant growth rate of investment--a

convenient mathematical simplification--depends on the assumption that the

legal system is on a long-run equilibrium growth path. For certain sub-

stantive areas of the law, the evidence strongly contradicts this assumption.

Civil rights is the most obvious example. We have estimated that the

production of precedents in the U.S. courts of appeals in the civil-rights

area has been growing at an annual rate of 15.6 per cent since 1953 (the

first year that civil rights cases were separately classified by

the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts). This is more than three

times the average rate of precedent production in the courts of appeals.39

Similarly, the civil-rights growth rate has been 7.3 per cent in the U.S.

Supreme Court since 1948, compared to an overall (i.e., all our subject-

matter classes taken together) growth rate of 1.2 per cent.

Changing social and economic conditions and their interaction with legisla-

tion over the last 25 years have induced a rapid increase in the demand

for civil-rights precedents, but it would be highly questionable to assume

that this is the long-run equilibrium growth in the demand for civil-

rights precedents. Probably the growth in civil'rights

precedents prior to the 1950's was closer to the overall

growth rate of precedents in the courts of appeals and Supreme Court.4°

    A second drawback of this procedure is the absence of a measure of

the standard error of the calculated depreciation rates. Although one can

                                                                                j
                                                                                41




test the significance of differences in average ages of citations across

subject-matter classes and between the Supreme Court and the courts of

appeals, there is no readily available technique for testing the significance

of differences in the depreciation rates themselves.

     2. The Age Distribution of Citations. Let              denote the number of

precedents produced t years ago (t =   0,   1, 2, . .   .   , 1)   that have survived

to the current period 0, and C the number of citations in

period 0 to judicial decisions t years ago. Assume that citations and

precedents are related as follows:


          P = kC   exp(ut)                                                      (12)


where k is a proportionality factor between citations and precedents4' and

u. is a random error term (for example, due to sampling errors in data

collection). The proportionality condition--the key assumption that

allows one to use citations to study precedents--states that if, for example, we

observe twice as many citations to decisions of X than 2X years ago, then twice

as many precedents have survived into the present from the former than from

the latter period. This example is also helpful in illustrating the

implicit weighting scheme built into our empirical analysis. In recording

the number of citations, our case readers made no distinction between

two citations to a single case from t years ago and the citation of two

such cases; in both instances the number of citations to t-years-old

decisions would be two.42 Thus, it is possible (though unlikely) that one

would observe twice as many citations to decisions of X than to those of

2X years ago, yet the number of decisions actually cited in the two

periods would b identical. Even so, one would not want to assign equal
                                                                        42




precedential significance to the surviving precedents from the two different

time periods,and our method of counting citations weights decisions

more heavily the more often they are cited. In our hypothetical

example twice as many equivalent decisions (i.e., decisions of equivalent

precedential significance) would have survived from X than from 2X years old

decisions even though an equal number of cases from both periods were still being

cited.43 More generally, estimates of depreciation in our study are based on decisions

                                                         is assumed to be
of equal precedential significance where significance

proportional to citations.

      Let I equal the annual investment in precedent production that

occurred t years ago, and assume that


                =                                                           (13)
                    mI., exp(vt)


where I equals our estimate of I based on a count of written opinions

t years ago, m is a proportionality factor applicable to investment, and

     is   a random error term. The number of precedents that have survived from
Vt
t years ago to period 0 equals investment in that earlier period discounted

by the depreciation rate,44 as in


                =
                    I   exp(-ôt) .                                          (14)


 By making the appropriate substitutions, taking logs, and rearranging terms,

 our estimating equation becomes


              ln (C/I)
                           =   ct + t +   c                                 (15)


                                                equals -6, and    is a disturbance
 where      is a constant (equal to ln(m/k)),

 term assumed to be subject to first-order serial correlation (i.e.,
                                                                           43



   =
             +e   where p equals the serial correlation coefficient). Since

we have data on both the age distribution of citations and the annual number

of written opinions, a simple regression (with an adjustment for serial

correlation) of the log of the citation-investment ratio on time will yield

an estimate of the depreciation rate.45

       The regression method of estimating depreciation has several important advan-

tages compared to that of the mean age. First, it enables a measure of the

statistical significance of S; this facilitates the testing of hypotheses. Second,

there is no need to assume a steady—state equilibrium in which the capital stock

and investment are growing at a constant rate. Third, equation (15) is

the foundation of a more complete        estimation system for the determinants

of depreciation and investment. A possible specification of this system

in addition to equation (15) would include


              =     +        + Ct                                         (16)

           It =     + 2'5t   +
                                 3't +                                    (17)

where X. is a vector of variables determining the depreciation rate in

period t (possibly, turnover in judicial personnel and new legislation);

Vt is a vector of variables affecting the level of gross investment

(possibly, changes in population, national income, legislation and the

stock of legal capital); and        is an average of depreciation rates prior to

t (since depreciation is expected to influence investment). We mention

this more complete equation system, which is not estimated here but will
                                                                     44




be utilized in subsequent work on a more comprehensive sample, because

it shows clearly the interesting extensions that are possible when one

integrates citation data into a regression framework.


               B. Depreciation-Rate and Capital-Stock Estimates


     1. The Problem of Measuring Investment. Before presenting our estimates

of depreciation and of the capital stock of precedents we discuss briefly

how we measured investment. It might appear straightforward to measure

the annual investment in the production of precedents--all one needs to know

is the number of cases decided each year in the relevant court and subject-

matter category. In fact, there are serious estimation problems.46

The first is the problem of what to count as a precedent-—all

terminations, only contested terminations, all terminations in which an

opinion is written, or only signed majority opinions (as distinct from per

curiam and memorandum opinions)? Since only a decision in which an opinion

is issued is likely to be cited in a subsequent decision, it is clearly

appropriate to limit the pool of precedents to such decisions. Unfortunately,

data on the number of written opinions are not published for the courts of

appeals, but must be tabulated by counting the opinions contained in the

more than 800 volumes of the Federal Reporter.

     Second, the available statistical data on subject matter are inadequate,

and increasingly so the further back in time one goes. Subject-matter

data are available for the Supreme Court back to 1930 but for the courts of
                                                                          45



 appeals only since 1947 and only for cases commenced and

 not for cases terminated or for written opinions. If we assume that the

 distribution by subject matter of cases commenced in the courts of appeals

 is proportional to that of written opinions in those courts, then the

 distribution of written opinions by subject-matter can be computed by

 multiplying the relevant proportion by our estimate of the total number

 of written opinions. But to obtain estimates of investment by subject

 matter in both the courts of appeals and the Supreme Court for years in which

 such data are not available, a more arbitrary assumption must be made:

 that the distribution of opinions by subject matter in those years is equal

 to that of the earliest years for which such data are available. However,

 this assumption is not likely to create serious errors in our regressions

 estimates of depreciation even though those estimates are generally

 based on a 100-year period: since our citation data have been aggregated

 for the early years, the number of observations for years prior to 1948 or

 1930 is far fewer than the number of years between 1847 and 1930 or

 1948.

      A further problem with our estimation procedure is the difficulty of

 matching citation and investment data by subject-matter classes. For

 example, our estimate of annual investment in civil-rights precedents is

 restricted to opinions in civil-rights cases, yet some citations in a

 sample civil-rights case may not be to prior civil—rights decisions

but to decisions in other fields of law.   Although

 this error is likely to understate actual investment within a subject-matter
                                                                            46



area, we have no reason to believe that it is systematically related to

time. Hence the error would enter the residual term in equation (15),

reducing the estimated R2. The error is also likely to be relatively

more important (and the R2 lower), the more narrowly the subject-matter

class is defined. This is generally consistent with our findings in the

empirical analysis.

     2. Depreciation-Rate Estimates. Tables 4 and 5 present regression

estimates derived from equation (15) of the depreciation rates by subject-

matter classes of the precedents cited in our 1974-1975 courts of appeals

(Table 4) and Supreme Court (Table 5) samples.       Both ordinary—least-

squares (OLS) and Cochrane—Orcutt generalized-least-squares (GLS) estimates

are presented-—the GLS method to deal with the assumed first-order serial

correlation of the disturbance term. The estimated depreciation rates are

nearly always positive, generally within a range of two to seven per cent per year,    ID

and most are statistically significant.49 Several of our estimates, however,

are based on a small number of cases, and though statistically significant
                               50
are nevertheless unreliable.

                           [Insert Tables 4 and 5]

      In our earlier discussion of the production function of precedents, we

 hypothesized that a court that gave no weight whatever to precedential

 significance in deciding a case and writing the opinion would act as if its

 choice of citations depended solely on the relative number of past opinions, and

 the citations by such a court would tend, therefore, to have a zero depreciation

 rate. Tables 4 and 5 enable us to reject this hypothesis and the theory of judicial

 decision-making that underlies it. We also suggested, however, as part of

the rudimentary theory of judicial decision-making sketched in that discus-

sion, that judges not constrained by the threat of reversal of their deci-

sions by a higher court would tend to depart more frequently from deciding

according to precedent than courts that were so constrained, and that this

would show up in a lower depreciation rate of their citations (because they

would be giving less weight to the recency of the precedents cited). Some

evidence for this hypothesis is provided by a comparison between the

depreciation rates in Tables 4 and 5. The depreciation rates of cases cited

by the Supreme Court are almost uniformly lower than those of cases cited by

the courts of appeals. Of the tenpossible comparisons from the GLS regressions

(holding court and subject matter constant), nine depreciation rates are lower

in the Supreme Court sample (Table 5) than the courts ofappeals sample (Table

4). This suggests that the Supreme Court pays less attention to recency

(authority) in its citations than the courts of appeals--as we would expect

since Supreme Court decisions cannot be reversed by a higher court.

     3. Capital-Stock Estimates. Table 6 presents estimates of the stock of

legal capital for precedents produced in the Supreme Court and in the courts

of appeals (see equation (3)). Two estimates are given for each court. One is the

capital stock of precedents produced in the period 1949 to 1973; the

other is the stock produced in the longer period from 1874 (1894 for the

courts of appeals) to 1973.   The second estimate is the more comprehensive

but is subject to substantially greater error because of the difficulty,

noted earlier, of classifying very old cases by subject

matter.

somewhat unclear. Since cases differ in their precedential significance,

a pure count of cases or even one adjusted for depreciation does not reveal

whether the capital stock of precedents is really larger in one subject-

matter area than in another, or larger in the Supreme Court than in the

courts of appeals. A more illuminating statistic, also shown in Table 6,

is the ratio of the capital stock to accumulated investment (unadjusted

for   depreciation). This ratio tells us the proportion of precedents
produced over a given period that have survived to 1974. For example,
the ratio .63 for court of appeals common law precedents indicates that

63 per cent of these precedents produced in the period 1949-1973 have

survived into 1974. This ratio can be meaningfully compared both across

subject-matter classes and between courts. (For example, 67 per cent of

comon law precedents produced in the Supreme Court have survived into

1974 compared to 63 per cent for the courts of appeals.) Usually (but not

always) a high depreciation rate will be associated with a low rate of

survival of precedents.51 To take an extreme example, a 33 per cent deprecia-

tion rate of civil rights precedents produced in the courts of appeals

yields   a 28 per cent survival   rate of precedents produced between 1949

and 1973. As one might expect from the generally lower depreciation

rates in the Supreme Court, the precedents produced in that court between

1949 and 1973 usually have a higher survival rate than those produced in

the courts of appeals.52 The differences in survival rates, however, are

generally of relatively smaller magnitude than the differences in deprecia-

tion rates because of the more rapid growth in investment in recent

years in the courts of appeals than in the Supreme Court.

                        C.   Tests of Other Hypotheses


     In this section, we present results of empirical tests of the remaining

hypotheses developed earlier. These hypotheses concern (1) generality

versus specificity of precedents, (2) effect of statutory activity, (3)

procedural versus substantive precedents, (4) effects of uncertainty, and

(5) Warren Court activism.

     1.   General Versus Specific Legal Capital. We hypothesized that
Supreme Court precedents were more general than those of other courts
(particularly the federal courts of appeals), and hence would depreciate

more slowly. The results for the 1974-1975 courts of appeals sample in

Table 4 are consistent with this hypothesis. The depreciation

rate of Supreme Court citations is lower than that of other courts in 13 of

the 16 possible comparisons using the GLS method. The major

exception is federal taxation. The two other

exceptions are the patent and bankruptcy classes, where we estimate negative

depreciation rates from the GLS regressions (though a 95 per cent confidence

interval includes positive depreciation rates for both classes) and

positive rates from the OLS regressions. Incidentally, these are the only

two negative depreciation estimates in our entire set of regressions.

     The results from our sample of Supreme Court decisions are similar,

 but less marked--indeed, for all classes together, the Supreme Court and

 other-court depreciation rates are the same, using the GLS method. The

 explanation for the difference in this regard between the Supreme Court

 and court of appeals samples may be that, in general, decisions of other

 courts do not have substantial precedential significance in the Supreme
                                                                        54




Court and the Court may therefore be less concerned with their recency,

which is an important attribute of a citation viewed as a

precedent. This is consistent with our earlier attempt to explain the lower

depreciation rates generally in the Supreme Court sample.

     The hypothesis that Supreme Court precedents tend to be more general

compared to other-court precedents can be tested indirectly by examining

the number of citations per case to Supreme Court and other-court decisions.

If Supreme Court precedents are indeed more general (implying that they

cover more issues), then in a aiven opinion there should be fewer citations

to Supreme Court than other-court decisions. The results for the court

of appeals sample presented in Table 7 are consistent with this hypothesis;

the average number of Supreme Court citations is about half that of other-

court citations in the broad subject-matter classes. Of further interest

is the dramatic reversal of these ratios in the Supreme Court sample, which

supports our earlier point that decisions of other courts may have little

precedential significance in the Supreme Court. There is an interesting

difference between the common law area and the other subject-matter areas

in the Supreme Court sample: in the common law area the ratio of Supreme

Court to other-court citations is 1.04 compared to a ratio of about two

in the other subject-matter areas. The explanation may lie in the

Erie decision, which gives other-court (especially state-court) decisions

special precedential significance in federal litigation in the common
            53
law area.

     2. Statutory Activity. We hypothesized that the depreciation rates

of legal precedents would be higher in areas of greater statutory change.

Tables 4 and 5 provide modest support for this hypothesis. As expected, we find

a lower-than-average depreciation rate in the cornon law area, one of

limited statutory change, and a higher-than-average depreciation rate in the

economic-regulation and civil-rights fields, both areas of substantial

statutory activity. However, there are a number of anomalies, such as the

very low depreciation rate of Supreme Court civil-rights precedents in the

court of appeals sample (in contrast to a more than 30 per cent annual

depreciation rate of other-court precedents), and the much higher depreciation

rates of other-court precedents in antitrust (an area of relatively little

statutory change over time) compared to tax (an area of great statutory

change over time). The antitrust estimates, however, are probably not

reliable because they are based on a small sample of cases. Thus, it is not

surprising that the difference between antitrust and tax depreciation rates is

reversed for Supreme Court precedents.

     There are two very serious problems in measuring the effect of statutory

activity on the rate at which precedents obsolesce. The first is the

difficulty of measurino statutory activity; simply counting the number of. statutory
enactments and amendments in an area is no measure of the relevant variable.

The second problem is that measuring the effect of statutory activity

on the depreciation rate requires that other facts be held constant, notably the

depreciation caused by changes in judicial doctrine—-an important

factor in the antitrust area. Much more work must be done before the

statutory-activity hypothesis can be considered either rejected

or confirmed.

     3. Procedural Versus Substantive Precedents. The theory suggests
                                                                        57



that the procedural precedents cited in cases within a particular

subject-matter class should depreciate more slowly than the substantive

precedents so cited. This is because the procedural precedent is more

general or versatile--it could be used in another subject-matter area

(e.g., a case deciding a point of pleading in an admiralty case could

be used to decide a similarpoint arising in a tax case). A major problem

in testing this hypothesis is our complete lack of data on invest—

ment in producing procedural precedents. We can, however, test a weaker

version of this hypothesis by comparing average ages. One should observe

less variation in average ages across subject-matter classes for

procedural than substantive citations because the former (at least in part)

come from a comon pool of precedents. The results of this comparison

are presented in Table 8.

                                 [Insert Table 8]

     Table 8 provides little support for the hypothesis. There is no

significant difference between the standard deviations of substantive and

procedural mean ages across subject-matter classes.54 Moreover, a regression

analysis indicates that the age of substantive citations is a highly

significant predictor of the age of procedural citations across subject-

matter classes,55 whereas the "common pool" hypothesis would suggest that ages of

substantive citations would not be a significant predictor of ages of procedural

citations. There are reasons for doubting these tests, rather than the hypothesis.

First, our case readers reported difficulty in classifying cases as

procedural versus substantive--a difficulty any lawyer will understand.

Second, our impression is that most of the procedural precedents used

in a particular substantive subject-matter area are precedents involving

1. Mean ages are based on weighted method (see pp. _____    supra).
2.  In each subject-matter class there are two numbers per column:     the top
one is the mean age and the bottom one is the number of citations.
                                                                        59




that area--that most procedural precedents are in practice, though not in

principle, pretty much limited in use to the substantive area in which they

arose. This is partly an aspect of the first point (many apparently pro-

cedural questions are in fact influenced by the substantive context) and

partly, perhaps, an aspect of lawyers' research habits (they are more apt

to be familiar with the procedural decisions rendered in cases arising in

the substantive areas in which they are expert). No doubt there is a class

of "pure" procedural cases that are of great generality or versatility, but

they may be too few to influence our statistical results measurably. That

of course, is our rationale for combining substantive and procedural

decisions in presenting the depreciation rates reported in Tables 4 and 5.

     4. Depreciation and Investment. We hypothesized that the higher the

depreciation rate of precedents, the more difficult it would be to forecast

the outcomes of legal disputes, and the greater the rate of investment in

precedent production. One method of testing this hypothesis is to examine

the effect of differences in depreciation rates on the rate of investment

across subject-matter classes. Our estimating equation is of the form


                     =   +     + u1
            ln I/L                                                      (18)


where I is the average annual investment in 1972 and 1973 in the ith

subject-matter class, L is the capital stock at the end of 1971 in

each class,56 51 is the estimated depreciation rate from the GLS regressions

on the 1974-1975 court of appeals sample in Table 4,57 andu' is the

disturbance term. Since there are ten subject-matter classes in the courts

of appeals and 11 in the Supreme Court (the "constitutional' class forming

an additional class) there is a maximum of 21 observations in the regression

analysis.
                                                                          60



     The results presented in Table 9 are consistent with the hypothesis

that an increase in depreciation leads to a positive adjustment in the

rate of precedent production. The regression coefficients on the

depreciation rates, which are positive and highly significant, indicate that

a ten per cent increase in depreciation is associated with approximately

a seven per cent increase in the rate of precedent production.58 The
                                                                         elasticity
estimate for the Supreme Court is unaffected by an expansion

of the number of periods used to measure the capital stock (compare the

first and third equations), and there is no significant difference between

the Supreme Court and courts of appeals in either the responsiveness of

investment to a change in depreciation (i.e., the difference between the

regression coefficients ° CA and 6SC in the first equation is not signifi-

cant) or the investment-capital ratio itself (i.e., the coefficient on the

dummy court variable is not significant).

                              [Insert Table 9]

     There are, however, several potential problems with the analysis.

First, there could be spurious positive correlation between It/Lt and

5. Since the depreciation rate is used to compute the capital stock, an

increase in depreciation would lower the capital stock, giving rise to a

positive regression coefficient in equation (18). As it turns out,

spurious correlation is not a serious problem since the correlation between

the depreciation rate and the capital stock for the 21 subject-matter

classes is positive (.06) and not significant.59 Other possible difficulties

arise from the limited number of observations in the regression analysis

identifying variables that are specific to subject-matter classes).60 Thus,

our results should be viewed as preliminary evidence in support of the

hypothesis that greater uncertainty about the outcome of legal disputes

generates an increase in the rate of litigation and the production of precedents.

     5. Judicial Activism and the Warren Court. Table 10 presents OLS

and GLS depreciation rate estimates for the 1960 court of appeals sample.61

To facilitate comparison with the 1974-1975 court of appeals sample, we

have reproduced the relevant depreciation rates from that sample in columns

(3) and (4) of Table 10. Although the sampling rates in the two court of

appeals samples were both 10 per cent, the 1960 sample is considerably smaller

(223 decisions compared to 653 in the 1974-1975 sample) because of the growth

in annual precedent production between 1960 and 1975, and the fact that the

1974-1975 sample is based on approximately 1.5 years of opinions. As a

result,fewer subject—matter areas are included in Table 10 because in many

areas the 1960 samplelacked a sufficient number of cases to permit

reliable estimates of depreciation.    Another difference between the two

samples is the virtual absence in 1960 of civil rights and constitutional

(both criminal and noncriminal) decisions and the corresponding (relative)

reduction in the number of common law and economic regulation cases

between 1960 and 1974-1975.

     Before assessing the "judicial activism" hypothesis, two further points about the

1960 sample are worth mentioning. The first is that in each of the subject-matter

classes in the 1960 sample Supreme Court precedents depreciate at a lower rate

than other-court precedents. This finding is consistent with our detailed

analysis of the 1974-1975 sample and our basic hypothesis that general rules

will depreciate at a slower rate than more specific ones. The second point

is the increase from 1960 to 1975 in the proportion of sample cases

that cite Supreme Court decisions (see Table 11). For example, in the

"all" class there is a statistically significant increase in the proportion

of opinions citing Supreme Court (.610 in 1960 compared to .748 in 1974-

1975) while the proportion citing other courts remained approximately

unchanged (.933 in 1960 and .956 in 1974—1975). The three broad subject-

matter classes--common law, economic regulation, and criminal-—reveal a

similar increase over time in the proportion of decisions citing the

Supreme Court.62 These figures are superficially surprising. Assuming

that the relative availability of Supreme Court to other-court precedents,

which is determined in part by the relative number of decisions in these

courts, influences citation behavior, then with the more rapid growth of

precedent production in other courts relative to the Supreme Court since

1960 one might expect to observe a decline over time in the proportion

of cases citing Supreme Court relative to those citing other-court

precedents. The fact that the opposite effect is observed may reflect

a growing authority or generality of Supreme Court precedents since 1960,

which would increase the likelihood of their being cited.63 This inter-

pretation is consistent with our earlier point that the more limited

capacity of the Supreme Court compared to the courts of appeals should

lead the Supreme Court to become relatively more selective over time in

its choice of cases to decide and thus to be choosing cases of greater

generality today.

     One test of judicial activism is a comparison of the depreciation rates

of precedents before and after the period of supposed activism. Since

judicial activism in the 1960s would imply an acceleration in the rate of

replacement of the precedents created prior to the 1960s, we should observe

a higher depreciation rate in the 1974—1975 court of appeals sample than in

the 1960 sample if the Warren Court was indeed an unusually activist one.

But the results in Table 10 provide only weak support for this hypothesis.

There appears to be a slight tendency for depreciation rates of Supreme Court

precedents to be higher in 1974—1975 than in 1960 (except in the tax area) but

the differences are not significant. With respect to other-court precedents,

the differences between the 1974-1975 and 1960 depreciation rates are more

mixed and even smaller.

     These results must be viewed as inconclusive. Our subject-matter classes

may be too gross to detect changes in depreciation due to the Warren Court

(e.g., we were not able to make comparisons within the civil-rights area).

Moreover, by 1974-1975 the reaction to the Warren Court associated with the

emergence of a distinctive "Burger Court" may already have resulted in the resurrection

of a number of precedents ignored by the Warren Court. In future work we

hope to deal with these problems by expanding the number of cases in our

samples and by including years between 1960 and 1974-1975.



              V. Conclusion and Suggestions for Future Research



    The concept of precedent is at the heart of the way in which lawyers

think about the legal system. And the results of the present study suggest

that an approach which treats legal precedents as a form of investment

subject to the usual economic laws governing the formation and depreciation
                                                                            67



 of capital may improve our understanding of precedent. But

 the present study is only preliminary.   Future studies

 will utilize much larger samples that will enable us both to utilize

 more information about each case and to study additional facets of legal

 capital. Eventually, we hope to compare the depreciation rates of judicial

 decisions with those of administrative—agency
                                                 decisions, statutes, and
 constitutional provisions, to compare different courts, to examine citation

 practices in appellate briefs, and to examine the depreciation question

 from the "case history" as well as the "citation practice" standpoint.64

      Of particular interest, we believe, would be a study of secular

changes in depreciation rates. There is a widely held belief in the

academic legal community that adherence to precedent has declined over

time, particularly j the U.S. Supreme Court, partly perhaps as a result (or

cause?) of the "legal realist" movement. The trend in depreciation rates

may cast light on this question, as may a comparison of trends in different

courts.

     There are many other interesting areas of research on legal precedent,

a few of which we shall mention briefly in
                                             closing:

     1. The services produced by precedents,
                                                primarily in creating specific
rules of legal obligation and thereby reducing the demand for litigation

across subject-matter categories and over time, may, as suggested

earlier, be important in explaining changes over time (or across states

or federal judicial districts) in the volume of litigation.65

     2. The measurement of precedential
                                          significance by counting citations
may prove to hold the key to the problem of
                                              evaluating judicial output.
For obvious reasons, the number of terminations, trials, or even judicial
                                                                       68




opinions does not measure the output of a judicial system in a socially          -D
interesting   sense; the number of precedents--weighted by the significance

of each precedent as measured by the number of times it is cited in

subsequent decisions--may. A precedent-based measure of judicial output

could be compared with the input measures used by the Administrative Office

of the U.S. Courts in its "weighted caseload" studies, which measure the

amount of judicial time allocable to various substantive and procedural

classifications of judicial activity.66 Precedential significance as

a measure of judicial output might also be used to compare the importance

of different courts as sources of law, and even to evaluate individual

judges.

     3. The number of law clerks has risen sharply in relation to the

number of judges in recent years, but we know of no systematic efforts to

appraise the significance of this development. One hypothesis about law

clerks which could be tested using citation data would be that since law

clerks (especially in the federal courts of appeals and Supreme Court) tend

to be drawn from a relatively small number of "elite" law schools,which

employ highly uniform teaching methods and materials, judicial citation

practices would tend to become more uniform, with respect to age and number

of precedents, over time as law clerks played an increasingly large role

in judicial research and opinion writings and, further, that judicial citation

practices would tend to be more uniform in the federal than in the state

                                                              -
court system.

     4.   A comparison of citation practices in appellate briefs and judicial

decisions may illuminate some of the fundamental characteristics of legal

advocacy. Are there systematic differences between lawyer and judge citation
                                                                      69



practices? Are there systematic differences between the citation

practices of the winning and losing lawyer? The answers to these questions

may suggest the contours of an economic theory of legal advocacy.

     5. The analysis of precedent may prove helpful in explaining observed

characteristics of the legal profession. Current research by Peter

Pashigian indicates that lawyers' earnings increase with age relative to

those of other professionals. The explanation for this phenomenon may lie

in the relatively low depreciation rates of legal precedent (see Tables

4-5). They imply that an important component of lawyers' capital--their

knowledge of the substantive rules of law--obsolesces slowly, more

slowly, we assume, than the essential knowledge of physicians, engineers,

and other professionals. Therefore, when the lawyer reaches the point in

his life cycle where additional investments in human capital would not be

economical, due to the shortness of the period in which they would yield

income, nonetheless his income may persist at a high level since his existing

stock of capital will decline slowly. It would be consistent with this

analysis to find that older judges cite on average older cases-—but that

study, too, we leave to the future.

2. However, legal precedent is discussed as a form of social capital having

     public—good characteristics in James M. Buchanan, The Limits of Liberty

     (1974), especially in ch. 6, and some aspects of the economic theory of

     precedent are also discussed in Isaac Ehrlich & Richard A. Posner,

     An Economic Analysis of Legal Rulemaking, 3 J. Leg. Studies 257

     (1974), and in Richard A. Posner, An Economic Approach to Legal

     Procedure and Judicial Administration, 2 J. Leg. Studies 399, 448-51

     (1973). Professors Lawrence Friedman of Stanford Law School and

     Stanton Wheeler of Yale Law School, and their associates, are in the

     process of collecting a large sample of state appellate opinions which

     they plan to use for an empirical study of precedents, though not

     within an economic framework.



3. The research assistants who counted the citations in the opinions in

     our samples were instructedto exclude citations to lower-court

     decisions in the same case, abut see" and other citations indicating

     rejection of the cited case as a precedent, and multiple citations

     to the same case if cited on the same point.
                                                                       3

5. Thus, the legal purist will be distressed at our placing admiralty

    cases in a category called "common law"; our purpose in doing so was

    to group together cases in which statutes have played a relatively

    small role as a source of legal rules. More refined classifications

    are used in our current research, not reported in this paper, which is

    based on a sample of about 7,000 federal court of appeals decisions.



6. A comparison of terminations involving a written judicial opinion (our

    samples) to commencements is at best a crude one. Unfortunately,

    the subject-matter breakdown for terminations, and subsets of termi-

    nations such as terminations with a judicial opinion, are not

    reported by or available from the Administrative Office. Observe that

    the frequencies in our subject-matter classes tend to exceed the

    frequencies in the Administrative Office data because of the larger

    proportion of unclassifiable cases in the Administrative Office

    data compared to our samples (e.g., 23.1 per cent compared to 2.9

    per cent in 1974, and 14.9 per cent compared to .4 per cent in 1960).
                                                                         4



7.    In a separate (and not completed) study we have classified some 400

     Supreme Court decisions rendered in the Court's 1900, 1938, and 1958

     terms by subject matter, and then analyzed the survival rates of

     precedents by tracing the time path of the citations to each decision

     by the Supreme Court and by other courts.



8. Only citations appearing in majority opinions are included in Table

     2; citations appearing in concurring and dissenting opinions were

     also counted but are not utilized in the present study. A case cited

     more than once in an opinion was counted separately every time it

     was cited on a different issue; but, as previously noted, a case

     cited repeatedly for the same point was counted only once.



9. However, a deficiency in our procedure (which will be remedied in

     subsequent studies) is the failure to distinguish within the category

     of other-court (i.e., other than U.S. Supreme Court) citations be-

     tween citations to U.S. court of appeals decisions and to other

     decisions (decisions of federal district courts, state courts, the

     Court of Claims, English courts, etc.). Still, our category of

     "other court" citations is a serviceable, if crude, proxy for U.S.

     court of appeals citations, because most other-court citations are,

     in fact, to U.S. court of appeals decisions, Thus, in a random

     sample of 261 citations appearing in volumes of the Federal Reporter,

     Second, for 1974 and 1975 (the source and period from which our 1974-

     1975 U.S. court of appeals sample was drawn), 74.7 per cent of the

     citations (excluding citations to the Supreme Court) were to U.S. court

     of appeals decisions.
                                                                      5




          However, the mean age of the courts of appeals citations was only

     5.8 years, compared to 14.5 years for the citations to other courts'

     decisions and 8.0 for both groups together (weighted).   (This is somewhat

     lower than the mean age of other-court citations in our main 1974-1975

     sample; see Table 2.) One reason why the mean age of the U.S. courts of

     appeals citations is lower than that of the other non-U.S. Supreme Court

    citations appears to be that the courts of appeals are of comparatively

    recent creation (1891). The oldest citation to a court of appeals

    decision in our 261-citation sample discussed in the preceding

    paragraph is 50 years old, compared to 194 years for the oldest

    citation to another court's decision.   [f all citations in the

    sample of more than 50 years are reduced to 50 years, the mean age

    of the non-courtsof appeals citations in the sample falls from 14.5

    to 10.5 years.



10. We also computed the ages of citations in a subsample limited to

     cases that cite both U.S. Supreme Court and other-court decisions,

     on the theory that cases citing only Supreme Court decisions might

     differ systematically from those citing only other courts' decisions

     and thus might distort a comparison of the mean ages of the citations

     in the respective types of decision. However, a comparison of the

     results of the subsample with Table 2 indicated that this refine-

     ment in the sampling method did not produce any marked change in

     results, so we did not utilize this subsample in our empirical

     analysis.
                                                                                        6




11. We have not systematically tested the statistical significance

      of the differences in average age of citations across subject-

      matter classes, between citations to Supreme Court and other-court

      cases, etc. The standard errors are quite low, however, suggesting

       that most differences in means that we are interested in comparing

       are significant.

15.   Observe that this implies that the first 15 citations in a case will

      have an average age of 25.8 years, and the next 15 an

      average age of 34.5 years in order to bring the average up to 30.2.
                                                                       7




16. The F-tests were 8.89 with 14 and 476 degress of freedom for

     citations to the Supreme Court, and 14.98 with 14 and 613 degrees

     of freedom for citations to other courts. Both were significant

     at the .01 level.




17. To simplify exposition, we disregard the contributions to legal

     capital that are made by statutes, constitutional provisions, and

     administrative rulings and regulations.



18. This leaves open the question whether a 10 per cent depreciation

     rate, for example, implies that 10 per cent of last period's prece-

     dents "disappear" while 90 per cent survive in full, or whether the

     services yielded by each precedent decline on average by 10 per cent.

     This paper adopts the latter formulation because it encompasses

     both precedents that "disappear" (100 per cent decline) and those

     that decline partially in value.
                                                                           8



 19. There are exceptions—-a long-dormant precedent may

      acquire a new value because of a sudden upsurge in demand, as in

      the recent controversies over impeachment and executive privilege.

      The counterpart in the realm of physical capital is the abandoned

      machine restored to service because of a sudden increase in demand

      for its services.



20. Conceivably, an increase in the stock beyond some level might produce

      conflicting precedents, or so increase the difficulty of discriminating

      among nonconflicting ones as to reduce the amount of information about

      the expected outcome of legal disputes; either result would imply

      a negative value of the marginal product of legal capital. But we

      prefer to view these situations as reductions in the set of precedents

      (i.e., negative investment) and hence in the capital stock, and thus

      rule out negative marginal products. Observe that the explicit

      replacement of an old by a new precedent (e.g., when old decisions

      are overruled) is analytically distinguishable from aconflict between

      precedents, because the overruling can be viewed, sequentially, as

      the depreciation of the old precedent followed by investment in de-

      veloping a new one.



21.   The public-good aspect of legal capital is implicit in the formulation

      of equation (4). Since one person's use of precedents does not

      exclude another's use, Vt will rise as the number of users increases

      (i.e., V/aN > 0).     If congestion eventually occurs as the number of
                                                                          9




      users increases, then beyond some point 2VtIN < 0.        In the develop-

      ment of our model we take as given the number of users.




22. Although   legal capital yields information, its value ultimately
      depends on the underlying behavior it promotes. If "value" is
      synonymous with "efficiency," then the more effectively legal precedents

      promote behavior consistent with efficient resource allocation,

      the greater will be their value. Precedents in fact differ

      greatly in the degree to which they affect efficiency, and some may actually

      reduce efficiency and hence should be assigned a negative value if

      value and efficiency are to be equated. But in this paper we ignore

      ultimate questions of value and assume that precedents are

      valuable insofar as they promote compliance with whatever legal norms

      the precedents are intended to implement.



23.   Nonnegative gross investment results from the inability of the

      community to sell its legal capital. Although zero gross investment

      in a period is possible, we assume for mathematical convenience

      that the optimality conditions yield positive gross investment in

      every period.

       capital is developed by Michael Grossman in his Demand for Health

25.   This effect would be strengthened if legal capital and legislation

      were substitutable,in the sense that on balance the value of the

      marginal product of legal capital was reduced by legislation. If

      they were complementary, however, legislation,though increasing the

      depreciation rate (and raising the cost of investment),would have

      an offsetting effect by increasing the demand for capital.



26.   To demonstrate this, we assume a stationary capital stock (i.e., zero

      net investment). Since gross investment in period t equals SLt we

      have

             alnl           lnL
                    t_1+
                     —
                         lnS
                            t



      From equation (7) it follows that

             3lnI -
             alms —     +   C16   -    -   es
                            VLt
      where e =
                    _(1/V)(Vt/Lt)     (the elasticity of the demand curve) and
                                                                              11




    s =   ô/(r+S)      (the share of depreciation in user cost). It follows

    that investment is more likely to increase with an increase in 5

    the smaller are e and s. This result would have to be modified

    if the capital stock were growing.



27. Gross investment may be written


                It =    L.(+)
                                                                        -
    where the rate of growth of the capital stock is Lt =       (Lt÷i       Lt)
            (aL/at)/L. This approximation allows us to ignore the one-
    /Lt
    period lag between investment and additions to the capital stock. Thus


                ___ =      3lnLt   aln(L+6)
                            at         at



     and a1n(L ÷s)/at equals zero by assumption.

29. The capacity of the federal appellate courts has not, however, grown
                                            The result has been not only an
     at the same rate as. the demand.
                                                                      12




     increase in court queues but also a decrease in the proportion of

     cases decided that are likely to produce precedents. Thus, while all

     cases tendered to the courts of appeals are (eventually) decided--

     the jurisdiction of these courts, unlike that of the Supreme Court,

    not being discretionary--an increasing number are being decided

    without creating a precedent, i.e., without a written opinion. See

     pp. _____,   infra   (App. A).



30. As urged by many of the Court's critics. See, e.g., Henry M. Hart,

    Jr., The Supreme Court 1958 Term: Foreword: The Time Chart of the

    Justices, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 84, 96—100 (1959).



31. The model developed in subpart B made the simplifying assumption

    of constant marginal costs of investment (see Figure 1). Thus, any

    discrepancy between the desired and actual capital stock would be

    eliminated in a single period (or instantaneously in a continuous-

     time model) by adjustments in investment. But if instead marginal

    cost is rising within a given period (and this is likely to be so, if

    only because the number of actual disputes capable of producing

     precedents is limited in each period), then discrepancies between

    actual and desired capital will tend to be eliminated gradually over

     several periods.



32. We showed in note 26 supra that the effect of a higher depreciation

     rate on gross investment was uncertain. However, since It/Lt =
                                                                            13



      for a stationary capital stock, a higher depreciation rate must be

      associated with a higher investment-capital ratio.       If the capital

      stock were growing, then It/Lt =        +    (see supra note 27).   Here

      a higher depreciation would also be associated with a higher investment-

      capital ratio, provided there was not an offsetting decline in the

      growth rate (La)   of   the capital stock.

34. We ignore, as irrelevant to the production of precedents, uncertainty purely

      over issues of fact, as distinct from legal issues, though factual un-

      certainty may also lead to litigation.



35.   Presumably, defendants would be entitled to a share in the royalties

      only when the issue for which the case was cited had been raised by

      the defendant (rather than the plaintiff) in the original case by way

      of defense to the charge.

37. The same implication--a zero depreciation rate--could be derived from

     a seemingly opposite theory of judicial behavior: that judges are so

     blindly wedded to precedent that they don't realize that a precedent

     ever depreciates. But perhaps this is the same theory, in that it

     implies a rejection of (rational) adherence to precedent.



38. See note 27 supra.



39. See the discussion and tables on investment in Appendix A, infra.



40. One can respond crudely to the question of a nonconstant growth rate by

     deriving an expression for the mean age of citations in which age is

     expressed as a function of a single depreciation rate but two growth

     rates: a growth rate from the base period to period j and a growth

     rate from j to the current period, t. Given data on average and on

     the two growth rates (e.g., the civil-rights growth rates before and

     after 1953), one can estimate the depreciate rate by an iterative

     procedure.



41. No substantive meaning can be attached to k, since it is a positive

     function of sample size; i.e., the more cases in the sample, the more

    citations there will be and hence the greater k will be.



42. However, we count only once multiple citations to an earlier decision

     if that decision is being cited for the same point in the same case.

    See note 3 supra.
                                                                       15




                                                               equal weight to all
.3.   Uot only is our method preferable to one that assigns

      prior cited decision, but it greatly reduces the costs of data collection.

      Much more detailed information on citations must be kept in order to

      record citations in different sample cases to the same decision.




44.   For convenience we use a continuous time specification in the empirical

      analysis.



45.   Michael Lovell (see note 5 supra) employs a similar though less

      efficient regression technique to estimate the depreciation rate of

      economic knowledge. He estimates a regression of citations on time
                                                           estimate of the growth
      and then computes depreciation by subtracting an

       rate of articles from the regression coefficient.



 46. Because it would burden the test unduly to recount our efforts in trying

      to deal with these problems, here we merely summarize the main problems

      and our solution to them. See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion

      of these problems as well as tables on investment.
                                                                          16




47. Our age distributions record the number of citations for each year

      from 1948 through 1973-1974 (a total of 25 observations); the average

      number of citations per year over five-year intervals from 1924-1948

      (i.e., a total of five observations); and the average number per year

      over 10-year intervals from 1874-1923 (i.e., a total of five observa-

      tions). Thus, only six of 35 observations in the regression analyses of

      citation data to the Supreme Court and eight of 33 observations in the

      other-courts regression are for years in which investment data

      by subject matter are not directly available. There are only

      33 observations in regressions of citation data to other courts

      because the U.S. courts of appeals were not established

      until 1891.




48. Complete regression results appear in Appendix A, infra.

      The biethods used in estimating depreciation

      rates in Tables 4 and 5 correspond to the unweighted method of estimating

      the age of citations. See pp. _____, supra.     Procedural and

      substantive citations were merged for purposes of making these

      estimates.



49.   In Table 4, 5 is positive in 64 of 66 equations, statistically

      significant (.05 level) in 55, marginally significant (.10 level)

      in 5, and not significant in the remaining 6.    In Table 5, 6 is

      positive in all 22 equations, significant in 18, and marginally

      significant in 2 more. Of course, not all of these equations are
                                                                      17




    independent (e.g., the OLS and GLS equations, and the equations that

    aggregate several subject-matter classes into a larger class).

    The difference between the OLS and GLS estimates are for the

    most part negligible.



50. Although the number of observations is typically 35 in regressions to

    Supreme Court precedents and 33 in regressions to other-court

    precedents, the number of sample cases that are the basis for the

    data need only be equal to or greater than one, for it is

    possible to estimate a regression on in (C°II) using the citations

    contained in a single sample case. We of course do not expect the citations in

    a single case to yield a reliable estimate of 5, and in general the more sample

    cases in a subject-matter class the more reliable should be our

     estimate. In the Supreme Court sample, the number of cases in the

     detailed classes was often too small for us to make reliable

     estimates (e.g., in citations to other-court cases there are only

     2 admiralty, 6 tax, 5 antitrust, 2 patents, 5 bankruptcy

     and 2 land cases; see Table 2 for the number of cases in other

     categories). Even in the 1974-1975 court of appeals sample, the small

     numbers of cases in antitrust (12 citing other-court cases and 10

     citing the Supreme Court), bankruptcy (17 and 8) and land (8 and 8)

     suggest that the estimates of 6 for these classes should be viewed

     cautiously. Notice also that the R2's tend to be lower in

     these subject-matter classes; presumably, this is due to a greater

     amount of error in measuring the dependent variable.
                                                                        18




           The reason why, in Tables 4 and 5, the number of observations in

      the regression analysis was sometimes less than either 35 or 33 (e.g.,

      22 in antitrust and civil rights in Table 4) is that in some years

      there were neither citations nor investment. For example, in the

      civil-rights area, there were no citations to cases and no (measured)

      investment before 1952. We excluded from the analysis any year when

      both citations and investment were zero, but if there were positive

      citations but zero investment, or positive investment but zero citations, then

      the year was included.   En the former case we arbitrarily assumed that

      investment equaled 1, and in the latter case that the number of

      citations equaled .01.



51.   If high depreciation is offset by a rapid growth in investment,

      then the survival rate of precedents produced over a given period

      might be independent of the depreciation rate.



52. Higher survival rates for Supreme Court precedents occur in most

      subject-matter classes but not in the "alP category.



53. Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkims, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), held that

      in cases brought in federal courts only
                                                                            19




    because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the courts
    had to apply substantive state law, including decisional law. Since
    most of the common law cases in our sample are diversity cases, the

    principally relevant precedents are state-law decisions, which are

    part of the "other court" category. We plan a more refined analysis

    of precedent in federal diversity cases in subsequent studies.



54. The standard deviations across the 12 subject-matter classes are

    11.6 and 13.1 years respectively for substantive and procedural

    citations to Supreme Court precedents, and 5.2 and 6.1 years

    respectively for substantive and procedural citations to other courts.



55. The regression estimates are as follows


         Supreme Court Precedents:             1.93 +             R2 = 60
                                                         .89X1
                                                         (4.15)
            Other-Court   Precedents:        = .36 + .89X         R2 = 53

                                                        (3.62)


    where      = mean age of procedural citations in ith subject-matter

    class, and X.         mean age of substantive citations in ith class.

     The number in parentheses is the t-statistic. There are 12

    observations in each regression.



56. In order to include the court of appeals civil rights and antitrust

     classes in the regression analysis (investment data for these two
                                                                           20



        classes are available only since 1952) we estimated L from annual

        investments over the—20 year period 1952—1971. When the Supreme

       Court is analyzed separately, L can be computed over a 43-year

       period, 1929—1971, since investment data for each class are available

       for this longer period.



 57.   There are two exceptions. 01$ estimates were used for the patent and

       bankruptcy precedents produced in the court of appeals because the

       GLS method generated negative depreciation rates.




 58. Each observation in Table 9 was weighted by        where C is the number of

       sample cases used to estimate 61 in Table 4. Weighted regressions

       were estimated because the error in the estimated depreciation rates

       is likely to be a positive function of the number of sample cases.

       (See pp. _____,   supra.)   Unweighted regressions, however, were also

       estimated,with little change in the results.



59. For the Supreme Court, the unweighted correlations between 6 and

       Lt are .09 and .04 (depending on whether Lt is computed from annual

       investment since 1952 or 1929), and for the courts of appeals the

       unweighted correlation is - .32.   None of these correlation coefficients

       is significant.



60.
       An alternative and promising approach would be to examine investment

       over time within a subject-matter area. The advantage is that one can
                                                                         21




      identify variables (e.g., the volume of business transactions,

      population changes, key legislation, judicial turnover, subsidies to

      litigants) that are likely to affect the demand and supply of precedent

      production. This approach would require one to estimate a depreciation

      rate that varied over time within a given subject-matter area.   (For

      further discussion see pp. _____,   supra.)


61.   In most instances GLS estimates are unnecessary because first-order

      serial correlation is not present. Two exceptions are the all      and


      labor   classes in the citations to other courts. In one other regres-

      sion--economic regulation in the citations to other courts--the Durbin-

      Watson test was inconclusive.


                                                                                    I)

62.   The only significant increase, however, is in the criminal subject-

      matter class. Observe also that there were slight but statistically

       insignificant increases in the proportion of cases citing other

       court decisions. In one class (tax) there was a greater increase

       from 1960 to 1974-1975 in the proportion of cases citing other courts than

       in the proportion citing the Supreme Court.
                                                                        22




63. This conclusion is of course a preliminary one. We have only

     examined two years and thus do not know whether the observed change

     reflects a persistent trend,as our explanation implies.



64. See pp. _____ supra.



65. Indeed, we first became interested in the possibility of studying

     legal precedents quantitatively as part of an ongoing study of the

    federal courts since 1874. That study is described briefly in Richard A.

     Posner, The Economic Approach to Law, 53 Texas L. Rev. 757, 769 (1975).
