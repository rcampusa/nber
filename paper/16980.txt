                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines argues that while two distinct perspectives characterize the foundations of the
public funding of research – filling a selection gap and solving a disclosure problem – in fact both
the selection choices of public funders and their criteria for disclosure and commercialization shape
the level and type of funding for research and the disclosures that arise as a consequence. In making
our argument, we begin by reviewing project selection criteria and policies towards disclosure and
commercialization (including patent rights) made by major funding organizations, noting the great
variation between these institutions. We then provide a model of how selection criteria and funding
conditions imposed by funders interact with the preferences of scientists to shape those projects that
accept public funds and the overall level of openness in research. Our analysis reveals complex and
unexpected relationships between public funding, private funding, and public disclosure of research.
We show, for example, that funding choices made by public agencies can lead to unintended, paradoxical
effects, providing short-term openness while stifling longer-term innovation. Implications for empirical
evaluation and an agenda for future research are discussed.

1.     Introduction

       Funding agencies, philanthropists and corporations agree that the funding of scientific

progress provides essential knowledge for solving major global challenges. However, in spite of

fifty years of scholarly enquiry since the original Rate and Direction volume articulated the

importance of public (and private) research funding (Arrow, 1962), disagreement continues

over the precise balance of funding, appropriate selection criteria for each funder and the

disclosure conditions that are enforced. In this paper, we review the choices funders have made

over the past fifty years and provide a model that provides an overarching framework in which

to consider the diverse motivations for research funders.

       Over the past century, scholars and policy makers have provided at least two distinctive

arguments for the public support of research – in particular, for basic research. The first

contention, most famously articulated by Arrow, is grounded in the idea that there is a “funding

gap” between the level of private support for research and the socially optimal level of its

provision (1962). The second, more recent argument highlights the differences in the

institutional foundations of knowledge production, particularly as they pertain to openness and

disclosure (see Dasgupta and David, 1994). Even if private funds were allocated to a critical

research project, under the “openness gap” argument, only public funding and the institutional

arrangements that it supports can enable optimal levels of disclosure and thus ensure effective

accumulation of knowledge (Gans, Murray and Stern, 2010). These two perspectives point to

the importance of the selection criteria used by public (and private) funders in shaping both the

overall level of funded research projects and their composition (across dimensions of

contribution to understanding and to usefulness). They also suggest a second dimension to be
                                                                                                   2

considered: the disclosure criteria that funders (public or private) impose as they deploy their

research funding. The two schools of thought, however, fail to articulate how the evolution of

private and publicly funded research has created a tangled relationship between openness and

innovation, whereby corporate protection of intellectual property can lead to greater innovation

and disclosure, while public funding can potentially restrict innovation and disclosure. A

comprehensive review of the policies used by the major government and non-profit funding

institutions can highlight how the relationships between project choice and disclosure policy can

affect outcomes for future research and innovation.

       This paper uses a theoretical model as a framework within which to examine and

compare such relationships between institutions, including how the differences shape the levels

of research funding, the balance of public-private projects and the disclosure of research results.

Not only does this approach synthesize an otherwise complex area of enquiry, it also provides

us with a much richer context within which to explore the role of public funders, the emerging

role of philanthropic funding, and the potential for public funding to crowd out private sector

research.

       In order to appreciate the role of the model we will propose in this paper, it is useful to

understand the historical arguments for the importance of public support of research. Arrow first

articulated   the “funding gap” or selection perspective in 1962 arguing that since private

incentives to fund research are well below social incentives, without public funding the rate of

inventive activity will be suboptimal and its direction would be biased towards more applied,

‘close to market’ outcomes. Even prior to this conceptualization, Nelson had argued that:

       … if the marginal cost of research output is assumed to be no greater in non-profit
       laboratories than in profit-oriented laboratories, and if industry laboratories are
       assumed to operate where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, then the fact that
       industry laboratories do basic research at all is itself evidence that we should increase
       our expenditure on basic research. (1959 p.304, Emphasis in original)
                                                                                                3



In other words, the very fact that private activity continues is evidence that public grants to

support invention do not displace private invention. Fifty years on, the theoretical rationale for

public support of invention remains unchallenged; in the years following World War II, such

public intervention has been recognized and institutionalized (Bush, 1945). Nonetheless, public

funders often find themselves at odds with policymakers and other constituencies as they

balance the need to fund areas of basic research that the private sector avoids against the

political need for real-world impact. Take, for example, the critique of cancer research spending

by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Forty years after Nixon’s “War on Cancer,” many have

accused the NCI of overemphasizing basic research to the detriment of more translational

projects that maximize patient impact (Groopman, 2001). On the other hand, when agencies

shift their funding toward near-term, mission-oriented R&D projects, they are criticized for

crowding out what industry would have done otherwise or for funding (seemingly) redundant

efforts.

           An alternative, “openness gap” or disclosure perspective rationalizes public funding

because a stream of private sector research is not optimal for ensuring the levels of disclosure

that can spark longer-term innovation. Only publicly funded, public-sector researchers can

ensure the broad disclosure of research findings that leads to long-term growth (Romer 1990).

The institutional foundations that establish the setting, incentives and mechanisms to ensure

such freedom and openness have been elaborated by David (2008) and others. In addition,

Mokyr (2004) emphasizes the importance of public funding for ensuring long-run knowledge

accumulation and inter-temporal spillovers. Together, these lines of scholarship build on and

broaden Nelson’s notion that basic research requires conditions of openness, and they

emphasize that any type of research that is disclosed is far more socially valuable than research
                                                                                                 4

held secret. Disclosure is achieved through the contractual provisions of research funding and,

more broadly, because of the norms and incentives for openness found in publish research

institutions. (Dasgupta & David, 1994; David, 2008). Moreover, different types of disclosure

regimes can arise and even co-exist, regardless of whether research is strictly basic or applied in

nature. In some cases, a happy convergence occurs between basic and applied research– a type

of research sometimes dubbed Pasteur’s Quadrant (Stokes, 1997).

       Conflicting selection versus disclosure perspectives on the rationale for public funding

are most vividly illustrated by the calls to halt public funding of the Human Genome Project,

following the announcement that the for-profit company Celera would also undertake full

genome sequencing and “race” the public effort to complete sequencing. Observers argued that

the public funding was redundant and wasteful. In response, public funders sought to emphasize

and enhance the commitment of the public project to openness, rapid and full disclosure of

sequencing data and the provision of an entire information infrastructure for future generations

of researchers – a claim that strongly countered Celera’s tight control of their data (Williams,

2010; Huang and Murray, 2009).

       To reconcile these two seemingly distinct perspectives on public research funding, we

develop a theoretical model that considers demand and supply of research funds in relation to

disclosure requirements and effects. Our contention is that the conditions attached to public

support of inventive activity will impact both on the mix of projects funded and the openness of

those projects. This is achieved through a market that emphasizes the preferences of both the

funders and the scientists in choosing the types of projects and disclosures they prefer. To

elaborate this argument, we model the supply of those funds, as determined both by the

selection criteria of funding organizations and the disclosure conditions that organizations’
                                                                                                5

impose for funding. As we will elaborate below, we define the space in which funders select

projects along two dimensions: usefulness to specific problems and contribution to basic

knowledge (Stokes, 1997; Murray, 2002). The demand for those funds comes from scientists

who choose to accept or reject these funding offers, based on their other options and preferences

for disclosure. This approach brings scientists back into a literature that has been centrally

focused on funders and has only paid limited attention to the funding preferences of scientists.

Our analysis of disclosure relies on the assumption that knowledge can often be disclosed (or

not) according to four different regimes: secrecy, publications, patents, or patent-paper pairs

(Murray and Stern 2007, Gans, Murray and Stern 2010). Our contention is that public funders

(governmental and non-governmental) do not contribute to invention solely by adding resources

to those activities. Their impact arises in the way they select projects for support and in the

conditions they attach to the disclosure and commercialization of those projects. Both, we

argue, have an impact on the direction of inventive activity. In our model we consider both

public and private funding, with some projects – depending on their characteristics – able to

attract private funding. The supply of those funds is determined by the selection criteria of

funding organizations and by those organizations’ choice of (disclosure) conditions on funding.

The demand for those funds is shaped by the relative desirability of accepting private funds.

       Our context for understanding the role of public and private research funding is a period

in which in which US total R&D expenditures have risen from $72.5 billion in 1962 (the year of

the Rate and Direction volume) to US$350 billion in constant 2000 dollars by 2008 (S&E

Indicators Figure 4-1). This represents not simply a rise in Federal (public) funding, which grew

around $47 billion to over $85 billion (over the same period); the amount of R&D funding from

industry experienced its highest growth, from being about 50% of the Federal contribution level
                                                                                                  6

($23 billion) to dwarfing the Federal contribution at over $200 billion. Given the high levels of

private sector funding of R&D, the possibility that at least some public funding is purely

duplicative of enlarged private efforts only strengthens the case that opportunities exist to target

public funding to promote more socially valuable inventive activity. When combined with the

question of what conditions should be attached to research contracts (for example, disclosure

and commercialization) this provides a framework within which to examine and inform research

selection and research contract design by public (government and philanthropic) funding

agencies.

       We pursue this question by gathering (the somewhat sparse) empirical evidence and

developing a theoretical model. Our findings motivate a broader agenda for the study of the

contract design problem facing public research funders. To this end, our paper does three things:

First, in Sections 2 and 3, we provide an overview of preferences of funding organizations

across different types of research project and disclosure regimes. Section 2 reviews the selection

criteria in government and non-government funding organizations – specifically focusing on

their choice of projects along the two dimensions of scientific merit and immediate

applicability. Then in Section 3, we examine conditions on disclosure and commercialization of

research project outcomes. In Section 4, we provide a model of the demand and supply of public

research funds. Finally, in Section 5, based on our analysis, we outline an agenda for future

research. This agenda is motivated by the fact that we have limited knowledge at the moment of

the actual outcomes – selection and openness – of publicly funded projects as well as the

baseline trade-offs that our theoretical model has identified.

2.      How public institutions select academic projects for funding

        In prescribing the role of public research support (in universities and elsewhere), Nelson,

Rosenberg and others have classified research projects along a continuum from basic to

applied.1 Under this schema, a key concern for public funders and academic observers was that

private funders pursued too little basic research relative their emphasis on applied “mission-

oriented” research. The funding landscape turns out to be more complex: First, industry itself

provides funding to universities to undertake research. Second, industry also does some basic

research. Third, public funding is spent in academia on both basic research and more near-term,

mission-oriented objectives. For example, some projects given government funding, such as the

development of theories of plate tectonics or the big bang theory (funded by the National

Science Foundation (NSF)), are explicitly generated to advance basic scientific understanding.

Others have been focused specifically on meeting a particular short-run practical objective, such

as the Department of Defense’s (DoD) funding of gallium arsenide RF technology to enable

cellular commercial infrastructure. Projects such as the Human Genome Project (noted above)

were funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to

generate knowledge considered useful and scientifically interesting. Not confined to the life

sciences, research on chip design in the 1960s and 1970s (funded by the Defense Advanced

Research Projects Agency or DARPA) was also considered to be critically useful and

scientifically important.

        Given the complexity of the funding choices described above, the simple basic-to-

applied continuum as a model of selection is too simple to capture the current research

landscape and fails to capture important findings in scientific history. As an alternative, we have

chosen to consider a two-dimensional space for projects characterized by the degree of scientific

merit on one dimension and the extent of immediate valuable application on the other. In other

words, research projects cannot simply be characterized as basic (contributing to the advance of

scientific knowledge) or applied (leading to immediate applications) but may also involve both:

Galileo not only developed significant scientific insights that contributed to astronomy while

observing the moons of Jupiter, Venus and other plants; he also made useful advances in optics

with implications for the nautical community (Biagioli, 2000). Another eponymous example of

this blurring between basic and applied research is Pasteur’s simultaneous discovery of the

small pox vaccine and advances in microbiology. His work, like Galileo’s has been described as

lying in “Pasteur’s Quadrant” (Stokes, 1997).

                Figure 1: Selection matrix of knowledge production projects



       By mapping research projects along two dimensions: their contribution to fundamental

advances in knowledge and their application to useful problems, we can define (at least) three
                                                                                                                9

distinct classes of research (see Stokes 1997):

             •   Pure basic research (exemplified by the work of Niels Bohr, early 20th century
                 atomic physicist).
             •   Pure applied research (exemplified by the work of Thomas Edison, inventor).
             •   Use-inspired basic research (described as "Pasteur's Quadrant").



        The criteria used by funding organizations in the selection of their research portfolio

have been the subject of surprisingly little empirical analysis, however it is clear that there is no

simple mapping of public (and private) funding to specific quadrants defined above. In what

follows, we therefore provide the broad context for public R&D funding (to universities) and

data to elaborate trends in the fifty-year period since the Rate and Direction volume (1962).

        As Figure 2 illustrates, United States Federal funding (the major source of public

funding in the U.S.) has grown four-fold in this period. Not all of this funding flows to

universities; they perform about 10-15% of the total (public and private) research with around

50-60% of this funding coming from public Federal sources and 5% from private sources2.

 One note however; because private funders generally do not use public “calls for proposals”, information on their
selection criteria are limited.

Public Funding - Federal Agencies

       University-based academics perform more than 60% of the research funded by the

Federal government (with much of the remainder by government laboratories) – what amounts

today to approximately $40Bn annually. The graph below illustrates both funding agency

sources and research performer. It highlights that the majority of funds disbursed via four major

funding agencies (who received budget via annual Congressional appropriations). In recent

years, the NIH has dominated Federal R&D, followed by the NSF (AAAS, 2010). The DOD is

the third-largest sponsor of academic research (when only science and technology funding is

included),3 with the DOE distributing a small (but growing) budget to academia.

  DOD "Science & Technology" (S&T) spending includes basic and applied research, medical research, and
technology development categorized as 6-1 “basic”, 6-2 “applied” and 6-3 “technology development”.

Selection Criteria of the Four Major Funding Agencies

       The National Science Foundation – funding Bohr’s Quadrant: At its current funding

level, the NSF accounts for about 20% of all research funding in academic institutions – one

third of all public Federal funds. The NSF and the funds it provides are most closely associated

with a single funding Quadrant – “Bohr’s Quadrant” and uses as its selection criteria long-term

scientific merit. These criteria (at the broadest level) reflect its founding mission, as articulated

in 1945 in the letter written by Vannevar Bush - later to become the first Director- to President

Truman. In it, he articulated the “Endless Frontier” – the power of public (government) support

for basic research that advanced our understanding and advance of knowledge. While

formulated as ultimately leading to innovation, economic growth and wealth creation, at its core
                                                                                                         12

Bush and his supporters established the NSF on the understanding that advances in knowledge

must be funded in their purest form. Thus, the funding for “basic research” in U.S. academia

was established in its modern form.

           The NSF awarded its first grants to academics in 1952 and since then the agency’s

mission has remained to “to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health,

prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense.”4 The funding criteria focus on their

mission “chiefly by issuing limited-term grants -- currently about 10,000 new awards per year,

with an average duration of three years -- to fund specific research proposals that have been

judged the most promising by a rigorous and objective merit-review system.”5 To be specific,

the NSF defines its goals as

           …discovery, learning, research infrastructure and stewardship – provide an integrated
           strategy to advance the frontiers of knowledge, cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive
           science and engineering workforce and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens, build
           the nation's research capability through investments in advanced instrumentation and
           facilities, and support excellence in science and engineering research and education
           through a capable and responsive organization. We like to say that the NSF is “where
           discoveries begin.

These goals have led the NSF in the 1950s to fund a series of national observatories (1955), the

South Pole Station (1957), and in the 1980s the Internet backbone. In addition to major

research infrastructure projects, most NSF funding is disbursed in the form of competitive

grants to individual investigators. Its selection criteria highlight the intellectual merit of the

proposed activity as well as the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity in their

proposals. However, these impacts are also defined not in terms of usefulness (in an Edisonian

sense) but rather their contribution to education and training; in other words, the NSF funds

questions, both emphasizing knowledge advance over applicability or usefulness:6

           What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? How important is the proposed
           activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across
           different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the
           project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of prior work.) To
           what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or
           potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed
           activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?
           What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? How well does the activity
           advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning?
           How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented
           groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it
           enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation,
           networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance
           scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed
           activity to society?

           More recently, the NSF has initiated a new mechanism – EAGER – focused on early-

stage research. However, this is not a move towards application. Instead, it is intended to move

researchers into more high risk-high return areas of Bohr’s Quadrant by supporting “exploratory

work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or

approaches”.7

           The NIH, DOD and DOE – funding multiple Quadrants: The more “mission-oriented”

funding for academic research provided by the NIH, DOD and DOE stands in contrast to the

NSF. All three agencies focus their attention towards Pasteur’s Quadrant as their explicit

mission-based approach (at least in theory) pushes them to evaluate and select projects along

criteria of basic intellectual merit and immediate mission-oriented impact. However, in the mix

of funding decisions, projects have been funded in Pasteur’s, Bohr’s and Edison’s Quadrants.

           National Institutes of Health: As of 2010, the NIH budget reached over US$25Bn

(excluding American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding) with more than 80%

funding research at over 3,000 U.S. universities and research institutions.8 The need to spend its

appropriations through project selections that blend scientific knowledge advancement with

immediate application is evident in the current NIH mission “to improve human health by

increasing scientific knowledge related to disease and health”.9 In its past history, the NIH was

more mission-oriented and at the outset more closely focused on immediate applications of

research to critical social problems, i.e. it was strongly associated with Edison’s Quadrant. In

1798 the Marine Hospital Service, which served as the founding organization of today’s NIH,

was established by President John Adams for the treatment of seamen and (later) officers of the

U.S. Navy. Its role in application-focused research was initiated almost 100 years later when

Congress appropriated funds to study the causes of epidemic diseases, “especially yellow fever

and cholera.”10 This was rapidly followed in 1879 by the establishment of the first

comprehensive medical research effort on a national scale and the creation of the National

Board of Health. Among its first research investments were a bacteriology laboratory on Staten

Island focused on useful research. By 1918, the research program expanded beyond

communicable diseases and extended its grants to outside institutions (thus establishing the

precedent that the Federal government might turn to scientists other than their own employees

in institutions around the country for research assistance through a grant-making mechanism).11

        The shift in orientation away from research of immediate practical application towards

Pasteur’s Quadrant and more basic contributions to the advances of knowledge in Bohr’s

Quadrant can be traced to the 1950s and the rise of molecular biology. This field offered a deep

knowledge base for the continued study of health and disease and for the development of

specific treatments and cures (Judson, 1979). This was exemplified in the NIH’s hybrid goal of

research to “advance the understanding of biological systems, improve the control of disease,

and enhance health.” Nonetheless, as the specific selection criteria illustrate, the current

orientation is towards more “Bohr-like” less problem-oriented research. This orientation is

evident in the criteria outlined to external peer reviewers: In selecting external awardees, the

NIH uses a peer review system as legally required through sections 406 and 492 of the PHS Act

with an underlying system to “provide a fair and objective review process in the overall interest

of science” (NIH Grants Policy Statement (12/03), p. 7). And, surprisingly, given the orientation

towards practical applications as well as basic knowledge advance, the NIH review criteria are

strikingly similar the NSF. Five selection criteria are defined in the Congressional guidelines12:

           •    Significance. Does this study address an important problem? If the aims of the
                application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge be advanced? What will be
                the effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive this field?
           •    Approach. Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analyses adequately
                developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the project? Does the
                applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative tactics?
           •    Innovation. Does the project employ novel concepts, approaches or methods? Are
                the aims original and innovative? Does the project challenge existing models or
                develop new methodologies or technologies?
           •    Investigator. Is the investigator appropriately trained and well suited to carry out
                this work? Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the PI and
                other researchers (if any)?
           •    Environment. Does the scientific environment in which the work will be done
                contribute to the probability of success? Do the proposed experiments take
                advantage of unique features of the scientific environment or employ useful
                collaborative arrangements? Is there evidence of organizational support?

The lack of mention of immediate application is striking. Specific funding choices at the level

of particular grant mechanisms emphasize this shift toward a basic knowledge orientation. For

example, in selecting projects in the R21 category (Exploratory Research Grant Program) that,

12
     http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part3.htm#_Toc54600045
                                                                                                    16

like the NSF EAGER grants, are designed to support “novel scientific ideas or new model

systems,    or   technologies     that   have    the    potential    for   significant   impact     on

biomedical…research,” reviewers are directed to focus their evaluation on the “conceptual

framework, the level of innovation and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge.”

        Department of Defense: The United States DOD spent $82 billion on research,

development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E)13 in 2008 - nearly 50% more than the rest of the

federal government combined. Little of this funding reaches academic institutions- only $2Bn to

academia for research purposes - 2.1% of the DOD’s RDT&E budget to so-called basic research

and 5.3% to applied research (DOD Budget: Fiscal Year 2009 2008).

        The limited emphasis on research in academia is further reflected in its organizational

structure; university research is one of several mandates supported by one of four organizations

within the Research Directorate, which itself is one of four directorates under the Office of

Defense Research & Engineering. Nearly all of the basic research and much of the applied

research supported by the DOD is funded through DARPA, an office administratively

independent from the Office of Defense Research & Engineering. Founded in 1958 as the

Advanced Research Projects Agency in response to the launch of Sputnik and renamed DARPA

in 1972, its mission is “to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent

technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-

payoff research bridging the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use.”14

DARPA can thus be squarely identified as searching for and selecting research opportunities in

Pasteur’s Quadrant or, when appropriate, in Edison’s Quadrant – solutions to specific problems.


13
    DOD classifies RDT&E into seven activities: basic research, applied research, advanced technology
development, advanced component development and prototypes, system development and demonstration, RDT&E
management support, and operational system development ((DOD Financial Management Regulation 2008).

   DARPA Mission 2010
                                                                                                         17

          This problem orientation is evident in DARPA’s organization around seven independent

offices: Adaptive Execution, Defense Sciences, Information Processing Techniques,

Microsystems Technology etc. These offices are similar to the NIH’s Institutional Centers in

that they have independent missions and identify their own research agendas, but their selection

criteria are more closely tied to their missions. Each office posts solicitations for research

proposals in the form of Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) (similar to NIH RFAs and

DOE FOAs) in the specificity of research requested (DARPA Solicitations, 2010). While the

independence given to each office leads to variability within the evaluation criteria used across

BAA's, the following criteria are present in each BAA, illustrating a tighter focus on useful

applications in Edison’s Quadrant:15

          •   Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The technical merit of the research and the
              soundness of the plan to perform it will be evaluated. The proposed research must be
              highly innovative and show promise of sufficient technical payoff to warrant the
              technical risk. The research must have the potential to make a radical impact on
              future technology. The proposed technical approach is feasible, achievable, complete
              and supported by a proposed technical team that has the expertise and experience to
              accomplish the proposed tasks. Task descriptions and associated technical elements
              provided are complete and in a logical sequence with all proposed deliverables
              clearly defined such that a final outcome that achieves the goal can be expected as a
              result of award. The proposal identifies major technical risks and planned mitigation
              efforts are clearly defined and feasible.
          •   Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission The potential
              contributions of the proposed effort with relevance to the national technology base
              will be evaluated and its relevance to DARPA’s particular mission and methods
              assessed. Specifically, DARPA’s mission seeks to maintain the technological
              superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming U.S.
              national security. DARPA aims to accomplish this by sponsoring revolutionary, high-
              payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their
              ultimate military use.
          •   Cost Realism The objective of this criterion is to establish that the proposed costs are
              realistic for the technical and management approach offered, as well as to determine
              the proposer’s practical understanding of the effort. The proposal will be reviewed to
              determine if the costs proposed are based on realistic assumptions, reflect a sufficient
              understanding of the technical goals and objectives of the BAA, and are consistent
              with the proposer’s technical approach (to include the proposed Statement of Work).
              At a minimum, this will involve review, at the prime and subcontract level, of the type
              and number of labor hours proposed per task as well as the types and kinds of

           materials, equipment and fabrication costs proposed. It is expected that the effort will
           leverage all available relevant prior research in order to obtain the maximum benefit
           from the available funding. For efforts with a likelihood of commercial application,
           appropriate direct cost sharing may be a positive factor in the evaluation.

       Department of Energy: The smallest of the Federal funding agencies in terms of funding

of research in academia, the Department of Energy - unlike the NSF and NIH - has not

historically been an organization devoted to funding research. Created in 1977 in response to

the energy crisis of the 1970s from organizations that regulated the nuclear power industry and

managed nuclear weapons development (Origins & Evolution of the Department of Energy

2010), the DOE has been “principally a national security agency” (DOE Program Offices,

2010). It originally emphasized “energy development and regulation,” “nuclear weapons

research, development, and production” in the 1980s, and “environmental cleanup of the

nuclear weapons complex, nonproliferation stewardship of the nuclear stockpile, energy

efficiency and conservation, and technology transfer and industrial competitiveness” in the

1990s and early 2000s (Origins & Evolution of the Department of Energy, 2010).

       As of 2008, the DOE’s mission is more focused on research and development,

specifically “discovering the solutions to power and secure America’s future” (DOE Summary

of Performance and Financial Information, 2009). In fact, the DOE now funds 40% of the basic

research in the physical sciences in the United States, making it the single largest supporter of

such research. (The majority of DOE supported research is performed internally in 17 national

laboratories rather than in academic university labs). Nonetheless, the DOE’s strategic theme of

science, discovery and innovation accounted for only 16% ($4.1 billion) of its total program

expenditures in 2009 (DOE Summary of Performance and Financial Information, 2009). While

this was supplemented by appropriations from ARRA, the DOE is not primarily focused on

research funding despite its current mission.
                                                                                                          19

           DOE selection criteria can be observed through its external grant solicitations through its

Office of Science. Like the other mission-oriented agencies, the Office of Science is subdivided

into six program offices, each reflecting a key mission area; Advanced Scientific Computing

Research, Basic Energy Sciences, Biological and Environmental Research, Fusion Energy

Sciences, High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics. Each office provides funding opportunity

announcements (FOAs) focused on well-defined research goals. The DOE criteria for peer

review (as legally required through the Office of Science Financial Program Rule (10 CFR Part

605 2006)) listed below in descending order of importance, reflect funding in Edison’s quadrant

and, to a lesser extent than the NIH, Pasteur’s Quadrant. They are:16

       •   Scientific and/or technical merit of the project; for example, the influence that the
           results might have on the direction, progress, and thinking in relevant scientific fields of
           research; the likelihood of achieving valuable results; and the scientific innovation and
           originality indicated in the proposed research.
       •   Appropriateness of the proposed method or approach; for example, the logic and
           feasibility of the research approaches and the soundness of the conduct of the research.
       •   Competency of the personnel and adequacy of proposed resources; for example, the
           background, past performance, and potential of the investigator(s); and the research
           environment and facilities for performing the research.
       •   Reasonableness and appropriateness of the proposed budget; and
       •   Other appropriate factors, established and set forth in a notice of availability or in a
           specific solicitation.


           In response 2006 “Rising Above the Gathering Storm ” report (National Academies

2006), the 2007 America COMPETES Act established the Advanced Research Projects

Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) within the DOE to “explore creative “outside-the-box” technologies

that promise genuine transformation in the ways we generate, store and utilize energy” (ARPA-

E: Programs Main Overview 2010).

           ARPA-E is modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

and receives $400 million in initial funding through ARRA. Its mission is to “fund projects that


16
     Basic Energy Sciences: Review and Selection of Research Projects 2010; 10 CFR 605.10
                                                                                                     20

will develop transformational technologies that reduce America’s dependence on foreign energy

imports; reduce U.S. energy related emissions (including greenhouse gasses); improve energy

efficiency across all sectors of the U.S. economy and ensure that the U.S. maintains its

leadership in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies” (ARPA-E: Mission

2010). Furthermore, ARPA-E is not intended to support the traditional energy research agenda

of the DOE, but to focus “exclusively on high risk, high payoff concepts - technologies

promising genuine transformation in the ways we generate, store and utilize energy” (ARPA-E:

Mission 2010). ARPA-E has released seven FOAs to date, six of which have a narrow research

focus similar to traditional DOE FOAs (ARPA-E: Programs Main Overview 2010). However,

“ARPA-E’s inaugural program … was open to all energy ideas and technologies, but focused

on applicants who already had well-formed research and development plans for potentially

high-impact concepts or new technologies” (ARPA-E: Broad Funding Announcement)

suggesting a shift towards Pasteur’s Quadrant with a specific focus on energy applications.

ARPA-E uses a peer review process to select awardees with the following evaluation criteria17:

          •   Impact of the Proposed Technology Relative to State of the Art
                 The proposed technology must directly address one or more ARPA-E Mission
                 Areas. Quantitative material and/or technology metrics must be proposed that
                 demonstrate the potential for a transformational (not incremental) advancement
                 in one or more energy-related fields. The applicant must demonstrate an
                 awareness of competing commercial and emerging technologies and identify how
                 its proposed concept/technology provides significant improvement over these
                 other solutions. The applicant must have a strong and convincing transition
                 strategy, including a feasible pathway to transition the program results to the
                 next logical stage of R&D or directly into industrial development and
                 deployment. The applicant must address the program-specific requirements
                 identified for the Full Application phase as described in Section II of this FOA.
          •   Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
                 The work must be unique and innovative. The proposed work should be high risk,
                 but must be feasible. The applicant must demonstrate a sound technical approach
                 to accomplish the proposed R&D objectives. The outcome and deliverables of the
                 program, if successful, should be clearly defined. The applicant must address the


17
     DE-FOA-0000289; DE-FOA-0000290
                                                                                                       21

                   program-specific requirements identified for the Full Application phase as
                   described in Section II of this FOA.
           •    Qualifications, Experience, and Capabilities
                   The proposed Principal Investigator or technical team should have the expertise
                   and experience needed to accomplish the proposed project. In addition, the
                   applicant should have access to all facilities required to accomplish the R&D
                   effort or has proposed the necessary missing equipment as part of the effort. The
                   applicant’s prior experience must demonstrate an ability to perform R&D of
                   similar risk and complexity.
           •    Sound Management Plan
                   The proposed effort must have a workable plan to manage people and resources.
                   Appropriate levels or people and resources should be allocated to tasks. The
                   application should identify major technical R&D risks and have adequately
                   planned mitigation efforts that are clearly defined and feasible. The proposed
                   schedule should be reasonable. The applicant’s prior experience in similar
                   efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to manage an R&D project of the
                   same proposed complexity that meets the proposed technical performance within
                   the proposed budget schedule.


Overall, it is clear that today’s Federal agencies select academic research projects across a mix

of quadrants.


Public Funding – Philanthropic Foundations

           Philanthropic foundations serve as an alternative source of public (i.e. not for profit)

funding for research in academia. They have played a critical role in supporting university

research since the contributions of James Smithson to the establishment of the Smithsonian

Foundation, which served not only to fund the now renowned museum but also one of the first

extra-mural grant-making program. According to his will (drafted in 1826) this Englishman’s

money would go "to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of

the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge ....”18

After that time, wealthy individuals in the United States continued the practice of supporting

academic research, selecting mainly on their interest in specific individual beneficiaries and

missions. Many of the earliest gifts to university-based researchers focused on astronomy,

                                                                                                22

botany and zoology. In later years, more highly organized philanthropy shifted attention

towards biomedical research.

           The current landscape of philanthropic support for research includes a broad variety of

criteria, with almost as much variation for funding university researchers as the Federal

agencies themselves. Traditionally, most foundations – for instance, the Sloan Foundation and

the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, have followed selection criteria emphasizing scientific

rather than applied outputs; Howard Hughes Awards are well-known for their provision of long-

term support for high-risk research based on scientific merit and contributions to fundamental

knowledge i.e. Bohr’s Quadrant (see Azoulay, Graff Sivin and Manso, 2010).

           The more recently founded Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a striking example of a

foundation with significant resources that places a much greater emphasis on solving problems

of immediate social and economic value. The overall foundation statement highlights a strong

mission orientation by outlining its commitment to projects by asking the following questions:19

           •   What affects the most people?
           •   What has been neglected?
           •   Where can we make the greatest change?
           •   How can we harness innovative solutions and technologies?
           •   How can we work in partnership with experts, governments, and businesses?

           In the arena of Global Health (which constitutes more than 60% of the $22 billion in

funding that the foundation has committed from 1994 through June 2010), the Foundation’s

priority areas are defined by disease. Its work in areas such as diarrhea, malaria, polio and

tuberculosis is closely mirrors the priorities and emphasis of the NIH in the late half of the

nineteenth century and early twentieth century. In selecting funding recipients, the Foundation

uses criteria that are significantly at odds with the NIH (even in the same programmatic arenas)

and emphasize problem-focus in Edison’s Quadrant.

           Like most of the Federal funding agencies, the Gates Foundation also has a program to

fund high-risk, high-reward research: the Grand Challenge Explorations program. At only

$100k per project, the foundation emphasizes “unorthodox thinking…essential to overcoming

the most persistent challenges in global health … to expand the pipeline of ideas to fight our

greatest health challenges.”20 Not only is the mission of this program more tightly coupled to

the production of useful knowledge to address key problems. The funding criteria are also

dramatically different from the approach used in Federal funding. At the start of an Explorations

program, a topic area is outlined. For example, a 2010 Grand Challenge Explorations theme was

focused on new technology for contraception. The topic was defined with the articulation of a

key “roadblock.” Specifically, they state that:21

           ... there have been tremendous improvements in the reproductive health of men and
           women in the developing world. Nonetheless, many do not have access to health supplies
           and services that enable planning the number and timing of pregnancies, safe delivery of
           children, and management and treatment of sexually transmitted infections …

The Foundation argues that barriers to uptake arise because

           … current methods do not meet their needs. For those whose income is less than $2 per
           day, cost is an specially important issue…and side effect[s] that can occur [are] not
           acceptable in certain cultural contexts. Skilled health care workers are often unavailable
           in resource poor settings so self-administration or options that allow for non-medical
           staff -- such as community health volunteers -- can increase access to new methods …
           etc.

They conclude with their statement of need for proposal to

           … solicit novel and innovative approaches to preventing unintended pregnancy. We seek
           proposals that are ‘off the beaten track,’ daring in premise, and clearly different from the
           approaches currently being developed or employed. Technologies or approaches should
           enhance uptake, acceptability and provide for sustained use; enable or provide for low-
           cost solutions; promote effective delivery and administration of new solutions; and
           ensure or enhance safety.

           Proposals are not explicitly subject to “peer review.” Instead, the review panel has

                                                                                                      24

“broad expertise and a track record in identifying innovations.” They may not be deep domain

expertise in the field. Review is executed in four stages: In Stage 1, Foundation staff review

proposals to determine a match between the proposal and key needs described in the topic, or

proposals considered to be more incremental advances. In the second step, external reviewers

make evaluations, but rather than seek consensus, they can making funding recommendations

based on the best proposals they see. Three criteria are deemed critical22:

           •   Topic Responsiveness – How well does the proposal address a key need illustrated in
               the topic description?
           •   Innovative Approach – Does the idea offer an unconventional, creative approach to
               the problem outlined in the topic?
           •   Execution Plan – Is the work described feasible within the budget and time allocated
               for a Phase I GCE award and if successful, would it be sufficient to show a clear
               path to further support?

The Gates criteria, in contrast to all the Federal funding criteria, illustrate a much tighter

coupling for selection to specific areas of need and immediate application. More akin to the

French wine industry funding much of Pasteur’s work on fermentation, the criteria couple the

hybrid generation of fundamental knowledge to the solution of specific problems, thus re-

emphasizing the degree to which -- at least in selection -- funders have a rich array of choices

available to them as they establish selection criteria. In the figure below we map each of the

agencies and several of their larger programs, as well as a number of the major Foundations,

into the two by two selection matrix outlined above. What is clear is that there is significant

diversity across the agencies, even among those three with a well-articulated mission

orientation. And, among Foundations there is even greater variation and a willingness to

experiment with a broader space of selection criteria (although the effectiveness of these

criteria, either in terms of selecting distinctively different research projects or achieving

different outcomes, remains to be fully analyzed).

3.     Disclosure and Commercialization

       Disclosure is a key element in shaping the impact of investments in research by both the

public and the private sector on the economy; however, the disclosure conditions imposed by

funders received only limited scrutiny from policymakers and scholars until the 1980s. At this

time came the recognition that the mere production of knowledge was inadequate to ensure its

role in knowledge accumulation: inter-temporal knowledge spillovers require that knowledge be

disclosed and accessible to others, a feature of knowledge production that is far from axiomatic

(Mokyr, 2004). What remains to be understood and analyzed in the context of the research

funding is the range of possible disclosure choices, the preferences of researchers and funders

for these conditions, and whether and how disclosure conditions influence the level and type of

projects funded by the public and private sector respectively.

       Building on the two-by-two framework elaborated in Section 2, we argue that there exist

at least four distinctive disclosure strategies; secrecy (non-disclosure), publication, patenting,
                                                                                                      26

and patent-paper pairs (Murray, 2002). Each of these options map into several of the four

research quadrants described above. Specifically for research that lies in Pasteur’s Quadrant, all

four disclosure strategies are viable alternatives – research that is useful and makes a

contribution to fundamental knowledge can be patented or published (or both), but can also be

subject to secrecy. For Bohr’s quadrant secrecy and publication are viable strategies. Edison’s

quadrant research can remain secret or be patented, as illustrated by the high levels of patenting

achieved by Edison and his laboratory.

        In what follows, we provide some insight into each of the four disclosure choices (for

more details see Gans, Murray and Stern, 2010). “Non-disclosure” or secrecy may be preferred

by some funders (particularly those in the private sector or government agencies funding

particular types of research with national security implications) but is generally not compatible

with researchers in academia. Far from being a modern practice, secrecy was widely used by

funders of research, particularly patrons who had utilitarian motives for maintaining at least

some of the discoveries that they funded a secret (David, 2008). Even in the case of Galileo, the

telescopes he prepared for his patron were presented only at the Grand Duke’s orders to the

other European rulers (David, 2008, p. 13). In later periods, researchers funded on botanical

expeditions also maintained their plant specimens, drawings and maps as secrets for their

wealthy commercial patrons (Stroup, 1990; Schiebinger & Swan, 2005). More contemporary

examples of secrecy in government-funded research include the Manhattan Project - among the

best known “secret” research projects undertaken by academic scientists. Most recently, the so-

called “climategate” argument over research performed in the UK identified researchers at the

University of East Anglia who had “an unacceptable culture of secrecy.”23 Indeed, as a leading


23
  Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee blamed the University for encouraging a “reprehensible
culture of withholding information”.
                                                                                                  27

analyst of medical science has argued: “secrecy in science reduces the efficiency of the

scientific enterprise by making it harder for colleagues to build on each other's work”

(Blumenthal et al., 2006).

       The three disclosure strategies that provide an alternative to secrecy rely upon complex

institutions to provide incentives for scientists and those who fund them to engage in disclosure:

the patent system or commercial science and the system of publications often termed open

science (Dasgupta and David, 1994).

       Disclosure in patents is supported by commercial science, which, among other functions,

provides incentives to ensure that knowledge locked within labs might instead be disclosed

(Machlup and Penrose, 1950; Kitch, 1977; Scotchmer and Green, 1990). As a quid pro quo for

exclusionary rights of a limited term, patent holders (whether they be the funder or the

researcher) must disclose knowledge at the level that enables a person “skilled in the art” to

replicate that knowledge and potentially build upon it. This strategy is most likely to be

appropriate for knowledge that is of immediate application (in Edison’s or Pasteur’s Quadrant),

given the requirement for patent grant that an idea be not only novel and non-obvious but also

useful. And, with the passage of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act title to patents was clearly given to

universities for researcher funded by the Federal government, a norm that has extended to many

other funders (with some institution specific variations).

       For researchers working within academia, publication disclosure associated with open

science is the dominant institutional logic: when knowledge is disclosed through scientific

publication in the academic literature, researchers are rewarded with kudos and other private

benefits (Dasgupta and David, 1994; David, 2008). In other words, to receive credit for the

intellectual priority of their scientific discoveries, scientists publicize their findings as quickly
                                                                                                28

as possible but retain no other rights over their ideas (Merton, 1957). Of course, journals require

that an idea make a contribution to fundamental knowledge and therefore knowledge in Bohr’s

and Pasteur’s quadrant are most likely to be potentially disclosed via publication. Interestingly

(as we outline in more detail below), public funders rarely place publication requirements on

those whom they fund, assuming instead that broader institutional norms promote publication.

       The fourth disclosure strategy – patent-paper pairs – is widespread among academic

scientists (using a variety of funding sources). When research projects are in Pasteur’s Quadrant

and lead to research of immediate usefulness and make a contribution to long-run knowledge

then we see may observe disclosure in the form of patent-paper pairs regardless of funding

source (Murray, 2002; Murray and Stern, 2007). For example, with funding from Geron

Corporation, Professor James Thomson from the University of Wisconsin developed both

monkey and then human embryonic stem cells and disclosed the research in the form of an

academic publication. However, only a few weeks prior to publication, he filed patents. The

more formal disclosure requirements provided by funders do not, to our knowledge, explicitly

make provisions for patent-paper pairs. Instead, by making provisions that allow for publication

hold-up to enable patent filing, they implicitly acknowledge the possibility of patent-paper pairs

and enable researchers, their universities and the flow of funding to follow the complex timing

requirements that enable disclosure through patent-paper pairs.

       Disclosure outcomes are typically negotiated between researchers or their organizations

(for example universities) and funders as they match on particular research projects. A control

rights approach to the selection of disclosure strategy has recently been developed by Gans,

Murray and Stern (2010). They argue that scientists and those who fund them have clear (and

potentially diverging) preferences for disclosure. In particular, while researchers have strong
                                                                                                   29

preferences for disclosure in the form of academic publications (Ster,n 2004), some funders –

particularly those in the private sector - may have expectations that research is disclosure

through patents or may prefer secrecy. This disjuncture highlights the important role of public

(versus private) support in shaping the conditions influencing the level of research

dissemination (or patenting) as well as the level of inventive activity (Furman, Murray and

Stern, 2010).

       In what follows, we examine the ways in which funders (as well as researchers and the

universities in which they are employed) shape the selection among the four disclosure

strategies for knowledge generated by the projects they fund. The precise nature of these

requirements can be defined either through formal contracts (as is typically now the case for

private funding) or via informal normative expectations (as is broadly true for public funding,

although specific regulations do exist).


Disclosure Criteria for Public Funding – Government Agencies & Foundations

       If public funding agencies, particularly the Federal government, have been vague with

regards to their expectations around the selection of research projects, their stipulations

regarding disclosure of the results of these projects is even less precisely articulated.

       In broad strokes, our analysis suggests that government funders make few active

provisions to limit non-disclosure; the National Science Foundation asks researchers to make

best efforts in disclosure but has no formal requirements limiting secrecy. The specific

contractual provisions hold few obligations of publication disclosure. The NSF outlines:

       38. Sharing of Findings, Data, and Other Research Products
       a. NSF expects significant findings from research and education activities it supports to
       be promptly submitted for publication, with authorship that accurately reflects the
       contributions of those involved….
                                                                                                            30

        b. Adjustments and, where essential, exceptions may be allowed to safeguard the rights of
        individuals and subjects, the validity of results, or the integrity of collections or to
        accommodate legitimate interests of investigators.

Overall, there is a strong adherence to the notion of autonomy and “self-regulation” for the

scientific community. This is based both on a view that incentives for academic publication will

eventually ensure that knowledge production will indeed be disclosed via publications and

through the use of publications as a selection mechanism for future awards.24

        With regards to patenting, the regulations are more precise. Provided for by the Bayh-

Dole Act, the National Science Foundation and other US government agencies have provisions

for the patenting of inventions outlined in the Federal Register ([35 U.S.C. § 200 et seq.]).

Specifically:

        Unless otherwise provided in the award, if this award is for experimental, developmental
        or research work the following clause will apply”:

        b. Allocation of Principal Rights
        The grantee may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each
        subject invention subject to the provisions of this Patent Rights clause and 35 U.S.C.
        §203. With respect to any subject invention in which the grantee retains title, the Federal
        Government shall have a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to
        practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. the subject invention throughout
        the world...

Of particular note is the requirement to disclosure subject inventions to the NSF within two

months (and include in that notification information about other publications and manuscripts).

        c. Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent Applications by Grantee
        1. The grantee will disclose each subject invention to NSF within two months after the
        inventor discloses it in writing to grantee personnel responsible for the administration of
        patent matters. …It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear
        understanding of the nature, purpose, operation, and, to the extent known, the physical,
        chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall
        also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention, whether a manuscript
        describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has
        been accepted for publication, at the time of disclosure…

This is the most salient element of the contractual regulation of Federal funding that requires
24
  Scotchmer and Maurer (2004) demonstrate that a reputation based funding mechanism can substitute for a public
funder’s difficulty in evaluating research outcomes ex ante.
                                                                                                    31

rather than expects disclosure, although it is not clear that in practice this is always fulfilled and

there is considerable discretion on the part of investigators.

       While the NSF rules are closely followed by other U.S. Federal funding agencies other

more stringent disclosure requirements have been imposed by other government agencies such

as the UK’s Medical Research Council. They place a greater emphasis on publication as a

strong expectation:

       GC 23 Publication and Acknowledgement of Support
       The Grant Holder should, subject to the procedures laid down by the Research
       Organisation, publish the results of the research in accordance with normal academic
       practice.

This is augmented by specific provisions making publications themselves more available:

       AC30 Self archiving of publications
       For proposals (for grants or fellowships) submitted after 1 October 2006, electronic
       copies of any original research papers accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed
       journal, which are supported in whole or in part by MRC funding, must be deposited at
       the earliest opportunity, and certainly within six months of publication, in UK
       PubMedCentral. This applies whether the manuscript was submitted during or after the
       period of the grant. The condition is subject to compliance with publishers’ copyright and
       licensing policies. Whatever possible, the article deposited should be the published
       version.

Some foundations follow a similar line and, in fact, use disclosures as critical inputs into

funding decisions. For instance, the Sloan Foundation specifically requests tangible outputs

“(such as number of students whose training or careers are affected, data collected, scientific

papers produced) and outcomes (such as new knowledge, institutional strengthening, etc)” or

other measures of success including “big sales of a book, a prize awarded for research, a

government grant to continue the project, web traffic, high enrollments, better salaries, etc.” in

evaluating grant effectiveness. Similarly, the criteria of Gates Foundation (as it pursues a

selection model that emphasizes immediate value) emphasize what they term ‘actionable
                                                                                                               32

measurement’25 in follow-on grant selection process but places no specific requirements on

disclosure.


Disclosure Criteria for Public Funding – Special Provisions of Defense Funding

        In comparison to most public funding from government agencies and philanthropic

foundations, research funding for defense-oriented research, including research funded by

DARPA, has more limitations on disclosure, particularly when associated with research of

immediate application. Of course, as Senator Moynihan quoted in an address on Secrecy in

Science to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1999:26 “What is

different with secrecy is that the public cannot know the extent or the content of regulation.27

Thus it is difficult to precisely calibrate the extent of secrecy for defense research”.

        The secrecy (non-disclosure) of publically funded research can be required through the

1951 Invention Secrecy Act,28 which empowers Federal defense agencies to prevent the

disclosure of new inventions that pose a potential national security threat by sharing with the

USPTO with a classified list of sensitive technologies in the form of the “Patent Security

Category Review List” (PSCRL).29 Prior to this time, during World War I and throughout

World War II, Congress authorized the USPTO to classify certain defense-relevant patent

applications, and patent secrecy was used to maintain secrecy over information considered

critical to national security particularly the Manhattan Project. The formal language of the 1951

statute is informative:

29
   It should be noted that this provision is not limited to ideas generated with Federal funding. It can be imposed
even when the application is generated and entirely owned by a private individual or company without government
sponsorship or support.
                                                                                                                   33

         Whenever publication or disclosure by the grant of a patent on an invention in which the
         Government has a property interest might, in the opinion of the head of the interested
         Government agency, be detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner upon being so
         notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall withhold the grant of a patent
         therefore under the conditions set forth hereinafter.

         Whenever the publication or disclosure of an invention by the granting of a patent, in which the
         Government does not have a property interest, might, in the opinion of the Commissioner, be
         detrimental to the national security, he shall make the application for patent in which such
         invention is disclosed available for inspection to the Atomic Energy Commission, the Secretary
         of Defense, and the chief officer of any other department or agency of the Government
         designated by the President as a defense agency of the United States. Each individual to whom
         the application is disclosed shall sign a dated acknowledgment thereof, which acknowledgment
         shall be entered in the file of the application.

A secrecy order not only prevents patent award and orders that the invention be kept secret, it

restricts the filing of foreign patents, and specifies procedures to prevent disclosure of ideas

contained in the application.30,31 The number of patents subject to this treatment as of 2009 is

just over 5,000 with 103 new secrecy orders imposed on patents in 2009.32

         It is generally within the more narrow constraints of specific research funding contracts

used by Defense funding agencies, particularly DARPA, that other disclosure limitations are

imposed in researchers (in academia and elsewhere). All DARPA BAAs are composed of the

same basic requirements (although details differ from office to office and announcement to

announcement) regarding disclosure with the obligations and requirements on intellectual

property, publications and export control restrictions dependent upon whether the research is

funded as basic research (6.1), applied research (6.2), advanced technology development (6.3).

         In general, all research performed on a university campus will have no publishing

30
   The inventor does have some recourse for compensation: According to Section 183, An applicant, his successors,
assigns, or legal representatives, whose patent is withheld as herein provided, shall have the right, beginning at the
date the applicant is notified that, except for such order, his application is otherwise in condition for allowance, or
February 1, 1952, whichever is later, and ending six years after a patent is issued thereon, to apply to the head of
any department or agency who caused the order to be issued for compensation for the damage caused by the order

restrictions and is distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, “the

results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons” (DARPA-

BAA-10-35 2010). For research that meets the basic or applied classification, BAAs have a

publication approval subsection under award administration information that states that it is “the

policy of the Department of Defense that the publication of products of fundamental research

will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible” (DARPA-BAA-10-35 2010, DARPA-

RA-10-76 2010). However, DARPA may change the research designation (and hence the

disclosure provisions) after research has been completed at the discretion of the DARPA

contracting officer according to this language:

          …in those rare and exceptional circumstances where the applied research effort presents
          a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or
          manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense, and where agreement
          on restrictions have been recorded in the contract or grant.’ Such research is referred to
          by DARPA as ‘Restricted Research.’	  (DARPA-­‐BAA-­‐10-­‐35	  2010,	  DARPA-­‐RA-­‐10-­‐76	  2010).	  

Depending on the designation imposed by the Contracting Officer, a variety of publication

disclosure limits may be imposed (see Table 1 below).

       With regards to noncommercial and commercial technical data and computer software,

as well as patents and other forms of intellectual property, disclosure and control is governed by

the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). However rather than

disclosure per se, the main concern of the funding agency lies in maintaining control rights over

ideas. For procurement contracts, the proposer must identify all commercial and

“noncommercial technical data and … computer software that it plans to generate, develop,

and/or deliver under any proposed award instrument in which the Government will acquire less

than unlimited rights, and to assert specific restrictions on those deliverables” (DARPA-BAA-

10-35 2010). It is important to note that the Government assumes unlimited rights to any

technical data and software not delineated. Researchers who undertake non-procurement

contracts must disclose similar information, primarily restrictions on Government use of

technical data and software. Just as the NSF and NIH require that patent filings be documented,

DARPA requires documentation proving “ownership of or possession of appropriate licensing

rights to all patented inventions (or inventions for which a patent application has been filed)”

(DARPA-BAA-10-35 2010). In addition, DFARS 227.303 gives patent rights to the contractor

for all inventions discovered while under contract. Thus, overall, DARPA’s standard contractual

obligations on disclosure are relatively unrestrictive with respect to intellectual property

ownership and the dissemination of information.

Disclosure Practices of Private-Sector Funders

         The disclosure practices of private-sector funded research taking place within private-

sector firms is beyond the scope of this paper. However, of the $200 billion in the private sector

funds spent on R&D, over $2 billion are spent on research taking place within U.S. universities,

which constitutes 5 percent of the university research budget. Private-sector funding is

particularly widespread among life science researchers: A survey of more than 2000 life

scientists at the 50 U.S. universities receiving the most National Institutes of Health funding

found that more than 25% of the most productive researchers received industry funding – over

36% in clinical departments compared to 21% in nonclinical departments (Blumenthal et al.

1996).

         With regards to disclosure, industrial funders are more closely associated with attempts

to enforce secrecy on the scientists they fund and the challenge of limiting secrecy falls to

sponsored research administrators within universities as well as on academic scientists

themselves. In current industry-funded medical science, for example, secrecy appears to be

widespread: The precise disclosure requirements places on recipients of industry funding is not

systematically documented. However, several recent surveys of life science researchers found

that faculty members with industrial support were significantly more likely than those without

industrial support to report that their research had resulted in trade secrets (14.5 percent vs. 4.7

percent), thus, suggesting more limited disclosure linked to industrial funding (this figure rises

to over 17% for the subset of over 500 researchers whose area of focus is in biotechnology –

including recombinant DNA, monoclonal antibodies and gene sequencing. However, these

researchers are also more likely to apply for patents and are more productive in publication

terms as illustrated in Table 2 (reproduced from Blumenthal et al. 1996, p. 1737).
                                                                                              37



                    2




       Concerns over delays in publication disclosure, while less concerning than secrecy, are

still salient in medical research because of the close relationships between medical scientists

and industry funders. As leading commentators have noted: “The enormous legal and financial

power of the pharmaceutical industry puts clinical investigators in a very difficult position if

there is a major controversy about the outcome of a particular study” (Nathan and Weatherall,

2002). In several cases, scientists have accused their funders of attempting to limit disclosure,

particularly of negative clinical results (Haack, 2006). Among the most infamous is the

relationship between Nancy Olivieri, a clinical researcher at the Hospital for Sick Children

(Toronto) and the University of Toronto, and Apotex, a Canadian manufacturer of generic drugs

who funded a short-term, uncontrolled clinical trial of deferiprone in patients with thalassemia

who had iron overload (Oliveri et al., 1995). The Oliveri case is by no means the only example

of the complex relationship between researchers, their funders and the universities (and medical

schools), who serve as the intermediaries in constructing and executing these contracts and in
                                                                                                              38

setting effective and appropriate levels of disclosure.34 As noted in a leading medical journal

“[t]he intense pressure on individuals at academic institutions to publish and on the sponsoring

companies to get their drugs on the market sometimes produce[s] tensions between the two

parties, and if results are not favorable, disagreements can develop[,] leading to disputes,

innuendos, and even legal action.”35 More pragmatic is the voice from leading journal Nature

Biotechnology that asks, “When is it reasonable for academics to expect total freedom over the

data they have gathered on a company’s behalf, especially if they have signed a confidentiality

agreement?”36

        The debate over privately-funded medical research and more broadly regarding all

industrial funding of academic research is grounded in the contracts that are signed between

academic scientists and the private corporations who fund them. Certainly, scandals, such as

those experienced in academic medical centers, have exacerbated the need for clearer rules.

Early examples of industry-university contracts gave many of the rights to the knowledge

produced (and its disclosure) to the funder (usually referred to as the sponsor). In the past

decade, universities have become more sensitive to charges of “research-for-hire” and the

possibility that knowledge is being withheld to serve corporate interests. However, while the

Technology Transfer Office (TTO) function has received considerable attention among scholars

of innovation and the academic-industry boundary (Owen-Smith 2005; Mowery et al. 2004), the

ways in which universities contract over the incoming funding (rather than the outgoing

licensing of completed projects) is poorly understood. We have little systematic knowledge of

the disclosure provisions put into place for privately (commercially) sponsored research. To fill

this gap, we have gathered some preliminary data in this regard that catalogues the contractual

practices of 20 major U.S. research universities.37

        The contractual provisions shaping disclosure (and ownership) of industry-funded

research in academia are rarely established via a bilateral agreement between researcher and

funder. More typically, the negotiation is carried out and the contract signed by an “Office of

Sponsored Projects,” which seeks to represent the broader interests of the university in

maintaining the disclosure of research findings. Our analysis focuses on the standard contractual

terms offered to industrial sponsors in single-sponsor research agreements with regard to

publications, rights to tangible research property, university project inventions, university

copyrightable software and databases and university copyrightable works other than software.

There appears to be significant heterogeneity among the terms surrounding publications and

rights in tangible research property across universities, whereas the terms for university project

inventions, university copyrightable works other than software and university copyrightable

software and databases are similar across the sample.

        Publication: With regards to disclosure via publication, 16 of the 20 universities in our

sample explicitly address publication restrictions in single sponsor research agreements with

industrial entities38 including terms governing the public disclosure of information gained in

research, the existence of prepublication sponsor review, the time for review (if permitted),

exceptions in permitted reviews for theses or dissertations and sponsor acknowledgment. We

present Article VI of the research contract used by the University of California at Berkeley as an

example of common terms presented to corporate sponsors with regard to publications:

        ARTICLE VI. PUBLICATION California will have the right to copyright, publish,
        disclose, disseminate and use, in whole and in part, any data or information received or
        developed under this agreement. Copies of any proposed publication will be provided to
        Sponsor thirty (30) days prior to submission for Sponsor's review, comment, and
        identification of any of Sponsor's proprietary data which has inadvertently been included
        and which Sponsor wishes to have deleted. During this review period, Sponsor may also
        identify patentable inventions for which it wishes California to file for patent protection.
        In such case, California will delay publication up to an additional sixty (60) days in
        order to file such patent application.

        The University of California at Berkeley and nine other universities in our sample

permit the disclosure of all information that is not marked as confidential by the sponsor, five

universities allow full disclosure and the University of Texas at Austin has a more complex

policy: it allows full disclosure if it has exclusive rights to the intellectual property produced in

the project, but it gives the sponsor the right to mark information as confidential and non-

publishable if the sponsor has some claim to the intellectual property produced. Nonetheless,

every university permits pre-sponsor publication review, even though the sponsor may not

necessarily have rights to restrict the information divulged in the publication. A majority of

universities give the sponsor 30 days for review and allow between a 30-day and 60-day

extension. However, some universities gave more favorable terms, such as a 180-day extension

and even a three-month standard review with a three-month extension. This heterogeneity

across universities is surprising and merits further investigation into its causes and effects.

        Patenting: While the terms surrounding publications are heterogeneous across

universities, the terms governing rights in tangible research property are dichotomous.39 When

addressed, the university is always given the right to use all tangible research property.

   The 11 universities in alphabetical order are Georgia Tech, Harvard, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Stanford, University of Arizona, University of California at Berkeley, University of Texas
at Austin, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin and Washington University.
                                                                                                     41

Ownership rights generally require further negotiation and/or separate agreement. Harvard is the

only university we examined that claims ownership rights over the research property and only

gives the sponsor rights for internal research use. While firm conclusions cannot be drawn from

such a small sample, it appears that the dichotomy presented in the terms governing rights in

tangible research property are a result of the fact that universities must often enter into

negotiations and/or use a separate agreement beyond the boilerplate contract when assigning

these rights.

        Unlike the terms for publications and rights in tangible research property, many of the

terms governing university inventions are nearly uniform across the 11 universities, including:

which party is awarded ownership of inventions, whether internal research licenses are offered

to the non-owning party, the existence and nature of any commercial licenses, the amount of

time given to elect to license (if available), the amount of time given to negotiate collective

licenses and whether the sponsor must reimburse expenses. We present an excerpt from Section

11 of the research contract used by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology below as an

example of common terms presented to industrial sponsors with regard to inventions.

        A.      MIT INVENTIONS. MIT shall have sole title to (i) any invention conceived or first
                reduced to practice solely by employees and/or students of MIT in the
                performance of the Research (each an “MIT Invention”) and (ii) any invention
                conceived or first reduced to practice by employees of the Sponsor with
                significant use of funds or facilities administered by MIT, if the invention is
                conceived or reduced to practice other than in the performance of the Research.
                The Sponsor shall be notified of any MIT Invention promptly after a disclosure is
                received by MIT’s Technology Licensing Office. MIT may (a) file a patent
                application at its own discretion or (b) shall do so at the request of the Sponsor
                and at the Sponsor’s expense.

        B.      LICENSING OPTIONS.     For each MIT Invention on which a patent application is
                filed by MIT, MIT hereby grants the Sponsor a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
                royalty-free license for internal research purposes. The Sponsor shall further be
                entitled to elect one of the following alternatives by notice in writing to MIT
                within six (6) months after MIT’s notification to the Sponsor that a patent
                application has been filed:
                                                                                                     42

               1.      a non-exclusive, non-transferable, world-wide, royalty-free license (in a
                       designated field of use, where appropriate) to the Sponsor, without the
                       right to sublicense, in the United States and/or any foreign country
                       elected by the Sponsor pursuant to Section 11.C. below, to make, have
                       made, use, lease, sell and import products embodying or produced
                       through the use of such invention, provided that the Sponsor agrees to
                       (a) demonstrate reasonable efforts to commercialize the technology in
                       the public interest, (b) reimburse MIT for the costs of patent prosecution
                       and maintenance in the United States and any elected foreign country,
                       and (c) indemnify MIT for any liability arising from Company's use or
                       sale of the invention; or

               2.      a royalty-bearing, limited-term, exclusive license (subject to third party
                       rights, if any, and in a designated field of use, where appropriate) to the
                       Sponsor, including the right to sublicense, in the United States and/or
                       any foreign country elected by the Sponsor pursuant to Section 11.C.
                       below, to make, have made, use, lease, sell and import products
                       embodying or produced through the use of such invention, provided that
                       this option to elect an exclusive license is (a) subject to MIT’s
                       concurrence and the negotiation of commercially reasonable terms and
                       conditions and (b) conditioned upon Sponsor’s agreement to reimburse
                       MIT for the costs of patent prosecution and maintenance in the United
                       States and any elected foreign country and to cause any products
                       produced pursuant to this license that will be used or sold in the United
                       States to be substantially manufactured in the United States.

               If the Sponsor and MIT do not enter into a license agreement within three (3)
       months after Sponsor’s election to proceed under paragraph 11.B.1. or 11.B.2. above,
       the Sponsor’s rights under paragraphs 11.B.1. and 11.B.2. will expire.

       As observed in MIT’s agreement, the university retains ownership of all project

inventions in each case and can therefore disclosure the knowledge via patent filing. In addition,

almost all universities examined automatically offer the sponsor a license for internal research

use and none explicitly deny such a license. With regard to commercial licenses, the terms range

from an option to negotiate a nonexclusive royalty-free license (NERF) to giving a royalty

bearing sublicense will contract. However, the majority of universities offer both non-

sublicensable NERFs and royalty-bearing sublicensable contracts. Harvard is the only outlier,

offering a NERF for blocking intellectual property, which is sublicensable if the license for

dominating intellectual property is also granted, and options for royalty bearing licenses that are

either exclusive and sublicensable or nonexclusive and non-sublicensable. As with university
                                                                                                   43

project inventions, the terms governing the ownership and licensing of copyrightable software

and databases are consistent across the ten universities we examined.40

           Taken together, the university-industry contract suggests that the nature of the disclosure

terms that prevail when university academics seek out private-sector funding are more complex

than under conditions of public-sector Federal funding. We have been led to believe in our

informal conversations with university Offices of Sponsored Research that in recent years

public funding coming from philanthropic sources is increasingly the subject of more stringent

disclosure conditions. Rather than attempting to limit disclosure and enable secrecy (albeit time

limited), philanthropic foundations are hoping to force more rapid disclosure by shifting the

burden on publication from a norm or expectation towards a requirement. Likewise, they hope

to shift ownership or licensing terms related to patents in a way that ensures that commercial

rights still enable the development of useful products and services for under-served

communities and nations (Furman, Murray and Stern, 2010). These trends, which deserve

further scrutiny, highlight the critical role of disclosure requirements in shaping scientists’

preferences for funding from different sources.

           In the model that follows, we combine our understanding of both the selection and

disclosure requirements of funds and their interaction with scientists’ preferences to offer a

window into the role of public versus private funding of R&D in academia.



4.         Selection, Commercialization and Disclosure in a Model of Private-
           Public Funding

           The previous two sections illustrated the selection intentions as well as the conditions

that public funders place on the disclosure and commercialization of research. For example, for

40
     Harvard’s standard research agreement does not address copyrightable works.
                                                                                                44

funders usually select projects on the basis of scientific merit rather than capacity for immediate

application. In addition, for the most part, funders do not explicitly consider whether other

sources of funding might be forthcoming for projects within their selection set. Nonetheless,

funders do display an active concern about what might become of the outcomes of research

projects. They often impose disclosure requirements – through publication and other means –

and also can limit commercialization options.

       In this section, we provide a model of private and public funding of scientific projects

and the ways in which funding criteria (both in selection and disclosure) made by these types of

funders interact and shape the portfolio of funded projects. This modeling approach allows us to

examine whether and how funding conditions impact the number, mix and openness of projects

that are funded. We see this theoretical exercise as a critical first step towards identifying the

first-order trade-offs that arise when publicly funded projects interact with privately funded

ones. This will provide a basis for hypotheses that may be tested empirically in the future, as

well as important considerations in identifying the causal impact of changes in funding policy

(such as those that arose as a result of the Bayh Dole Act).

       To this end, the focus of our model is on the public funder’s conditions regarding

commercialization and patenting rather than on selection and disclosure per se (although those

conditions have important consequences for these). With regard to selection, we assume that it

is difficult for the funder to observe immediate applicability, while it can more readily evaluate

scientific merit. We do, however, discuss what happens when funders can observe aspects

beyond pure scientific merit. With regard to disclosure, the evidence above suggests that we can

take as a given that disclosure rights are preserved and, indeed, compelled as a condition for the

receipt of public funds. We will demonstrate that this requirement, however, has an important

impact on the decisions of scientists and potential commercial funders to accept such funds.


Key Assumptions and Setup

            We assume that there is a [0,1] × [0,1] space of research projects that can potentially be

funded. The cost of funding each project is a constant amount, k. Projects also require a scientist

to perform the research.41 Projects differ in terms of their potential immediate social benefit, v,

and their potential present value of future scientific benefits, b. b and v are independently and

identically distributed, uniformly on [0,1].42

            For a project with potential benefits (b, v) there are constraints on realizing this scientific

and social value. With regard to immediate social (and economic) value, v is realized if the

results of the research project are commercialized by competitive firms; otherwise a fraction of

the value, δ , is lost under monopoly production. We assume that competition can be fully

provided by two firms who each capture β of immediate value while a monopolist captures a

fraction µ ∈ [2β ,1 − δ ] .

            With regard to scientific benefit, b is realized if and only if research outcomes are

publicly disclosed (i.e., the scientist engages in disclosure via publishing). Otherwise, there are

no scientific benefits. It is assumed that the scientist appropriates b in ‘kudos’ if the project

proceeds and its results are disclosed in a scientific publication.

            Taken together, these conditions assure that maximum social value is realized if there is

both competitive commercialization and scientific publication under conditions where all

projects for which v + b ≥ k are funded while those with v + b < k do not proceed (Figure 5).




41
     It is assumed that scientists are suitable for at most one potential project.
42
     We examine the consequences of non-independence of b and v below.

Intellectual Property and Competition

         For simplicity, we assume that at most two firms can commercialize the outcome of a

given research project.43 Commercialization of a project carries no cost for the firm who funds a

project but a cost, θ, for a rival firm engaging in parallel commercialization. This cost is

distributed uniformly on [0,1]. However, if there is a publication, these costs are reduced by a

fixed amount, d < 1 – βv.44

         If permitted by the funder, the research outcome from a project may include a patent that


43
   If more firms can commercialize the research this only intensifies the gap between competition and monopoly in
terms of profits and social value.
44
    Below we consider what happens if commercialization requires the scientist’s cooperation to transfer key
knowledge (other than that done through publication). This will raise the possibility that commercialization is not a
certain outcome when the scientist does not have a commercial interest.
                                                                                                                 47

is conferred on one firm. The existence of a patent generates a probability that entry may be

blocked. There are many ways this might be modeled. Here we assume that, if there is a patent,

then with probability 1 – ρ, entry is possible; otherwise, it is not. Specifically, if not blocked by

a patent, an entrant will only enter if β v + d ≥ θ if there is a publication or β v ≥ θ , if there is

not. This means that, if a firm controls the intellectual property of a research project, its

expected profits are µ v − (1 − ρ )( β v + d )( µ − β )v if there is disclosure of scientific knowledge

and µ v − (1 − ρ ) β v( µ − β )v otherwise.45 In what follows, we use a variable, i, to indicate

whether a firm as a patent (i = 1) or not (i = 0).


Scientist-Firm Negotiations

         Firms provide the project capital, while scientists provide the labor. In this model, it is

clear that while scientists may benefit from publication, firms do not.46 However, publication

may increase joint surplus if b > (1 − i ρ )d ( µ − β )v . In this case, if profits are still non-negative,

a firm would find it profit maximizing to allow publication, as this would allow them to reduce

payments to the scientist to ensure they participated in the project (Stern, 2004).

         For many projects, there will be a surplus (or rents) created. The division of the surplus

is determined by the relative bargaining power of scientists and firms. In Gans, Murray and

Stern (2010), negotiations over whether to disclose research results are modeled using a Nash

bargaining solution with arbitrary bargaining power. Here, for expositional ease, it is assumed

that scientists have all of the bargaining power. Specifically, it is assumed that the private

supply of capital is perfectly elastic and consequently, firms will receive enough surplus (net of

45
   Note that it is always profit maximizing for the firm to choose to patent if it is permitted to do so. In reality,
patents have their own disclosure requirements and other transactional costs that may make this decision more
nuanced.
46
   This is an extreme assumption. Firms may benefit from funding in terms of marketing benefits, attracting talent,
reputation and also defensive publishing to influence patent race outcomes.

payments to scientists or license fees to scientist employers) to ensure that profits cover their

capital costs.


Pure Private Funding

           We begin by examining outcomes when only private funding is available. In this case,

there will be no constraints placed on the ability to patent or earn commercial returns. However,

disclosures through publication may still arise if this raises total surplus generated by the

research project.

           It is useful to define the threshold values of v that will allow a project to be

commercially viable; that is, how high does v have to be to ensure that the commercial profits

cover capital costs? This defines the set of projects capable of commercial funding and in the

case the only projects funded in a regime of pure private funding. First, we define v as the

minimum level of immediate value that would allow the net profits from any project with v ≥ v

to cover capital costs. That is,

                                   µ v − (1 − ρ ) β v ( µ − β ) v = k                            (1)

Second, we define vd ,1 as the minimum level of immediate value that would allow the net

profits from any project with publication and a patent and with v ≥ vd ,1 to cover capital costs.

That is,

                            µ vd ,1 − (1 − ρ )( β vd ,1 + d )( µ − β ) vd ,1 = k                 (2)

Third, we define vd ,0 as the minimum level of immediate value that would allow the net profits

from any project with publication but no patent and with v ≥ vd ,0 to cover capital costs. That is,

                               µ vd ,0 − ( β vd ,0 + d )( µ − β ) vd ,0 = k                      (3)
                                                                                                   49


Note that v < vd ,1 < vd ,0 as a publication diminishes commercial returns. This implies that all

projects with v ≥ v will be funded. This is because, even without publication, the profits from

those projects will enable the project to cover capital and scientist costs.

        The following proposition characterizes the equilibrium outcomes:

Proposition 1. A research project (b, v) is privately funded with no publication if v ≥ v and (i)
b < d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v or (ii) b ≥ d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v and v < vd ,1 . A research project (b, v) is
privately funded with publication if and only if b ≥ d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v and v ≥ vd ,1 .

The proof involves a straightforward comparison of the conditions that maximize total surplus.

Figure 6 depicts the equilibrium outcome. Importantly, projects that have both a high future and

immediate value are more likely to be funded and are also more likely to be disclosed through

publication. These projects lie squarely in Pasteur’s Quadrant. Because the scientist is liquidity

constrained, some projects whereby b ≥ d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v are funded but do not involve a

publication.

       At this point, it is useful to note the impact of stronger intellectual property protection,

as measured by ρ, on the equilibrium outcome. Notice that an increase in ρ will increase both v

and vd ,1 but will also impact on the margin between publishing and not. The former

comparative static comes from the pure increment to commercial returns accompanying

stronger patent protection. The latter arises because stronger patents protect the firm from the

consequences of published disclosure, thereby reducing the costs of such disclosure. This means

that more projects will be funded and, in addition, a larger number of projects will be funded

that permit publication. As Gans, Murray and Stern (2010) demonstrate, this is not a

consequence of scientists having all of the bargaining power and can arise simply because firms

wish to economize on scientist labor costs.


Public Funding

       We now turn to examine what happens to the mix and disclosure of projects when there

is a public funder who is interested in providing maximizing social value (b + v). Under these

conditions, we assume that the public funder is constrained in its ability to assess and

consequently select projects for funding. Specifically, we assume that the public funder can

only observe b and cannot observe v. The idea is that b is something that is subject to possible

peer review in such a way that it can be properly assessed, whereas v is somewhat harder to

extract as information from the marketplace. Maurer and Scotchmer (2004) tie this specifically

to published outputs that can serve as a signal of scientific value being met and also likely to be

met in the future through a reputational mechanism. We examine below what happens when

more symmetric information acquisition across project dimensions is possible.

       The public funder is assumed to be liquidity constrained (in contrast to private funders).

It has total funds available of K (< k) so it can only fund at most K/k projects. This implies that
                                                                                                                51

there exists some threshold, b, such that it would fund all proposals with b > b.47 Note that, as

some projects satisfying this constraint may choose not to apply for public funding but be

purely privately funded, b depends on the equilibrium outcome in terms of each project’s opt in

decisions.

           The key focus of our analysis is on the restrictions the public funder attaches to funds

received. One obvious restriction is a requirement to publish without which future value cannot

be generated. Consequently, it will be assumed throughout that the public funder always

requires this in return for accepting any funds.

           The other restrictions we consider are as follows. First, the scientist cannot profit from

commercialization, and no patent can be applied for and granted. This is a common requirement

from funding by government sources. Second, the scientist can profit from commercialization,

but patenting is not permitted. Finally, that there are no commercialization restrictions and

patenting is permitted without any conditions on how patent rights are used. We examine each

in turn.

No commercial payments or patent: When scientists (or their institutions) cannot receive

commercial payments, their decision as to whether to accept public funding (if offered) will

compare the kudos they receive, b, with the potential surplus otherwise.

Proposition 2. When public funding prohibits commercial payments to the scientist, such
funding will only be accepted by a research project (b, v) if:
       (i) v < v ; or
       (ii) v ∈ {v , vd ,1} and b ≥ µ v − (1 − ρ ) β v( µ − β )v − k .
A research project (b, v) will be privately funded with publication if v ≥ vd ,1 and


47
   It is possible that the funder could also have a maximum cut off that did not fund projects with very high
scientific value. This might arise if many such projects would be funded anyway and so the funder was willing to
sacrifice not funding those with high scientific value that would not otherwise be funded. As this possibility does
not fit the description of any known funding agency, we implicitly assume that is not the case here. However,
strictly speaking this would only apply under certain distributional assumptions on the space of projects as well as
the availability of public funds.
                                                                                                 52


b > d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v . A research project (b, v) will be privately funded without publication if
v ≥ v and b < µ v − (1 − ρ ) β v( µ − β )v − k .

The proof is straightforward once it is noted that:

                    µ v − (1 − ρ ) β v( µ − β )v − k > (1 − ρ )d ( µ − β )v ⇔ v > vd ,1 .

A possible outcome is depicted in Figure 7. There are three things of interest. First, if a project

was privately funded with publication prior to the existence of a public funder, it remains

privately funded. This is because the scientist can earn profits as well as kudos with private

funding. Second, public funding does crowd out some private funding but where it does so it

generates a publication. Thus, more projects are funded and overall openness has increased

compared to a purely private system. Finally, there may be projects the public funder would like

to fund in order to generate scientific benefits from publication, but these projects remain

privately funded and unpublished. This is because the funding conditions restricting commercial

payment cause ‘too many’ projects to opt out of receiving public funding.

       Interestingly, in this regime, the total level of public funding available has no impact on

whether projects with v ≥ vd ,1 are funded and what type of funding those projects would receive;

those projects remain private. That is, the addition of public funding with restrictions on

profiting from commercialization and patenting does not change the set of privately funded

projects that are disclosed.

Commercial payment but no patent: Suppose now that the scientist is permitted to have a

commercial interest in the project, but if it accepts public funds, no patent can be taken out.

Consequently, imitative entry can proceed in an uninhibited manner.48 The following

proposition summarizes the resulting equilibrium.




48
     In addition, no license revenue can be generated; something we discuss below.
                                                                                                                                54

Proposition 3. When public funding prohibits patenting, such funding will only be accepted by a
research project (b, v) if:
       (i) v < v ; or

                   { (
          (ii) v ∈ v , 21β   d 2 + ( µ4−kββ) ρ − d   )} and b ≥ (ρβ v + d )(µ − β )v − k .
A research project (b, v) will be privately funded with publication if v ≥                           1
                                                                                                    2β   (   d 2 + ( µ4−kββ) ρ − d   )
and b > d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v . A research project (b, v) will be privately funded without publication
if v ≥ v and b < ( ρβ v + d )( µ − β )v − k .

The proof follows from that fact that:

                  ( ρβ v + d )( µ − β )v − k > (1 − ρ )d ( µ − β )v ⇔ v >       1
                                                                               2β   (   d 2 + ( µ4−kββ) ρ − d   )
A possible outcome is depicted in Figure 8. In comparison to the no commercial payment case,

observe first that there is more crowding out of privately funded projects and consequently, the

total number of projects funded falls. This means that the marginal project receiving public

funding has a higher b. Moreover, some of those projects crowded out are those that received

private funding but involved disclosure. Nonetheless, some additional projects are disclosed.

These projects, however, are of relatively low b (our proxy for scientific and potential future

value). Finally, the additional projects receiving public funding have a higher chance of

resulting in competition and so the realized immediate value for those projects is likely to be

higher.

          It is useful to compare this outcome to a weaker restriction – that a patent can be taken

out, but it should be licensed openly, as proposed in Furman, Murray and Stern (2010) and

elsewhere. The idea here is to increase the probability that there is competition and that the

immediate value of the innovation is socially realized. The question is whether this actually

adds value to the firm relative to the ‘no patent’ case.

       If a patent is licensed to rivals, this allows the firm to earn more revenue in the event

such rivals should enter. Indeed, if there were no restrictions on the fee that could be offered to

a potential competitor, the firm could appropriate all of the competitor’s profits; that is,

taking place). In that case, the firm’s expected profits from accepting public funding become

µ v − ( β v + d ) ( ( µ − v)v − 12 ( β v + d ) ) . This makes it more likely that the firm would accept

public funding but significantly makes the firm less concerned about the impact of disclosure

requirements on its profits.

       Of course, this assumes that the firm can charge a lump-sum license fee but not

otherwise control ex post competition through a license agreement; for example, by setting a

license fee that preserves monopoly. A public funder would unlikely find much value in open
                                                                                                        56

licensing if it did not increase realized social value.

        In addition, open licensing could give rivals a significant degree of bargaining power;

especially if the onus was on the patent holder to ensure that licensing takes place. In this case,

the fee may end up being close to some minimum amount as required by the funder and the

outcomes may not be very different from the case where a patent is simply prohibited.

No restrictions: Finally, we consider what happens when the public funder places no

restrictions on how the research project might be commercialized. Previously, public funding

may not be accepted because of a desire to appropriate commercial profits and take out a patent.

In this case, the only restriction is that the project outcome has to be published. If

b < d (1 − ρ )( µ − β )v − k , this may result in a project choosing to opt out of public funding.

Otherwise, such funding will be accepted if it is available. Figure 9 depicts a possible outcome.

       The first thing to note is that every project that might have been privately funded with

publication will opt to take out public funds if they are available. Compared to the situation

where the public funder allowed a commercial interest but no patent, this is a pure crowding out

effect, with no benefits in terms of disclosure or increase in likely competition. Second, there

are some privately funded projects without publication that do not receive public funding.

However, there are also those for which the reverse might be the case. However, these are of

lower b and hence, the shift in publications is socially more valuable.


Impact of the Bayh-Dole Act

       This analysis gives some insight into the possible impact of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980.

That legislation removed restrictions on the patenting of government funded research performed

within universities. While it is not necessarily the case that scientists themselves appropriated

commercial returns in the period that followed, their employers did, with a likely sharing of

benefits in non-monetary form. Thus, it was akin to a move from the ‘no commercial interest,

no patent’ case to the ‘no restriction’ case.

       The likely impact of the Act was, first, to have caused projects that might otherwise

have been privately funded to become publicly funded. Moreover, the analysis demonstrates

that this may not necessarily increase the degree of openness by the same amount, as many of

the high scientific value projects would likely have been disclosed anyway.

       There is little evidence that the Bayh-Dole Act had a significant impact on the number

of research projects funded and performed within universities (Mowery and Sampat, 2001) or

on the mix of those projects (Mowery and Ziedonis, 2002). While there was an increase in

patenting, there is evidence that this was stimulated by other factors and, in fact, the quality of

the patents was, on average, lower than prior to 1980 (Henderson, Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 1998).
                                                                                               58

       Our analysis here is consistent with empirical findings that the quality of patented

research from universities was reduced by the Bayh-Dole Act. Note that the marginal projects

both encouraged and now patented as a result of the change in funding conditions are all at the

lower end in terms of commercial prospects – arguably, the measure of quality associated with

patent citation rates. Consequently, our model predicts precisely the decline in average quality

that was observed empirically. Nonetheless, our analysis also identifies the broader role of

university-based researchers in private innovative efforts as being relevant to consider when

evaluating the full impact of the Bayh-Dole Act. To our knowledge, no such evaluation has yet

been conducted.


Interdependence between immediate value and scientific merit

       So far, we have assumed that b and v are independently distributed. What happens if

they are interdependent? Specifically, how does this change the importance of imposing funding

conditions on crowding out of private funding? If b and v are negatively correlated, then even in

the absence of funding restrictions, very few high b projects would be available to opt for public

funding and consequently, the crowding out effect will be lower. In this case, funders can more

freely offer funding without restrictions. On the other hand, positive correlation of b and v

implies that the reverse is true. In this case, public funders will want to be more diligent

regarding conditions on commercialization and patenting to minimize crowding out.


What if scientists receive kudos for obtaining grants?

       In the above analysis, scientists care about two things – kudos from publication and

potential earnings from commercialization. In many higher education institutions, scientists also

receive prestige from obtaining grants from public funders. The model here demonstrates that
                                                                                               59

such prestige is likely to have negative consequences. In particular, it means that scientists may

opt for public funding even in cases where they might have been able to privately fund projects

with publication. This increases the crowding out effect, even in situations where public funders

impose many restrictions on commercialization and patenting. The clear implication is that

when crowding out is an issue, prestige associated with obtaining grants has negative

consequences. Practically, however, it is difficult to separate out the prestige associated with

grant awards, especially competitive grant awards, with the kudos likely to be generated from

the outcomes of such grants.


Scientist effort in commercialization

       Of course, expanding the funding base and assisting openness were not the primary

rationales behind the Bayh-Dole Act. Instead, it was to unlock university research for

commercialization by giving universities the ability to clarify commercial ownership and an

obligation to facilitate commercialization and appropriate commercial returns. The idea behind

this is quite consistent with economic theory: in the absence of a commercial stake, universities

and academics would not expend much energy in trying to find commercial partners and

communicate their innovations and research outcomes widely. Indeed, there is evidence that the

Bayh-Dole Act did stimulate university level activities in technology transfer (Mowery and

Ziedonis, 2002).

       In other words, when comparing a ‘no commercial payment’ situation to a pure privately

funded situation, some research projects would accept public funds but at the same time be

commercialized at a lower rate than they would have been if they had been privately funded. As

we move to a situation where public funding is granted unconditionally, then projects that

receive some funding are more likely to be commercialized. This may include some low v
                                                                                                 60

projects. However, selection again plays a role. If we expect that it is high v projects that are

more likely to be commercialized, we can also observe that those projects would have likely

received private funding prior to the Bayh-Dole Act. Thus, mere observations that more projects

are being commercialized after 1980 may mask the true impact of the Bayh-Dole Act on

commercialization – which is likely to be lower. This suggests considerable caution in the

interpretation of such results.

        The other implication is that proposals to improve the transactional efficiency of the

commercialization process should receive additional attention, as these will impact on

university-based research across the board. Kenney and Patton (2009) argue that ownership of

patents should be vested with scientists, and Litan, Mitchell and Reedy (2007) argue that

universities should not have an exclusive option on commercializing research that is federally

funded but performed in their home institutions. Instead, each emphasizes the role of

competition in promoting more efficient search and commercialization from Universities.


Placing weight on immediate value in selection

        So far, we have assumed that the public funder can only observe the future value of a

research project and not its immediate value. Consequently, it could only use future value as a

selection criterion. However, if the funder could also observe immediate application value, then

it could reject funding of projects that had both high scientific and immediate value and could

allocate those funds to other projects. Thus, perfect information would allow the funder – even

operating alongside a private system – to more closely approximate the socially optimal

outcome. As noted earlier, there was a sense in which the Gates Foundation undertook this

practice by emphasizing projects of immediate value that, for some reason, were subject to

difficulties in private appropriability that limited their ability to attract private funding.
                                                                                                61

       More realistic is the possibility that public funders could use more sophisticated

mechanisms to reveal whether a project would otherwise be of high immediate value. For

example, Maurer and Scotchmer (2004) argue that matching funds assist public funders in

selecting projects with high social prospects and not those with low prospects. They argue that a

pure capital subsidy means that public funders may end up funding some low value projects.

Instead, suppose that all projects required a minimum capital contribution from private funders

before receiving an additional subsidy. In that situation, for projects with low social value, the

minimum capital contribution screens them out, as even with the subsidy such projects will not

earn a return for their private backers.

       Here, the concern is with projects that might otherwise have received private funding

and not require public funds. In this case, minimum capital requirements would not screen out

those projects. Instead, matching funds could be tied to funding conditions. For instance,

‘restricted’ grants that prevented commercialization or patenting might receive the full capital

costs whereas ‘unrestricted’ grants may only receive partial funding. Of course, these latter

grants would still require disclosure through publication. In this case, public funders would

offer researchers a menu of options. A possible outcome of this is depicted in Figure 10.

       In Figure 10, note that some projects choose open science with full public funding rather

than the matching grant option. Note also that the matching grant makes public funding more

attractive to some projects who switch from no publication to publication. However, it is clear

that this outcome is superior for the public funder compared with the unrestricted funding case,

as more projects receive funding and high scientific merit but low commercial return projects

operate under open science. This suggests a rationale for tying a lack of restrictions on patenting

and commercial exploitation of research with shared capital contributions for that research.

       This mixed system overcomes some of the difficulties identified with matching grant

systems. That occurs here, but by also providing restricted funding without matching grants,

those projects with high scientific merit can be funded regardless.



5.     Discussion & Agenda for Research

       The design of research contracts by public or publicly spirited funders is an issue that

has been understudied. Some prior formal models have examined the role of funding conditions

on individual projects and their performance. Most notably, Aghion, Dewatripont and Stein

(2009) examine the interplay between an academic’s choice of project (which comes with

public funding) and ceding that right to private commercial interests. Their concern was that
                                                                                               63

research effort be optimally allocated between exploration and exploitation of promising paths

(see also Banal-Estañol and Macho-Stadler, 2010). Importantly, they emphasized the

importance of conditions (to select research direction) attached to public funding and contrasted

these with conditions that would be imposed by private funders. With regard to openness,

Mukherjee and Stern (2009) and Gans, Murray and Stern (2010) examined the disclosure rights

afforded research scientists. None of these investigations, however, analyzed how public

funding conditions affect the mix of private-public projects and with it the level of disclosures

across the whole system.

       Our approach, in contrast, allows us to explore several of the more contentious issues

associated with research funding. Specifically, we shed light on the arguments of some scholars

who, noting the variability in the amount of profit that can be appropriated from inventive

activity (see Romer 1990 and Maurer and Scotchmer, 2004), raise concerns that private funding

may be concentrated amongst highly appropriable projects. Others claim that blanket public

support may also fail to select the most socially valuable projects, and more sophisticated

mechanisms should be employed to screen projects and also to ensure quality.

       This paper highlights a number of critical trade-offs that public funders must confront

when supporting research projects. Our chief finding is a surprising one; even in the absence of

public funding, many projects with high scientific merit and immediate applications will indeed

be funded and, in fact, disclosed in an open manner. Public support, offered with conditions

attached that shape commercialization (e.g., patents), will not be attractive to projects that are

commercially valuable, and so a natural screen occurs. However, unrestricted public funds will

ensure that those projects will take public funding thus leading to fewer projects funded overall

without consequent gains in openness. This has implications as to the way funding
                                                                                                 64

organizations should think about the conditions they impose. Even where their support is

directed towards projects with high scientific value, the funder’s choice of disclosure

requirements and commercialization restrictions affect the portfolio of projects that will be

attracted by the support. Research scientists often have a range of funding choices, including

private sector support, and this contours the final set of projects available to and selected by the

public sector. Specifically, we noted that while lifting commercialization restrictions may

increase the number of projects with immediate application to seek public funds, this comes at

the expense of projects that might both have been privately funded and, in even in that

environment, generated high levels of disclosure. The end result may be a significant crowding

out effect, with limited gains in terms of the quality of scientific discourse and disclosure.

       Supporting this notion, we observed that, while public funding organizations have paid

attention to the impact of funding conditions on the outcomes of specific projects they fund,

very little attention is paid to broader outcomes on the innovation system per se. Our survey

notes that selection criteria tend to have common claims based on measurable scientific

outcomes across funding organizations but are less explicit in their acknowledgement of wider

impacts. In contrast, the growing not-for-profit foundation sector, in an attempt to differentiate

themselves from purely public funders, has increased their emphasis on social impact. The

broad implications of this transformation are not yet understood, nor do we have the systematic

information we need to assess the influence of foundations on the public-private R&D complex.

We noted also that disclosure requirements, while acknowledged, were not necessarily a key

condition of funding, although they may play a role in reputational mechanisms to ensure future

grants. This trend is changing in the context of foundations that are also becoming more

aggressive regarding their disclosure and commercialization conditions but work within a
                                                                                                  65

limited framework of analysis in enforcing these requirements. Finally, we observed that

commercialization outcomes have been considered with explicit concern for conflicts of interest

as well as their effects in facilitating the diffusion of scientific ideas. However, little attention

has been paid to whether these restrictions have adversely affected the distribution of public

funds or generated real improvements overall in the openness in science.

       These concerns suggest the need for future research to understand these trade-offs. In

our opinion, future research should be directed at the following questions:

   1. How do stated selection and disclosure criteria translate into realized selection and

       disclosure outcomes? There is a need to examine the mix of projects actually funded by

       public organizations and to see where, in fact, they lie along the scientific

       merit/immediate application space as identified by Stokes (1997). In addition, are there

       indeed systematic differences in the level of disclosure achieved in this space

       conditioned on the source of funding (private vs public)?

   2. Do changes in commercialization opportunities affect the mix of projects funded and

       their level of disclosure? Taking, for example, the Bayh-Dole Act as an experiment, what

       was the impact of this reform on the mix of projects claiming public funds? Did projects

       that might have otherwise been privately funded end up involving higher levels of

       disclosure through academic routes?

   3. How do scientists actually match their desired research projects to particular funding

       sources? Our model has identified the key role that scientists play in shaping the demand

       for research funding associated with different terms and conditions. They also shape

       their particular projects to meet the selection criteria at hand from different funders. To

       date, however, our analysis of research funding has focused almost exclusively on the
                                                                                                 66

       supply-side, with little or no insight into demand-side issues.

   4. Do mechanisms such as matching grants, university-industry alliance funding or other

       joint mechanisms reduce crowding out while promoting high level of scientific

       openness? Matching grants are designed to allow self-selection away from projects that

       might be inefficiently funded. However, they increase the need for commercial returns

       in order to be viable. Such motivations may conflict with goals of scientific openness.

   5. Do open licensing requirements stimulate scientific openness? The paper identifies a

       complementarity between the strength and effectiveness of intellectual property

       protection and commercial interests to permit scientific disclosure. Open licensing

       requirements may promote greater use of scientific outputs, but at the same time they

       weaken intellectual property protection’s role in facilitating scientific openness. In an

       area where open licensing emerged as a new requirement, this would provide an

       empirical environment to test such claims.

   6. Do foundations play a complementary role in the research-funding complex? How does

       their stated social mission interact with their emphasis on funding projects of high

       scientific merit? This paper provides a framework within which to analyze the

       implications of foundations’ growing commitment to rapid and full disclosure,

       alternative commercialization rights and public-private collaborations.

These questions are central to analyzing the effectiveness of current mechanisms and processes

attached to public funding of research and development. As noted in the introduction,

significant, ongoing and unresolved issues remain in the arena of the public support of science

with regard to the efficiency whereby capital funds are directed. We believe that this agenda is

necessary for understand some of the new trade-offs explored in this paper.
