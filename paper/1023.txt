         Observations on the Indexation of Old Age Pensions



                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper examines some positive and normative aspects of the

inflation indexation of public and private pensions. The analysis shows

that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual

patterns of risk bearing than is usually thought to be the case. In so far

as inflation indexing has real effects, there is no presumption that they

are beneficial. In particular, the pre—commitment aspects of public

indexing may not be efficient. There are sound reasons to believe

that voluntarily agreed on, non—indexed private pensions may well be

efficient.   Non—indexed pensions may result in an efficient allocation

of risks given the other assets and liabilities of pension issuers and

beneficiaries. In this case, indexation would impede the efficient

allocation of risks. In this paper is also developed an ICOLI (interteinporal

cost of living index) which is superior to conventional price indices

as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being, associated with

changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant implications

for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets should

be held in pension portfolios.

     A major issue in the design of both public and private pension plans

involves the inilexation of benefits to price level changes. A major purported

virtue of current public pensions in the United States is that they provide an

asset with a fixed rel return. This is regarded as important because of the

absence of an indexed bond market. It is frequently alleged that the failure to

provide indexed benefits is a major weakness of standard private pension

arrangements. These views have influenced the recomendations of groups such as

the President's Commission on Pension Policy (1980) and the Advisory Council on

Social Security (1979). Both these groups, without detailed argument, strongly

endorse the indexation of Social Security Benefits.

     Serious   consideration of issues regarding indexation requires the careful
specification of an alternative to indexing. It is clearly naive to suppose
that Social Security benefit levels would never be adjusted in the absence of
indexation, or that real benefits would never be adjusted in the presence of

indexing. It also requires recognition of three fundamental principles of

modern finance. First, as exeiclified by the Modigliani—Miller theorem,

repackaging risk does not make it go away. Provisions which insure pension

recipients against some risks impose these same risks on the bearers of pension

liabilities. Second, risk associated with an asset cannot 'be measured in isola-

tion but depends on the covariance of its return with other economic events.

Third, the consumers' objective is to reduce total risk, not to insulate them-

selves completely from arr   one source of   uncertainty.   While these principles

are widely recognized, they have not informed nny previous analyses of pension

policy.

     This paper examines soi positive and normative aspects of the inflation

indexation of public and private pensions. A major conclusion of the analysis

is that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual

patterns   of risk bearing than is usually thought        to be   the case. In so far as

inflation indexing has real effects, there is no presumption that they are bene—

ficial. In particular, the pre—coarnitnent aspects of public indexing may not

be    efficient.           There are sound reasons    to believe that voluntarily agreed

on,   non—indexed private pensions may well be efficient. Non—indexed pensions
may result in      an efficient allocation of risks given the other assets and liabi-

lities of pension issuers and beneficiaries. Th this case, indexation would

impede the efficient allocation of risks.

       Discussions of indexation in most contexts invariably focus only on irifla—

tion indexation. The reasons for this           narrow focus are not clear. Consumers'
objective' is      to   minimize uncertainty about their well being not just to be   free

from inflation risk. It is certainly possible to. imagine indexing public or
private benefit levels to variables other than price indices. In this paper I
develop    an ICOLI (interteioral cost of living index) which is superior to con-

ventional price indices as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being,

associated with changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant

implications for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets

should be held in pension portfolios.

       The plan of the paper is as follows. The firstsection analyzes the infla-

tion indexation of public old age pensions. Under standard assumptions of

either complete legislative discretion, or perfect capital markets, there will

be no real effects arising frora the indexation of Social Security benefits. If

enough imperfections are introduced for indexation to have real effects, there

is no presumption         that they will be   desirable. I argue that in the context of

public pensions, indexation should be thought of primarily as a kind of                real

of holding down the size of the program.

pensions. Because of the non—coercive nature of private pensions, there are

effects. Once imperfections of a kind which permit indexing to have real

optimal. Indeed, some crude empirical calculations suggest that fixing

benefit levels may result in efficient risk sharing.

       The third section of the paper extends the analysis by considering the

possibility of indexing pensions benefits

of greater importance than inflation. A major source of uncertainty comes from

here focuses on the effects of changing the size of the program in resp3flSe to

changes in the price level. The issue of indexing in the design of benefit for—

mulae is not considered.l

        Since 1912, the Social Security program has in some sense been indexed to

the price level.2 The indexation scheme initially enacted was conceptually

flawed, and led benefits to rise much more rapidly than prices.           The error was

repaired in new legislation in 1917, which has been gradually phased in. At present,

benefits for current recipients are indexed on an annual basis.           In July

of each year, benefits are increased by the annual rate of CPI inflation over the
preceding 12 months. Several advisory groups including most recently, the
President's      Commission on Pension Policy have recorunended that the frequency of

benefit adjustientS be increased.

        The    arguments in   favor of indexing the level of public pension benefits do

not   appear to be very well developed. The        argument   seems to be that indexing
benefit levels provides insurance for beneficiaries agains. the effects of
inflation. Little attention is given to the possibility that this insurance can

 of  alternative indexing arrangements for the risk characteristics of tax liabi—
 lities are not considered. Without considering these facets of the problem, it
 is impossible to evaluate the merits of indexing public pension benefits.
      For clarity it is useful to consider the necessary conditions for indexing
 benefits to have any real effects at all. This is most easily done recognizing

bonds and nominal bonds exist indexip arraents will have no real efs

even if benefits can be usted               onhl
       The first proposition is obvious once stated. Regardless of indexing

arrangements, real benefits will be set at their desired level at each instant.

The form of indexing arrangement will affect whether benefit changes are or are

not necessary, and their magnitudes, but will have no impact on real benefit levels. -

A similar argument suggests that in a competitive spot labor market, indexing

in wage contracts will have no real consequences. This proposition establishes

that a necessary condition for indexation to have real effects is that benefits

can only be adjusted periodically or that some types of legislated benefit

adjustments     (i.e.,   real benefit cuts) are not permitted. These possibilities

are   considered below.
       The second proposition is equivalent to the Modigliani-4liller theorems for

indexed bonds proved by Liviatan and Levhari (1977). It can be demonstrated as

follows. Assume that a consumer has wealth W0, which he allocates to consump-

tion and various portfolio assets in order to maximize


           E U (C,WT) s.t. WT          Z(l+r1)A + B                                           (1)



where C is consumption, WT is terminal wealth, r1 is the real return on asset i,

A1 15 investment in asset i, and B represents real social security benefits

which may be uncertain. Suppose for concreteness that asset 1 is the ris)cless

indexed bond, and asset 2 is an otherwise riskiess nominal bond. Then, when
                                          —6—




benefits are indexed, in order for them to have the same real value,         the con-

dition Bnom B•eal(1+r2)/(l+rl) must hold.3 Now supposing that this condition

does hold, consider any feasible allocation (c,A) when Social Security is not

indexed. The sarie terminal wealth distribution can be obtained, if Social

Security is indexed by taking A1 =   Al   —                       2 +                 and
                                              Breai/(l+r),   A2         Breai/(1+r)
making no other portfolio chanes. A similar argument can be used to show that

switching from indexed to non—indexed benefits does not chance the feasible set.

It follows that indexing has no real effects under the stated conditions. The

argument could be extended to consider taxpayers' behavior and show that

indexing   has no general equilibrii effects.
    This    proposition is clearly not literally applicable to the real world

since indexed bonds do not exist. However it is an open question whether or not

portfolios of   assets with near constant real returns can be forid. If so the
irrelevance   proposition here will continue to hold. Even in the absence of
indexed bonds, or the capacity to manufacture them from existing assets, indivi—
duals can   undo the effects of non—indexation by borrowing to purchase real

durable assets. Thus it seems likely that at least to the extent that indivi—

duals have access to the capital markets, they can negate many of the effects of

indexing   arrangements.
     The preceding discussion demonstrates that capital market imperfections in

conjunction with rigidities in adjusting benefit levels are a

necessary condition for indexation to have real effects. We now consider the

case where individuals have no access to indexed bonds or arr close

substitute and where benefits are subject to infrequent adjustment.

            Indexation   as Insurance

            If a program can be legislatively modified only      infrequently,     indexation

    of benefits will provide insurance against unexpected developments between

    legislative adjustments. The'       oportance    of this insurance depends on the amount

    of unexpected variation in the price level which takes place between legislative

    adjustments. Table 1 reproduces a chronolor of legislative changes in Social

    Security      Benefit foruulae. It is clear from the table that benefit adjustments
    are very common occuring on average every four years. It is useful to get an
    idea of how far out of line benefits can be over intervals of this length. The
    likely error in forecasts of the average price level over vario1s horizons can
    easily be estiizated. Forecasts based on estimates of expected inflation were
    generated by applying an     AFJA (i,i) process     to annual rates of   CPI   inflation for
    the    l9L7_l975 period. The root mean square forecast error rises from 1.1 per— -

    cent with a one year horizon to 14.2 percent with a five year horizon. These
    numbers do not suggest      that indexation mitigates an otherwise important source
    of    uncertainty and may seem surprisingly small. Suppose however that one
-

    misestirnated the annual inflation rate over a 5 year period by three percent,
    the   average error in estimates of the    price level would    only be T.5 percent.
            For   two reasons, even these figures overstate the importance of any real
    uncertainties generated by the nonindexation of benefits. First, the timing of
    benefit readjustments is endogencus. When the price level innovation is large,
    adjustment of benefits can be accelerated. This means that one is unlikely to

    observe large undesired changes in real benefit levels. Second, and more impor-

    tantly, benefit adjustments can take account of losses or gains suffered during

    thepreceding period. For simplicity assume that the target level of real
    benefits is a constant B. Now assume that benefits are adjusted each period.

Then suppose that in each period benefits are set to satisfy the

expression:

       E(Bt) = B +   (l+r) (Bti   - E(B+1))                                      (2)

That is the uncertainty in the present value of benefits received by an indivi—

dual, the second terra is (3), is much smaller than the uncertainty associated

with benefits in any given year.

       Assuming that individuals have a capacity to borrow and lend at the interest

rate r, in Equation (2), the reduction in lifetirre risk due to indexing is

clearly negligable. Soire data on the financial position of the elderly are pre—

sented below. They show that most possess at least a small amount of liquid

assets. That is all that would be necessary to buffer any fluctuations in real

income due to unexpected changes in the price level. Even for individuals with

no access to the capital market, there is some marn for interteoral substi-

tution   in the timing of the purchases of durable goods. It   thus seens unlikely
that the length of the adjustment period constitutes any significa-t arumerit
for indexation. The data in Table 2 certainly suggest that there as been no
reduction in the variance in real benefit levels in the post 1912 -eriod when
Social Security was indexed. Admittedly this evidence is difficuL-. to interpret
because there has been an upward drift in benefit levels.

Note: Earnings record for average-earnings individual is the annualized average
wage for all workers in the first quarter of the particular years. Earnings record
for low-earnings individual is $3,200 for 1974; for other years, it is the same
ratio to the earnings of the average-earnings individual as prevailed in 1974
(namely, 39.8%).
Note:  The lower ratios for the average-earnings individual than for the
Inaxirnum-earnings one in 1963-66 result from the fact that, because the
maximum taxable earnings base remained unchanged in 1959-65, the former had
almost the same "final" earnings as the latter, but had significantly lower
"career" earnings.

 interest      groups. One plausible explanation of how   indexation   can have inortant
effects    comes from viewing it   as a form of pre—cornmitaent. The governrent is

committed      because of political constraints to maintain the level of benefits,
however they are denominated. If benefits are indexed, th cannot be cut in
real    terms. If not indexed, they cannot be cut in nominal terms.        This distinc—
tion is    frequently cited in discussions of tax bracket indexing as well as
Social    Security indexing. It may be the result    of   any political process in
which it is difficult to enact legislation, because more than a majority is

required, or the problems of consensus building among diverse constituencies.

In this situation, it is possible to reduce real benefit levels through infla-

tion erosion, and inaction but not through actual legislation. Thus the main

effect    of indexation may be to pre—commit to a minimum fixed real benefit level.
        At first, it may seem as if such a policy should be favored by advocates of
a   larger Social Security system. Indexation does prevent reductions in        real
benefit    levels through inflation. Upon reflection however, the situation is

more complex. The optiim level of real benefits legislated will in general

be lower if a constraint is imposed precluding future benefit reductions. The

nature of the ambiguity can be highlighted in the context of a highly stylized

model.

     Suppose that optiiim level of benefits in period t is given by X where
X is distribited uniformly on the unit interval and is serially uncorrelated.
Assume also that the regret associated with setting a benefit level B in period t is
given    by:


       R(B,X) =   X—B      if    B < X                                               (4)

                                             —10—




 Let   policy makers design the Social Security sche to minimize the present

 value of future regrets. That is they choose a sequence of values B5 in each

 period to minimize:




                            L    = E   E R(B-X)'         /                            (5)

                                       t   S




 In the case where there is no precorrimitziient problem, the optical strate is
 clearly to set B5 = X in each period and have zero regret. Note that when this
 strater is followed, the mean level of benefits is X = .5.
       Now consider the optirrEl strate when benefits can never be cut. It is

 immediately obvious that it will never be desirable to set B5 >         X.   However it
 may be desirable to set B5 <    X.        This may be seen as follows. Let L(B) be the

 expected   regret if the optimal strater is pursued, given that benefits are
 constrained to be greater than B in all remaining periods. Then it follows imme—
• diately that if X <     that the optimal strater is to set B5 =         !. If X >
 the   optimal strater is to set B =           or   to satisfy the first order condition:

                             —                      =o                                 (6)

 if   the value of B5 satisfying this first order condition is less than X. The

 first order condition (6) states that the marginal gain from increasing benefits

 in the current period, must equal the marginal cost from imposing tighter

 constraints in future periods. The first order condition (6) does not provide

 a basis for computing the optiuiim level of Bj,, since the form of the function

 L(B) is unknown.

         However it is possible to characterize the stochastic steady state when the

 optimal strater is pursued. This ray be done as follows. The optimum feasible

 strater at time s is given by some              function   B5 =r(B5,x5) which is clearly
 monotone increasin in X5. The maxirrum attainable value of X5 will be given by

            which as shown below does not depend on B.             It is clear that ultimately
 the value of
                        must approach this limit. The steady state may        then   be charac—

terized by solving for f(Bl).

       Equatjo0 (6) reveals that the optimum choice of B* does not depend on B.

It can be solved easily in this case. SuppDse f(B,l) = B*.                 Then in   all   future

periods    B = B*.      If X < B*, the "no—cut constraint" insures this equality.
If X > Bt the equality is insured by the nonotonicity of the function f(B,x).
This means that it        is   easy to evaluate f(B*). It is given by:
                    t                rR(B*)1
                                                                                              (7)
                0

Differentiating () and using (6) yields the first order condition:

            1 -          (B*(1+a)a)       =
                                                                                              (8)

It   follows that B* is given by:


            B* =               +                                                              ()
                    (l+a)          l+a


      Several inferences can be drawn from equation (9). Note first the steady

state level of benefits B* can be greater or less than the expected benefit level

when full    discretion     is maintained. By       choosing   appropriate parameter values
in (9)   any   level of B may        be   found to be optixial. As the value of the discount

factor 13, increases, the level of benefits declines. This is because when the
                                        —12—



future   counts more   highly, the cost of constraining one's policy   choices is
more severe. As one would expect, increases in the value of a also reduce the

steady state value of B.

      The stylized model here illustrates an obvious principle that cutting off

one's options is undesirable, and a more subtle one that irposing a "no—cut"

constraint on a prorain ray reduce its exjected funding level. Obviously, the

model would acco;aodate a number of extensions. But it seems unlikely that these
qualitative results would be upset by introducing factors such as an upward
drift in the expected desired level of funding     X5 or allowing   it to be serially
correlated.

       It is difficult to assess the relevance of the effects stressed here.
Certainly the current policy debate on Social Security rakes it plausible that
the program would be cut in real terms, if this were     possible without legisla-

tive action. This suggests the importance of the pre—comit:ent aspect of

indexation stressed here. The failure of Congress to rescind double indexing's

effects strongly supports the importance of pre—cornnitment effects. Whether or

not "no cut" comrriitments   have the restraining effects on spending suggested here
is   more   problematic.

II.    InflatiorIndexation     and_Private_Pensions

       There are at least two important indexatiori issues in connection i.ith

defined   benefit private pensions. First, there is the question of indexing
benefits for persons who are already      retired.    At the present time, most private
pensions in the      United States provide beneficiaries with level noidnal

annuities. While adjustments       are sometimes made for the effects of inflation,
these   are rare and relatively small. A second issue is in the calculation of

benefits. At present, in most plans, workers' vested benefits are        a fraction
which   depends on years of service and their current salaries.       Actual benefits

received   from a firm depend on a worker's final year salary at that firm. These

two aspects of pension indexation are considered separately below.


        Indexed   etirement Benefits
     It is widely believed that private pensions should offer indexed retireiient
benefits. For example, the President's Commission on Pension Policy (1980)
 •••    encourages private and state and local pension plans to provide some form
of inflation protection for retirees." The failure of         private pensions to offer
indexed options is a puzzle. Feldstein (1981)         suggests the developcient °'

indexed pensions would not have been desirable because workers already had a

substantial       degree of inflation protection from Social Security. His analysis

assumes that the capital market coiensates individuals for bearing inflation

risk. The basis for this supposition is not at all clear. Both the issuers

and holders of nominal instruments bear risk from inflation uncertainty. There

is    no obvious reason why the holders rather than issuers of nominal instruments
should be compensated for bearing this risk. Indeed, the fact that mean
                                         —1)4 —




realized returns    bonds and bills have been essentially zero over the last 50
years tends to suggest that the capital market does not compensate individuals
for 'bearing   inflation i-isk.

      Atthe outset, it is useful to consider as a benchmark the special case of
a perfect capital market, in the presence of a safe real asset, and unchanging
opportunity    sets for investors. In this    case all individuals in equilibrium
will hold some combination of the safe asset and the market portfolio. There is
no optical degree of pension indexing; any form of pension asset is as good as any

other. If a firm issues safe real pensions, it will find that its shareholders
hedge by purchasing the safe asset. Its pension beneficiaries draw down their
holdings of the safe asset and switch their portfolios towards more risky
assets.     The form of the pension 'benefit is a ritter of irrelevance. This
theorem can clearly be     proven under much more general assumptions, similar to

those   that have 'been used to provide proofs    of the gener1ized odigliani-44iller

theorems.      In order to find arr effects of alternative indexing arrangements,    it
is   necessary to introduce some capital market     imperfections.

        The natural imperfection to introduce is a restriction on short sales.      This

has at least two potentially important effects. First, it may be impossible for

individuals to undo the     effects of their pension plan. In     general, this would

require    drawing do.rn or selling short their assets held by their pension funds.
This consideration, taken'by itself would tend to suggest that efficient private
pension arrahgenients would make benefit levels contingent on the returns on
widely traded assets. Second, in general it        will   be iiiossible for all indivi-
duals to hold the market portfolio. Because of moral hazards, individuals are

 likely to be locked into holding much more of their wealth in the form of their

 own homes and human capital, than would be included in fully        diversified port—
                                       —15--



 folios. This suggests that they would prefer their pension assets to have

 returns that are negatively correlated with the returns on assets that they are

 locked into holding.   -




      Hurd and Shoven (1982) assess the vulnerability of the portfolio of assets

held by the elderly to the effects of inflation.    They conclude +.hat even when
nominal   pensions are included, the aged are for the most part well hedged
against unexpected inflation. It is likely that their results understate the
extent to which the aged are protected from inflation. A very sizable fraction
of the wealth of the aged is represented by the gross value of their homes.
Both economic theory and empirical evidence, (Sumrers (198la,)poterba (1981))
suggest   that owner occupied housing prices should rise much more than point for

point with unexpected inflation. This inference is supported by the recent

sharp decline in real house prices.

     These factors suggest that nominal pension liabilities may in fact reduce

the real uncertainties associated with the wealth position of the aged. Of

course efficient pension arrar€emnt cannot be discussed without also con-

sidering the risks borne by corporate shareowners. This aspect of the problem

is considered below, after a discussion of the role of indexation in vesting

provisions.

     Indexed Vesting Provisions

     Bulow (1982) has made the   important observation that in   a competitive   labor
market a worker's marginal product in each period should equal the sum of his
wage and his accrual of vested pension benefits. More generally, his argument
suggests that   some set of market forces determine an optimal time path for com-

pensatiori. This optimal compensation path will in general be independent

of what pension arrangements are made. If pension benefits are vested in nomi—
                                       -16—



nal terms, they represent a nominal asset to workers, and nominal liability to

firms. If the rate of inflation rises, the value of the worker's already

accrued pension asset declines. There is no reason why this should be asso—

ciated with higher subsequent compensation anymore than one would expect

workers' coiripensation to be increased just because other parts of their port-

folio performed 'badly.

     The common argument that pensions are effectively indexed during the

accrual phase, because benefits are tied to final year salaries, is as Bulow

points out, wrong. It ignores the fact that wages and pension accruals are

determined jointly. Market forces determine a path of total corupensation not a

path of waes. If inflation increases, and pension rules remain static, so that

the rate of growth of pension accruals increases, the rate of wage growth will

decline.

     Thus under current institutional arrangents, pension wealth is a nominal

asset for all workers, not just those who have already retired. At current

high rates.of interest, the value of the asset is likely to 'be small for most

young workers. As just emphasized we should not expect the non—indexation of

vested benefits to have any effect on the path of compensation. Hence there is
no reason to expect that indexing pensions would have ar effects on      patterns of
labor turnover or allocative efficiency. Again by the same arguments made

above, in a perfect capital market indexation would have no real effects.

     Table   3 presents some evidence on the balance sheets of different age
groups.    The data su,ggest that the younger part of   the population is likely to
be even better hedged against inflation than the aged. This inference is
strengthened by the observation that the "net hoire" iteu in Table 3 is likely to

involve   much more offsetting gross ho::e value and mort.age debt for younger
households. This implies that the provision of nominal pensions is unlikely to
impose serious risks on young workers.

       Risk_Bear inyrms
       The question which remains to be examined is the impact of alternative pension
irdexing arranerents on the risks borne by the u1tirate cwners of pension
liabilities. The proximate owners are corporation. The ultiate owners are
mainly corporate shareowners, but also other corporate creditors, and taxpayers
through the PBGC. Given capital market imperfections, it is reasonable to
expect that corporate s'nareowners will be less well hedged against inflation
than   will pension beneficiaries. Data in Blume, Crockett and Friend (19714) con-

firm that ownership of   corporate stock is concentrated anng the very affluent. Hurd
and Shoven report that inflation vulnerability increases with affluence. This
inference   is strongly confirid by      the data in Table 4 on the composition of
wealth    by income class. The   share   of liquid   assets and investnent assets
(mainly stocks and bonds) rises sharply with income.
         The same point may be made more directly. Despite the fact that pension
liabilities are nominal, corporate equity returns are systematically negatively
related to unexpected inflation. In Summers (1981b) I sho, that this is quite
consistent with rationality on the part of investors. A one percent increase in
the permanent rate of expected inflation is estimated to reduce the present
value of real cash flows to shareholders by 3.146 percent, due to tax effects.
This calculation does not take arv account        of pension obligations. Since in

most cases pension plans are overfunded, taking         account of pension   assets and

liabilities   would increase the estimated negative effect of inflation. If firms

offered indexed pensions, the negative effect would be increased still further.
      The discussion in this section suests that the failure of the private
market to develop inflation indexed pensions is not surprising. In a perfect
capital market, indexation arraneitnts would have no real effects. If capital
markets   are imperfect, one would expect arrangements to evolve which lead to the

sharing of otherwise undiversifiable risks. The holders of pension assets

appear to be positioned so that they gain from unexpected inflation. The cor—
porations which issue pension liabiities appear because of a non—irdexed tax

system   to be in the position of nominal creditors. This means that efficient

risk sharing calls for the issuance of nominal pension liabilities. It is

interesting to note that similar considerations can explain why indexed bonds

have not been issued.

 I II. In exin     to Other rates
    Almost all p-actically oriented discussions of indexation focus on indexing
benefits to the general price level. The motivation for this choice is rarely
clearly specified.      The implicit argument for price level indexation   seen   to   be

that this provides full insurance because real benefit levels are guaranteed.

To state this arguinnt is to realize its limitatIons. Presumably, we care about

the real standard of living of pension and Social Security beneficiaries, rather

than their benefit levels from the prograrrs. Only for individuals wholly sup-

ported by a given nonadjustable program is there a potential argument for

inflation indexation of benefit levels. The discussion in the precedin section

made the point that insuring program benefit levels may actually increase the

risk borne by beneficiaries if benefits would     otherwise   have covaried negative-
ly with the assets in beneficiaries' portfolios.

     This   raises the more general point, that if the   goal is to provide
insurance to beneficiaries, it will in general be desirable to link changes in
benefits to changes in the opportunity set faced by consumers. Benefits should
be varied so as to play the role of the hedge portfolios in Merton's (1913)
Intertemporal     Capital Asset Pricing Model. Of course, the qualifications

suggested in preceding sections abcxit whether indexing can have any real effects

apply equally in this context. Similarly the cost of ar insurance is that the

insured   risks   are foisted on the holders of pension liabilities.

    These   points may be illustrated in a more formal way. Consider the problem
of the representative aged consumer. For simplicity, I assume that the horizon
is known with certainty, and that future prices are known with certainty, so
that there exists a safe real asset. The consumer's probln is to:
                                                 -20—

where A represents          assets, B represents benefits, and i is the nominal interest

rate. This problem           gives rise to     an indirect utility function of the form:



        U =   V(At,j,pt     •.••PT,        ....)                                               (11)


It   is not difficult to verify that the •indirect utility function (II) is hoinoge—

neous of degree 0 in A and the vectors P and B. If for simplicity it is
assumed that the rate of inflation is constant, (ii:) can be rewritten as:

                                                                                                   (12)
                    U =
                          H(--,
                                  -   H,   b       .bT)



where i       is   the rate of inflation and the lower case values of B represent real

benefit levels. It is inrnediately apparent from (12) that chances in the rate

of inflation will not affect the attainable level of utility only if (i) they do

not affect real benefit levels, Bt, (ii) thej leave the real interest rate t —

 Itt,   unaffected and (iii) they have no effect on real wealth. Conventional

indexing schemes are directed at insuring that the first of these conditions is

met. The discussion in the preceding section considered the implications of the

fact that (iii)is unlikely to be satisfied. The analysis here however suggests

that indexing if it is to insure beneficiaries' standard of living must take

account of all changes in real wealth, and in the real interest rate.

         The effect of changes in the real            interest   rate is of particular interest.
                                            —21--




Conventional price indices try     to   measure   the change from period to period in
the cost of attaining some level of utility. Norm.lly, this is done by finding

the change in the purchase price of a fixed bundle of goods. The logic of this

procedure is not clear once one recognizes that consumers "spendt' most of their

income   on future consumption. If the price of a washing machine goes down a
consumer is usually though better off. Has he not also gained if the price in
terms of today's dollars of     the   bundle he plans to buy next period goes down?
This   suggests   that in evaluating the welfare of the aged some sort of inter—

temporal price index should be emplqred.

       There is another way of looking at the problem which leads to a similar

conclusion. Consider an indivióial who desires a constant real consumption

stream, and holds all his wealth in the form of an indexed real annuity. Such

an individual is exposed to no real risk since his annuity payments exactly

match his consumption streams However if' real interest rates fluctuate, the

market value of such a real annuity will vary. The asset will appear risky when

risk is measurable in the standard way. This paradox is easily resolved. When

real interest rates rise, the value of the annuity declines and the price of
future consumption also falls. The value of the annuity measured relative to a
proper interterrrporal cost of living index (as described below) remains con-
stant. Notice that the same analysis could be applied to the situation of' an
individual who owns his home which fluctuates in value as the real interest rate
changes.
         POllak   (1975) shows how the standard theory    of   cost of living indicies can
be extended    to intertemporal case. The goal here is more modest. In an effort
to   illustrate the potential importance of changes in the real interest rate, I
                                              —22—




calculate       altrr]ative estii:ates of a Laspyres intertetporal cost of living
index. The assumed market basket is a constant stream of real consumption over
a 10 year period. The purchase price of such a real annuity Is given by:

                          =
                              Pt(lt)                                                     (13)

where     rt is the real interest rate at time t, and T is the annuity horizon. The
change     in the interteinporal cost of living index is given by:


                                                 _rT
                          pA = O/ p + o                                                  (14)
                                   t            rt
The     first term in (14 )   corresponds   to the ordinary inflation rate. The second
corresponds to the change in the price of             future consumption.

         The   major problex.a in esticating the intertcnpora1 price index given in
(13 )    is measuring the long term real interest rate. In the enirical work
reported       below, the actual ex-post rates of      inflation were used in calculating
the     long term real interest rate. For periods after 1981, when actual Inflation

data were unavailable, expected inflation as measured in the Livingston Survey

was used. This data Is described In Carison (1977).               Obvioxsly,   the use of such

a perfect foresight inflation measure is somewhat problematic. Preliminary

investigations using the econometric measures of expected inflation developed

In Sunirs (1981a) reached qualitatively similar conclusions.

        Estimates of the percentage change in the interteioral cost of living

index    are shown in    Table 5   along   with the rate of CPI inflation. It is clear

that movements in real interest rates are an important element affecting the

interteraporal index. In the three years             when CPI inflation was    greatest, l971,

1978, and 1979, the interte:.iporal index showed only very small increases. This

was because tbe sharp increases in real interest rates reduced the price of

future consurption. Increasing real interest rates contributed —7.1% in     l97,
J4.7%    in 1918, and —6.% in 1979 to the interteinporal inflation rate. Overall,
the correlation between the rate of inflation as measured using the standard
CPI,    and   as measured using the interteuporal index was only .5.
These   crude calculations indicate the importance of aggregate factors
other than the price level which ::ay affect corsumers' well being.
        It is important to be clear abot the letate uses of an intertemporal
price index like the one developed here. The index provides a correct basis for
assessin the change in welfare for a given change in prices and interest rates
for an individual who has no future income streams. Even here there is a small
problem unless individuals are infinite lived, since the length of their horizon
is   changing. The more serious issue involves future incoies. It would be

appropriate to compare the present value of future incomes to the price index

developed     here.        be clear that in such a calculation, the effects of a
                      It should

change in the interest rate on the present value of future streams, and on the
price    of future consumption would work   in opposite directions. The adjustments
under    consideration will be important only when the duration of the individual's

future    consumption and income streams differ siiificantly. The data in Hurd
arid Shoven (1982) suggest that only about half of the wealth of the "young aged"
is in the form of future streams of income. This suggests that the price index
considered here is likely to be very relevant to assessing their well being.
    Once one conterx1ates the possibility of indexing benefits to a price index
of this general type, other possibilities suggest themselves. Why not also
index benefits to changes in real wealth which also change the opportunity set,
or to developients which affect future incoJe? Efforts to integrate private

pensions and Social Security represent one small step in this direction. Such

indexingschemes of córse involve the same issues of discretion and capital
market behavior. It does seem clear however that there is no strong logic which
suppDrts indexation of benefits to the current price level as against other
alternatives.
     A second implication of these results is that in iriaking portfolio choices
the aged should be concerned about real returns relative to an intertnporal
price index like that considered here. Assets should be more highly valued if
their returns are positively correlated vith the price of future consumption.

Iv.     r-)clusio

       The analysis in this paper supports three principal conclusions: First,

indexation   of both public and private pensions is likely to have only minor
effects on real economic behavior. The presence of provisions for discretionary
adjustment, and the workings of capital markets, suggest that indexation provi-
sions will be largely neutralized by other offsetting adjustments.
       Second, the effects of increased indexatiori may well be perverse. The pre—
commitment aspect of public indexing means that the ultirate effect of indexing

provisions may be to reduce the size of public pensions. The non—indexation of

private pensions probably represents efficient risk sharifl. It appears that

pension beneficiaries are much better hedged against inflation risks than are

the bearers of pension liabilities.

       Third, if insurance is the motivation for indexation proVisiOnS, there is no

reason why such provisions should be confined to inflation. Only under very

restrictive assumptions will inflation indexing provide full insurance. In par—

ticular an important source of exogenous uncertainty facing the aged involves

the price of future consumption. Changes in an estited interteiora1 cost of

living index diverge significantly from those in the conventional CPI.

       Pobert   Merton, in his contribution to this volume advocates a novel solu-
tion   tosome of the problems discussed here. He proposes that Social Security

benefits be indexed to the level of aggregate consumption. He argues that in

addition to providing inflation protection, such a plan would offer a form of

"standard of living" insurance. In      general, the level of   consumption is likely

to be a proxy for the opportunity set facing consumers. This notion is

justified formally in Merton (l9T3) and Breeden (1979).
       erton's proposed Social Security plan is self financing and requires only

very   infrequent adjustzrient. The self financing character of the plan reduces
substantially the precor-nitment problems stressed here. !erton's indexing
scheme provides for both   increases   and   decreases in benefit levels, so the "no
cut" constraint is unlikely to bind. It also implicitly Trakes benefit levels
depend on both the level of '.ealth and real rates of return.
       There are however a number of types of shocks which are likely to affect
real consumption but not optimal benefit levels. Triese include changes in the taste
for leisure, changes in demographic composition of the population, changes in
life   expectancy, and changes in the distribution of income. The Lportance of

these shocks relative to others causing fluctuations in aggreate consumption is

an empirical question. If they are significant, it may be preferable to desii

indices   based on estiriated changes in the opportunity set of the representative
aged consumer. The interteiporal cost of living index presented here represents
a   start in this direction.

1. Indexing in the desi&n of the benefit formula may well cause greater

horizontal equity.

2. While the discussion here focuses on Social Security, it is clearly appli-

cable to other public pensions such as those for Veterans and federal ei.lajees.

3. This condition is necessary. In order to meaninful1y talk about the

effects of indexation it must be assumed that benefit pac).'ages have equal value

in all cases.
