                                            ABSTRACT

We estimate the general-equilibrium labor market effects of a large-scale randomized intervention
in which we designed and marketed a rainfall index insurance product across three states in India.
Marketing agricultural insurance to both cultivators and to agricultural wage laborers allows us to
test a general-equilibrium model of wage determination in settings where households supplying labor
and households hiring labor face weather risk. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that
both labor demand and equilibrium wages become more rainfall sensitive when cultivators are offered
rainfall insurance, because insurance induces cultivators to switch to riskier, higher-yield production
methods. The same insurance contract offered to agricultural laborers smoothes wages across rainfall
states by inducing changes in labor supply. Policy simulations based on our estimates suggest that
selling insurance only to land-owning cultivators and precluding the landless from the insurance market
(which is the current regulatory practice in India and other developing countries), makes wage laborers
worse off relative to a situation where insurance does not exist at all.

1. Introduction

         Field experiments providing weather insurance to farmers find, consistent with economic

theory, that formerly uninsured farmers switch towards riskier, but higher-yield, crops and seed

varieties (Cole et al 2013b; Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2014), thus making agricultural output more

rainfall-sensitive (Karlan et al 2013; Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013). Those cultivators hire landless

laborers for harvest tasks, and changes in labor demand associated with cultivators’ risk-taking can

make wage rates more volatile. Insurance sales to cultivators can thus potentially worsen the welfare

of landless laborers – the poorest of the poor who presumably find it most difficult to manage risk,

and who make up a sizeable proportion of the world’s impoverished population. On the other

hand, if greater risk-taking by cultivators is associated with higher average yields, then average wages

may rise. To properly evaluate the welfare effects of introducing a formal insurance product in a

developing country, it is important to move beyond effects on the treated population, and determine

the general-equilibrium effects on both wage levels and the sensitivity of wages to rainfall variability.

         In this paper we examine the general-equilibrium labor market effects of a large-scale

randomized controlled trial (RCT) that marketed rainfall insurance to both landless and cultivating

households in rural India. Based on a simple model of the agricultural labor market, we estimate the

effects of insurance on agricultural labor supply, ex ante and ex post labor demand, and equilibrium

wages. The labor-market spillover effects on the landless are of direct policy relevance because in

India and other developing countries, agricultural insurance is explicitly targeted to only those with

an “insurable interest” – i.e., cultivators with land.1 Income of the landless is arguably even more

directly tied to rainfall2, and precluding the landless from the insurance market prevents the poorest

segment of society from using insurance to smooth fluctuations in wages. Further, our analysis

1 These products are regulated like conventional indemnity insurance, and the insurable interest requirement is typically
interpreted as a cultivation requirement for agricultural insurance.
2 Heterogeneity in land and landowner characteristics introduce some idiosyncratic component of risk for cultivators,

whereas all agricultural laborers of the same gender face the same wage rate .

                                                                                                                            1
shows that selling insurance only to cultivators makes the landless worse off via general-equilibrium

wage effects, compared to a regime of no insurance.3

         Our research contributes to a burgeoning literature on the effects of insurance marketed

through RCT’s4 by tracking the labor market spillovers of such interventions using a general

equilibrium model. General-equilibrium effects are important to consider for other interventions

being tested using RCT’s in the large and expanding program evaluation literature (Heckman 1991;

Rodrik 2009). For example, providing better education and training opportunities to large numbers

of beneficiaries (Banerjee et al. 2007; Blattman et al. forthcoming) may change skilled wages,

providing migration opportunities (Bryan et al. 2013) may change wages at the destination, and

providing livestock assets (Bandiera et al 2013) or access to credit (Karlan and Zinman 2010;

Banerjee et al 2013) may affect market prices. Comprehensive evaluation of development programs

requires a full accounting of these general-equilibrium changes, especially if we are interested in

assessing how effective an intervention will be when it is scaled up (Acemoglu 2010)

         Our study is the first to analyze the aggregate, general equilibrium effects of any

experimental intervention on both average wages and its volatility. Furthermore, we present

experimental evidence on the labor demand and supply mechanisms by which these wage-effects are

realized. A few studies have considered spillovers effects of interventions on the non-treated

(Miguel and Kremer 2004, Angelucci and DeGiorgi 2009, Crepon et al 2012), others have examined

peer effects in technology adoption (Kremer and Miguel 2007, Oster and Thornton 2012, Miller and

Mobarak 2013), and yet others have tracked political economy responses to interventions (Bold et al

2012, Guiteras and Mobarak 2013). But these spillover effects are mostly related to non-market
3
  We marketed rainfall index insurance (a contract which pays out if the monsoon is delayed) to landless agricultural
wage workers, in addition to selling insurance to cultivators in the same villages. Our partnership with the Agricultural
Insurance Company of India (AICI), the largest state insurer, allowed us to circumvent the regulatory restriction against
marketing insurance to agricultural laborers. We stratified the randomization by these two occupational groups in order
to study both the labor demand and the labor supply responses to insurance sales.

mechanisms, such as health externalities, direct transfers and information flows. Muralidharan and

Sundararaman’s (2013) experimental study of school vouchers in India estimates aggregate effects in

relevant markets, but does not estimate price or (teacher) wage effects. Our study is distinct because

the spillover effects we identify work through the aggregate effects of equilibrium price changes that

are the consequence of any scaled-up intervention.5

         Our research also contributes to the small but important literature on the determinants of

rural wages in developing countries. The relative dearth of literature on the determinants of the

price of labor can be traced back to “surplus labor” models from the 1960s (Lewis 1968; Ranis and

Fei 1961) which posited that wages are set institutionally, rather than through economic forces.

Important subsequent contributions to this literature include nutrition-based efficiency wage models

(Mazumdar 1959; DasGupta and Ray 1986), wage determination assuming complete markets

(Rosenzweig 1978), the role of imperfect credit markets on wage volatility (Jayachandran 2006), and

nominal wage rigidity with uninsured shocks (Kaur 2012). Our work in particular builds on that of

Jayachandran (2006), who was the first to show that market imperfections, in her case for credit,

have general-equilibrium effects on rural wage levels and volatility, working through labor supply

and migration channels. Here, we focus on uninsured risk and we test the model of risk and

insurance using variation derived entirely from a randomized field experiment large enough to detect

general-equilibrium effects.6 Use of randomized variation limits concerns about omitted variables

bias and other threats to identification. Further, our experimental design allows us to examine the

precise labor supply and labor demand mechanisms by which insurance affects wages.

  There are related non-experimental studies on general equilibrium effects of credit market imperfections on wages
(Jayachandran 2006) and on technology diffusion and price dispersion (Jensen 2007, Aker 2010).
6
  In our model, we assume complete credit markets to highlight the risk channel and later show that our empirical results
are robust to controlling for the effects of credit market imperfections, using the same set of proxies used in
Jayachandran (2006).

                                                                                                                       3
        Our model provides implications for the effects of insurance on the labor demand and

supply responses of cultivators and agricultural wage laborers who face rainfall risk, which in turn

affect wages in market equilibrium. The empirical tests are based on randomized offers of a rainfall

insurance contract to individual landless laborers and cultivators, random variation in the fractions of

cultivators or laborers in a village receiving offers, and random variation in the occurrence of

insurance payouts. We separately estimate a labor demand equation for landowning cultivators, a

labor supply equation for landless workers, and a general equilibrium wage equation. We use these

estimates to analyze changes in equilibrium wage profiles under three policy relevant scenarios: a)

when only cultivators are offered insurance, b) when both cultivators and laborers are targeted and

c) where only laborers are targeted with insurance marketing. These counterfactual policy

simulations are conducted within the bounds of our data because we have significant variation in

both the proportion of cultivators and the proportion of agricultural labor households who receive

insurance marketing across our sample villages. We generate cross-village variation in these variables

of interest through a two-step feature of our experimental design – we first randomly select a subset

of castes (with varying population sizes) in each village to receive insurance marketing, and then

offer random subsets of households within these castes rainfall insurance contracts.

        Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find that insured cultivators take more risk,

and labor demand therefore becomes more rainfall-sensitive. On the other hand, insured

agricultural wage workers supply less labor when insurance payouts occur. In villages that qualified

for a payout (i.e. where the monsoon was delayed), they are less likely to participate in the

agricultural labor market compared to the uninsured, and they supply fewer hours conditional on

participating. This implies that insuring a subset of wage workers indirectly insures other

(uninsured) wage workers in the village through the labor supply choices of the insured.




                                                                                                           4
        These labor demand and labor supply responses propagate through to general-equilibrium

wage effects. Agricultural wages become more sensitive to rainfall when a larger fraction of

cultivators in the village are offered insurance (the labor demand channel). Wages are also higher

when a larger fraction of households are offered insurance in villages that ultimately qualified for a

payout (the labor supply effect). Policy simulations based on our estimates suggest that landless

wage workers would be worse off if insurance were only marketed to cultivators, even relative to a case

where rainfall insurance is never introduced to anyone in the village at all. Symmetrically, marketing insurance

to landless workers helps smooth wages across rainfall realizations in villages where payouts occur

(inducing the labor supply response), which makes risk-averse cultivators worse off. The opposing

labor demand and labor supply effects evidently cancel each other when insurance is marketed to

both cultivators and wage workers in our simulation, and the net effect is a slight increase in wages

during periods of high rainfall.

        The next section presents the model of the agricultural labor market. A description of the

experimental design and a description of the data follows, after which we present the estimates of

the individual effects of insurance provision on labor demand and supply, aggregate effects on

equilibrium wages, and counterfactual policy simulations based on these estimates. Finally, we

discuss implications for policy and future research in a brief conclusion.



2. A Model of Insurance and the Agricultural Labor Market

        2.1      Landless labor households, labor supply and rainfall insurance

        To highlight the role of risk in determining equilibrium wages we set out a simple model of

the agricultural labor market. We consider two groups – cultivators, who own land and hire labor

but do not supply labor, and the landless, who supply labor to cultivators. In India the landless

almost never lease in land and cultivate. Smaller landowners who cultivate sometimes also supply


                                                                                                                   5
agricultural labor, and our main results are unaffected by allowing cultivators to also supply labor.

The key assumption is that cultivators are net hirers of labor. A second simplification is that we

ignore credit constraints in the model, so that the effects of risk are transparent.7 Cultivator and

landless households can save (at a fixed interest rate r) and borrow.

         We begin with the labor supply decision made by the landless. To focus on the role of risk,

we ignore the smoothing problem highlighted by Jayachandran (2006) and employ a one-period

labor-leisure model. Each landless household is endowed with non-earnings income m and one unit

of time. Utility functions are Cobb-Douglas in leisure h and consumption c :



         Rainfall       can be either low (L) or high (H), and                         denotes the state of nature.

The L-state occurs with probability . We consider two groups of landless, corresponding to our

RCT – one group which is able to purchase insurance optimally at price p per unit (the insured), and

those for whom insurance is not offered or available. Insurance pays out I in the low state of nature

L. Thus, consumption in the two states for households that purchase insurance is




where                  is labor supply. The landless household maximizes expected utility

                                                                                   ,

and the FONC is                                                                        (   =      if actuarially fair.)




7In the empirical work we allow for credit constraints, employing in our equilibrium wage specification the same
variables used by Jayachandran (2006) in her tests of credit constraints and also carry out a test for credit constraints on
cultivator harvest labor demand.

                                                                                                                               6
        Solving for labor supply in each realized state , we get that                       ,where        is

non-earnings income in state , inclusive of the cost of and payout from insurance. This leads to the

following proposition:

Proposition 1: The labor supply of the insured and uninsured will differ depending on the weather
state:
    a. In the low state, the labor supply of the insured will be lower than that of the uninsured.
    b. In the high state, the labor supply of the insured will be higher than that of the uninsured.


        The proof is given in Table 1, which provides the labor supplied in the two states for the

insured and uninsured landless. In the low state L, the non-earnings income of the insured is greater

than that of the uninsured because of the insurance payout. Labor supply of the insured is lower

than that of the uninsured, because leisure is a normal good. In the high-state H, the net income of

the insured is lower than the uninsured, by the amount they paid for the insurance contract, and thus

they work more than the uninsured. To ensure sufficient insurance take-up, the insurance premium

was heavily subsidized in our RCT. We therefore do not expect much of an income effect in state

H. Insurance payouts were large when they occur, and our empirical exercise will therefore

concentrate on labor supply effects in villages that qualified for a payout.

        2.2     Cultivator households, the demand for labor and rainfall insurance

Cultivators are endowed with one unit of land and non-earnings income m. Production takes place

in two stages using a Cobb-Douglas technology with two inputs, l (labor) and        (an input like

fertilizer or seed variety that is complementary with rainfall). In stage 1 (planting-stage), cultivators

decide on the stage-1 input    and whether to buy insurance. In stage 2, the state of nature         is

realized, labor is hired and profits are maximized. Stage-2 profits are                     , where       is

hired labor. Thus, in any state , labor demand is




                                                                                                               7
The stage-1 program is:




where    is an indicator variable for the low state, when the insurance payout occurs.

        As noted, we allow borrowing and savings (s), where r is the return on savings. We ignore

the use of labor in the first stage, as we will focus the empirical work on the demand for and supply

of labor after the realization of the state of nature. The effect of insurance on labor demand in the

first (planting) stage will solely depend on the relationship between    and labor in that stage.

        It is easy to show that in the absence of insurance the amount of      is lower than the amount

that maximizes expected profits, due to risk, and that the amount of the stage-1 input increases as

the cost of insurance falls; i.e., insured cultivators invest more than uninsured cultivators. This

follows from the fact that purchasing insurance decreases cultivator marginal utility in the low state

while increasing   decreases marginal utility in the high state. More generally, insured cultivators will

select inputs that increase output more in the high state than in the low state compared to the

uninsured, because insurance payouts occur in the low state. Our empirical exercise will therefore

compare stage-2 (harvest stage) labor demand for insured and uninsured cultivators, and how that

demand varies across rainfall states.

        2.3. Labor market equilibrium

If there are N landless households supplying labor and M cultivators in the labor market then in any

rainfall state j, we have the equilibrium condition


                                                                                                         8
We now can derive propositions for how making rainfall insurance exclusively available to either the

landless or cultivators affects (a) average wages, and (b) equilibrium wage volatility       , which is the

difference between equilibrium wages in the high and low states.

Proposition 2: Offering insurance to landless laborers dampens wage volatility           .

Proof: The effect of an increase in non-earnings income y on the equilibrium wage is always

positive




        From Table 1, labor supply is lower in state     when the landless are insured, so        increases

compared to the case where no landless are insured. In state      ,   is lower when the landless are

insured ( higher) than if there were no rainfall insurance, so that       decreases compared to the

non-insurance case . The general-equilibrium effect of offering insurance to landless households

thus reduces wage risk. If only some landless households purchase insurance, then income is

smoothed across the states of nature for the uninsured landless. Note that by symmetry, the welfare

of risk-averse cultivators decreases when the landless are able to purchase weather insurance. Profits

are decreased in the low state when laborers are offered insurance (since        increases), and greater

in the high state, due to the general-equilibrium wage effects.


Proposition 3: Offering insurance to cultivators increases wage volatility (     ).

Proof: Insured cultivators use more first-stage inputs     (inputs more complementary with rainfall).

The effect of an increase in   on wages in the     state is higher than in the   state, so



                                                                                                              9
Offering insurance only to cultivators increases wage volatility and thus may worsen the welfare of

the (uninsured) landless.8 On the other hand, it may also provide some benefits to the landless:


Proposition 4: Offering insurance to cultivators increases average wages.

Proof: Insured cultivators use more . The effect of an increase in                 on the equilibrium wage in any

state is positive




         To summarize, offering insurance to cultivators makes labor demand more volatile across

rainfall states because insurance allows cultivators to make decisions that increase output in the high

state, while worrying less about outcomes in the low state when payouts are expected. Accordingly,

the sensitivity of wages to rainfall also increases when a larger number of cultivators are insured.

Insured cultivators also invest more, and average wages therefore rise. On the other hand, insurance

to landless workers dampens wage volatility, because insured workers supply less labor than the

uninsured when the rainfall is bad (i.e. when they receive insurance payouts). Our empirical work

will examine: (a) how cultivator labor demand responds to insurance offers, across rainfall states; (b)

how agricultural worker labor supply respond to insurance offers, across rainfall states; and (c) how

equilibrium wages respond to the fractions of cultivators and workers insured, across rainfall states.


8Just as the uninsured landless benefit from the insured landless via general-equilibrium wage effects, risk-averse
cultivators who do not have insurance benefit from the behavior of the insured: profits are higher in the low state
compared to the case where no cultivator insurance is available.

                                                                                                                      10
3. Experimental Design

         3.1 Sampling

         The National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER)’s 2006 Rural Economic

and Development Survey (REDS) conducted a comprehensive listing of all rural households

residing in 202 sampled villages in 15 major Indian states. The 2006 REDS listing for three large

states (Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) served as the sampling frame from which

we drew the sample for our randomized controlled trial (RCT) marketing rainfall insurance.

         Our sampling procedure first eliminated members of all castes (jatis) with fewer than 50

households in the listing for these 63 villages.9 118 unique jatis met this size criterion in the REDS

listing. We randomly select 42 (of 63) sampled REDS villages in the three states to receive insurance

marketing. Our next step was to randomize insurance offers to households within these 42 villages.

We stratified the randomization by caste, and members of 25 (out of 118) castes were randomly

selected to not receive any insurance offers. Since the randomization was stratified by village and

caste, we will cluster our standard errors by caste-village groupings in all our regressions. Within the

93 treatment castes, we used occupation data from the 2006 REDS listing to target insurance offers

to 2400 cultivator households (i.e. those with land, making cultivation decisions and typically hiring

in labor) plus 2400 “pure” agricultural labor households (households purely reliant on agricultural

wages, with no member engaged in cultivation). The insurance product was successfully marketed

to 4667 households between October 2010 and January 2011, with a take-up rate of 42%. 98% of

these households had no prior exposure to formal insurance.

         3.2 The Insurance Marketing Experiment

         There are three sets of variables created by the randomized design that are important for

testing the implications of our model and for identifying general-equilibrium effects. The first is

9This is because another project (Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2014) required us to construct average jati characteristics
with statistical precision, which led to our focus on castes that were relatively populous in these specific villages.

                                                                                                                         11
individual-level variation in insurance offers, which are expected to affect labor supply decisions for

wage workers, and risk-taking and labor demand by cultivators. Using this variation we can

compare, for example, the labor demand of cultivators randomly selected to receive an insurance

offer – i.e. the ‘intent-to-treat’ - against cultivators randomly chosen to not receive the insurance

offer. The model suggests that insurance should make labor demand more sensitive to rainfall, and

the specifications therefore add interaction terms between insurance offers and rainfall realized

during Kharif 2011, after insurance offers are made.

        Insurance offers were subsidized in our experiment to ensure adequate take-up, thereby

enabling a study of the effects of insurance. Although we report intent-to-treat estimates

throughout the paper, we randomly varied the extent of the subsidy. The price for a unit of

insurance varied from Rs 80 to Rs 200 (USD 1.6 - 4) across villages, with an average price of Rs.145.

The experiment offered 0%, 10%, 50% or 75% discounts on this price, and Figure 1 shows that

most of the insurance was purchased at highly subsidized rates. Buying insurance and not receiving

a payout is therefore unlikely to have had a significant (negative) wealth effect in this setting, which

is relevant for testing the labor supply predictions of our model.

        3.3. Insurance Payouts

        In contrast, the second variable useful for testing implications of the model - the occurrence

of an insurance payout, induced by random variation in the realization of rainfall in 2011 – was

potentially a large positive wealth shock to those who purchased insurance. We designed a “Delayed

Monsoon Onset” index-based insurance product under-written and marketed by the Agricultural

Insurance Company of India (AICI). AICI first defined an expected onset date of the monsoon

using historic rainfall data. Monsoon onset is defined as a certain level of rainfall accumulation

(varied between 30-40mm). The monsoon is considered delayed if the target amount of rainfall is




                                                                                                        12
not reached by one of three pre-selected "trigger" or payout dates.10 The three trigger dates varied

across villages. In many villages, the first (Rs.300) payout came if the monsoon was about 15 days

late; a larger (Rs.750) payout came if the monsoon was 20 days late; and the largest (Rs. 1200) came

if the monsoon was 25 days late. In other villages, the same triggers were associated with delays of

20, 30, or 40 days, rather than {15, 20, 25}. This is an index product where all farmers in the village

would receive the same payout (or not).

         Four villages in Andhra Pradesh (AP) qualified for a payout. That payout was the largest

potential amount (Rs. 1200 per unit of insurance purchased) in one village, Rs. 750 per unit in

another village, and Rs. 300 per unit in two villages. Figure 2 shows the variation in total rainfall

during the Kharif season across all sample villages in AP. While payouts are strongly negatively

correlated with total rainfall, the figure also indicates that the correlation is not perfect. The onset of

monsoon was not delayed in some villages that ultimately experienced low rainfall. Our regressions

will therefore control for the payout indicator separately from a measure of rainfall amount.

         For our empirical tests of labor supply decisions, it is important to establish that the

occurrence of a payout is a random shock, that long-run rainfall conditions in the payout villages do

not different systematically from those in non-payout villages. If, instead, the occurrence of a

payout indicates that these villages are generally more susceptible to large rainfall shocks, then

farmer behavior in such villages may be systematically different. In principle, this should not be the

case, because AICI tailored the insurance contract design details for each village on the basis of

that’s village’s historical rainfall distribution (e.g. the trigger dates and length of trigger periods varied

across villages, and the monsoon onset date was village-specific). Some villages therefore did not

have a higher ex-ante probability of payouts than others, because AICI attempted to keep the unit

price of insurance as similar as possible across villages, and the trigger dates were therefore adjusted

10The product was designed this way so that it is simple and easily comprehensible to rural farmers in India, and meant
to indemnify agricultural losses due to delayed rainfall.

                                                                                                                      13
to keep payout probabilities constant. Even though in principle none of this should be of concern

to the estimation strategy, we can examine the historical rainfall data to directly establish that rainfall

conditions are not systematically different across payout and non-payout villages.

        The REDS survey collected historical rainfall data in all our sample villages for the period

1999-2006. Using these data, we compute the historical mean rainfall during the Kharif season in

each village, and the inter-annual coefficient of variation of that rainfall. Table 2 reports these

moments of the rainfall distribution, and a t-test of differences across the payout and non-payout

villages. First we see that over the period 1999-2006, the rainfall distribution is statistically identical

across the two sets of villages. The mean and coefficient of variation varies by only 1-2%, and are

statistically indistinguishable. The table further shows that the payouts occurred because Kharif 2011

happened to be an unusually bad rainfall year in the payout villages, but it was a relatively good year

in the non-payout villages. The payout villages had 2 mm/day deficiency in rainfall during Kharif

2011 relative to their historical average. In contrast, the villages that did not qualify for the payout

experienced 4 mm/day excess rainfall relative to their historical average.

        In summary, payout villages evidently experienced a random negative rainfall shock in 2011,

although their long-run rainfall distribution is statistically identical to villages that did not qualify for

a payout. We will therefore treat the occurrence of payouts as a random shock in our regressions.

Moreover, we will control for historical mean rainfall in all our equations, and our rainfall measure

will use only the variation stemming from the deviation of 2011 Kharif season rainfall from its

historical mean.

        3.4 Village-Level Variation in Insurance Marketing

        A third set of variables useful for identifying general-equilibrium effects is cross-village

variation in the proportion of cultivators or agricultural laborers who received insurance offers.

According to our model, labor supply and labor demand in the village depend on access to insurance


                                                                                                           14
by wage workers and cultivators in the aggregate, and these factors will therefore affect equilibrium

wages in agriculture.

        Stratification of the random assignment by caste (described above) creates natural variation

in the number and fraction of farming households in each village receiving insurance offers. For

example, one of the 93 castes randomly chosen for treatment may have been relatively populous in

village A but sparse in village B, whereas the dominant caste in village B may have been randomly

assigned to be a ‘control caste’ not receiving the insurance treatment. The fractions of cultivators

and agricultural laborers receiving insurance offers would be greater in village A under this scenario.

        About 25% of all cultivators and 31% of all laborers received insurance marketing in the

average treatment village, but these fractions vary between 0% to 53% for cultivators, and between

0% to 100% for laborers. For estimation of the general equilibrium wage equation, it is important

to establish that this variation can be treated as random. The main concern arises because we

eliminated all “small castes” (with fewer than 50 members in the REDS listing) from our sample

frame, and this reduces the numerator (number of insurance offers) in each of our two variables of

interest. The 50-member rule eliminates 19% of the population from insurance marketing, and this

fraction varies between 0% and 86% across villages because the size distribution of castes varies

across sample villages. This variation potentially creates some correlation between our variables of

interest and other factors like the number of castes in the village or the concentration of caste

membership, because the fraction of farming households eligible to receive insurance marketing (i.e.

satisfying the 50-member rule) may be correlated with such variables. This implies that our variables

of interest can be treated as random only conditional on the fraction of eligible population according to

our sampling rule.

        A closely related concern, since we are separately studying the effects of cultivators and

laborers receiving offers, is that the cultivator-laborer balance in the population may vary across


                                                                                                       15
locations. If, for example, cultivators are heavily concentrated in large castes in certain villages, then

that might introduce some non-random variation in our variables of interest. Our wage equations

will therefore control for the fraction of cultivators in the village eligible to receive insurance

separately from the fraction of landless laborers who are eligible. Furthermore, we will condition on

the population shares of cultivators and laborers, and rely only on variation in the subsets of those

cultivators and laborers who were randomly assigned to receive insurance offers.

         Table 3 examines the quantitative relevance of these concerns, and shows how these

conditioning variables eliminate any correlation (that might have been introduced by the sampling

strategy) between the fractions of cultivators and laborers randomly selected for insurance offers

(which are our variables in interest), and caste and village characteristics. Column 1 reports the

correlations between the fraction of the population eligible to receive insurance marketing, and village

size, number of castes, and measures of caste diversity. In column 2 we examine how these same

village and caste characteristics are correlated with our variables of interest – fractions of cultivators

and laborers who receive insurance marketing. As expected, we see some significant correlations in

both columns, so these variables cannot be treated as random in an unconditional sense. Column 3

reports the correlations between our variables of interest and village and caste characteristics

conditional on the fraction of cultivators or laborers eligible to receive insurance marketing, and all the

correlations become small and statistically insignificant. 11 In the fourth column of Table 3, we

again examine the correlation between our variables of interest and village and caste characteristics

conditional on state dummies, fraction of population eligible to receive insurance marketing, and

population shares of cultivators and laborers. The correlations remain statistically insignificant, and

close to zero. This exercise, coupled with careful consideration of the details of our sampling



11We regress fraction of cultivators in the village receiving insurance offers on the fraction of cultivating households in
the village, generate residuals, and correlate those residuals with the village and caste characteristics.

                                                                                                                          16
strategy, indicates that the proportion variables can be treated as exogenous, conditional on the

sampling eligibility variables that we will control for in our regressions.



4. Data

        We collected follow-up data after the Kharif harvest, starting in April 2011 in Tamil Nadu,

and between December 2011 and March 2012 in Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. The follow-up

sample comprised of all households we marketed insurance to, plus an additional 1619 control

households selected from the same sampling frame. The survey collected detailed information from

cultivators on their input choices, labor use, and other farming decisions separately for every step of

the agricultural cycle – land preparation, planting, weeding, harvest, etc. For landed cultivators, this

allows us to estimate the determinants of their labor demand specifically during the harvest stage

(which are expected to be affected by insurance and the realization of rainfall during Kharif 2011),

and construct placebo tests using data on labor use during the planting stage. For landless wage

workers, our survey asked questions about the number of days of labor supply, total earnings and

the wage rates received. Agricultural wages in rural India vary by gender and age (and possibly

education), and we collected information on these demographic factors from all respondents. The

results we report below are similar, regardless of whether we use wage rates directly reported by

respondents, or infer the wage rate on the basis of reported earnings and days worked.

        Table 4 provides summary statistics on the variables used for analysis in three samples: (1)

Cultivators who own more than half an acre of land (and therefore likely to hire labor), for our labor

demand estimation; (2) Landless agricultural wage workers aged 25-49 (who supply most labor) for

the labor supply estimation; and (3) All landless workers who report daily wages, useful for the wage

estimation. About 60% of all cultivators and agricultural wage workers in our sample villages were

offered the rainfall insurance product, and high market penetration allows us to track general


                                                                                                       17
equilibrium effects on wages. There is significant rainfall variation across villages, and large rainfall

shocks experienced in 2011: Historically, these villages receive 4.15mm of rainfall per day, but the

average rainfall deviation in 2011 was 3.38mm per day. 14-15% of our total sample were exposed to

insurance payouts. Daily agricultural wages averaged Rs. 120, but males earned more.

        Table 4 shows that only 2.3% of wage workers out-migrate during the Kharif season, and we

will therefore focus on labor supply within the village in our estimates. Migration outside of the

Kharif season is of course possible as an ex-post labor supply response to rainfall or wage shocks. Our

follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the Kharif to collect accurate agricultural data, but we

have data on the same variables that Jayachandran (2006) used to proxy for the ease of migration:

the presence of bus stops and paved roads in the village. The wage estimates will directly control for

these migration variables, while the labor supply and demand estimates will include village fixed

effects to control for all time-invariant village characteristics including ease of migration.


5. Empirical Methodology and Results

        5.1 Labor demand

        The key implication of the model for labor demand is that insured cultivators will use more

inputs that are complementary with rainfall compared with uninsured cultivators. As a result the

output of the insured will be higher in higher rainfall states than that of the uninsured, and we

should observe that more labor is employed for harvesting. In other words, the elasticity of labor

demand with respect to rainfall should be higher for insured cultivators. To test this hypothesis we

estimate the following labor demand specification for cultivator j in village k:



where LDjk is the total number of harvest-stage labor days employed by the farmer, Ijk is an indicator

variable for whether or not the cultivating household was offered insurance at the beginning of the


                                                                                                            18
Kharif season; Rk is the village-specific rainfall shock experienced in the village during the season; Kk

is a vector of village dummy variables; and       is the error term. Standard errors are clustered by

caste-village groupings in all regressions, since the randomization of insurance offers was stratified at

this level.

         The set of village indicators absorb all differences across the villages in Kharif-season

realized and historic rainfall as well as input prices. β1 is thus the estimated linear intent-to-treat

(ITT) effect of insurance (offers) on harvest labor demand and β2 is an estimate of how labor

demand varies with rainfall net of wages across the “insured” (offered insurance) and “uninsured”

(not offered insurance) farmers in the same village. Following the theory, we expect that β2>0 –

labor demand will be more sensitive to rainfall for insured cultivators relative to uninsured

cultivators.

         The first column of Table 5 reports the estimates of the harvest labor demand equation for

cultivators with at least .5 acres of land. Consistent with the theory, the demand for harvest labor is

significantly more sensitive to realized rainfall for cultivators offered insurance relative to

comparable farmers not offered insurance in the same village. The point estimate indicates that a

one standard deviation increase in rainfall, for given historic mean rainfall, increases harvest labor

demand by 3.3 days more for insured compared with uninsured cultivators - a 22% increase in

relative demand. Consistent with uninsured farmers behaving more conservatively than insured

farmers, the negative β1 coefficient, while not statistically significant, implies that at very low rainfall

levels harvest labor demand is higher on uninsured compared with insured farms.

         We assumed in the model that farmers profit-maximize in the harvest period; i.e. that once

planting-stage decisions are made, cultivators do not face liquidity constraints on harvest-stage

inputs. To test this we exploit the fact that in some of the villages insured farmers received non-

trivial insurance payouts after the rainfall was realized, and thus substantially after the planting stage

                                                                                                           19
concluded.12 Harvest labor demand should be no different across insured and uninsured farmers in

payout villages, if there are no liquidity constraints. The second column of Table 5 adds a separate

indicator for farmers receiving insurance offers in villages that qualified for a payout. We cannot

reject the hypothesis that the payouts had no effect on labor demand. The insurance rainfall

sensitivity coefficient remains unchanged in this specification.

            To assess if these results on the increased rainfall sensitivity of harvest labor demand for

insured cultivators are spurious, we also carried out a placebo test. The sensitivity of planting-stage

labor to rainfall that is realized over the course of the Kharif season should not be affected by

whether or not cultivators are offered insurance, as planting-stage preparations are made prior to the

bulk of rainfall realizations. To test this we employed the same labor demand specification but

replaced total harvest labor days by planting-stage labor days. This category of labor demand

includes labor used for sowing, soil preparation and transplanting. Column three shows that in

contrast to the estimates for harvest labor, the effect of realized rainfall in the village on the

difference in demand for planting-stage labor across insured and uninsured cultivators is not

statistically different from zero. Indeed, the estimates indicate that cultivators offered insurance

evidently did not employ more planting-stage labor. In the last column of the table we also report

estimates including the insurance offers in payout village interaction, and this too is not statistically

significantly different from zero, which is expected given the timing of the payouts.

            5.2. Labor Supply

            To test Proposition 1 of the model, we estimate the determinants of agricultural labor supply

– total days worked and participation – during the Kharif season for members of landless agricultural

worker households aged 25-49. We estimate the following specification for a member i in landless

household j in village k:


12
     The payouts were made in the late fall of the Kharif season.

                                                                                                            20
The first two columns of Table 6 examine the determinants of participation, where LSijk is an

indicator for households that supply any agricultural labor hours at all during the Kharif season. The

dependent variable for the last two columns is the number of days spent in the agricultural labor

market during the season. Ijk is again the indicator for randomized insurance offers, and Rk is the

rainfall shock for Kharif 2011, relative to historical mean rainfall. Zijk is a vector of person-specific

characteristics (age, age squared and gender); and Kk is a vector of village indicator variables; and

    is the error term. The village dummy variables absorb all differences across villages in realized

and historic rainfall and other determinants of labor supply at the village level. Standard errors are

again clustered by the unit of randomization (caste-village groupings).

        Our model (Proposition 1) predicts that the labor supply responses to insurance will differ

depending on whether payouts occur. In the low-rainfall state, when payouts occur, the insured are

predicted to supply less labor than the uninsured, due to the income effect of the payout (1a). This

prediction reverses in the high rainfall states (1b) if purchasing insurance and not receiving a payout

leads to a substantial negative wealth effect.

        To test the model’s predictions, we therefore estimate the labor supply equation separately in

Table 6 for villages with and without insurance payouts. As we show in Table 2, the permanent

rainfall conditions across these two sets of villages is similar, and payout villages just happened to

have a negative rainfall shock in 2011. Moreover, our inclusion of village fixed-effects means that all

contrasts between the insured and the uninsured are within-village. Specifically, Table 6 provides the

ITT estimates for the labor supply behavior of households that received random insurance offers

relative to same-village residents who did not receive offers. 40% of those who were offered

insurance purchased insurance, and they received substantial payouts in the villages that qualified for


                                                                                                            21
payouts, leading to significantly higher non-earnings incomes than the uninsured during the peak

harvest stage of production. Proposition 1a therefore predicts α1<0 and α2<0, i.e. that the insured

work less, and their labor supply is less sensitive to realized rainfall.

        There was no such wealth effect in the villages that did not qualify for a payout. While the

insured paid some premiums, Figure 1 shows that the vast majority who purchased insurance

bought the contract at highly subsidized rates (randomized discounts of 75% or 50%). The net costs

of subsidized insurance (Rs. 80 per unit) are far below the values of the indemnification payouts in

the payout villages (which ranged from Rs. 300 to Rs. 1200 per unit). The model predicts reverse

labor supply effects if there is an adverse wealth effect from paying the premium in non-payout

villages, but in reality there was not much of a wealth effect, in contrast to the payout village sample.

        The first column of Table 6 shows that both α1<0 and α2<0 in the sample of villages that

received payouts, implying that landless labor households offered insurance are significantly less

likely to participate in the agricultural labor market at any level of rainfall. Using the point estimates,

we compute the derivative of their ex post harvest-period labor supply with respect to insurance

offers at the median value of the rainfall shock in the payout village sample (1.9 mm’s below the per-

day mean). The estimates (and t-statistic) reported in the bottom row indicates that the participation

rate of insured laborers after receiving payouts was 28.5 percentage points lower than that of

otherwise identical laborers in households not offered insurance.

        In contrast, insurance offers do not affect labor force participation in the villages that did

not receive payouts. The bottom row of the second column shows at the median rainfall shock in

this sample, there is no statistically significant difference in the labor supply of the insured and

uninsured. This is consistent with the subsidized insurance contract having only a marginal impact

on the non-earnings income of the landless households.




                                                                                                         22
        In the third and fourth columns of Table 6 we report the estimates of the effects of

insurance in payout and non-payout villages, respectively, on days worked in the agricultural labor

market during the Kharif season. The results are similar, though less precisely estimated, for the

intensive margin of labor supply. Both α1<0 and α2<0 in the payout sample, indicating that the

insured who received payouts work fewer days than the uninsured at any level of rainfall, but both

coefficients carry a t-statistic of 1.83, which implies that they are only significant at the 10% level.

The point estimates indicate that at the median level of rainfall shock, those offered insurance

worked approximately 15 days less during the Kharif season. Paralleling the participation results, the

insured in the non-payout villages supplied no less labor than the uninsured (point estimate of -4.6

days, and not statistically significant).

        5.3 The General Equilibrium Wage Equation

        The labor market equilibrium condition in the model relates wage volatility across rainfall

states to the fractions of cultivators and wage workers who are insured. The model predicts that

insuring more cultivators increases the sensitivity of wages to rainfall through the labor demand

channel (Proposition 3). We have already observed the underlying mechanism in the labor demand

equation we estimated – the harvest labor hired by a cultivator becomes more rainfall sensitive if he

is offered insurance. Symmetrically, the model also implies that wages become less volatile across

rainfall states when landless laborers are insured (Proposition 2). This is because of the labor supply

mechanism in which wage workers supply less labor in bad rainfall states (when they receive

payouts) when they are insured, and more labor in high rainfall states when they don’t receive

payouts. Our labor supply estimates showed that this mechanism operates in the payout villages,

where the wealth effect from insurance payouts is substantial. We will now test the aggregate effects

of these demand and supply mechanisms by estimating a general equilibrium wage equation:




                                                                                                           23
        Wik is the daily wage rate reported by a landless laborer i in village k, CIk is the fraction of

cultivators in the village who received randomized insurance offers, LIk the fraction of landless

laborers who received randomized insurance offers, IPk the fraction of households offered insurance

in payout villages. The RHS variables of interest that help us test the general equilibrium predictions

of the model are:

    a) The interaction between CIk and rainfall during the Kharif 2011 season, rk. A positive

        coefficient (2) on this interaction would imply that more insurance for cultivators increase

        wage volatility across rainfall states, which would support Proposition 3.

    b) The interaction between LIk and rk. A negative coefficient ( 4) on this interaction would

        imply that more insurance for wage workers decrease wage volatility across rainfall states,

        which would support Proposition 2.

    c) A positive coefficient on IPk ( 5) would imply that landless laborers supply less labor when

        insurance payouts occur, and this raises village level wages.

        We focus on these predictions, while controlling for Zik, a vector of person-specific

determinants of wages, such as gender, age, age-squared and indicators for primary and secondary

school attainment. This is primarily why we estimate the wage equation with individual-level data:

we gain precision and efficiency by soaking up the unnecessary variation in wages with its individual

level determinants. For example, the estimated coefficient on gender in the wage equation (Table 7)

shows that males earn 30% more than females. Controlling for these quantitatively important

determinants of wages using individual-level data leads to greater statistical power.

        We also control for a large vector of village-level characteristics,Vk. This vector includes the

sampling variables (proportion of cultivators and laborers who were eligible to receive insurance

offers in our sampling strategy), and the proportion of cultivators and laborers in the population, so

that – as discussed in detail in section 3.4 – the coefficients of interest are identified using purely

                                                                                                           24
random variation in the fractions of cultivators and laborers who were offered insurance in the

experiment. We also control for village rainfall during Kharif 2011 (rk), its squared term, and the

historic average rainfall in the village for the period 1999-2006, so that rk identifies the effect of the

2011 rainfall shock. Further, we control for eleven different soil type variables including soil color

(red, gray, black), type (soft or hard clay), percolation speed, depth and drainage characteristics.

        Finally, while our model focuses on the roles of risk and insurance in wage determination,

Jayachandran (2006) has shown that missing credit markets and transportation frictions can lead to

wage volatility. We collected data on all the variables that proxy for market imperfections in her

paper: the presence of a bank, a bus stop, and a paved road in the village, and control for their direct

effects, and their interactions with rainfall (rk). With these controls, we can verify that our insurance

variables do not merely pick up the effects of other market failures such as lack of credit or lack of

migration opportunities.

        5.4 Estimation Results on General Equilibrium Wages, and Policy Simulations

Results from estimating the general equilibrium wage equation are shown in Table 7. Wages are

logged so that coefficients can be interpreted as percentage changes. The errors         , are clustered by

the unit of randomization of insurance offers, which is the caste-village grouping.

        The first column of Table 7 omits our insurance variables of interest to replicate the general

equilibrium wage equation from the existing literature (Jayachandran 2006) and establish that wage-

setting in our sample of villages is not unusual, and conforms to what Jayachandran finds using a

sample of districts across India. We replicate the main results of her study in our sample of villages:

wages are substantially higher in villages with banks, paved roads and bus stops, and the presence of

any of these three types of credit or migration infrastructure (all of which offer better income

smoothing opportunities) reduces the sensitivity of wages to rainfall variation. Migration during the

Kharif season is quite rare in our sample, but the infrastructure variables allow us to control for

                                                                                                         25
village-level differences in the propensity to migrate in the off-season. Wages are 14.5% greater for

every extra millimeter per day of a positive rainfall shock, but the coefficient on the square term in rk

indicates that the positive marginal effect of rainfall tapers off as the village experiences a larger and

larger rainfall shock.

        In the second column of Table 7 we add the insurance variables of interest. First, we find

evidence consistent with Proposition 3: β2>0, which implies that offering insurance to a larger

proportion of cultivators in the village increases the volatility of wages across rainfall states. This

mirrors the labor demand results we showed in Table 5 – these wage effects presumably arise

because when rainfall is good, insured cultivators hire more harvest labor than uninsured cultivators.

Furthermore, β1<0 and highly significant, which implies that during droughts, wages actually fall

even further in villages where many of the cultivators are insured. These two results are consistent

with cultivators taking more risk when insurance is offered. They have a bumper harvest under

good rainfall conditions and therefore hire more harvest labor, but suffer larger losses during

droughts (when they expect insurance payouts), and cut back on hiring labor under such conditions

even more than the uninsured. The results also clearly show the adverse spillover effects on landless

laborers of selling insurance to cultivators. Wages become more volatile, and the landless are worse

off, especially if they are uninsured. In terms of magnitudes, a 10% increase in the fraction of

cultivators insured leads to a 33% lower wage rate at the 20th percentile of rainfall, but a 29% higher

wage rate at the 80th percentile of rainfall. According to these estimates, insurance for cultivators

leads to substantially greater wage volatility.

        Second, we find evidence consistent with Proposition 2: β4<0, which means that offering

insurance to a larger proportion of cultivators in the village decreases the volatility of wages across

rainfall states. Our labor supply estimates show that this is likely because of the labor supply

responses to insurance in villages that qualified for a payout. We find a general equilibrium effect


                                                                                                          26
consistent with that mechanism. Our results show that β5>0, which indicates that wages rise when a

larger fraction of people are offered insurance in the payout villages. This effect is also substantial; a

10% increase in insurance marketing in payout villages increases the wage rate by 24.7%. In

summary, insured laborers supply less labor than the uninsured when they expect payout. This

increases the wage rate, and helps to indirectly insure the uninsured laborers in the same village.

        These general equilibrium estimates allow us to conduct simulations to predict the

equilibrium wage profiles under alternative policy scenarios where cultivators or wage workers are

offered insurance in isolation, or in combination. Evaluating the rainfall sensitivity of wages under

these scenarios is realistic and policy relevant, because most of the rural, agrarian developing world is

not yet covered by formal weather insurance, and even when insurance is introduced, it is typically

designed for and marketed only to cultivators.

        Figure 3 plots the predicted wage-rainfall relationship based on the general equilibrium

estimates in column 2 of Table 7 under two policy scenarios: (a) there is no insurance in the village,

and (b) insurance is marketed to 25.6% of cultivators, which is the maximum fraction receiving

insurance marketing in any of our sample villages. For this simulation we assume that landless

laborers do not receive insurance, because this reflects real-world insurance marketing conditions –

the landless typically do not have the have the opportunity to purchase agricultural insurance. We

otherwise assume an “average” village in our sample in terms of access to banks, paved roads, bus

stops and proportions of cultivators and wage laborers in the village population. We plot predicted

log wages for the entire range of rainfall observed across our sample villages, which is roughly two

standard deviations around the mean rainfall per day.

        Figure 3 shows that the sensitivity of wages to rainfall increases when cultivators are offered

insurance. The effect of moving from no coverage to having 26% of cultivators covered by

insurance on wages is quite dramatic in periods of low rainfall. At the 30th percentile of rainfall,


                                                                                                        27
wages are 0.63 log points lower. At the median level of rainfall experience in our sample in 2011,

wages decrease by 0.23 log points. The effect turns positive at the 54th percentile of rainfall, and at

the 70th percentile of rainfall village wages are 0.34 log points higher. The key lesson from this

simulation is that wages become much more volatile when cultivators are offered insurance, and the

shapes and positions of the two curves in Figure 3 indicate that the greater volatility dominates any

effect on average wages.

        Next we simulate the effects of insurance for landless agricultural laborers on village wages

based on the same general equilibrium estimates. Figure 4 plots predicted wages across rainfall

states under two policy scenarios: (a) no insurance for landless laborers, and (b) insurance marketed

to 31.8% of laborers, which is the maximum fraction receiving insurance marketing in any of our

sample villages. We again simulate these effects for an “average” sample village in terms of

infrastructure and cultivator/labor balance. We now hold the cultivator insurance marketing rate

constant at 25.6% to approximate real-world conditions, as it is not realistic to market agricultural

insurance to only the landless, leaving cultivators uninsured. We simulate effects for a village that

qualified for an insurance payout, because our labor supply estimates indicate that this is the only

interesting case: we only observe general equilibrium responses by workers in the payout villages.

        Figure 4 shows that marketing insurance to landless laborers reduces the sensitivity of wages

to rainfall. The general equilibrium labor supply responses are such that wages rise during

unfavorable rainfall states, which serves to indirectly insure the other landless in the village who did

not receive insurance marketing. The magnitudes are quite substantial: wages rise by 72 log points at

the 30th percentile of rainfall when insurance is marketed to laborers. This wage effect stays positive

for the bottom 70 percentiles of rainfall experienced by our sample villages in 2011.

        In Figure 5 we combine the two policy simulations, and examine the effects of marketing

insurance to both cultivators and landless laborers simultaneously. The opposing rainfall sensitivity


                                                                                                          28
effects from cultivator choices and laborer choices evidently cancel each other out, and wages are no

more volatile when both cultivators and laborers are offered insurance, relative to the case of no

insurance in the village. Wages are higher with insurance in the good rainfall states. At the 80th

percentile of rainfall, wages increase by 19% and at median rainfall, insurance for both cultivators

and agricultural laborers increase wages by 11.7%.



6. Concluding Comments

        Comparing the graph with the combined insurance marketing (Figure 5) to the effects of

marketing to the supply and demand sides in isolation (Figures 3 and 4) clarifies the value of

combining general equilibrium analysis based on a model of the labor market with data generated by

a randomized controlled trial. The net spillover effects of insurance marketing on wage volatility is

virtually non-existent (Figure 5), but this masks significant opposing effects on volatility from the

demand and supply sides, exactly as predicted by the model. The analysis allows us to learn more

about the economic environment, and enumerate a more complete range of costs and benefits of

insurance marketing, relative to what a simple program evaluation would permit, even if that

evaluation included regressions of spillover effects. Directly analyzing the labor demand and supply

responses to insurance was also important, because this motivates and rationalizes the exact

specification for the general equilibrium wage estimation.

        Designing randomized controlled trials of development and other social programs such that

aggregate effects of interventions can be uncovered is an important next step for the research

agenda on program evaluation. Providing sound policy advice requires us to estimate the effects of

programs when they are scaled up by governments, accounting for the general equilibrium changes

that may occur as a result of the program at scale. This paper provides a framework for estimating

general equilibrium effects of an important economic intervention: addressing a missing insurance


                                                                                                        29
market in an environment where the poor face large weather risk. The paper also illustrates how an

RCT can be designed to capture aggregate effects. Our experimental design incorporated both

individual-level and village-level variation in insurance marketing, and stratified the marketing by two

occupational groups (landed cultivators and landless agricultural laborers) that represent the demand

and supply sides of the agricultural labor market. This design helps to clearly identify labor demand

and labor supply responses.

        In the process, our research yields a clear and important policy message – the current

practice of designing insurance contracts on the basis of acreage, and marketing products only to

landed cultivators likely reduces the welfare of the landless. These unintended spillovers create a

more risky economic environment for those who have to rely exclusively on their own labor for

their livelihoods. The problem is compounded since this same population is also denied the

possibility of insurance coverage. Our general equilibrium analysis highlights this adverse spillover

effect on a non-treated population, but our experimental design and simulations also allows us to

show that the problem can be addressed by expanding insurance coverage for this population.

                                                 Average Rainfall per day During the Monsoon Season




                                        Predicted Wages with No Insurance


                                        Predicted Wage with Insurance for both Cultivators and Agri. Laborers in Payout Village



                     The wage rate is predicted based on the wage equation estimated in the second column of Table 6. Assumes an
                     "average" village in terms of banks, roads, bus stops and fractions of cultivators and agricultural laborers in the
                     populations. Graph is plotted for 2 standard deviations of rainfall per day around the mean. The "insurance"
                     line considers a case where the sample-maximum fractions of cultivators and agricultural laborers are offered
                     insurance.
