Optimal taxation in the presence of bailouts

                                            ABSTRACT

The termination of a representative financial firm due to excessive leverage may lead to substantial
bankruptcy costs. A government in the tradition of Ramsey (1927) may be inclined to provide transfers
to the firm so as to prevent its liquidation and the associated deadweight costs. It is shown that the
optimal taxation policy to finance such transfers exhibits countercyclicality and history dependence,
even in a complete market. These results are in contrast with pre-existing literature on optimal fiscal
policy, and are driven by the endogeneity of the transfer payments that are required to salvage the
financial firm.

1     Introduction
During the recent financial crisis, several financial corporations received public-sector as-
sistance. The usual reason given for such “bailouts”, as they are commonly called in the
popular press, is that massive liquidations would have severe adverse effects on the economy.
    Predictably, such bailouts cause a lot of debate and questions as to their desirability. The
present paper does not seek to resolve this debate. Instead, it studies a more focused question.
Using a neoclassical framework in the tradition of Ramsey (1927), and simply assuming that
private-sector contracting frictions induce governmental intervention to avoid bankruptcy-
related deadweight costs, it studies optimal (distortionary) taxation to finance the transfer
payments needed to salvage the financial firms. In the model a welfare-maximizing govern-
ment adjusts tax rates, anticipating the effects of tax changes on equilibrium allocations,
and ultimately consumer welfare. There are two types of (competitive) firms. Financial
firms supply financial services using capital. Final goods firms produce consumption goods
using labor and the services of financial firms as inputs. Financial firms are partly financed
by debt. If the firm’s assets fall short of its liabilities, then the financial firm must be liqui-
dated. Liquidation leads to deadweight costs, which can induce the government to provide
the financial firm with capital injections in order to prevent its liquidation and the associated
deadweight losses.
    In the baseline model, the transfer payments are financed by distortionary labor taxes
similar to Lucas and Stokey (1983), and markets are (dynamically) complete. Because
taxation is distortionary, Ricardian equivalence fails and the optimal welfare-maximizing
way to raise taxes becomes a non-trivial problem.
    A new feature of the model is that taxes are not raised to finance exogenous government
expenditures, but rather to finance transfer payments from the government to the financial
firm. Hence, government outlays do not drive a wedge between consumption and output;
they merely reallocate existing consumption goods through taxes and transfers. Importantly,
the net present value of the transfer payments is not exogenous to the model, but rather
is determined in general equilibrium, since the value of the firm and the necessary transfer

                                                2
payments to prevent liquidation are endogenous to the model.
      Within such a neoclassical framework optimal taxation balances two aspects.
      On the one hand, the usual labor tax smoothing argument (see e.g. Barro (1979)) implies
a constant tax rate, irrespective of current economic conditions. Indeed, a first result states
that if one were to ignore the endogeneity of transfer payments, then the optimal tax rate
within the model should be constant. This result is reminiscent of Lucas and Stokey (1983),
who find that in the presence of complete markets and constant government expenditure
(government expenditure is set to zero in the present model), optimal tax rates are constant.
      On the other hand, inside the model countercyclical fiscal policy (raising tax rates in
good times and lowering them in bad times) can help boost output, the demand for financial
services and accordingly the value of the representative firm in bad times. In turn, increasing
the firm’s value in bad times can lower the amount of transfers that are required to salvage
the firm, and can lead to a lower overall net present value of required (distortionary) taxes.
      The main insight of the proposed neoclassical model is that the trade-off between smooth-
ing tax distortions and reducing the net present value of transfers implies procyclical taxes.
Specifically, optimal taxes are a non-decreasing function of total factor productivity. An
additional result of theoretical interest is that optimal tax rates are history dependent de-
spite (dynamically) complete markets; tax rates at some time t do not only depend on the
productivity level at time t, but are also a non-decreasing function of past transfer payments.
This result contrasts with Lucas and Stokey (1983), where tax rates are history independent,
when government expenditure is Markovian.
      The analysis is related to two strands of the literature. The first strand uses continuous
time finance techniques to price government guarantees as contingent claims1 . In this liter-
ature, the stochastic discount factor is taken as given, and the issue of how the government
should raise the revenue to pay for the guarantees is not considered. By contrast, in the
present framework the endogeneity of the stochastic discount factor and the optimal way to

finance these guarantees are explicitly taken into account. The second strand of the literature
studies optimal (labor-distortionary) taxation2 . This literature is mostly considered with the
optimal timing of taxes in the presence of exogenous expenditures. As mentioned above, the
distinguishing feature of the present paper is that taxes are raised in order to finance en-
dogenous transfer payments rather than exogenous government expenditures. Karantounias
et al. (2008) also obtain history dependence of the optimal tax rate in a framework involv-
ing complete markets. However, their results are driven by fears of model mis-specification
rather than endogenous transfers.
        The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the model and the problem of the
government. Section 3 derives the optimal taxation policy. Section 4 considers additional
forms of funding government transfers and derives the process of optimal debt holdings.
Section 5 concludes. All proofs are in the appendix.



2         Model

2.1         Consumers, firms and assets

The representative consumer has preferences given by
        (Z         "                          # )
             ∞                            1−φ
                                (1 − ht )
     E0        e−ρt log (ct ) +                dt ,                                                    (1)
           0                       1 −  φ

where ct is an adapted consumption process, and ht denotes hours worked, ρ > 0 is the
subjective discount rate, and φ > 0, φ 6= 1 controls the elasticity of labor supply. The rep-
resentative agent’s endowment of hours is normalized to one. Specification (1) is attractive,
since it allows hours to be stationary in the long run, while keeping the utility of consumption
and leisure separable.
        Firms in the economy are competitive and fall into two groups: Non-financial (NF )
and financial (F ). Within each group all firms are identical, so that one can speak of a

single representative financial and a single non-financial firm. The services produced by
the representative financial firm are used by the non-financial firm as intermediate goods.
Specifically, the non-financial firm is the sole producer of consumption goods and it utilizes
the production function

         Yt = Zt (Ft )1−α (ht )α ,                                                                        (2)

       where Ft denotes the amount of financial services, ht the hours worked, α ∈ (0, 1) controls
the labor share of production, and Zt captures total factor productivity, which follows a
geometric brownian motion
         dZt
             = µdt + σdBt .                                                                               (3)

                                               > 0. The price of a unit of financial services is given by
pt . Accordingly, the optimization problem of the non-financial firm is given by

         max Yt − wt ht − pt Ft .                                                                         (4)
         ht ,Ft

The financial firm employs a simple production technology. It owns Kt units of capital
goods, and uses one unit of capital goods to produce one unit of financial services. To
simplify matters, I follow Lucas (1978) and assume that Kt cannot be accumulated, nor
does it depreciate, so that it remains constant.
       Agents can frictionlessly trade a zero net supply instantaneously maturing riskless claim
and a zero net supply3 claim that pays Zt as a dividend. Dynamic trading of these two
securities in equilibrium4 implies that financial markets are complete with respect to the
filtration generated by Bt , and hence there exists a (unique) stochastic discount factor ξt .
       Accordingly, the total value of the financial firm’s capital stock, which I will denote as
Wt , is given by the present value of the revenue that it produces

       By introducing trading in a zero net supply claim paying the dividend Zt , it is possible to ensure the
dynamic completeness of markets.

2.2        Default and Bailouts

The financial firm is levered; it owes debtholders an amount Lt . The coupon of this debt is
variable and equals the rate of return on an instantaneously maturing risk-free bond.5 The
presence of debt introduces the possibility of default. The modeling of default follows Leland
(1994). If a firm defaults, ownership of the entire capital stock is transferred to debtholders.
To simplify the presentation, I assume that in the event of bankruptcy, the capital stock of
the firm is sold by the debtholders to a newly formed set of financial firms that raise their
funds by issuing equity to the representative households. However, this redeployment process
is costly. Specifically, a fraction δ of the capital stock is lost in the process of redeployment,
so that Kt jumps downward to (1 − δ) Kt .
       To simplify the analysis further, I assume that debt includes a protective covenant that
allows debtholders to liquidate the firm once

         Wt ≤ Lt                                                                                        (7)

Equation (7) can be viewed as a constraint, that arises naturally in the presence of collater-
alized borrowing.
       As in Leland (1998), loan modifications (principal write-downs, debt for equity swaps
etc.) are not allowed as a mechanism to avoid impending bankruptcy and the associated
deadweight losses. In the real world such modifications or write-downs are hard to implement
because of various frictions, and that’s why we observe bankruptcies in the first place6 .
   5
       As Duffie (2001), and Karatzas and Shreve (1998) show, the stochastic discount factor in a brownian
filtration model can be written as

         dξt
             = −rt dt − dAt − κt dBt ,                                                                   (6)
         ξt

where (rt ) is the equilibrium interest rate, κt is the Sharpe ratio or price of risk and At is a continuous
process of bounded variation. The rate of return of an instantaneously maturing risk-free bond is given by
rt dt + dAt . (In many cases dAt = 0 and the rate of return of an instantaneously maturing risk-free bond is
simply rt dt.)
   6
     As Leland (1998), p. 1219 argues “Repeated restructurings would always take place before default, and


                                                     6
Modeling these frictions is besides the scope of this paper, since it is inessential for the
optimal taxation results that are derived in the next section. All that matters is that
frictions in private contracting will lead to bankruptcy once Wt < Lt .
    Since bankruptcy leads to deadweight costs, a benevolent government may have an incen-
tive to intervene and “bail out” the financial firm. Bailouts are modeled in a way similar to
Panageas (2008). Specifically, if the firm is threatened by imminent default, the government
makes a transfer that allows the firm to pay down an amount dLt < 0 of debt, so that7

       Wt ≥ Lt+ ≡ Lt + dLt .                                                                                   (8)

An implication of Karatzas and Shreve (1991) p. 210 is that there exists a unique minimal
process dLt that enforces (8) and it is given by
     Z t                        
         dLt = min L0 , min Ws − L0 .                                                                          (9)
        0                      0≤s≤t


    Later, I show that if the parameter δ, which controls the deadweight costs of bankruptcy,
is large enough, then an optimizing government will indeed provide the transfers implied
by equation (9). I refer to such a situation as a “perpetual bailout”. For what follows, I
simply assume that the bailout is perpetual and proceed as if all agents anticipate that the
government will provide the transfers implied by equation (9).
default would never occur. As default is not uncommon, this approach is not pursued.” Leland’s observation
applies to a wide class of models, including the present one. If debt renegotiation were frictionless, there
should never be any bankruptcies, since bankruptcy costs reduce the joint surplus of all claimholders. The
fact that we do observe bankruptcies implies that various frictions that are not explicitly modeled here (e.g.
hold up problems created by different seniority of the tranches, asymetric information about the long-run
prospects of the firm etc.) can lead to failure of negotiations between the various claimants.
   7
     This specification of the transfer and its use to reduce debt is stylized, but could be easily relaxed without
changing the main insights of the analysis. For instance, replacing a fraction of the fair-market-rate loans
to the private sector with below-market-rate loans to the government is equivalent to a government transfer
whose value dLt is equal to the difference in the economic value of the two loans.

2.3     Taxes to finance the bailout

The government needs to raise taxes in order to finance the transfers to the firm. Taxation
is distortionary and the only source of funding for the government is labor income taxation.
This simple assumption allows a comparison with the results in Lucas and Stokey (1983).
Later, I enrich the model and consider what happens when the government can obtain
a fraction of company stock, or a fraction of the firm’s assets (or both) in exchange for
providing the associated transfers.
    Specifically, the government levies a (proportional) labor tax on workers. This tax raises
a revenue given by τt wt ht at time t. For simplicity, there are no government expenditures
and no initial debt. Hence taxes or raised only in order to finance the transfers to the firm.
Given the above assumptions, and recalling that markets are complete and dLs < 0, the
government’s intertemporal budget constraint is
        Z ∞                      Z ∞
     E0     ξt τt wt ht dt = −E0     ξt dLt .                                                  (10)
           0                       0



2.4     Formulation of the government’s problem

Given a path of τt , a market equilibrium is defined as a tuple of adapted process for ct , ht ,
Ft , ξt , wt and pt , so that

   1. Consumers maximize (1) over ct , ht subject to their intertemporal budget constraint
              Z ∞               Z ∞                           Z ∞                  Z ∞
           E0     ξt ct dt = E0     ξt (1 − τt )wt ht dt + E0     ξt pt Ft dt − E0     ξt dLt . (11)
                  0               0                           0                   0


   2. Firms maximize (4) over ht , Ft .

   3. Goods markets, financial services markets, and labor markets clear, i.e. ct = Yt ,
      Ft = Kt and hours supplied by workers are equal to hours demanded by firms.

   4. All asset markets clear.




                                                 8
   Equation (11) has a natural interpretation. It states that the consumer’s present value
of consumption (left hand side of equation [11]) should equal the present value of after tax
labor income (first term on the right hand side of [11]) plus the total value (sum of debt and
equity) of the financial firm which is given by the last two terms on the right hand side of
(11). Observe that the last term in (11) captures the increase in total firm value due to the
government transfers.
   Constructing an equilibrium for a given path τt is straightforward. Attaching a Lagrange
multiplier ν to the intertemporal budget constraint (11) and maximizing over ct , ht leads to
the pair of first order conditions
                     1
               e−ρt    = νξt ,                                                           (12)
                    ct
      e−ρt (1 − ht )−φ = νξt (1 − τt )wt .                                               (13)

   Combining (12), and (13) leads to

                                wt
      (1 − ht )−φ = (1 − τt )      .                                                     (14)
                                ct

   Turning to firms, the first order conditions with respect to ht and Ft yield

            αYt = wt ht ,                                                                (15)

      (1 − α) Yt = pt Ft .                                                               (16)

   These are familiar relationships for factor payments when the production function is of
the Cobb-Douglas form. Multiplying both sides of (14) by ht , using (15) and recognizing
that in equilibrium ct = Yt leads to

      (1 − ht )−φ ht = (1 − τt )α.                                                       (17)


    Equation (17) implies a one-to-one mapping between a given tax rate and the hours
worked in equilibrium. To capture this relationship, let

                    (1 − ht )−φ ht
      τ (ht ) ≡ 1 −                                                                      (18)
                          α

                                              9
denote the tax rate that is required to induce a given value of ht . Straightforward calculations
yield τ ′ (ht ) < 0, τ ′′ (ht ) < 0.
    Before proceeding with the formulation of the government’s problem it is useful to use
(12)-(17) in order to obtain the present value of taxes and bailout payments in a market
equilibrium. Using (12) and (15) inside (10) and recognizing that in equilibrium ct = Yt
implies that the budget constraint of the government can be written as
          Z ∞                     Z ∞
                −ρt                        1
      αE0      e τ (ht ) dt = −E0      e−ρt dLt .                                           (19)
           0                       0       ct

    Furthermore, equations (5) together with (16), (12) and ct = Yt yield
                  
             1−α
      Wt =           Yt .                                                                   (20)

    Equation (20) is a well known property of economies where the representative agent has

claim that pays a constant fraction (1 − α) of aggregate consumption (ct = Yt ) is simply ρ1 .
Defining

and using equations (20) and (9) leads to

Equation (22) implies that dLt changes only when ct = mt and hence

    where the last equality obtains because mt is a bounded variation process. Combining
(19) and (23) leads to the following problem for a government that is assumed to be providing
a perpetual bailout.

                                                   10
Problem 1 Let J (Z0 , K0 ; ht ) denote the representative consumer’s welfare

                                                                               (1 − ht )
  U (Z0 , K0 ; ht ) ≡ E0       e−ρt log (Zt ) + (1 − α) log (K0 ) + α log ht +                dt .
                           0                                                      1 −  φ
                                                                                                                             (24)

Then the optimal taxation problem for a government is

          max U (Z0 , K0 ; ht )
         ht ∈[0,1]

subject to
                Z        ∞                               Z     ∞

where τ (ht ) is given by (18) and mt is given by (21).

       Equation (24) is simply a re-statement of equation (1), using ct = Yt , equation (2), and
the fact that the supposition of a perpetual bailout implies Kt = K0 . Equation (25) is the
government’s intertemporal budget constraint, which follows from (23) and (19).
       Before proceeding with the solution of problem 1, it is useful to make three remarks.
       First, the one-to-one correspondence between hours worked and tax rates implies an
equivalence between choosing τt and ht . For convenience, it is easiest to have the government
choose ht rather than τt . Second, as is well known (see e.g. Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004),
Chapter 15), the government’s budget constraint (10) implies the consumer’s budget con-
straint in a market equilibrium.8 As a result, to check feasibility of an allocation, it suffices to
ensure that the government’s intertemporal budget constraint holds (equation [25]).9 Third,
problem 1 assumes that the government can commit to a sequence of taxes. However, as
Lucas and Stokey (1983) show, this assumption can be relaxed if the government can issue
contingent debt at all maturities.

       To see this add E0            0    ξt (1 − τt ) wt ht dt+ E0    0   ξt pt Ft dt to both sides of (10) and use the fact that
wt ht + pt Ft = Yt = ct on the left hand side of the resulting expression to obtain (11).
   9
     Alternatively put, after solving for the optimal h∗t in problem 1, it is always possible to find a market
equilibrium that supports the resulting allocation. (In that equilibrium output and consumption are given
                                      α
by ct = Yt = Zt K01−α (h∗t ) , the taxes that yield the optimal allocation as a market equilibrium are given by
τ (h∗t ) and the price processes ξt , wt , pt are given by equations (12), (14) and (16), evaluated at Ft = K0 .)

                                                                        11
3       Optimal taxation
The key difficulty in solving problem 1 is the endogeneity of the cost of the bailout, which
is reflected in the fact that output Yt and as a result its running minimum mt are affected
by the choice of ht .
    To obtain intuition, it is useful to examine what would happen if the government behaved
“naively” and optimized over ht as if mt were an exogenous process beyond its influence.
In that case, the solution to problem 1 is straightforward. Letting λ denote the Lagrange
multiplier on the government’s budget constraint and maximizing
                              Z ∞                    Z ∞                                

     U (Z0 , K0 ; ht ) + λ αE0     e τ (ht ) dt + χE0     e 1{log mt ≤log( L0 )} d log mt ,
                                                                              χ
                                0                         0

amounts to a simple “point by point” maximization problem with solution
                  "                                   #
                                       1−φ
                             (1 − ht )
    h∗ = arg max α log ht +                + λατ (ht ) .                                      (26)
               ht               1−φ

By concavity of the objective in (26), there is a unique value h∗ that maximizes (26). Fur-
thermore, the one-to-one correspondence between ht and τt (equation [17]) implies that the
government would end up choosing a constant tax rate. This result is reminiscent of the well
known labor tax smoothing results in the optimal taxation literature (see e.g. Ljungqvist
and Sargent (2004) Chapter 15), and serves as an illustration of the labor tax smoothing
forces that are present in the model.
    However, matters are more complex, because a fully rational government takes into ac-
count that mt (and hence the cost of the bailout) are both endogenous. This introduces two
opposing forces: On the one, smoothing the distortions associated with taxation tends to
favor a stable tax rate. On the other hand, lowering taxes in states where the financial firm
is threatened with bankruptcy can boost demand for labor, and hence increase the marginal
product of the financial firm and the value of its assets Wt . In turn this boost in value implies
that the total cost of the bailout may be reduced by “stimulating” the economy through tax
cuts.


                                               12
       The remainder of this section derives the optimal h∗t (and hence the optimal τt∗ ) that
solves problem 1. It is easiest to start by assuming that τ0 and hence h0 is given, so that
log m0 = log Y0 = log Z0 + (1 − α) log K0 +α log h0 is also given. It is also useful to assume
that bailout payments haven’t yet started at time 0

Remark 1 in the appendix allows the government to freely choose τ0 (and hence Y0 and m0 )
and shows that condition (27) is always satisfied for sufficiently high values of Z0 .10
       Next, attaching a Lagrange multiplier λ > 0 to (25), defining

                                       (1 − ht )1−φ
         f (ht ) ≡ α log ht +                       + λατ (ht ) ,                                                  (28)
                                          1−φ
and observing that the first two terms inside the square brackets of (24) are exogenous,
implies that maximizing U is equivalent to maximizing Φ (ht ) , where
                   Z ∞                     Z ∞

To derive the optimal ht , I first derive an upper bound to Φ over all processes ht , and then
show how to attain it with an appropriate choice of ht .
       To this end, I consider an arbitrary path of e
                                                    ht and fix the associated process m

       If the initial conditions are such that W0 < L0 , then the initial payment L0 − W0 must be added to the
net present value of the guarantee. Even though this doesn’t change the nature of the solution for optimal
taxation, it does affect the cost-benefit evaluation of the bailout, that is described in section 3.3.

                                                               13

   Hence, maxmt ∈D(m0 ) J (mt ) provides an upper bound to the feasible payoffs Φ e

admissible process e

given by

      h∗t = arg                       max                           f (ht ) ,                 (34)

                  ht


denote the unconstrained maximum of f (ht ) , and noting that f (·) is concave, the process
h∗t that solves (34) is simply given by

                            α

Equation (36) suggests a simple two-step strategy for solving the government’s problem.
First, determine the optimal mt that solves maxmt ∈D(m0 ) J (mt ). In a second step, use equa-
tions (36) and (18) to determine the optimal process for hours and taxes given the optimal
m∗t from the first step. Intuitively, in the first step, the government determines a minimum
level of output that it wants to achieve, while in the second step it determines the hours and
the taxes that will implement that minimum level.


3.1    Determining m∗t

To determine m∗t one needs to solve the optimization problem

      V (Z0 , m0 ) =       max J (mt ) .                                                      (37)

This maximization problem shares several similarities with problems of irreversible invest-
ment. The only difference is that irreversible investment-problems feature maximization over
increasing rather than decreasing processes.
   The next proposition derives the solution to problem (37).

to keep m∗t unchanged. By contrast at point B it is optimal to instantaneously decrease m∗t
so as to move to point B ′ and restore the inequality Zt ≥ βm∗t .

where m∗t is given by (40) and h is given by (35). Equation (41) shows that the optimal tax
rate can be expressed as the ratio of two state variables, namely Zt and min0≤s≤t Zs .
   Inspecting (41), and recalling that τ is a decreasing function, reveals that the tax rate
is non-decreasing in Zt , i.e. the tax rate is higher in times of higher productivity. Figure
2 illustrates the dependence of τ on Zt . When Zt = min0≤s≤t Zs , (i.e. at times when the
government makes transfers to the private sector), the tax rate attains its lowest value. For
values of Zt that are to the right of min0≤s≤t Zs , the tax rate increases monotonically until

   The lower panel of the figure depicts the associated behavior of Yt . For values of Zt such

once τ becomes constant. This behavior of Yt is a manifestation of the two forces present
in the model; on the one hand, the government would like to set a constant tax rate for
standard labor tax smoothing reasons. On the other hand however, by making the tax rate
procyclical, the government can stabilize output Yt and accordingly ensure that the value of



                                                17
capital Wt does not fall further. This helps the government save transfers to the firm and
reduce the overall cost of the bailout.
   A further and somewhat surprising property of the optimal tax rate is its history depen-
dence despite dynamically complete markets. Equations (40) and (41) imply that the tax
rate is a non-increasing function of the running minimum of output and hence an increasing
function of the total payments to the financial firm by time t (by equation [22]). Alterna-
tively put, fixing a given level of productivity (Zt ) at time t, the model implies a positive
relationship between total bailout payments prior to time t and tax rates at time t.
   Equation (41) gives the optimal tax rate up to two constants h and β that depend on
the Lagrange multiplier λ. To complete the determination of the optimal tax rate, the next
Lemma shows how to compute λ.

3.3    The optimality of transfer payments to the financial firm

Sofar the analysis has simply assumed that an optimizing benevolent government will choose
to extend transfer payments to the financial firm. This subsection shows that this is indeed
the case when δ is large enough.

depend on δ. Accordingly, at any point in time, the representative agent’s welfare -assuming
a perpetual bailout- is at least as large as

                                                            . Comparing (43) and (44) reveals that a sufficient
condition for a perpetual bailout is

       (1 − α) log (1 − δ) + ψ2 < ψ1 .                                                                            (45)

     Since neither ψ1 nor ψ2 depend on δ, and log (1 − δ) can be made arbitrarily small as
δ → 1, there always exist sufficiently large values of δ that make condition (45) hold.
     It is important to stress that re-distribution concerns (which have been ignored sofar)
may have a substantial impact on the welfare implications of a perpetual bailout. In a
representative agent economy, the taxes raised through labor taxation get indirectly rebated
back to the consumer in the form of an increased value of his total (financial and non-
financial) wealth. In reality, a large fraction of the population has little or no financial
wealth and has to rely on labor income alone to finance consumption. If the government
cares mostly about these parts of the population, then the welfare calculations need to be
modified. In these modified calculations, the benefit of a bailout would stem from the fact
that the deadweight costs of bankruptcy reduce the capital stock and hence the wages of
workers.



4      Additional forms of financing bailouts and the evo-
       lution of debt

Sofar, bailouts could only be financed with distortionary labor taxes. In reality, bailouts
are at least partly financed by the beneficiaries of bailout payments. For instance, the

                                                                19
government may provide cash injections in exchange for equity holdings in the underlying
company.
   Given the stylized nature of the model, which abstracts from capital accumulation, tax-
ation of the existing capital stock in any shape or form is efficient, since it amounts to a
non-distortionary, lump-sum tax. As is well understood in the literature, however, such
forms of taxation can strain the government’s commitment abilities, since typically they
imply confiscatory capital taxation at time zero, accompanied by zero capital taxes in the
long run in order to promote capital accumulation.
   With this literature as a backdrop, it seems reasonable to place limits on the amount of
tax that can be raised by taxing the existing capital stock within the model. For instance,
such limitations can be motivated as resulting from pre-existing commitments to promote
the capital accumulation that led to the initial capital stock K0 .
   To be specific about the limits of capital taxation, this section continues to assume that
the debtholders of the financial institution cannot be taxed. Besides the theoretical reasons
laid out above, there are also some practical, institutional considerations, which make this
assumption plausible. If the debtholders are thought of as deposit holders in depository
institutions, then the presence of FDIC insurance along with the possibility to withdraw
deposits on demand and invest them in tax-advantaged forms (municipal bonds, gold bars
in safe deposit boxes etc.) would render deposit taxation practically very hard; in reality
such taxation would induce the sort of bank run that governments try to prevent in the first
place.
   The sort of taxation that is allowed, however, is taxation of the equityholders. Specifically,
this section allows for the possibility that part of the funds needed for the bailout may be
raised by having the government obtain either a) a fraction π1 ≥ 0 of the equities of the
financial firm and/or b) a share π2 ≥ 0 of the revenues of the representative financial firm.
The motivation for considering equities and revenue fractions as two alternative forms for
raising funds is based on proposals put forth during the crisis to fund part of the cost of
bailouts by either diluting current shareholders, or by placing some of the troubled assets in


                                              20
the hands of the government (or in a government-sponsored “bad bank”). Since the goal of
this section is mostly illustrative, I assume that π1 and π2 remain constant throughout time.

       In equation (47), ζ is the fraction of the bailout that can be financed by taxation of
the equity holders. Specification (47) is attractive, because it ensures that the value of
                                         R∞
equity is at least as large as −(1 − ζ)E0 0 ξξ0t dLt ≥ 0, and hence it implies allocations that
are compatible with limited liability of equity. Moreover, values of ζ smaller than one can
be motivated by the need to provide appropriate continuation incentives to managers and
workers, who may be holding deferred compensation in the form of equities.
       The government’s modified budget constraint is given by
            Z ∞                                   Z ∞                   Z                           ∞

       Combining (47) and (48) leads to
            Z ∞                               Z                 ∞

Since labor taxes are distortionary, (49) will hold with equality at the optimum. There
are two obvious, yet important, implications of equation (49). First, obtaining a share of

       To see that this is the total value of equity, note that equity value is given as the difference between
post-tax revenue and interest payments. By footnote 3 the payments to debtholders when debt is equal to
Lt are given by Lt (rt dt + dAt ) . Letting
                Z ∞                                 Z ∞                      

denote the total value of equity, using the fact that Lt (rt dt + dAt ) = −Lt (dξt /ξt − κt ξt dBt ) (by footnote
3), integrating by parts and ignoring terms having expectation equal to zero leads to (46).


                                                                        21
the dividends or the revenues of the financial firm is equivalent to limiting the cost of the
guarantee and hence the distortions associated with labor taxation. And second, since π1
and π2 do not appear in (49), the choice between taxation of the profits of the financial
firm or the underlying capital has no welfare consequences (since neither the maximization
objective [1], nor the modified budget constraint [49] depend on π1 or π2 .)
    The second implication of (49) depends crucially on the assumption of dynamically com-
plete markets. However, if one were to assume restrictions on the ability of the government
to issue debt (say for commitment-to-repay issues), then one form of financing may become
more preferable compared to the other. To illustrate this point, the next subsection considers
the stochastic process of government debt under the two alternatives (obtaining a fraction
of dividends or obtaining a fraction of revenues) and shows that in the presence of a debt
ceiling, the latter form of financing may be preferable.

5     Conclusion
The present paper considered optimal fiscal policy, when distortionary taxes are used to
finance bailouts. The key departure from pre-existing literature is that taxes are not used
to finance exogenous government expenditure, but rather endogenous transfer payments.

                                                22
   Within such a framework, taxes are not only used to finance the bailout, but also to
support real activity, raise the value of financial firms and hence reduce the (endogenously
determined) net present value of the taxes required to finance the transfers. As a result,
taxes turn out to be procyclical. This result is in contrast to a large literature (e.g. Barro
(1979), Lucas and Stokey (1983)), that finds a constant, acyclical tax rate to be optimal,
when government expenditures do not vary. Furthermore, tax rates are dependent on both
current productivity and past transfer payments. This history dependence of the tax rate
in a dynamically complete market is in contrast to Lucas and Stokey (1983), where the tax
rate depends only on current government expenditure.
   An extended version of the model considers additional forms of funding a bailout such as
obtaining equity shares of the company and diluting shareholders or obtaining shares of the
underlying capital stock. In a complete market it is only the total value of these claims that
affects welfare, and not the choice between the two. However, the stochastic process for debt
implied by the two alternatives is different. For instance, equity shares may lead to higher
levels of the debt to gdp ratio, which may be unattractive if the government is subject to a
debt ceiling.

where the first inequality follows from gm < 0. Since V (Z0 , m0 ) ≤ V Z0 , χ , and it is

The first step towards verifying that Vb (Zt , mt ) is the value function of (53) is contained in
the following Lemma

Lemma 3 Vb (Zt , mt ) satisfies the following differential inequality

         σ 2 Zt2 VbZZ + µZt VbZ − ρVb + η (Zt , mt ) ≤ 0                                                             (56)

       Proof of Lemma 3. By applying Ito’s Lemma to (54) and using (55), it is simple to

verify that17

When Zt ≤ Z (mt ) it follows that ω (Zt ) ≤ mt and hence

    η (Zt , mt ) − η (Zt , ω (Zt )) =      ηm (Zt , u) du < 0,                                                       (58)

Lemma 5 Let y (u) be given by (38) and β by (39). Then the value Z (mt ) that solves (52)
is given by Z (mt ) = βmt .

     Proof of Lemma 5.                            By Lemma 2, equation (52) has a unique solution Z (mt ) .
Accordingly, in order to prove the statement of Lemma 5, it suffices to show that
     Z ∞
           ηm (x, mt )
                       dx = 0 for all mt .                                                (61)

This proves (61).
     Combining (60), Lemma 5 and the definition of ω (·) yields (40). This concludes the
proof of Proposition 1.

Remark 1 The purpose of this remark is to show that supλ∈[0,∞) β (λ) < ∞. To see this,

side of equation (62) is zero. Since β is a continuous function of λ, supλ∈[0,∞) β (λ) is finite.

Since |ϕ2 | > 1, it follows that c0 + E0 0 e cs dLs > 0, irrespective of Z0 .

   Since Lc00 + E0 0 e−ρs c1s dLs > 0, equation (74) implies that sup0≤s≤t bs is minimal when
