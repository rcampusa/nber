                                            ABSTRACT

While the balance sheet structure of U.S. banks influences how they respond to liquidity risks, the
mechanisms for the effects on and consequences for lending vary widely across banks. We demonstrate
fundamental differences across banks without foreign affiliates versus those with foreign affiliates.
Among the nonglobal banks (those without a foreign affiliate), cross-sectional differences in response
to liquidity risk depend on the banks’ shares of core deposit funding. By contrast, differences across
global banks (those with foreign affiliates) are associated with ex ante liquidity management strategies
as reflected in internal borrowing across the global organization. This intra-firm borrowing by banks
serves as a shock absorber and affects lending patterns to domestic and foreign customers. The use
of official-sector emergency liquidity facilities by global and nonglobal banks in response to market
liquidity risks tends to reduce the importance of ex ante differences in balance sheets as drivers of
cross-sectional differences in lending.

1.       Introduction

The recent financial crisis underscored the importance of understanding the ways in which
liquidity conditions influence credit extension to domestic and foreign customers. We
investigate the distinctions between responses to liquidity risks across two types of large U.S.
banks, those that are domestically oriented and those that are more global in the sense of having
affiliates in foreign countries. As these banks have widely different business models, the
channels and magnitude of transmission of shocks into bank lending should differ significantly
by bank type. Small domestic banks have been shown to have relatively strong lending
responses to liquidity shocks (Kashyap and Stein 2000). Banks with foreign affiliates,
particularly large banks, have been shown to actively move funds across their organizations in
response to such shocks, potentially insulating lending in their home markets but transmitting
shocks abroad (Cetorelli and Goldberg 2012a). For both types of banks, changes in market
liquidity conditions are likely to influence lending differently in crisis periods than in normal (or
non-crisis) periods, in part due to their willingness to use liquidity provided through official
sector facilities.
         The extant literature shows that changing liquidity conditions alter the loan growth rates
and liquid asset mix within U.S. banks, and that differences documented within groups of large
and small U.S. banks relate to their ex ante balance sheet compositions (Cornett, McNutt,
Strahan and Tehranian 2011). 1 However, the links between liquidity risk and banks’ activities
warrant additional consideration in (at least) three ways. First, banks have distinct channels
through which they may adjust their balance sheets in response to liquidity strains. Loan growth
effects may differ across domestic and foreign customers. Also, for global banks, loan activity
within the organization and across affiliated banks may adjust, providing an extra margin of
response than can change the incidence of effects on domestic versus foreign customers
(Cetorelli and Goldberg 2012a).

1
 There is a growing literature on the link between liquidity shocks and bank lending using micro data. The prime
example is Khwaja and Mian (2008), who focus on the effect of changes in banks’ access to funding on their
domestic lending. Schnabl (2012) adds to this literature by exploring the differential effect of funding shocks on
banks affiliated with global institutions and those that are purely domestic but that rely on foreign financing.
Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012b) and Correa, Sapriza, and Zlate (2013) have studied the transmission of liquidity
shocks across borders through the activities of branches of global banks. However, none of these studies have
analyzed the effect of funding shocks and bank balance sheet characteristics on the international activities of global
banks.

                                                           1
        Second, these effects hitting the parent bank are not likely to transmit to the same degree
across all the foreign countries they interact with: global banks differentiate across countries
when they adjust their international exposures after a liquidity shock. The magnitude and
direction of adjustments depend on the business models of the respective banks (Cetorelli and
Goldberg 2012b). Some affiliate locations are more important for the investment strategies of
the whole organization, while other locations are more important for funding the organization.
        Third, the effects of liquidity risk on lending will differ during non-crisis and crisis
periods. The effects of the price of liquidity are likely to depend importantly on whether public
(or official) sector sources of liquidity are a competitively priced option for financial firms. As
Buch and Goldberg (2014) show, empirical studies of the effects of liquidity risk on bank
adjustments should control both for bank characteristics and the use of official sector liquidity
facilities. As market liquidity conditions deteriorate, weaker banks initially face the tightest
constraints from private sector funding sources. As banks turn to publically-provided liquidity,
this relieves some of the adjustment pressures associated with the elevated cost of liquidity from
private sources. These points need to be addressed, if possible, in econometric specifications.
        All these themes motivate, and are addressed by, the analysis of the present paper on the
experiences of U.S. banks. Our study is part of a broader initiative, described in Buch and
Goldberg (2014), in which researchers in eleven countries participating in the International
Banking Research Network (IBRN) independently analyze the effects of liquidity risk through
the cross-section of banks operating in their own countries. 2 The teams of researchers use
confidential data from regulatory reports filed within their countries, and then apply a common
empirical methodology that follows closely on two building blocks. The first methodological
building block is Cornett, McNutt, Strahan and Tehranian (2011, hereafter CMST2011) who
examine the role of ex ante bank balance sheet composition in explaining the ex post differences
across U.S. banks in their adjustment to liquidity risk conditions. Our paper is closest to that
building block as we also focus on the sample of U.S. banks, albeit using a longer period of time
for the analysis (from 2006 through 2012, instead of through 2009). However, our work is
distinguished in a number of substantive dimensions. We concentrate only on the large U.S.
banks, distinguish between those banks without versus those with foreign affiliates, and we focus

Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom.

more pointedly on different counterparties in the credit extension by these banks. We introduce
explicit treatment of international linkages through funding and lending of individual banks with
both their related and unrelated counterparties at home and abroad. In addition, we explicitly
examine how use of official sector liquidity facilities alters which balance sheet characteristics of
financial institutions drive differences in the transmission of liquidity risk to loan and credit
growth. The relative importance of the balance sheet characteristics evolve when official
liquidity facilities are accessed, with corresponding implications for the transmission of liquidity
shocks internationally through banks.
        The second methodological building block is Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012c), who
demonstrate that the business models of global banks and the characteristics of destination
countries, as investment or funding locations, drive their relative importance in banks’ internal
capital markets adjustment to shocks for individual banks. We build on those results by
combining bank balance sheet composition considerations with bank-destination considerations
in a single econometric specification.
        We confirm that elevated levels of liquidity risk have different effects on lending growth
across large U.S. banks. The ex-ante balance sheet characteristics that matter for these different
responses depend on whether or not the banks are global (have foreign affiliates). For non-
global banks, the key balance sheet characteristic that explains cross-sectional differences in loan
growth is the share of core deposits in bank funding, confirming one of the results in CMST2011
for large banks. By contrast, we find that differences in the transmission of liquidity risk into
lending across global banks are more strongly associated with their organizational liquidity
management strategies, as reflected in outstanding internal borrowing or lending with the rest of
their organization. Net internal capital market borrowing increases in periods with increased
liquidity risk for the U.S. banks that have higher outstanding unused commitments to their
customers and lower Tier 1 asset shares. This higher net borrowing is associated with relatively
more growth in domestic lending, foreign lending, credit, and cross-border lending. In all
regression specifications, the roles of cross-sectional differences in bank balance sheets are
diminished when liquidity risk conditions deteriorate substantially and banks access official
sector liquidity.
        Cross-border lending activity and internal borrowing and lending activity tend to be more
volatile than domestic lending and lending conducted through U.S. bank affiliate offices abroad.


                                                   3
The empirical model we test explains observed changes in domestic loan growth, as well as
changes in internal capital market positions, but does not capture as much of the cross-border
lending growth rates of U.S. banks. At the same time, differences across banks in cross-border
lending activities are sensitive to more of the bank balance sheet characteristics than any of the
other forms of lending. Our further investigation of drivers of cross-border and local lending
disaggregated by international locations shows that the effects of liquidity risk on these locations
vary considerably. Locations that are relatively important in the outstanding claims of the parent
bank tend to be supported to a greater degree when liquidity risk rises. When official sector
liquidity is used, different balance sheet characteristics matter compared with lower liquidity risk
periods.


2.      Empirical Method

As described in detail in Buch and Goldberg (2014), the first stage of our analysis explores the
effect of banks’ funding conditions on their loan growth and credit extension. We begin with the
following regression specification:

           ∆Yit = γ i + µt + ( β 0 + β 1 LIB _ OISt ) X i ,t −1 + (α 0 + α 1 LIB _ OISt ⋅ X i ,t −1 ) Fit + ε it   (1)

where Yit is a set of bank i balance sheet items that respond to funding availability. For our
purposes, this set includes loans to domestic counterparties, various measures of loans to foreign
counterparties, total credit extension, and net due to balances (which capture the net internal
borrowing of the parent bank from its domestic and foreign affiliates). This set of variables
provides a useful window into the real transmission of liquidity risk. X i ,t −1 is a vector of control

variables that captures the degree to which a bank is exposed to liquidity risk through ex ante
balance sheet composition and market access, as in CMST2011. These variables include the
liquidity of a bank’s on-balance-sheet assets, the funding sources of the bank, and a proxy for
bank size. The interaction between these terms and the LIBOR over OIS spread ( LIB _ OISt ) ,

which is used as a measure of overall liquidity in the financial system, reflect the sensitivity of
these intermediaries’ credit extension to funding risks in accordance with their balance sheet




                                                            4
composition. 3 As the baseline regression model includes bank and time fixed effects, γ i and µt ,

respectively, following Cornett et al (2011), the estimates of β reflect the importance of balance

sheet composition considerations as cross-sectional drivers of the response of the Yit variables to
liquidity risk. 4
         The measured effects of liquidity risk through these balance sheet channels included in
equation (1) may be affected by the intervention of a lender of last resort. The use of official
liquidity could mitigate some of the high costs of private market financing during the crisis, and
change how the banks’ manage their liquidity internally (through their affiliates) and externally
(through the interbank market). In the case of the United States, the relevant official liquidity
facilities for these banks include the Federal Reserve's discount window and the Term Auction
Facility (TAF), both of which are discussed in more detail below. To account for the potential
effect of the official liquidity provision econometrically, we add interaction terms between the
X i ,t −1 variables described above and a measure of central bank intervention Fit (Facility), an

indicator variable equaling 1 if a bank accessed the discount window or the TAF in period t.
Essentially, this specification controls for the possibility that the effects of private measures of
liquidity risk through balance sheet channels are biased indicators of bank-specific liquidity
constraints during periods characterized by use of central bank facilities. Formal tests of this
sensitivity are via the coefficient 𝛼1 in equation (1), while the overall sensitivity of the balance
sheet to liquidity risk in periods of central bank facility use is captured by β 1 + α 1 .
         The second stage of our analysis considers in greater detail the incidence of transmission
of liquidity risk to foreign countries through different types of claims extended. For this purpose
we exploit detailed information on the claims of parent banks on related and unrelated
counterparties in foreign countries. We estimate a modified version of (1) which permits each
bank to adjust its activities in different countries depending on the strategic importance of those
locations to that bank. Formally, we estimate the following equation:




3
  These specifications trace the effects of liquidity risk on the composition of bank balance sheets. In addition to
quantity adjustments, liquidity risk also can be reflected in the terms of loans and credit commitments to customers,
as shown in Bord and Santos (2014).
4
  We run alternative specifications excluding bank fixed effects. In those specifications the βs capture both absolute
and cross-sectional differences in balance sheet composition.

                                                          5
                ∆Yitc = γ i + µtr + ( β 0 + β 1 LIB _ OISt + β 2 X ic,t −1 + β 3 LIB _ OISt ⋅ X ic,t −1 ) X i ,t −1
                                                                                                                      (2)
                       + (α 1 LIB _ OISt + α 3 LIB _ OISt ⋅ X ic,t −1 ) X i ,t −1 ⋅ Fit + ε it

In specification (2) the dependent variable is a claim of bank i on a resident of country c at time
t, which can take the form of cross-border lending (claims) or local claims extended through
overseas branches or subsidiaries. We follow Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012c) and construct
measures of each country c as an investment or funding location for each bank i ( X ic,t −1 ) , with the

investment variable essentially capturing the scale of bank claims in each country relative to the
sum across all countries and the funding variable capturing the extent to which affiliate balance
sheets are locally funded. As in the previous specification, we test for the significance of the
sensitivity of foreign claims to liquidity risk in periods with no use of Federal Reserve facilities

( β ) and periods when the bank accessed these facilities β
     3                                                                         3
                                                                                   + α 3 . The estimating equation

includes region-time fixed effects to absorb changes in demand conditions in each region ( µtr ) .


3.       Data

The primary data for our empirical analysis is a panel dataset containing bank balance sheet and
other financial information collected from a number of sources. We obtain income statement,
balance sheet, and selected off-balance sheet data on bank holding companies from the FR Y-9C
form filed quarterly as part of regulatory reporting in the United States. We use the Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 form for detailed information on the
country-specific distribution of U.S. bank holding companies’ claims on foreign residents. We
focus on the period between the first quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2012. 5
         We follow CMST2011 and compute the following dependent variables for specification
(1): the change in loans during the quarter t divided by beginning of period (t-1) assets
( ∆Loansit )   and, the change in credit extension at t, which is the sum of loans plus undrawn

commitments divided by the sum of total assets plus undrawn commitments at the beginning of



5
  We begin in 2006 due to data availability issues. The FFIEC 009 reporting form changed in 2006, with some
relevant items not included in the form prior to 2006. Hereafter, we use interchangeably the terms “bank holding
company” and “bank”, recognizing that the commercial banks represent only a portion of the holding company.

                                                                6
the quarter ( ∆Creditit ) . 6 Given our focus on international transmission channels, we use loans

subdivided according to the domestic or foreign residence of the borrower. This residency split
is available only for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, which represent about 20 percent of
loans of both large banks without foreign affiliates and banks with foreign affiliates. Overall
lending to foreign counterparties can take the form of cross-border claims (lending from an
office outside of the country where the borrower resides) or foreign office claims (local lending
from the foreign office), with the latter possible only when the bank has branches or subsidiaries
established outside of the United States. In addition, we add a dependent variable relevant for
global banks, which is the change in net borrowing (liabilities minus claims) between the lead
commercial banking office of a bank holding company and its affiliates (domestic and foreign).
The change in “Net Due To” of the bank is scaled by the beginning of period total assets
( ∆NetDueToit )    and captures internal liquidity management within the banking organization both

domestically and internationally.
        The balance sheet characteristics identified as potentially influencing cross-sectional
variation in liquidity conditions for individual banks include the beginning of period: fraction of
a bank’s portfolio of assets that is illiquid ( IlliquidAssetsi ,t −1 ) , ratio of unused commitments to

commitments plus assets ( Commitmentsi ,t −1 ) , fraction of the banking organization’s balance

sheet financed with core deposits ( CoreDepositsi ,t −1 ) , banking organization’s regulatory Tier 1

risk-based capital to asset ratio (Tier1Capitali ,t −1 ) , and the banking organization’s Net Due To

position relative to total liabilities ( NetDueToi ,t −1 ) . All specifications also introduce the log of

total assets ( Assetsi ,t −1 ) as a control variable. Each of these variables is included in the

regressions individually and also interacted with the measure of aggregate liquidity conditions,
which is the U.S. dollar LIBOR over OIS spread, calculated as the average, within a quarter,
difference between the three-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) and the
Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) rate for Federal Funds. 7

  Appendix Table 1 presents a detailed description of construction of each variable used in the empirical analysis.
7
  The LIBOR-OIS spread can be calculated in different currencies, and is available for most of the countries
involved in the IBRN initiative, thus providing some degree of consistency across countries. It also correlates
closely with a broader set of liquidity measures as shown in Drehmann and Nikolau (2010). An alternative measure

                                                         7
         The Federal Reserve announced a number of extraordinary official liquidity measures to
address the strains in U.S. financial markets during the crisis. 8 Since the cost of funds at official
facilities was at times lower for banks than private market financing, we adjust the response of
individual banks to market prices of liquidity in order to account for their official sector facility
use. We collect data on the institutions that accessed the TAF and discount window by date and
aggregate by consolidated banking organization. We assign a value of Fit = 1 to any institution

that has a positive balance in these facilities within each quarter, with Fit = 0 otherwise.
         Finally, we refine the sample of institutions and observations used in our time-series
panel specifications. First, we restrict the sample to banks with more than $10 billion in total
assets (in 2012 dollars), drop non-bank financial institutions and reporters that were added in Q1
2009 (such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT, GMAC, and Metlife),
and drop observations where the quarterly change in real total assets is greater than 10 percent to
account for structure changes (such as mergers). We split the large banks in our sample into two
groups: (1) non-global banks, which are those large banks without foreign affiliates; and (2)
global banks, which are banks with branches or subsidiaries located in other countries. 9 We also
winsorize the dependent variables at the 1 and 99 percentiles.
         Table 1 reports the summary statistics of select banks’ financial statement items over the
period 2006Q1 to 2012Q4. Panel A describes data at the bank holding company level, covering
95 banks each for up to 28 quarters. We have a total of 1920 bank-quarter observations, of which
1415 are for non-global banks and 505 observations pertain to banks with foreign affiliates.
Panel A reports these statistics for all bank holding companies and quarters in the sample, and
separately for banks with foreign affiliates and banks without foreign affiliates. Global banks are
fewer in number, have a larger median size, and rely less on core deposits as a source of funding.
Global banks are exposed to larger contingent loan demand shocks, as the ratio of unused
commitments to total credit is larger, and actively borrow and lend within their broader
organization, with liquidity management through internal capital markets reflected in the Net
Due To rows. These differences across the banks with and without foreign affiliates will prove

is the TED spread, used in Cornett et al. (2011). However, the TED spread may incorporate credit risk associated
with the creditworthiness of local sovereign debt. We thank Ben Craig for these insights.

  This sample has a strong overlap with that described as large banks in Cornett et al (2011). That study set the large
bank cutoff as banks with assets exceeding $1billion. We choose the cutoff over bank holding company assets (as
opposed to commercial bank assets), and have more comparability in size in our two groups of large banks.

to be important in explaining cross-sectional variation in lending effects of liquidity shocks. In
addition, cross-border claims and flows associated with internal liquidity management are more
volatile than the domestic lending and the claims extended by foreign offices of U.S. banks.
       Table 1 Panel B summarizes data that add a location dimension to the time and bank-
specific dimensions already reported. Data are available with locational details for the banks that
have significant international exposures either through lending cross-border to foreign residents
or through claims via bank affiliate locations. Banks are exposed to more countries via cross-
border claims compared with through affiliate locations. In addition, a larger number of banks
hold cross-border claims than claims at their foreign affiliates. These differences and the cross-
country dimensionality of the data are reflected in the numbers of observations for analysis in
each category, at 22,171 versus 5,911.


4.     Regression Results

4.1    Bank-level regressions.
CMST2011 establish that diverse balance sheet structures are associated with diverse bank
reactions to funding shocks with their study emphasizing differences across small and large U.S.
banks. Our first set of estimations replicate their findings but use our sample of large banks, the
longer time period, and refinements that capture international banking considerations and use of
official sector liquidity. We further build on that work by dividing the group of large banks into
those without foreign affiliates (Table 2 Panel A) and those with foreign affiliates (Table 2 Panel
B), and by adding the various international dimensions for adjustment to changing liquidity risk
conditions. Table 2 provides results for the estimated coefficients of equation (1) for changes in
domestic C&I loans, foreign C&I loans, and credit (Panel A), with cross-border claims, foreign
office claims, and Net Due To added for the banks with foreign affiliates (Panel B). The bottom
section of each panel presents the implied marginal effects β 1 + α 1 of liquidity risk priced
through the LIBOR-OIS spread and operating through bank balance sheet channels for periods in
which individual institutions used central bank liquidity facilities. The sum β 1 + α 1 indicates the
contribution of each right hand side variable to the cross-sectional differences in lending growth
rates during periods when these banks are accessing a Federal Reserve liquidity facility.




                                                  9
         We find that banks’ liquidity risk exposure through their balance sheet composition is
associated with changes in their loan growth and credit extended, consistent with CMST2011. 10
However, there are substantive differences between our results and CMST2011. For instance,
we observe fewer statistically significant drivers of cross-sectional differences in lending and
credit growth across banks. In banks without foreign affiliates, those with higher shares of core
deposits in their funding mix, all else equal, are also those that sustain higher growth in domestic
lending when liquidity risk rises (column 1). Illiquid asset shares, commitment ratios, and Tier 1
capital ratios do not contribute significant explanatory power to the cross-sectional differences in
bank lending for this group of banks. During the crisis period when liquidity risk rises and some
institutions use official sector sources of liquidity, ex ante balance sheet distinctions across banks
no longer drive the cross-sectional difference in domestic loan growth rates in response to
LIBOR-OIS. However, deposit funding shares matter for cross-sectional differences in credit
growth and foreign lending during stress periods. The size and significance of the effects during
these periods are presented in the lower rows of Table 2, Panel A. Particularly interesting is the
sign pattern of these effects. Those banks with higher deposit shares provide relatively more
support to credit and less support to foreign loans at times when they are accessing official sector
liquidity, although facility use also raises the average level of foreign loans across banks relative
to without facility use. Comparison of the R-squared statistics for these banks shows that the
model does much better at capturing variation in domestic lending growth (adjusted R2 of 0.15)
and credit growth (adjusted R2 of 0.18) than it does for variation in foreign lending growth
(adjusted R2 of 0.02).
         We conduct a simple exercise to assess the economic magnitude of these results in the
sample of large banks without foreign affiliates. In particular, we assume an increase of 100
basis points in the LIBOR over OIS spread and compare its impact on banks located in the 25th
percentile and 75th percentile of the distribution of those balance sheet characteristics that
significantly affect bank lending. In the first set of results described above, core deposits are
significant determinants of both domestic and foreign C&I lending. Using the coefficient on the

  We have successfully replicated the Cornett et al. 2011 results for the types of samples of institutions, dependent
variables, and time period they examine (tables not shown). In keeping with discussion in that study, we will not
provide an interpretation of the reasons that (log) real assets may contribute to cross-sectional differences across
banks in balance sheet adjustment to liquidity risk. In addition, while all of the reported regression specifications
contain bank fixed effects, we also run and report the specifications excluding bank fixed effects Appendix Table 3).
The findings reported in our text are robust to exclusion of bank fixed effects.

                                                         10
interaction between core deposits and the LIBOR over OIS spread (0.007) reported in Panel A of
Table 2, we find that a bank with a share of core deposits relative to total assets from the 25th
percentile of the distribution (58 percent) would lend $211 million less in domestic C&I loans
compared with a bank with a deposit share at the 75th percentile (76 percent). This difference is
sizeable, as it represents about 9 percent of total domestic C&I loans of the median bank
(without foreign offices). 11 At the same time, banks with more core deposits in their balance
sheets would lend about $40 million more to foreign residents as a results of the increase of 100
basis points in the LIBOR over OIS spread. These results confirm that the impact of liquidity
risks on bank lending outcomes in relation to cross-sectional differences in balance sheet
composition is economically important, but only through the deposit share distinction in this
sample of banks.
         Next, Table 2 Panel B presents the results of regression specifications for the large U.S.
banks that have foreign affiliates, sometimes referred to as U.S. global banks. These regression
specifications explain significantly more, at approximately 40 percent, of the time series and
cross-sectional variation in domestic C&I lending and credit growth. The model explains closer
to 10 percent of the variation in C&I lending to foreign resident borrowers, total cross-border
lending, and lending by affiliate offices. This weak fit is despite the more substantial role that
foreign lending plays in the global bank balance sheets. Foreign lending is 26 percent of global
banks’ C&I lending compared with 1 percent for non-global banks. .
         In global banks, internal liquidity management is a consistent driver of explaining cross-
sectional differences in loan growth in response to changing liquidity risk. Those banks with
higher net borrowing from affiliated entities had consistently strong loan growth (domestic,
foreign, cross-border, credit) when liquidity risks increased. As shown in the last column of
Table 2 Panel B, these global banks with larger unused credit commitments borrow relatively
more (net) from their affiliates when liquidity conditions worsen and then sustain lending to a
greater degree.
         Another interesting result is the way in which drivers of cross-sectional differences across
the large global banks change when the global banks access official sector liquidity. Tier1
capital ratios gain importance, with higher capitalized banks lending and supporting credit to a

11
  To arrive at this dollar amount, we multiply the growth rate given by the product of the coefficient on the
interaction term from Table 2 and the difference in the share of deposits of banks in the selected percentiles, by the
total assets of the median bank in the sample of financial institutions that do not have any foreign affiliates.

                                                           11
greater degree than less capitalized banks. When official liquidity is in use, the banks that have
higher illiquid asset shares and more Tier 1 capital reduce net borrowing from foreign affiliates
to a greater degree. The observation that higher internal capital market borrowing is used to
support loan growth in global banks is consistent with evidence provided by Cetorelli and
Goldberg (2012 b,c): the official liquidity provision may have helped insulate adverse
international transmission to affiliated firms. The official liquidity also helped reduce
transmission to foreign markets in banks that were relatively well capitalized and which also had
relatively high shares of illiquid assets. Relatively high core deposit shares of banks were not
associated with this same pattern of differences in activation of internal capital markets.
        In terms of economic magnitudes, we replicate the quantitative analysis described above
using information on the banks with foreign affiliates. First, we compare the difference in
lending growth of a bank in the 75th percentile of the Net Due To distribution (a ratio of Net Due
To over Total Liabilities of 6.6 percent) to a bank in the 25th percentile (a ratio of 1.2 percent)
when there is a 100 basis point increase in the LIBOR over OIS spread. Banks in the higher part
of the distribution support their domestic C&I lending by about $800 million more and support
foreign C&I lending by $167 million more. These differences in lending represent about 5
percent and 27 percent of the lending done by the median bank in each category respectively,
and are sizeable differences. The balance sheet differences in relation to liquidity risk
transmission are even larger when we compare banks at different points of the Tier 1 capital ratio
distribution during times when banks access official liquidity facilities. A bank in the 75th
percentile of the Tier 1 capital ratio distribution (a ratio of 12.9 percent) lends about $6,500
million more to its domestic C&I customers than a bank in the 25th percentile (with a Tier 1 ratio
of 8.6 percent) and also lends about $211 million more to foreign customers. These differences
represent more than 30 percent of the median bank’s loans in each category. This evidence
confirms that the internal liquidity management of a bank and, especially, its regulatory capital
ratio are important economic determinants of differences across banks in lending in periods of
liquidity stress.


4.2     Bank-country-level regressions.
Finally, we examine whether the dynamics of transmission internationally are better captured by
specifications that contain breakdowns of data by foreign locations. The next set of results use


                                                  12
locational data for each of the banks, with observations that cover claims by bank, by quarter,
and by country location. The sample excludes banks with claims too small to qualify for
locational reporting. Individual banks extend cross-border claims with up to 87 countries, with
the median number of countries per bank equal to 27. The corresponding numbers of countries
for extension of local claims are 57 and 7 respectively. In addition, we use data on internal
liquidity management that is specific to each location. Specifically, we now use a measure of the
amount of net borrowing by a foreign affiliate from the rest of the banking organization, as a
fraction of the consolidated bank’s assets. This net borrowing measure is different from that
used in the specifications shown in Table 2. The former assesses net borrowing from the
perspective of the head office of the banking organization, while the latter captures net
borrowing from the perspective of the foreign affiliate.
        Table 3 provides results for the effect of liquidity conditions on the growth of cross-
border and foreign affiliates claims based on estimating equation (2). This specification permits
bank business models to take into account the relative importance of countries as important
investment locations or as important funding locations in adjusting lending and internal capital
flows across foreign locations. The first three columns of Table 3 show that drivers of cross-
sectional differences in cross-border claims growth as liquidity risks rise include parent bank
illiquid asset shares, core deposits, and net borrowing and lending within the organization. Banks
with higher illiquid investment shares sustain their cross-border claims to core investment
locations to a greater degree than to other locations. Banks with greater core deposit funding
shares reduce growth in cross-border claims more than those banks with lower deposit funding
shares. It is possibly the case that this occurs because the banks with higher core deposit shares
are also the banks with a more pronounced focus on U.S. domestic lending as their core business
activities.
        We also observe that, conditional on higher liquidity risks, the growth in claims to a
specific country is complementary to relatively higher net borrowing by (or lower net lending to)
that location’s foreign affiliate from the rest of the organization. However, the importance of
these business model differences for cross-sectional differences in loan growth is less
pronounced during the crisis period when central bank liquidity facilities are accessed. 12


12
 As a robustness check, we have excluded Citigroup, which has activities in a large number of locations
worldwide. The results are largely robust to this exclusion.

                                                        13
        Overall, however, it is important to recall that there is substantial time series and cross –
sectional variation in cross-border lending growth. The regression fit measures show that very
little of the variation in cross-border lending growth is accounted for by the empirical
specification, even with the inclusion of time-country fixed effects and differentiation across
locations by their investment or funding status.
        The last three columns of Table 3 report results for estimates of equation (2) using the
bank-country-specific changes in foreign office claims as the dependent variable. Less than 20
percent of the time series and cross-sectional variation is explained by the regression
specification. The liquidity risk proxies working through the balance sheet of the parent
organization do not appear to be strong drivers of location-specific loan growth in affiliate
locations. Banks appear to provide less credit through their foreign affiliates, in core funding
locations, in periods of liquidity stress. However, is the ex ante differences across banks are not
significant drivers of cross-sectional variation in lending during the period when banks accessed
the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities. In these same periods, parent banks that have more
unused credit commitments and that fund themselves with more core deposits tend to sustain
relatively more claims through their foreign affiliates. Overall, however, liquidity risk
interacting with the balance sheet of the parent organization does not explain a large fraction of
the substantial cross-sectional variation of cross-border claims or the claims booked by foreign
affiliates.


5.      Concluding remarks
        This paper is part of a broader cross-country initiative to better understand the movement
of international capital flows through banks. We have demonstrated that the global business
model of some U.S. banks is associated with different drivers of cross-sectional variation in loan
growth in response to changing liquidity risk conditions. Large U.S. banks without foreign
affiliates have loan growth rates that differ cross-sectionally mainly in line with their reliance on
core deposits in bank funding. Large U.S. global banks have loan growth rates that differ mainly
in relation to their use of liquidity management within the broader organization. Those banks
that tend to borrow more from affiliates also have more stable domestic lending and credit
growth as liquidity risk conditions worsen. The degree to which these organizations adjust the



                                                   14
borrowing and lending vis-à-vis affiliates is, in turn, influenced by the balance sheet composition
of the parent organization.
       During more extreme liquidity risk conditions and when banks access official liquidity
facilities, different characteristics of banks matter for cross-sectional lending variation. Banks
with higher Tier 1 capital have higher growth rates in domestic lending and credit and rely
relatively less on borrowing from their affiliates. Use of official liquidity is associated with less
growth in net borrowing from affiliates for those banks with more illiquid assets and fewer core
deposits. This type of internal net borrowing and organizational liquidity management becomes
less important for cross-sectional distinctions across banks in lending to domestic and foreign
customers. Official sector liquidity support can be important for containing adverse liquidity risk
effects on the real economy and transmission abroad.

Table 1: Summary Statistics for Large U.S. Bank-holding Companies, 2006Q1 to 2012Q4
Panel A reports summary statistics for growth in liquid assets, loans, credit, net due to (head office), and domestic and foreign C&I lending as
well as other firm characteristics and central bank facility use. The data are observed quarterly from 2006Q1-2012Q4. Panel B reports summary
statistics for growth in foreign-office claims, cross-border claims, and net internal borrowing. Note: foreign-office claims are not available on an
immediate counterparty basis prior to 2006Q1, so the data in Panel B are observed quarterly from 2006Q2 to 2012Q4. Beginning-of-quarter
assets are used to standardize most of the growth variables in Panels A and B. Assets and commitments, together, are used to standardize growth
in credit. The panel is restricted to bank holding companies with greater than $10 billion in total assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the
sample. To mitigate the effect of bank mergers on the dependent variables, banks are excluded in a particular quarter when asset growth exceeds
10%. Firm characteristic data in Panel A come from the FR Y9-C and are aggregated to the highest domestic holding company. On a quarterly
basis, banks are split into subgroups: banks with foreign affiliates and banks without foreign affiliates. Banks are judged to have a foreign affiliate
if they report positive aggregate foreign-office claims in the FFIEC 009. Banks that report zero foreign-office claims or do not report the FFIEC
009 are considered not to have a foreign affiliate. In Panel A, the net due to (or due from) variable, reported in the FFIEC 031, measures from the
perspective of a bank’s head office total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related domestic and international offices. Given that
the flows include domestic intra-bank lending, net due to observations are excluded for banks without foreign affiliates. In Panel B, the net due to
(or due from) variable, reported in the FFIEC 009, measures from the perspective of a bank’s foreign office total net internal lending (or
borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related offices in other countries. Facility use is a dummy variable indicating whether or not a bank accessed the
Federal Reserve’s Discount Window and Term Auction Facility in a particular quarter. The underlying loan-level data on central bank facility use
are available through Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ website. In Panel B, international claims are consolidated into regional aggregates for
smaller and static exposures. Exposures to a particular country are grouped into a regional aggregate if total cross-border claims are less than $2
billion across all banks and quarters in the sample or growth in cross-border claims, at the bank level, is zero for greater than 30% of the
observations in the sample for the particular country. Core investment reflects the ratio of a bank’s total foreign claims in a particular country
(foreign-office and cross-border) over their total foreign claims across all countries. Core funding is a ratio of locally-raised deposits over locally-
raised deposits plus net due inflow in a particular country. Growth variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Note: In Panel B, the
growth variables, originally reported in growth relative to assets (percent), have been multiplied by a factor of 1,000.

Table 2: Credit and Lending Effects of Liquidity Risk using Bank-Specific Data
This table reports the effects of liquidity risk conditions, central bank facility use, and firm characteristics on growth in domestic and foreign C&I
lending and credit. Panels A and B respectively observe samples of banks without and with foreign affiliates, and Panel B includes additional
regressions for changes in aggregate cross-border claims, foreign-office claims, and net due to (or net due from). The underlying fixed effects
regressions are presented in Appendix 3. Results without fixed effects are presented in Appendix 4. Reported separately in each panel are the
implied marginal effects for periods in which individual institutions used central bank liquidity facilities. The reported coefficients are the linear
combination of the coefficients on the respective LIBOR-OIS and LIBOR-OIS*Facility interaction terms. Beginning-of-quarter assets are used to
standardize growth in liquid assets, loans, and net due to, while assets and commitments, together, are used to standardize credit growth. The data
are quarterly from 2006Q1 to 2012Q4 for a panel of bank holding companies. The panel is restricted to bank holding companies with greater than
$10 billion in total assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the sample. Banks are judged to have a foreign affiliate if they report positive
aggregate foreign-office claims in the FFIEC 009. Banks that report zero foreign-office claims or do not report the FFIEC 009 are considered not
to have a foreign affiliate. To mitigate the effect of bank mergers on the dependent variable, banks are excluded in a particular quarter when asset
growth exceeds 10%. Firm characteristic data comes from the FR Y9-C and are aggregated to the highest domestic holding company. The net due
to (or due from) variable is reported in the FFIEC 031 and measures a bank’s total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related
domestic and international offices from the perspective of the head office. Given that the flows include domestic intra-bank lending, net due to
observations are excluded for banks without foreign affiliates. Loan-level data on banks’ borrowing through the Discount Window and Term
Auction Facility are available through Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ website. The LIBOR-OIS is the quarterly average of the daily
difference between the London Interbank Offered Rate and the effective federal funds rate. Growth variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th
percentiles. All specifications include bank and time fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank. ***, **, and * respectively indicate
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

Table 3: International Claims and Liquidity Risk, using Bank-Location-Specific Data
This table reports the marginal effects, as liquidity conditions worsen, of firm characteristics and central bank credit facility use on growth in
country-specific cross-border and foreign-office claims. The underlying fixed effects regressions are presented in Appendix 5. For each firm
characteristic variable and corresponding interactions with Core Funding and Core Investment, the No Use, Use, and Difference columns
respectively represent, from the underlying regressions, the coefficient on the LIBOR-OIS interaction terms, the linear combination of the
coefficients on the LIBOR-OIS and LIBOR-OIS*Facility interaction terms, and the difference between the two. Beginning-of-quarter assets are
used to standardize growth in the dependent variables. Cross-border and foreign-office claims are measured on an immediate counterparty basis.
The data are observed quarterly from 2006Q2 to 2012Q4 for a panel of U.S. bank holding companies. The panel is restricted to bank-holding
companies with greater than $10 billion in total assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the sample. For growth in foreign-office claims, the
sample excludes observations when country-specific foreign-office claims are zero in both the current and previous quarter. To mitigate the effect
of bank mergers on the dependent variables, banks are excluded in quarters when asset growth exceeds 10%. Firm characteristic data comes from
the FR Y9-C and are aggregated to the highest domestic holding company. Data on country-specific bank exposures are from the FFIEC 009. The
net due to (or due from) variable measures a bank’s total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related offices in other countries.
Reported in the FFIEC 009, these flows reflect the perspective of the foreign office. International claims are consolidated into regional aggregates
for smaller and static exposures. Exposures to a particular country are grouped into a regional aggregate if total cross-border claims are less than
$2 billion across all banks and quarters in the sample or there is zero growth in cross-border claims, at the bank level, for greater than 30% of the
observations in the sample for the particular country. Exposures to Caribbean countries are also excluded. Loan-level data on banks’ borrowing
through the Discount Window and Term Auction Facility are available through Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ website. The LIBOR-OIS is
the quarterly average of the daily difference between the London Interbank Offered Rate and the effective federal funds rate. Growth variables
are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. All specifications include country-time and bank fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by
bank. ***, **, and * respectively indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level. The dependent variables, originally reported in growth
relative to assets (percent), have been multiplied by a factor of 1,000.

Appendix 2: Non-winsorized Summary Statistics for Large U.S. Banks, 2006Q1 to 2012Q4
Contrary to Table 1, this table reports the growth variables prior to winsorization (1st and 99th percentiles) and does not exclude from the sample
bank observations in quarters when asset growth exceeds ten percent. Panel A reports summary statistics for growth in liquid assets, loans, credit,
net due to (head office), and domestic and foreign C&I lending as well as other firm characteristics and central bank facility use. The data are
observed quarterly from 2006Q1-2012Q4. Panel B reports summary statistics for growth in foreign-office claims, cross-border claims, and net
internal borrowing. Note: foreign-office claims are not available on an immediate counterparty basis prior to 2006Q1, so the data in Panel B are
observed quarterly from 2006Q2 to 2012Q4. Beginning-of-quarter assets are used to standardize most of the growth variables in Panels A and B.
Assets and commitments, together, are used to standardize growth in credit. The panel is restricted to bank holding companies with greater than
$10 billion in total assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the sample. Firm characteristic data in Panel A come from the FR Y9-C and are
aggregated to the highest domestic holding company. On a quarterly basis, banks are split into subgroups: banks with foreign affiliates and banks
without foreign affiliates. Banks are judged to have a foreign affiliate if they report positive aggregate foreign-office claims in the FFIEC 009.
Banks that report zero foreign-office claims or do not report the FFIEC 009 are considered not to have a foreign affiliate. In Panel A, the net due
to (or due from) variable, reported in the FFIEC 031, measures from the perspective of a bank’s head office total net internal lending (or
borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related domestic and international offices. Given that the flows include domestic intra-bank lending, net due to
observations are excluded for banks without foreign affiliates. In Panel B, the net due to (or due from) variable, reported in the FFIEC 009,
measures from the perspective of a bank’s foreign office total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related offices in other countries.
Facility use is a dummy variable indicating whether or not a bank accessed the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window and Term Auction Facility in
a particular quarter. The underlying loan-level data on central bank facility use are available through Federal Reserve Board of Governors’
website. In Panel B, international claims are consolidated into regional aggregates for smaller and static exposures. Exposures to a particular
country are grouped into a regional aggregate if total cross-border claims are less than $2 billion across all banks and quarters in the sample or
growth in cross-border claims, at the bank level, is zero for greater than 30% of the observations in the sample for the particular country. Core
Investment reflects the ratio of a bank’s total foreign claims in a particular country (foreign-office and cross-border) over their total foreign claims
across all countries. Core Funding is a ratio of locally-raised deposits over locally-raised deposits plus net due inflow in a particular country.
Note: In Panel B, the growth variables, originally reported in growth relative to assets (percent), have been multiplied by a factor of 1,000.

Appendix 3: Underlying Regressions for Credit and Lending Effects of Liquidity Risk
The coefficients reported reflect the underlying results for Table 2. This table reports the effects of liquidity risk conditions, central bank facility use, and firm characteristics on growth in domestic and
foreign C&I lending and credit. Panels A and B (from Table 2) respectively observe samples of banks without and with foreign affiliates, and Panel B includes additional regressions for changes in
aggregate cross-border claims, foreign-office claims, and net due to (or net due from). Beginning-of-quarter assets are used to standardize growth in liquid assets, loans, and net due to, while assets and
commitments, together, are used to standardize credit growth. The data are observed quarterly from 2006Q1 to 2012Q4 for a panel of bank holding companies. The panel is restricted to bank holding
companies with greater than $10 billion in total assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the sample. Banks are judged to have a foreign affiliate if they report positive aggregate foreign-office
claims in the FFIEC 009. Banks that report zero foreign-office claims or do not report the FFIEC 009 are considered not to have a foreign affiliate. To mitigate the effect of bank mergers on the
dependent variable, banks are excluded in a particular quarter when asset growth exceeds 10%. Firm characteristic data comes from the FR Y9-C and are aggregated to the highest domestic holding
company. The net due to (or due from) variable is reported in the FFIEC 031 and measures a bank’s total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related domestic and international offices
from the perspective of the head office. Given that the flows include domestic intra-bank lending, net due to observations are excluded for banks without foreign affiliates. Loan-level data on banks’
borrowing through the Discount Window and Term Auction Facility are available through Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ website. The LIBOR-OIS is the quarterly average of the daily difference
between the London Interbank Offered Rate and the effective federal funds rate. Growth variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. All specifications include bank and time fixed effects.
Standard errors are clustered by bank. ***, **, and * respectively indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

Appendix 4: Credit and Lending Effects of Liquidity Risk without Bank Fixed Effects
The model specifications for Appendix 2 exclude bank fixed-effects but are otherwise identical to Table 2. This table reports the effects of
liquidity risk conditions, central bank facility use, and firm characteristics on growth in domestic and foreign C&I lending and credit. Panels A
and B respectively observe samples of banks without and with foreign affiliates, and Panel B includes additional regressions for changes in
aggregate cross-border claims, foreign-office claims, and net due to (or net due from). Reported separately in each panel are the implied marginal
effects for periods in which individual institutions used central bank liquidity facilities. The reported coefficients are the linear combination of the
coefficients on the respective LIBOR-OIS and LIBOR-OIS*Facility interaction terms. Beginning-of-quarter assets are used to standardize growth
in liquid assets, loans, and net due to, while assets and commitments, together, are used to standardize credit growth. The data are quarterly from
2006Q1 to 2012Q4 for a panel of bank holding companies. The panel is restricted to bank holding companies with greater than $10 billion in total
assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the sample. Banks are judged to have a foreign affiliate if they report positive aggregate foreign-
office claims in the FFIEC 009. Banks that report zero foreign-office claims or do not report the FFIEC 009 are considered not to have a foreign
affiliate. To mitigate the effect of bank mergers on the dependent variable, banks are excluded in a particular quarter when asset growth exceeds
10%. Firm characteristic data comes from the FR Y9-C and are aggregated to the highest domestic holding company. The net due to (or due
from) variable is reported in the FFIEC 031 and measures a bank’s total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related domestic and
international offices from the perspective of the head office. Given that the flows include domestic intra-bank lending, net due to observations are
excluded for banks without foreign affiliates. Loan-level data on banks’ borrowing through the Discount Window and Term Auction Facility are
available through Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ website. The LIBOR-OIS is the quarterly average of the daily difference between the
London Interbank Offered Rate and the effective federal funds rate. Growth variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. All
specifications include time fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank. ***, **, and * respectively indicate significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% level.

Appendix 5: Underlying Regressions for International Claims and Liquidity Risk, using
Bank-Location-Specific Data
This table reports fixed effects regressions of quarterly growth in country-specific cross-border and foreign-office claims on LIBOR-OIS, central
bank facility access, firm characteristics, and interactions. The coefficients reported reflect the underlying results for Table 3. Beginning-of-
quarter assets are used to standardize growth in the dependent variables. Cross-border and foreign-office claims are measured on an immediate
counterparty basis. The data are observed quarterly from 2006Q2 to 2012Q4 for a panel of U.S. bank holding companies. The panel is restricted
to bank-holding companies with greater than $10 billion in total assets (2012 prices) during its final quarter in the sample. For growth in foreign-
office claims, the sample excludes observations when country-specific foreign-office claims are zero in both the current and previous quarter. To
mitigate the effect of bank mergers on the dependent variables, banks are excluded in quarters when asset growth exceeds 10%. Firm
characteristic data comes from the FR Y9-C and are aggregated to the highest domestic holding company. Data on country-specific bank
exposures are from the FFIEC 009. The net due to (or due from) variable measures a bank’s total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all
its related offices in other countries. Reported in the FFIEC 009, these flows reflect the perspective of the foreign office. International claims are
consolidated into regional aggregates for smaller and static exposures. Exposures to a particular country are grouped into a regional aggregate if
total cross-border claims are less than $2 billion across all banks and quarters in the sample or there is zero growth in cross-border claims, at the
bank level, for greater than 30% of the observations in the sample for the particular country. Exposures to Caribbean countries are also excluded.
Loan-level data on banks’ borrowing through the Discount Window and Term Auction Facility are available through Federal Reserve Board of
Governors’ website. The LIBOR-OIS is the quarterly average of the daily difference between the London Interbank Offered Rate and the
effective federal funds rate. Growth variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. All specifications include country-time and bank
fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank. ***, **, and * respectively indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level. The
dependent variables, originally reported in growth relative to assets (percent), have been multiplied by a factor of 1,000.
