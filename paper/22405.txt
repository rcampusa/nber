                                              ABSTRACT

We present evidence of a causal impact of research and development (R&D) tax incentives on innovation.
We exploit a change in the asset-based size thresholds for eligibility for R&D tax subsidies and implement
a Regression Discontinuity Design using administrative tax data on the population of UK firms. There
are statistically and economically significant effects of the tax change on both R&D and patenting
(even when quality-adjusted). R&D tax price elasticities are large at about 2.6, probably because the
treated group is from a sub-population of smaller firms and subject to financial constraints. There does
not appear to be pre-policy manipulation of assets around the thresholds that could undermine our
design. Over the 2006-11 period aggregate business R&D would be around 10% lower in the absence
of the tax relief scheme. We also show that the R&D generated by the tax policy creates positive spillovers
on the innovations of techno-logically related firms.

1. Introduction
     Innovation is recognized as the major source of growth in modern economies. But because of
knowledge externalities, private returns on research and development (R&D) are lower than their
social returns, hence the need for some public subsidy.1 As a consequence, almost every country
treats R&D investments more generously than capital investment, but the majority of OECD coun-
tries (and many developing countries) also have additional fiscal incentives such as enhanced de-
ductions for R&D. Over the last two decades, these tax incentives have grown more popular com-
pared to more direct R&D subsidies to firms.2 One reason for this shift is that subsidizing R&D
through the tax system rather than direct grants reduces administrative burden and mitigates the
risk of “picking losers” (e.g. choosing firms with low private and social returns due to political
connections).
     But do R&D tax incentives actually work? The existing literature has several serious short-
comings that we seek to address in this paper. First, researchers have mainly focused on the effects
of taxes on R&D whereas the point of the policy is to try and stimulate innovation.3 The tax incen-
tive could increase observed R&D without having much effect on innovation if, for example, firms
re-labeled existing activities as R&D to take advantage of the tax credits or only expanded very
low quality R&D projects. We address this issue by analyzing the effect of R&D tax incentives not
only on R&D expenditures but also on patenting activity (and other firm performance measures
such as TFP and size). We also look at the quality of these additional innovations through various
commonly used measures of patent value.
     A second problem with the literature is that it has proven difficult to come up with compelling
causal designs to evaluate the impact of R&D tax policies. Evaluations at the macro-economic
(e.g. Bloom, Griffith and Van Reenen, 2002; Corrado et al., 2015) or state level (e.g. Wilson, 2009;
Moretti and Wilson, 2015) face the problem that changes of policies are likely to be coincident


1
  Typical results find marginal social rates of return to R&D between 30% and 50% compared to private returns
between from 7% to 15% (Hall, Mairesse and Mohnen, 2010). Endogenous growth theories (Romer 1990, Aghion
and Howitt 1992) provide several reasons why private innovative activities do not take into account externalities over
producers and consumers, and produce less than optimal innovations and growth. For evidence showing R&D exter-
nalities, see for example Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen (2013). There is also evidence that these spillovers
are partially localized geographically, so the country where the R&D is performed obtains a disproportionate share of
the productivity benefits, at least initially (Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Henderson, 1993).
2
  Over the period 2001-2011, R&D tax incentives were expanded in 19 out of 27 OECD countries (OECD 2014).
3
  There is a large literature on the effects of public R&D grants on firm and industry outcomes such as Einiö (2014),
González, Jamandreu and Pazó (2005), Goodridge et al. (2015), Jaffe and Le (2015), Lach (2002), Moretti, Stein-
wender and Van Reenen (2015) and Takalo, Tanayama, Toivanen (2013). The earlier literature is surveyed in David,
Hall and Toole (2000).



                                                          1
with many unobserved factors that may influence R&D. On the other hand, variation at the firm
level is often limited as the tax rules apply to all firms and the heterogeneity in tax prices that does
exist are driven by endogenous firm choices (e.g. R&D spending, tax exhaustion, etc.).
     To address this identification problem, we exploit a policy reform in the UK which raised the
size threshold under which firms can access the more generous tax regime for small- and medium-
sized enterprises (SME). Importantly, the new tax threshold introduced was unique to the R&D
tax policy so it did not overlap with access to other programs or taxes. Prior to the major change
in 2008 the threshold was based on the European Commission definition of an SME. Given this
change in tax thresholds, we can implement a Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design (e.g. Lee and
Lemieux 2010) looking at differences in R&D and innovation around the new SME threshold,
which was based on accounting data pre-dating the policy change. To assess the validity of our
design we confirm covariate balance and the absence of bunching of the running variable (assets)
around the threshold prior to the policy change. And we can show that there were no discontinuities
in R&D, patents or any other outcomes in the years prior to the policy change.
     A third problem with the literature is that data limitations have meant a focus on large firms.
Since R&D is concentrated, aggregated data will also be effectively dominated by large firms.
Accounting regulations in most countries only require larger (usually public listed) firms to report
R&D. As a consequence there has been a particular focus on US Compustat firms.4 But since at
least Arrow (1962) it has been recognized that financial markets may under-supply credit for R&D
and these problems are likely to be particularly acute for SMEs.5 Hence, extrapolating from the
innovation response of large firms to policy changes may be misleading. We use a new merged
dataset containing the universe of UK firms. This combines confidential HMRC data (the UK
equivalent of the US IRS) on R&D levels, firm accounts from the population of public and private
firms, and patents from 60 patent offices around the world. The data is available before and after
the R&D tax change.
     We find large effects of the R&D Tax Scheme on R&D and patents. As a result of the policy,
R&D approximately doubled in the treated firms and patenting rose by about 60% (and there is no




4
  Rao (2015) has used US administrative tax data on the firm population to look at the impact of tax credits on R&D
and Agrawal, Rosell and Simcoe (2014) look at the tax effect on investment for small private Canadian firms.
5
  Since R&D costs are mainly people such as scientists, it is hard to post collateral to borrow against R&D projects.
Furthermore, asking outsiders for finance may reveal the innovation and so undermine its value.




                                                         2
evidence that these innovations were of lower value). We estimate an elasticity of R&D with re-
spect to its tax-adjusted user cost of about 2.6 – higher than the values typical in the recent literature
of between one and two.6 We argue that the higher elasticity is likely to be because the sub-popu-
lation “randomized in” by the RD Design is composed of smaller firms than have usually been
examined and so are more likely to be credit constrained and therefore are also more responsive
to R&D tax credits. We confirm this intuition by showing the response is particularly strong for
young firms, presumably because they are more subject to credit constraints. Our simple calcula-
tions suggest that between 2006 and 2011 the UK R&D Tax Relief Scheme induces £1.7 of private
R&D for every £1 of taxpayer money and that aggregate UK business R&D would have been
about 10% lower in the absence of the policy. Finally, we find evidence that the R&D induced by
the tax policy generated spillovers – i.e. more innovation by technologically related firms. Hence,
it appears the policy succeeded in its intentions.
     In terms of the existing literature, some papers have examined the causal impact of other types
of innovation policy on R&D and other outcomes. These have used ratings given to grant applica-
tions as a way of generating exogenous variation around funding thresholds. Jacob and Lefgren
(2010) and Azoulay et al. (2014) examine the impact of NIH grants. Bronzini and Iachini (2014)
and Bronzini and Piselli (2014) use an RD Design for R&D subsidies in Italy.7 Probably closest to
our paper is Howell (2015) who uses the ranking of SBIR proposals for energy R&D. She finds
significant effects of subsidies on future venture capital funding, especially for small firms.8 Some
papers have looked at the impact of R&D tax credits on non-R&D outcomes without an RD De-
sign. For example, Bøler, Moxnes and Ulltveit-Moe (2015) employ a difference-in-differences
strategy to investigate how the introduction of R&D tax credit in Norway affects profits, interme-
diate imports and R&D.9
     Our paper also contributes to the literature on the effects of R&D on innovation (e.g. Hall,
Mairesse, and Mohnen, 2010). We find that R&D has a positive causal effect on innovation, with
elasticities that are underestimated in conventional OLS approaches. More broadly, we provide

  The authors look at the impacts of R&D subsidies on investment and patents in Northern Italy in an RD Design (they
do not have R&D data). In their setting the running variable is determined on the basis of scoring the project applica-
tions by a committee of experts. They observe a discontinuity in the score distribution around the eligibility cut-off,
which they interpret as a sign of program managers being able to assign higher scores for projects just below the cut-
off to avoid appeals.

and Hubbard, 2002).
     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the institutional setting; Section 3 explains
the empirical design; Section 4 describes the data; Section 5 presents the main results; Section 6
some extensions; Section 7 has the technology spillover analysis and Section 8 concludes.

2. Institutional setting
     We give more details of the institutional setting and tax policies in Appendix A (e.g. Table A1
details the policy changes over time), but summarize the most important features in this section.
From the early 1980s the UK business R&D to GDP ratio fell, whereas it rose in most other OECD
countries. In 2000, an R&D Tax Relief Scheme was introduced for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). It was extended to cover large companies in 2002, but SMEs continued to enjoy more
generous R&D tax relief. The policy costs the UK government £1.4bn in 2013 alone (Fowkes,
Sousa and Duncan, 2015).
     The tax policy is based on the total amount of R&D, i.e. it is volume-based rather than calcu-
lated as an increment over past spending like the US R&D tax credit. It works mostly through
enhanced deduction of R&D from taxable income, thus reducing corporate tax liabilities.10 At the
time of its introduction, the scheme allowed SMEs to deduct an additional enhancement rate of
50% of qualifying R&D expenditure from taxable profits (on top of the 100% deduction that ap-
plies to any form of current expenditure). If an SME was not making profits, it could surrender
enhanced losses in return for a payable tax credit11 amounting to 16% of enhanced R&D.12 This
design feature was aimed at dealing with the well-known problem that smaller companies may not
be making enough profits to benefit from the enhancement rate. The refundable aspect of the
scheme is particularly beneficial to firms who are liquidity constrained and we will present evi-
dence in line with the idea that the large responses we observe are related to the alleviation of
financial constraints. Large companies had a less generous deduction rate of 25% of their R&D
and could not claim the refundable tax credits in the case of losses (Finance Act, 2002).
     The aggregate UK business R&D to GDP ratio stabilized after the introduction of this R&D
tax policy and Bond and Guceri (2012) suggest that these are causally connected. Guceri (2015)


10
   Only current R&D expenditures, such as labor and materials, qualify for the scheme, but since capital only accounts
for about 10% of total R&D, this is less important (e.g. Cameron, 1996).
11
   Throughout we will use “tax credit” to refer to this refundable element of the scheme as distinct from the “enhance-
ment” element.
12
   Or equivalently, 24% (=16% x 150%) of total R&D expenditure. See Finance Act 2000 (Chapter 17, Schedule 20).

uses a difference-in-differences method across firm size classes to look at the effect of the intro-
duction of the program and argues that the policy raised R&D by a fifth in the affected firms.
Fowkes et al. (2015) calculate the firm-specific user cost and instrument this with lagged values,
also finding positive effects on R&D.
     The policy used the SME definition recommended by the European Commission (EC)
throughout most of the 2000s. This definition was based on employment, total assets, and sales13
from the last two accounting years. It also takes into consideration company ownership structure
and constrains variation in the SME status over time by requiring that in order to change its SME
status, a company must fall in the new category two consecutive accounting periods (two-year
rule). If a firm is below the threshold in year t, it must be above the threshold in both years t+1
and t+2 to lose its SME status in year t+2. Otherwise, it remains an SME in both subsequent years
as it has been in year t.14
     We focus on the major change to the scheme that commenced from August 2008. The SME
assets threshold was increased from €43m to €86m, the employment threshold from 249 to 499
and the sales threshold from €50m to €100m.15 As a result of these changes, a substantial propor-
tion of companies that were eligible for the large company rate according to the old definition
became eligible for the SME rate. In addition to the change in SME definition, the UK government
also increased the enhancement rate for both SMEs and large companies in the same year. The
SME enhancement rate increased from 50% to 75%.16 For large companies, the rate changed from
25% to 30%. The policy change implies a reduction in the tax-adjusted user cost of R&D from
0.19 to 0.15 for the newly-eligible SMEs whereas the user cost for large companies was basically
unchanged (see sub-section 5.2 below and Table A11).
     We examine the impact of this jump from 2008 onwards in tax-adjusted user cost of R&D at
the new SME thresholds. There are several advantages of employing this reform instead of the
earlier changes. First, unlike the previous thresholds based on the EU definition, which were ex-
tensively used in many other support programs targeting SMEs, the thresholds introduced in 2008
were specific to the R&D Tax Relief Scheme. This allows us to recover the effects of the R&D

13
   We use the terms “sales”, “turnover” and “revenue” interchangeably in the paper, except when more precise defini-
tions are needed.
14
   For further details of the EC criteria see Recommendations 1996/280/EC and 2003/361/EC (see Appendix A1).
15
   The other criteria laid down in the EC 2003 recommendation (e.g. two-year rule) were maintained in the new pro-
vision in Finance Act 2007 (Chapter 11). This act did not appoint a date on which new ceilings became effective. The
date was appointed in the Finance Act 2007, Section 50 (Appointed Day) Order 2008 of July 16 th 2008.
16
   In parallel, the SME payable tax credit rate was cut slightly to 14% (from 16%) of enhanced R&D expenditure (i.e.
24.5% of R&D expenditure) to ensure that R&D tax credit falls below the 25% limit for state aid.

Tax Relief Scheme without confounding them with the impact of other SME schemes. Second,
identifying the impacts around newly introduced thresholds mitigates biases arising from tax plan-
ning of R&D intensive firms which may cause endogenous bunching of firms around the thresh-
olds. We show that firms did respond rationally by starting to bunch around the new thresholds in
2009 and afterwards. But we also demonstrate that there was no bunching around the threshold in
2007 (or earlier) and covariates were all balanced at the cutoff. The 2007 value of assets is therefore
what we use as the running variable. This is important as although the policy was not completely
detailed until July 2008 (and implemented in August 2008), aspects of the policy were understood
in 2007 so firms may in principle have responded in advance. Information frictions, adjustment
costs and policy uncertainty mean that this adjustment is likely to be sluggish, especially for the
SMEs we study.17
     We will focus on assets as our key running variable. This is one of the three determinants of
SME status and, unlike employment and sales, does not suffer from missing values in the available
datasets. We discuss this in detail in Section 4 and also consider using employment and sales in
sub-section 6.4. We use the 2007 value of assets as this will matter for SME tax status in 2009
which depends on the past two accounting years as discussed above. Since the policy only began
mid-way through 2008, it is inappropriate to use values in 2008 as running variables. Nevertheless,
we also examine the results’ robustness when we consider other years for the running variable.

3. Empirical strategy
     We start with a simple R&D equation of the form:
                      𝑟𝑑𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼1,𝑡 + 𝛽𝐹𝑆,𝑡 𝐸𝑖,2007 + 𝑓1,𝑡 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) + 𝜀1𝑖,𝑡                                   (1)
where t = 2009, 2010, 2011 following the 2008 policy change and 𝜀1𝑖,𝑡 is an error term. 𝑟𝑑𝑖,𝑡 is
R&D the expenditure of firm i in year t and 𝐸𝑖,2007 = 𝐼{ 𝑧𝑖,2007 ≤ 𝑧̃ } is a binary indicator equal to
one if assets in 2007 ( zi ,2007 ) are equal to or less than the corresponding new SME threshold, 𝑧̃ .

The coefficient of interest 𝛽𝐹𝑆 (subscript “FS” for First Stage) estimates the effect of the difference
in tax relief schemes between SMEs and large firms on R&D spending. In an RD Design frame-
work, the identification assumption requires that the distribution of all predetermined variables is
smooth around the threshold, which is testable on observables. The identification is guaranteed
when firms cannot manipulate their running variable, 𝑧𝑖,2007 (Lee, 2008). Under this assumption,


17
  Sluggish adjustment to policy announcements is consistent with many papers in the public finance literature (e.g.
Kleven and Waseem, 2013).



                                                        6
eligibility, 𝐸𝑖,2007, is as good as randomly assigned at the cutoff. We consider year by year regres-
sions of equation (1) as well as averaging over three post-policy years. We also estimate identical
regressions in the pre-policy years to assess the validity of the RD Design.
     Equation (1) can be derived from the static first order condition of a firm with an R&D aug-
mented CES production function (see Appendix A). We show how the elasticity of R&D with
respect to its user cost can be derived in Section 5 below.
     As is standard in RD Designs, we control for separate polynomials of the running variable on
both sides of the asset threshold of €86m.18 As noted above, because of the two-year rule, a firm’s
SME status in 2009 is partly based on its financials in 2007. These are unlikely to be manipulated
by firms for tax planning purpose since the start date of the new SME definition (August 1st 2008)
was only announced on July 16th 2008.19 Using total assets in 2007 as our primary running variable
thus mitigates the concern that there may have been endogenous sorting of firms across the thresh-
old. Nevertheless, since there were discussions of the change in thresholds in late 2006 we are
careful to check for continuity of observables around the thresholds even in 2007.
     Notice that the “new SMEs”, i.e. those who became SMEs only under the new definition,
could only obtain the higher tax deduction rates on R&D performed after August 2008. Hence, to
the extent that firms could predict the change in thresholds in early 2008 (or they could manipulate
the reported timing of within year R&D), such companies would have an incentive to reduce 2008
R&D expenditures before August and increase them afterwards. To avoid these complexities with
the transition year of 2008, we focus on 2009 and afterwards as full post-policy years.
     Figure 1 shows that the distribution of firms’ 2007 assets appears continuous around the new
2008 SME threshold of €86m. The McCrary test gives a discontinuity estimate (log difference in
density height at the SME threshold) of -0.026 with a standard error of 0.088, insignificantly dif-
ferent from zero. Sub-section 6.3 discusses how there is also no discontinuity in earlier years, but
how this changes in later years in response to the policy change.
     In terms of innovative outputs we consider the following patent equation analogous to the
R&D equation (1):
                       𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼2,𝑡 + 𝛽𝑅𝐹,𝑡 𝐸𝑖,2007 + 𝑓2,𝑡 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) + 𝜀2𝑖,𝑡                                    (2)


18
   In the baseline results we use a first order polynomial being mindful of Gelman and Imbens’s (2014) warning against
using higher order polynomials when higher order coefficients are not significant. We show in robustness checks that
including higher order polynomials produce qualitatively similar results across all specifications.

where the dependent variable is the number of patents, 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 . Under the same identification as-
sumptions discussed above, 𝛽𝑅𝐹 (“RF” for Reduced Form) estimates the causal effect of the policy
on patents.
     Finally we consider the “structural” patents equation:
                      𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼3,𝑡 + 𝛾3,𝑡 𝑟𝑑𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑓3,𝑡 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) + 𝜀3𝑖,𝑡                                    (3)
which can interpreted as a “knowledge production function” as in Griliches (1979). Equations (1)
and (3) correspond to a fuzzy RD model identifying the impact of additional R&D spending in-
duced by the difference in tax relief schemes on firms’ innovation output, using 𝐸𝑖,2007 as the
instrument for R&D. With homogenous treatment effects, IV delivers the causal effect of R&D on
patents under the exclusion restriction that the threshold indicator 𝐸𝑖,2007 does not affect innovation
outputs through any other channel.20

4. Data

4.1 Data sources
     Appendix B details our data sources. Our data comes from three main sources: (1) the HMRC
(Britain’s IRS) Corporate Tax returns (CT600) and its extension, the Research and Development
Tax Credits (RDTC) dataset, which provide data on the universe of UK firms and importantly
includes firm’s R&D expenditures as claimed under the R&D Tax Relief Scheme, (2) Bureau Van
Dijk’s FAME dataset which provides data on the accounts of the universe of UK incorporated
firms, and (3) PATSTAT which has patent information on all patents filed by UK companies in the
main 60 patent offices across the world.
     CT600 is a confidential administrative panel dataset provided by HMRC Datalab which con-
sists of tax assessments made from the returns for all UK companies liable for corporation tax. It
is made accessible to researchers only since 2011. The dataset covers financial years 2000-01 to
2011-1221, with close to 16 million firm by year observations, and contains all information pro-
vided by firms in their annual corporate tax returns. We are specifically interested in the RDTC
dataset, which consists of all information related to the R&D Tax Relief Scheme including the
amount of qualifying R&D expenditure each firm has in a year and the scheme under which it


20
   With heterogeneous treatment effects, IV requires a monotonicity assumption that moving a firm’s size slightly
below the threshold always increases R&D. In this case, 𝛾3 is the Average Causal Response (Angrist and Imbens
1995), a generalization of the Local Average Treatment Effect that averages (with weights) over firms’ causal re-
sponses of innovation outputs to small changes in R&D spending due to the IV.
21
   The UK fiscal year runs from April 1st to March 31st so 2001-02 refers to data between April 1st 2001 and March
31st 2002. In the text we refer to the financial years by their first year, so 2011-2012 is denoted “2011”.



                                                        8
makes the claim (SME vs. Large Company Scheme).
     Firms made a total of 53,000 claims between 2006 and 2011 (22,000 claims between 2006
and 2008 and 31,000 claims between 2009 and 2011), about 80% of which are under the SME
Scheme. Total claims amounted to £2.5bn in R&D tax relief in total between 2006 and 2008 and
£3.3bn between 2009 and 2011.22
     We only observe total R&D when firms seek to claim R&D tax relief. All firms performing
R&D are in principle eligible for tax breaks which as we have discussed are generous. Further, all
firms must submit tax returns each year and claiming tax relief is a simple part of this process.
Hence we believe we have reasonably comprehensive coverage of current R&D spending. Ideally,
we would cross check at the firm level with R&D data from other sources, but UK accounting
regulations (like the US regulation of privately listed firms) do not insist on SMEs reporting their
R&D, so there are many missing values. Statistics provided by internal HMRC analysis indicate
that qualifying R&D expenditure amounts to 70% of total business R&D (BERD).23 Note that the
other outcomes (like patents) are observed for all firms, regardless of R&D status.
     CT600 makes it possible to determine the SME status of firms who claim the R&D tax relief,
but not the SME status of firms who are not claiming (the vast majority of firms). Employment
and total assets are not available because such information is not directly required on corporate tax
forms. Furthermore, only tax-accounting sales is reported in CT600, while the SME definition is
based on financial-accounting sales as reported in company accounts.24 Consequently, we turn to
a second dataset, FAME, which contains all UK company accounts since about the mid-1980s. We
match CT600 to FAME by an HMRC-anonymized version of company registration number
(CRN), which is a unique regulatory identifier in both datasets. We merged 95% of CT600 firms
between 2006 and 2011 with FAME and these firms cover close to 100% of R&D performing
firms and patenting firms. Unmatched firms are slightly smaller but not statistically different from
matched ones across different variables reported in CT600, including sales, gross trading profits,
and gross and net corporate tax chargeable (see Appendix B4).


22
   It is currently not possible to merge CT600 with the BERD firm survey which is used to build the national estimate
of R&D. The BERD survey (like US BERDIS) is a stratified random sample with very partial coverage of SMEs,
however, so there would only be partial coverage.
23
   There are various reasons for this difference, including the fact that BERD includes R&D spending on capital in-
vestment whereas qualified R&D does not (only current expenses are liable). It is also the case that HMRC defines
R&D more narrowly for tax purposes that BERD which is based on the Frascati definition.
24
   Tax-accounting sales turnover is calculated using the cash-based method, which focuses on actual cash receipts
rather than their related sale transactions. Financial-accounting turnover is calculated using the accrual method, which
records sale revenues when they are earned, regardless of whether cash from sales has been collected.



                                                           9
     All firms are required to report their total assets in company accounts, but reporting of sales
and employment is mandatory only for larger firms. In our 2006 to 2011 FAME data, only 5% of
firms reported employment and only 15% reported sales. By comparison 97% reported assets.
Even in our baseline sample of relatively larger firms around the SME asset threshold of €86m,
employment and sales coverage is still only reported by 55% and 67% of firms respectively. For
this reason, we only focus on exploiting the SME asset threshold with respect to total assets and
use this as the key running variable in our baseline specification. Financial variables are reported
in sterling while the SME thresholds are set in euros, so we convert assets and sales using exactly
the same tax rules used by HMRC for this purpose. In addition, FAME provides industry, location,
capital investment, profits, remuneration, etc., though coverage differs across variables.
     We use assets from FAME as our key running variable, but also experiment with using sales
to determine SME status, despite the greater number of missing values. In principle, using both
running variables should increase efficiency, but in practice (as we explain in sub-section 6.4) it
does not lead to material gains in the precision of the estimates. The fact that we use only one of
the three SME criteria for determining eligibility does not violate the assumptions for RD Design,
it may just reduce the efficiency of our estimates.
     The third dataset we exploit is PATSTAT, a database curated by the European Patent Office
(EPO). PATSTAT is the largest available international patent database and covers close to the pop-
ulation of all worldwide patents since the 1900s. It brings together nearly 70 million patent docu-
ments from over 60 patent offices, including all of the major offices such as the European Patent
Office, the United States Patent and Trademark office (USPTO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO).
Patents filed with the UK Intellectual Property Office (UK IPO) are also included. To assign pa-
tents to UK-based companies we use the matching between PATSTAT and FAME implemented by
Bureau Van Dijk and available from the ORBIS database. The quality of the matching is excellent:
over our sample period, 94% of patents filed in the UK and 96% of patents filed at the EPO have
been successfully associated with their owning company. We select all patents filed by UK com-
panies between 1980 and 2013.25 Our dataset contains comprehensive information from the patent
record, including application date, citations, and technology class. Importantly, PATSTAT includes
information on patent families, which are sets of patents protecting the same invention across sev-
eral jurisdictions. This allows us to identify all patent applications filed worldwide by UK-based

25
  To avoid double counting, a patent filed by more than one firm is distributed equally among the firms. For example,
a patent filed by 2 firms is counted as 0.5 for each of the firms.




                                                         10
companies and to avoid double-counting inventions that are protected in several countries.26
     In our baseline results, we use the number of patent families – irrespective of where the patents
are filed – as a measure of the number of inventions for which patent protection has been sought.
This means that we count the number of patents filed anywhere in the world by firms in our sample,
whether at the UK, European or US patent office, but we use information on patent families to
make sure that an invention patented in multiple jurisdictions is only counted once. Patents are
sorted by application year. Our measures use all patent application to avoid artificially truncating
the sample, as the granting of a patent is a long administrative process (3.3 years on average in the
UK, see Dechezleprêtre, 2013).
     Numerous studies have demonstrated a strong link between patenting and firm performance.27
Nevertheless, patents have their limitations (e.g. Hall et al., 2013). To tackle the problem that the
value of individual patents is highly heterogeneous, we (i) show results separately for high value
EPO patents vs. UK patents, (ii) use data on the number of countries that IP protection is sought,
(iii) look only at granted patents instead of all applications and (iv) weight patents by future cita-
tions.28

4.2 Baseline sample descriptive statistics
     We construct our baseline sample from the above three datasets. Our baseline sample contains
5,888 firms with total assets in 2007 between €61m and €111m which survive29 at least until 2008
based on a €25m bandwidth around the threshold, with 3,651 firms under the €86m SME asset
threshold and 2,327 firms above the threshold. The bandwidth of €25m is somewhat arbitrary, so
we show robustness to a range of alternative bandwidths.30 Our key outcome variables include
amount of qualifying R&D expenditure, and number of patents filed. All nominal variables are
converted to 2007 prices using the UK Consumer Price Index, and all outcome variables are win-
sorized at 2.5% of non-zero values to mitigate the leverage of outliers.31 In 2006-08 224 of the

26
   This means that thanks to patent family information our dataset includes patents filed by foreign affiliates of UK
companies overseas that relate to an invention filed by the UK-based mother company. However, patents filed inde-
pendently by foreign affiliates of UK companies overseas are not included.
27
   For example, see Hall, Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2005) on US firms or Blundell, Griffith and Van Reenen (1999) on
UK firms.
28
   Variations of these quality measures have been used by inter alia Lanjouw et al. (1998), Harhoff et al. (2003) and
Hall et al. (2005).
29
   Firms who die are kept in the sample to avoid selection bias, but are given zero R&D.
30
   The Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2011) optimal bandwidth for using R&D as the outcome variable is 22, which is
close to our baseline choice of 25.
31
   This is equivalent to “winsorizing” the R&D of the top 5 to 6 R&D spenders and the number of patents of the top 2
to 4 patenters in the baseline sample each year. We also show robustness to excluding outliers instead of winsorizing
outcome variables.



                                                         11
firms in this sub-sample had positive R&D and this number rose to 254 over 2009-11 (roughly 5%
of aggregate R&D expenditure). 210 firms filed 327 patents over 2006-08, and 157 firms filed 285
patents over 2009-11.
     In the 2006-2008 period firms below the threshold spent on average £57,800 per annum on
R&D and firms above the threshold spent an average of £94,500 (with an overall average of
£72,300). After the policy between 2009 and 2011 these numbers changed to £72,000 and £93,600.
In other words, the gap in R&D spending between the two groups of firms around the threshold
almost halved from £36,700 pre-policy to £21,600 post-policy. In terms of innovation outputs, the
average number of patents per annum was similar between the two groups of firms before the
policy change (0.06), while after the policy change, firms below the SME asset threshold filed
30% more patents than those above the threshold (0.06 vs. 0.04). Detailed descriptive statistics by
year across the two groups are in Table 1.
     These “difference in differences” estimates are consistent with our hypothesis that the 2008
policy change induces firms below the new SME asset threshold, which are more likely to benefit
from more generous tax relief under the SME scheme, to increase their R&D and patents. Guceri
(2015) and Guceri and Li (2015) come to the same conclusion using a difference in difference
approach.32 However, there could be differential time trends correlated with size which could con-
found these simple comparisons between smaller and larger firms. We now turn to implementing
the RD Design of equations (1)-(3) to investigate the causal effects directly.

5. Results

5.1 Main results
     Table 2 reports R&D regressions (equation (1)). The key explanatory variable is whether the
firm’s total assets in 2007 was below the new SME asset threshold of €86m. The sample is limited
to firms with total assets in 2007 between €61m and €111m, and the running variable is the firms’
total assets in 2007. Looking at each of the three “pre-policy” years 2006 to 2008 in columns (1)
to (3), we find that as expected there is no significant discontinuity in R&D at the asset threshold




32
   Unlike our paper they look only at R&D, however, and not patents or other firm performance outcomes. Further-
more, they condition on R&D performing firms which (i) creates selection issues and (ii) means that they cannot look
at the extensive margin (i.e. they cannot examine whether any firms start or stop performing R&D as a result of the
tax changes).




                                                        12
before the new SME definition became effective toward the end of 2008.33 In the next three col-
umns we observe that from 2009 onward, firms just below the SME threshold have significantly
more R&D than firms just above the threshold. Column (7) averages the three pre-policy years
and column (8) the three post policy years. The discontinuity implies a causal annual effect of
£138,500 per firm, compared to an insignificant effect pre-policy. Column (9) presents the differ-
ence between columns (8) and (7) and even in this specification there is a causal effect of £75,300.
Although formally, our analysis indicates no pre-policy trends, we consider this a conservative
approach.34 An effect of £75,300 per annum about doubles the average R&D per annum observed
in the pre-policy period (£72,300), suggesting that the policy had a substantial impact from an
economic as well as statistical perspective.
     Figure 2 shows visually the discontinuous jumps in R&D at the SME asset threshold of €86m.
While total assets correlate positively with both outcome variables in the regions just above and
just below the threshold, as shown by the upward sloping regression lines, right across the thresh-
old, there is a sudden jump in R&D expenditure. The size of the jump corresponds to the estimate
in column (8) of Table 2 and is statistically significant at the 5% level.
     Table 3 directly checks our RD identification assumption by looking at covariate balance.
Firms right below and above the threshold are similar to one another in their observable character-
istics prior to the policy change. The differences in sales, employment, and capital between the
two groups of firms in 2006 and 2007 are both small and statistically insignificant in columns (1)
through (6). After the policy change, we should not observe any discontinuity in R&D around any
asset threshold other than the true SME asset threshold of €86m. To test this we ran a series of
placebo tests on “pseudo” thresholds and found no significant effects. In column (7) we use a lower
threshold of €71m with as an upper bound the true threshold of €86m and as a lower bound €46m
(€25m below the lower pseudo-threshold as in the baseline). In column (8) we use a higher thresh-
old of €101m with as a lower bound the true threshold of €86m and as an upper bound €116m
(€25m above the higher pseudo-threshold). Neither experiment yield statistically significant ef-
fects. We also run similar placebo tests using all possible integer “pseudo” thresholds between

33
   The coefficient of 32 in 2008 is a third smaller than in 2007 (although both are insignificant). As noted above, this
could be because firms were delaying their R&D in the start of 2008 (before the R&D threshold was changed in
August) to the latter part of 2008 or even 2009. The fact that the policy effect in 2010 and 2011 are larger than 2009
makes this somewhat unlikely, but does highlight the difficulty of interpreting the 2008 data (which is another reason
for using 2007 as the running variable).
34
   Alternatively we can condition directly on lagged R&D in the regressions. In Table A3, column (4) shows that we
obtain treatment effects (standard error) of £82,000 (36,400) when we do this over the 2009-11 period, very similar to
the £75,300 figure in column (9).



                                                          13
€71m and €101m with a band ranging from €25m below to €25m above the pseudo threshold (we
do not truncate the band at the true threshold for these specifications). Figure A1, which plots the
resulting coefficients and their 95% confidence interval against the corresponding thresholds,
shows that the estimated discontinuities in R&D peaks at the true threshold of €86m, while they
are almost not statistically different from zero anywhere else.
      Our results are robust to a wide range of robustness tests (see Table A3). First, if we add a
second order polynomial to the baseline specification of column (8) in Table 2, the treatment effect
(standard error) is larger at 171.2 (87.4) and the coefficient (standard error) on the first and second
order assets terms are 0.1 (0.6) and 0.3 (0.7).35 Second, the results are also robust to adding lagged
dependent variable controls, industry and/or location fixed effects.36 Third, we obtain statistically
significant effects of comparable magnitude when using a Poisson specification instead of OLS.37
Fourth, the discontinuity remains significant when we narrow the sample bandwidth or when we
give more weights to firms closer to the asset threshold.38 Fifth, our estimates are robust to the
choice of winsorization. Finally, all of our outcomes are conditional on survival. We also evaluate
the same specification as in Table 3 but using survival as the dependent variable. The resulting
treatment effect is small and insignificant.
      Table 4 reports the patent regressions (equation (2)) using the same specification and sample
as Table 2. As with R&D, the first three columns show no significant discontinuity around the
threshold for patenting activity prior to the policy 2006-08. By contrast, there is a significant in-
crease in patenting in the post-policy period from 2009 onward (columns (3) to (6)). According to
column (8) there is a significant average increase of 0.073 patents per year per firm as a result of
the policy. The coefficient for the pre-policy period is half the size and statistically insignificant
(column (7)). If we use the before and after differences, this is still significant at 10% level with a
treatment effect of 0.035, a substantial increase over the pre-policy sample mean of 0.060 (i.e. 58%
more patents). This is a key result, as the R&D policy was not based on patents, so there is no


35 If we add a third order polynomial the treatment effect rises further to 175.3, but is no longer statistically significant. The F-test
on joint significance of the four higher order terms, however, is 1.05 (corresponding p-value of 0.38), suggesting their addition
does not improve the fit much but comes at the cost of reduced precision of the estimation due to higher degrees of freedom.
36 Adding R&D in 2007 or average R&D over 2006-08 as a control variable gives coefficients (standard error) of 75.5 (37.6) and

82.0 (36.4), similar to result from the baseline after-before design. Adding industry (4-digit SIC) fixed effects or location (2-digit
postcode) fixed effects gives coefficients (standard errors) of 125.6 (61.2) and 107.4 (49.5).
37
   We do this to allow for a proportionate effect on R&D (as in a semi-log specification). Using Poisson specification
gives treatment effects (standard errors) of 1.62 (0.57) without lagged dependent variable control and 1.08 (0.54) when
controlling for R&D in 2007. This is similar to the proportionate effects in Table 2.
38
   Using bandwidths of €35m or €15m gives coefficients (standard errors) of 43.6 (43.5) and 182.0 (73.5). Using
Epanechnikov-kernel or triangular-kernel weights gives coefficients (standard errors) of 148.6 (57.8) and 151.9 (60.8).



                                                                  14
incentive to relabel other activities as “research”. It may be surprising that the patent response is
so speedy, but patent applications are usually timed quite closely to research expenditures in most
sectors. We ran all the robustness tests discussed for the R&D equation also on the patent regres-
sions (see Table A4).
     Figure 3 illustrates the discontinuity in the total number of patents filed over 2009-11 at the
SME asset threshold of €86m, which corresponds to the estimate column (8) of Table 4. As with
R&D there is clear evidence of the discontinuity in innovation outcomes at directly the point of
the tax threshold. Furthermore, “pseudo” threshold tests similar to those discussed in Table 3 show
that the estimated discontinuities in patent counts peak at the real SME threshold of €86m and are
not statistically different from zero elsewhere (Figure A2).
     As patents vary widely in quality, one important concern is that the additional patents induced
by the policy could be of lower value. Table 5 investigates this possibility by considering different
ways to control for quality. Column (1) reproduces our baseline results of patent counts. Column
(2) counts only patents that are filed at the European Patent Office (EPO). It is around six times
more costly to file a patent at the EPO than just at the UK patent office.39 Consequently, EPO
patents are likely to be of higher value – only about a third of firms who filed UK patents in our
sample also filed at the EPO. It is clear that there is a significant and positive effect on these high
value patents and on the lower value patents filed in the UK (but not necessarily elsewhere) as
shown in column (3). Although the point estimate is larger for UK patents than EPO patents (0.094
vs. 0.37), so is the mean (see base of the column), so the proportionate increase in patents is by a
factor of about 1.2 in both columns (0.037/0.031 and 0.094/0.077).
     As an alternative measure of patent value, we use data on family size, i.e. we count the number
of jurisdictions in which each invention is patented. Since firms have to bear administrative costs
for taking out intellectual protection in each country, the larger the family size, the more valuable
the patent is likely to be. Compared to citations (see below), an advantage of patent family as a
quality indicator is that all patent applications of the same invention need to be filed within (at
most) 30 months after the first filing date. Hence, information on family size is available more
quickly than patent citations. Column (4) of Table 5 uses this measure as a dependent variable and
again finds a significant causal effect, showing almost a doubling of patenting activity.40 Column


39
   Filing a patent at the European Patent Office costs around €30,000 (Roland Berger, 2005). In contrast, filing a patent
at the UK IPO costs £3,000 to £5,000 (i.e. €4,000 to €6,000).
40
   We also look at average family size per patent as a measure of patent value (we assign average family size value of




                                                           15
(5) looks at the number of patents subsequently granted (rather than all applications), which also
results in a positive and significant estimate.
     Concerns have been raised that many patents are of dubious value and standards have slack-
ened (e.g. business processing methods like Amazon’s “one click” patent). It is generally agreed
though, that patents in chemicals (such as biotechnology or pharmaceutical patents) remain of high
value. Consequently, column (6) of Table 5 looks at chemical patents as an outcome and column
(7) at non-chemical patents. Both dependent variables show a positive and significant effect of the
policy with proportionate effects which are, if anything, larger in the “high quality” chemical pa-
tent sector.41 Finally, if we weight EPO patents by future citations we obtain a coefficient (standard
error) of 0.004 (0.002) as shown in column (8) of Table 5. In column (9), the UK measures are
similar in proportionate terms, but insignificant at conventional levels.42 We need to keep in mind
that our data is very recent. For example, patents applied for in 2011 will have been published in
2012 or 2013 and hence will have had very little time to be cited.43
     In summary, there is no strong evidence from Table 5 of any fall in innovation quality as a
result of the policy.
     Table 6 reports IV patents regressions where the key right hand side variable, R&D, is instru-
mented by the discontinuity in the tax threshold.44 Column (1) presents the OLS version which
shows a positive association between patents and R&D. Column (2) presents the IV results which
increases the coefficient substantially (although the two estimates are not statistically different on
the basis of a Hausman test presented at the base of the column). The IV estimate implies that one
additional patent costs on average £1.9m (= 1/0.53) in additional qualifying R&D expenditure.
Columns (3) and (4) show OLS and IV results for EPO patents and the final two columns for UK
patents. All have significant effects, although they are larger for IV than OLS. The corresponding
costs for one additional UK patent or one additional EPO patent is £1.5m and £3.7m respectively



zero to firms with no patents). The resulting coefficient (standard error) of 0.0038 (0.0314) is also positive, although
not statistically significant.

   If we narrow the outcome still further to only bio-pharmaceutical patents the coefficient (standard error) is even
larger in proportionate terms: 0.013 (0.006) on a pre-policy mean of 0.005.
42
   The coefficients (standard errors) obtained when we weight UK patents or all patents by future citations are 0.023
(0.021) and 0.012 (0.012). We also look at average citations per patent as a measure of patent value (again, we assign
average citations value of zero to firms with no patents). This gives coefficients (standard errors) of 0.0010 (0.0010)
for EPO patents and -0.0015 (0.0028) for UK patents. Both estimates are statistically insignificant.
43
   Patents are published 18 months after the application date.
44
   In the corresponding IV model, the estimate of the first-stage effect of the instrument on R&D is the coefficient on
the threshold dummy in column (8) of Table 2.

(columns (4) and (6)), which reflects that fact that only inventions of higher value typically get
patented at the EPO. These figures are broadly in line with the existing estimates for R&D costs
per patent of $1m to $5m.45 We again subject these IV regression to the robustness tests discussed
for the first stage and reduced form regressions to show that the magnitudes are robust (Table A5).

5.2 Magnitudes and tax-price elasticities
     What is the implied elasticity of R&D with respect to its tax-adjusted user cost? Following
the existing literature,46 we define the elasticity as the percentage increase in R&D capital with
respect to the percentage increase in the tax-adjusted user cost of R&D capital. In our setting, the
tax-price elasticity of R&D 𝜂 is given by:
                                                  ln(𝑟𝑑𝑆𝑀𝐸 /𝑟𝑑𝐿𝐶𝑂 )
                                             𝜂=
                                                   ln( 𝜌𝑆𝑀𝐸 / 𝜌𝐿𝐶𝑂 )
where 𝑟𝑑𝑆𝑀𝐸 and 𝑟𝑑𝐿𝐶𝑂 are the R&D of a firm under the SME scheme and under the large com-
panies (“LCO”) scheme respectively,47 and 𝜌𝑆𝑀𝐸 and 𝜌𝐿𝐶𝑂 are the tax-adjusted user cost of R&D
facing the firm faces under the corresponding schemes.
     Table 2 column (9) generated a treatment effect of £75,300, about a doubling over the pre-
policy average R&D of £72,300.48 Using these figures for our baseline tax-price elasticity calcu-
lation gives us a log difference in R&D of ln(𝑟𝑑𝑆𝑀𝐸 ) − ln(𝑟𝑑𝐿𝐶𝑂 ) = ln(75.3 + 72.3) −
ln(72.3) = 0.71.49 We calculate the tax-adjusted user cost, 𝜌𝑓 , based on the actual design of the
R&D Tax Relief Scheme (see Table A1 and Appendix A4 for more details):
                                                   (1 − 𝐴𝑓 )
                                            𝜌𝑓 =                (𝑟 + 𝛿)
                                                    (1 − 𝜏𝑓 )
where sub-script 𝑓 ∈ {𝑆𝑀𝐸, 𝐿𝐶𝑂} denotes whether the firm is a smaller (SME) or larger company
(LCO), 𝐴 is the value of R&D tax relief, 𝜏 is the effective corporate tax rate, 𝑟 is the real interest

(2015).

   For example, Hall and Jorgenson (1967) or Bloom, Griffith, and Van Reenen (2002).
47
   Formally, the numerator of the tax price elasticity should be the R&D capital stock rather than flow expenditure.
However, in steady state the R&D flow will be equal to R&D stock multiplied by the depreciation rate. Since the
depreciation rate is the same for large and small firms around the discontinuity, it cancels out (see Appendix A).
48
   As the tax-adjusted user cost of R&D for large companies remains unchanged over 2006-11 (Table A11), it seems
reasonable to use the average R&D over 2006-08 as a proxy for how much an average firm would spend on R&D if
it remained a large company over 2009-11.
49
   For robustness checks, we use estimates from various alternative first stage specifications, including both OLS and
Poisson specifications, and derive estimates for log difference in R&D investment in the range of 0.69 to 1.08 (see
Appendix B).

rate and 𝛿 is the depreciation rate. As described in Section 2, the R&D Tax Relief Scheme includes
a tax deduction feature for firms with corporate tax liabilities with different enhancement rates
under the SME and large company schemes and a payable tax credit feature for firms with no
corporate tax liability only under the SME scheme.50 In the case of tax deduction, the value of the
tax relief Ad,f is Ad,f = τf(1+ef) where ef is the enhancement rate (which is 75% for SMEs and 30%
for large companies in 2009-10 and 100% for SMEs and 30% for large companies in 2011). In the
case of payable tax credit, the value of the tax relief Ac is Ac = c(1+e) where 𝑐 is the payable tax
credit rate (which is 14% for SMEs in 2009-11 and 12.5% for SMEs in 2011 and always zero for
large companies). Finally, the average tax-adjusted user cost of R&D under each scheme is an
average of the user costs under each case, weighted by the probability, Pr(. ), that a firm will have
no corporate tax liability:
                                          𝑑𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛                           𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡
            𝜌𝑓 = Pr(𝐻𝑎𝑠 𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦) × 𝜌𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑒    + Pr(𝑁𝑜 𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦) × 𝜌𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑒
     To calculate this we use the share of firms in the sample with corporate tax liabilities in 2006
and 2007, which is 45%, as a proxy for Pr(𝐻𝑎𝑠 𝑡𝑎𝑥 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦). The effective tax rate 𝜏 was 28%
in 2009-10 and 26% in 2011.51 The average tax-adjusted user cost of R&D is 0.15 under the SME
scheme and 0.19 under the large company scheme over 2009-11, which translates into a log dif-
ference in user cost of 0.27.
     Putting all these elements together we obtain a tax-price elasticity of R&D of 2.6 (=
0.71/0.27). This is somewhat higher than the typical values of between 1 and 2 found in other
studies.52 However, almost all previous studies have effectively focused on larger firms such as
publicly listed firms or using state/macro data that are dominated by larger firms’ expenditures.
Our sample, by contrast, is predominantly of SMEs around the €86m threshold. As these firms are
more likely to be credit constrained, they are likely to be more responsive to R&D tax incentives.
     Some evidence for the hypothesis that there are larger treatment effects for the more finan-
cially constrained firms is presented in Table 7. First, we split the sample by firm age, as younger
firms are much more likely to be credit constrained than older ones. Splitting by median age we
find that although the effect of the policy is significant in both sub-samples, it is proportionately
larger for the young firms. R&D rises by a factor of 2.4 for the young and only 1.9 for the old

50
   In some situations, a firm can first use the tax deduction feature to reduce its chargeable profits to zero, then claim
the rest of the enhanced qualifying R&D expenditure using the payable tax credit feature. This is called a combination
claim. However, as there are very few combination claims in our baseline sample, we ignore this case for simplicity.
51
   We set the real interest rate 𝑟 to 5% and depreciation rate 𝛿 to 15%. As ln(𝑟 + 𝛿) cancels out in ln( 𝜌𝑆𝑀𝐸 /𝜌𝐿𝐶𝑂 ),
the value of these two last parameters does not affect our estimate of the final tax-price elasticity.
52
   See the surveys in Becker (2015), OECD (2014), Fowkes, Sousa, and Duncan (2015), Hall and Van Reenen (2000).

(columns (1) and (2)). Furthermore, when we use the after-before design, the treatment effect is
significant for young firms, but smaller and insignificant for older firms (columns (3) and (4)).
Estimates from the after-before design gives a treatment effect to baseline ratio of 2.6 for young
firms and 0.5 for old firms, a difference that is significant at the 10% level (the implied tax price
elasticities are 4.7 and 1.6 respectively).53
     One issue is that young firms respond more to the R&D tax policy not because they are finan-
cially constrained, but because they are more likely to have zero corporate tax liabilities and there-
fore benefit more from the SME scheme via payable tax credit. We directly address this concern
by comparing the responses of young and old firms only among firms with corporate tax liabilities
for at least one year between 2005 and 2007 (columns (5) to (8) of Table 6). As before, we find
that young firms still have a much higher treatment effect to baseline ratio in this subsample: 2.4
to 0.5 among old firms, implying tax price elasticities of 4.8 and 1.6 respectively. Though these
differences are not statistically significant due to smaller sample size, they support our hypothesis
that the larger treatment effects we find are driven by financially constrained firms.54

5.3 Cost effectiveness of the R&D Tax Relief Scheme
     A full welfare analysis of the R&D policy is complex as one needs to take into account general
equilibrium effects through spillovers (see below) and possibly aggregate effects on scientists’
wages (Goolsbee, 1998). We take one step in this direction by implementing a simple “value for
money” calculation based on how much additional R&D is generated per pound sterling of tax-
payer money (“Exchequer Costs”). The details of the calculations are in Appendix A5, but we
summarize them here.
     As described in the previous sub-section, we obtain empirical estimates of the tax-price elas-
ticity from the 2008 policy change. In addition, for every year we can also calculate the difference
in the user costs of R&D generated by the policy parameters of the tax system. We do this sepa-
rately for each of the three R&D schemes: SME deductible, SME payable tax credit and large
                                                                                           ∆𝑅𝐷
company scheme. This allows us to calculate the value for money ratio,                           separately for each
                                                                                           ∆𝐸𝐶

scheme in each year where ∆𝑅𝐷 is the change in aggregate business R&D generated by the policy
and ∆𝐸𝐶 is the Exchequer/tax payer cost of the program. From the HMRC data (HMRC 2015) we

53 The log difference in the user cost of R&D among younger firms is 0.274 (probability of payable tax credits is 67%).

The log difference in the user cost among older firms is 0.267 (probability of the payable tax credits is 44%).
54
   Replicating the exercise using the sub-sample of firms with no corporate tax liabilities 2005-07 gives a treatment
effect (relative to baseline R&D) ratios of 2.8 for young firms and 0.5 for older firms, implying tax price elasticities
of 4.7 and 1.5 respectively.



                                                          19
also know the amount given out in each of the three schemes by the government (∆𝐸𝐶 ). Combining
this with the value for money ratio (derived from the tax elasticity and the user costs) enables us
to calculate the counterfactual level of aggregate R&D.
     The estimated R&D tax-price elasticity of 2.6 implies that a firm entering the SME scheme as
a result of the new threshold increases its R&D by 84% of its pre-policy level in the tax deduction
case, and 109% of its pre-policy R&D in the payable tax credit case. The corresponding increase
in Exchequer costs by the same firm is 31% of its pre-policy R&D in the tax deduction case, and
51% of its pre-policy R&D in the payable tax credit case. In both cases, roughly half of this in-
crease is to cover more generous tax relief applied to the firm’s old level of R&D, while the other
half covers tax relief applied to the firm’s additional R&D. The implied “value for the money”
ratio of the 2008 policy change, as measured by additional R&D over additional Exchequer costs,
thus ranges from 2.1 in the payable tax credit case to 2.7 in the tax deduction case.
     If we generalize the estimated R&D tax-price elasticity of 2.6 to the whole population of
SMEs, we can do a similar calculation for the overall SME scheme between 2006 and 2011. Value
for money ratios are on average 2.79 for the deduction scheme and 2.13 for the tax credit scheme.
Combining these ratios with Exchequer costs statistics gives us estimates of the additional SME
R&D induced which averages at £719m per year (£321m from the deductible and £398m from
payable tax credit). Total SME qualified R&D averaged £1,745m, so this is a substantial fraction.
Our calculations suggest SME R&D would have been 41% lower in the absence of the UK R&D
tax credit system.
     We also repeat the exercise for the population of large companies, but with more conservative
R&D tax-price elasticity of 1.055 as these firms are likely less responsive to tax incentives, and
obtain value for the money ratios of around 1.4. These translate into an average of £919m addi-
tional R&D (about 11% of total large firm’s qualified R&D spending).
     Putting these figures together suggests that the R&D Tax Relief Scheme induced an average
of £1.64bn per year 2006-11, while costing the Exchequer £0.96bn in lost tax revenue – a value
for money ratio of 1.7. The UK’s qualifying R&D spending would have been about 16% lower in
the absence of this fiscal support. This suggests that the tax policy was important in the macro-
economic performance of UK R&D. In Figure 4 we show estimates of the counterfactual business


55
  This follows the conclusions from literature surveys (e.g. Becker, 2014). These elasticity assumptions are likely to
underestimate the benefits of the policy as (i) the literature may have under-estimated the elasticity due to weaker
identification approached and (ii) since we find larger elasticities for medium sized firms, the responsiveness may be
even larger for the much smaller firms who are well below the asset thresholds we consider.



                                                         20
R&D (BERD) to GDP ratio estimated in the absence of the tax relief scheme (see Appendix A.5
for details). It is striking that since the early 1980s UK BERD became an increasingly small share
of GDP, whereas it generally rose in other major economies. According to our estimates this de-
cline would have continued were it not for the introduction and extension of a more generous fiscal
regime in the 2000s.56 Business R&D would have been 10% lower over the 2006-2011 period
(total BERD is larger than tax qualifying R&D).
     A full welfare analysis would likely produce even larger benefit to cost ratios than 1.7. First,
since the taxpayer costs are transfers, only the deadweight cost of tax should be considered (e.g.
Gruber, 2011, uses 40%). Second, the additional R&D is likely to have technological spillovers to
other firms, raising their innovation rates (e.g. Bloom et al. 2013). We examine these spillover
effects in Section 7.

6. Extensions and Robustness

6.1 Intensive versus extensive margins
     The additional amount of R&D induced by the policy could come from firms which would
not have done any R&D without the scheme (i.e. the extensive margin) or from firms which would
have done R&D, although in smaller amounts (i.e. the intensive margin). It turns out that the main
R&D effects are coming from the intensive margin (Table A6). Estimating the R&D equation
where the outcome is a dummy for whether the firm performs R&D produces insignificant effects.
By contrast, when the outcome is whether a firm patents there remains a positive and significant
effect.57 Similarly, if we split by industry, the strongest effects of the policy come from those sec-
tors that are more intensive in R&D and patents (Table A8).58
     We also split the baseline sample into firms which made some capital investment in the 2005-
07 pre-policy period, and firms that did not (Table A9).59 The policy effect on R&D and innovation
is larger among firms who had invested, suggesting that current R&D and capital investments are


56
   The trend annual decline in business R&D intensity was 1.9% between 1981 and 1999. We estimate that in the
absence of the policy change the decline would have continued at 1.7% a year 1999 to 2012.
57
   Table A7 shows similar findings by splitting the sample by firms with and without R&D or patents in the past. Both
R&D and patent effects come mainly through the intensive margin, driven by firms with past R&D or patents.
58
   These are shown by splitting at median of industry patent intensity, and we generate the same qualitative pattern if
we repeat the exercise using R&D intensity. Examples of high-patenting industries include electric domestic appli-
ances, basic pharmaceutical products, medical and surgical equipment, organic and inorganic basic chemicals, optical
and photographic equipment, etc.
59
   Due to limited coverage of investments in FAME, we use data on machinery and plant expenditure reported in
CT600 as a proxy for capital investments.




                                                         21
more likely to be complements than substitutes. This result is consistent with the idea that firms
having previously made R&D capital investments have lower adjustment costs and therefore re-
spond more to R&D tax incentives (Agrawal, Rosell, and Simcoe 2014).

6.2 R&D tax effects on other aspects of firm performance
     We examine if the tax policy generated changes in other aspects of firm performance. We
again use the baseline specification but use Total Factor Productivity (TFP) as the outcome varia-
ble. We proxy TFP by estimating a production function using the Olley and Pakes (1996) method.60
Table 8 Panel A shows that there appears to be some positive policy impact on TFP that is signifi-
cant in the final column that represents the change in TFP. The effect magnitude of 0.241 is sizable,
although the standard errors are also large. Since TFP is hard to measure we also examined more
straightforward measures of firm size, including sales (Panel B), employment (Panel C),61 and
capital (Panel D). The policy impacts on sales and employment exhibit the same pattern as that on
TFP. In particular, the treatment effects grow over time for employment which is consistent with a
dynamic where firms increase R&D, then innovate and then grow larger. There is no effect on
capital, which may reflect substitution towards intangible capital (R&D) and away from tangible
capital. We also looked at various alternative measures of TFP as robustness checks, including
using Solow residual approach to calculate TFP, using sales instead of value added, and using wage
bill instead of employment. The policy impact on the change in TFP (column (9) specification)
remains positive, large, and significant across these TFP measures.62
     These results in Table 8 should be interpreted with caution. First, there are many missing
values on accounting values of employment and sales as UK accounting regulations do not insist
on these being reported for smaller and medium sized enterprises (as in the US). Second, our avail-
able panel ends in 2011 and so we will not capture all the long-run effects. Nevertheless, the results
suggest that the policy effects other measures of size and productivity as well as innovation.



60
   We use a Cobb-Douglas in value added as a function of capital and employment. We estimate separate production
functions for each two-digit industry across all firms in the FAME dataset across the 2000-2005 period.
61
   If we subtract imputed R&D staff count from employment to net out the impact of the policy on raising R&D, the
effects are smaller but qualitatively similar. The effects in log terms (standard errors) on adjusted employment in 2010
and 2011are 0.24 (0.15) and 0.27 (0.15).
62
   Examples of alternative TFP measures include (i) Solow-residual TFP calculated from value added, capital, and
employment, (ii) Solow-residual TFP calculated from sales, capital, and employment, (iii) Olley-Pakes TFP calculated
from sales, capital, and employment, and (iv) Olley-Pakes TFP calculated from sales, capital, and wage bill. The
corresponding estimated policy impacts (standard errors) on the change in TFP are (i) 0.203 (0.123), (ii) 0.284 (0.130),
(iii) 0.211 (0.122), and (iv) 0.211 (0.118).




                                                          22
6.3 How firms cluster around the threshold in later years
     As discussed in Section 3, we chose total assets in 2007 as our primary running variable to
avoid potential endogenous sorting of firms across the threshold once the policy effective date was
announced in 2008. We test the validity of our primary running variable choice and our concern
by performing the McCrary test for each year from 2006 to 2011,63 which estimates the disconti-
nuity in firms’ total asset distribution at the SME threshold of €86m. The respective McCrary tests
for 2006 and 2007 (Figure A3) confirm that firms did not manipulate their total assets to benefit
from the SME scheme before 2008.64 On the other hand, there is some graphical evidence of firms’
bunching right below the €86m from 2009 onward, which is most obvious in 2009 and 2011. Fi-
nally, Figure A4 pools together the two years before the policy change (2006-07) and Figure A5
the three years after the change (2009-11). Again, it is apparent from these graphs that endogenous
sorting does seem to happen, but only from 2009 onward after the policy became effective.

6.4 Exploiting other elements of the SME definition
     We also explored using other elements of SME definition (sales and employment) to estimate
the impacts of the policy and R&D and innovation outputs (Table A10). We must interpret this
with caution because, as noted above, there are many missing values on sales and employment.
Furthermore, we also find evidence that the asset criterion is more binding than the sales criterion.
As a firm is considered an SME if it meets either the asset or the sales criterion, the asset criterion
is binding only when the firm already fails the sales one and vice versa. The binding/non-binding
ratio for the asset criterion is 0.36, considerably higher than the binding/non-binding ratio of 0.20
for sales criterion (Figure A6).65
     As expected, while we still find positive effects on R&D and innovation outputs using the


63
   We exclude 2008 as the increase in deduction rate for large companies became effective before the effective date
for the changes in the SME scheme (including increase in deduction rate for SMEs and SME definition change) was
announced much later in the year. As such, it is hard to predict which way the bunching would happen in this year, or
if it would happen at all.
64
   This is the log difference in density height at the SME threshold. The coefficient (standard error) is 0.029 (0.065) in
2006 and -0.026 (0.088) in 2007.
65
   Binding/non-binding ratio for the asset criterion is calculated as number of firms with sales in 2007 between €100m
and €180m/number of firms with sales in 2007 between €20m and €100m, conditioned on firms’ total assets in 2007
being between €36m and €136m (i.e. +/-€50m window around the asset threshold of €86m). Binding/non-binding
ratio for the sales criterion is calculated as the number of firms with total assets in 2008 between €6m and €86m/num-
ber of firms with total assets in 2007 between €86m and €166m, conditioned on firms’ sales in 2007 being between
€50m and €150m (i.e. +/-€50m window around the sales threshold of €100m). The qualitative result that the asset
criterion is more binding than the sales criterion does not change when we pick different windows to calculate the
binding/non-binding ratios.




                                                           23
sales or employment criterion (Table A10) but these effects are not always statistically significant.
They are also of smaller magnitude compared to our baseline effects estimated using the asset
criterion when taking into consideration the baseline R&D and patent count of the respective sam-
ple. The treatment effect to baseline ratios for R&D using asset, sales, and employment criteria are
1.92, 1.27, and 0.39 respectively, and the same set of ratios for patent count are 1.22, 0.42, and
0.85.66 We also examined whether combining the different SME criteria could increase the effi-
ciency of our estimates, but found no significant improvement.67

7. R&D technology spillovers
     The main economic rationale usually given for more generous tax treatment of R&D is that
there are technological externalities, so the social return to R&D exceeds the private return. Our
design allows us to estimate the causal impact of tax policies on R&D spillovers, i.e. the innovation
of other firms. Following the work of Jaffe (1986) we calculate the knowledge spillover pool
available to firm i as SpilltechRDi,09-11 =              rd
                                                       j i
                                                              ij    j ,09 11   where rdj,09-11 is the average R&D of firm j

over 2009-11 and ωij is measure of technological “proximity” between firms i and j as indicated
by which technology classes a firm patents in (e.g. if two firms have identical distributions of
patent classes then proximity is 1 and if they are in entirely different patent classes the proximity
is zero).68 We follow our earlier approach of using Ej,2007 as instrument for rdj,09-11 where Ej,2007 is

   Even when we restrict the sample to firms for which the sales criterion binds when using the sales running variable,
the percentage effects are still lower than our baseline results, and are not statistically significant.
67
   The asset threshold almost always generates large and statistically significant effects on both R&D and patents,
while the sales threshold does not (columns (1)-(2) and (4)-(5) in Panel B of Table A10). Joint F-statistics for below-
asset-threshold dummy and below-sales-threshold dummy indicate that their effects on both R&D and innovation out-
puts are jointly significant in all cases. Finally, the estimated effects of R&D on innovation outputs using both criteria
as instrumental variables for R&D are of similar magnitude to our baseline effect of 0.530 (0.698 and 0.410 in columns
(3) and (6) respectively). However, these estimates are less precise due to the inclusion of an additional weak below-
sales-threshold dummy instrument.

   Following Jaffe (1986) we define proximity as the uncentered angular correlation between the vectors of the pro-
                                                                                𝐹𝑖 𝐹𝑗′

                                                                        (𝐹𝑖 𝐹𝑖′ )2 (𝐹𝑗 𝐹𝑗′ )2
        𝑛𝑖𝜏
𝐹𝑖𝜏 =         is firm 𝑖’s number of patents in technology field 𝜏 as a share of firm 𝑖’s total number of patents. To calculate
        𝑛𝑖
𝐹𝑖𝜏 , we use information on all patents filed between 1900 and 2011 (80% of these patents are filed after 1980) and
their 3-digit International Patent Classification (IPC), which classifies patents into 123 different technology fields.
These data are available from PATSTAT. Bloom et al. (2013) show that the Jaffe measure delivers similar results to
more sophisticated measures of proximity.

   More generally, 𝐸𝑖,2007 = 𝐼{ 𝑧𝑖,2007 ≤ 𝑧̃ } is a binary indicator equal to one if the 2007 financial variable 𝑧𝑖,2007 is
equal to or less than the corresponding new SME threshold for it, 𝑧̃.

quires that the discontinuity-induced random fluctuations in firm j’s eligibility would only affect
connected firm i’s R&D and innovation outputs through R&D spillovers.
     Our main spillover IV regression estimates the impact of SpilltechRDi,09-11 on firm i’s innova-
tion, pati,09-11, controlling for firm i’s own R&D using Ei,2007 as an instrument for it:
               𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖,09−11 = 𝛼4 + 𝛿𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11 + 𝐺𝑖 (𝒛2007 ) + 𝜃𝐸𝑖,2007 + 𝑓4 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) + 𝜆 ×
                                                                                        𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 + 𝜀4𝑖 (4)
where 𝐺𝑖 (𝒛2007 ) = ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝑔(𝑧𝑗,2007 ) and 𝒛2007 is a vector comprising of the 2007 assets for all
firms; 𝑓4 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) and 𝑔(𝑧𝑗,2007 ) are polynomials of firms i and j’s total assets in 2007; and
𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 = ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 .70 We instrument 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11                          with 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 .
𝐺𝑖 (𝒛2007 ) and 𝑓4 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) are polynomial controls for 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 and 𝐸𝑖,2007 respectively
while 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 additionally controls for firm i’s level of “connectivity” in technology space.
We estimate equation (4) on the sample of firms with total assets in 2007 between €51m and
€121m. This is a larger bandwidth than in the baseline sample as the policy-induced R&D can
have spillovers on firms well beyond the policy threshold.71 Standard errors are bootstrapped using
1,000 replications over firms.
     Column (1) of Table 9 reports the first stage for the R&D spillover term and column (2) the
first stage for own R&D. As expected the instrument 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 significantly predicts
𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11, in the first column and the instrument 𝐸𝑖,2007 significantly predicts firm 𝑖’s
R&D expenditure in the second column. The instruments 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 and 𝐸𝑖,2007 are


70
   Given an RD Design equation for firm 𝑗’s R&D as 𝑟𝑑𝑗,09−11 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐹𝑆 𝐸𝑗,2007 + 𝑔(𝑧𝑗,2007 ) + 𝜀𝑗 , aggregating across
all connected firm 𝑗’s around the SME asset threshold and using 𝜔𝑖𝑗 as weights gives ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝑟𝑑𝑗,09−11 =
𝛼 ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽𝐹𝑆 ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝐸𝑗,2007 + ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝑔(𝑧𝑗,2007 ) + ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝜀𝑗 . Rewritten as 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11 = 𝛼 ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 +
𝛽𝐹𝑆 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 + 𝐺𝑖 (𝒛2007 ) + 𝜂𝑖 , this equation shows that 𝐺𝑖 (𝒛2007 ) is the appropriate polynomial control
when using 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 as instrument for 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,2007 . The key condition that 𝜂𝑖 = ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝜀𝑗 is mean
independent of 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 conditional on 𝐺𝑖 (𝒛2007 ) follows from RD Design results. To address non-trivial
serial correlation among the error term 𝜂𝑖 = ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝜀𝑗 , we correct the standard errors using 1,000 bootstrap replica-
tions over firms.
71
   Note that 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11 is calculated using the population of all possible firm 𝑗’s, while 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007
and 𝐺(𝑧𝑗,2007 ) are calculated using all firm 𝑗’s with total assets in 2007 between €51m and €121m (same as the sample
on which we estimate equation (4)), as the RD Design works best in samples of firms around the relevant threshold.
Our key results are robust to using different sample bandwidths around the threshold to calculate 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007
and/or to estimate equation (4), as reported in foot note 73. In addition, in all reported results, we use second order
polynomial controls separately on each side of the threshold for 𝑔(𝑧𝑗,2007 ) and 𝑓4 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ). In this larger sample we
found that higher order terms were significant (unlike in the earlier Tables on smaller samples). However, using dif-
ferent orders of polynomial controls does not change our qualitative findings.



                                                              25
jointly statistically different from zero in both columns, with F-statistics of 26.9 in column (1) and
6.4 in column (2). Interestingly, we see that in the reduced form patent model of column (3) the
R&D spillover instrument 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 has a large and significant positive effect on firm
𝑖’s patents. This is consistent with the tax policy generating sizeable spillover effect on innovation.
     Turning to the IV results column (4) shows that there appears to be no significant effect of
other firms’ R&D on own R&D. By contrast, the implementation of our main IV specification of
equation (4) in column (5) shows that R&D by a firm’s technological neighbors
(𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11) does have a causal impact on patenting consistent with the patent reduced
form of column (4). This includes the instrument for own R&D as a control in addition to the
instrumented spillover term. Column (6) also instruments own R&D and thus is a very demanding
specification. Even though the spillover coefficient is no longer significant,72 its magnitude is al-
most identical in both specifications.
     In terms of magnitudes, the last two columns suggests that a £1m increase in R&D by a firm
with an identical technological profile will increase patenting by 0.016, which is 3.8% of the direct
effect of an equivalent R&D increase by the firm itself (=0.016/0.416). Combining this with the
mean level of connectivity among firms in the sample gives us the total spillover effect of 0.704
(= 0.016 x 44). In other words, the total spillovers of £1m increase in R&D on all technology-
connected firms’ patenting is about 1.7 times ( = 0.704/0.416) the direct effect on own patenting.73
     This presence of positive R&D spillovers on innovations is robust to a wide range of robust-
ness tests. Focusing on the column (3) reduced form, if we limit our sample to only patenting firms,
the coefficient (standard error) of the R&D spillover instrument 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 on patenting
is 0.185 (0.079), compared to 0.183(0.079) in Table 9. Second, the effect is present in both EPO
and UK patent outcomes, with coefficients (standard errors) of 0.108 (0.048) and 0.157 (0.090)
respectively. Third, the effect remains strong when we use the more sophisticated Mahalonobis
generalization of the Jaffe proximity measure to allow for between field overlap (see Bloom et al.
2013), with coefficient (standard error) of 0.173 (0.080). Fourth, to address concern that patenting
behavior after 2008 could be endogenous to the policy change, we reconstruct our standard Jaffe

72
   If we use robust standard errors instead of bootstrapped standard errors, the estimated coefficient (standard error)
for 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11 from column (6)’s specification is 0.016 (0.008), statistically significant at 10% level.
73
   Consider a firm j that increases its R&D by £1m. The spillover of this R&D increase on a firm i’s patenting, as
estimated by equation (4), is 𝛿𝜔𝑗𝑖 . Summing this spillover over all technology-connected firms’ patenting gives total
spillovers of 𝛿 ∑𝑖,𝑖≠𝑗 𝜔𝑗𝑖 , which is the product of the spillover coefficient and firm j’ level of connectivity. The esti-
mated total spillover effect for an average firm j is then 𝛿̂ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
                                                              ∑𝑖,𝑖≠𝑗 𝜔𝑗𝑖 = 0.016 × 44 = 0.704.

measure of technological proximity using only information on patents filed up to 2008. The result-
ing spillover effect (standard error) is 0.199 (0.086). Fifth, the effect is robust to using smaller or
large sample (by narrowing or widening the sample bandwidth around the asset threshold) to cal-
culate the instrument 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 or to estimate the spillover effect.74
     In addition to equation (4), we also employ an alternative “dyadic” specification to estimate
R&D spillovers on innovations:
             𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖,09−11 = 𝛼5 + 𝜅𝐸𝑗,2007 + 𝑔5 (𝑧𝑗,2007 ) + 𝜁𝐸𝑖,2007 + 𝑓5 (𝑧𝑖,2007 ) + 𝜀5𝑖𝑗                            (5)
where each observation is a pair of firm i and firm j that share the same main technology field (the
technology field in which the firm files the most patents).75 In this specification, we are interested
in the spillover effect of firm j’s R&D instrument 𝐸𝑗,2007 on firm i’s patents, controlling for firm
i’s own R&D instrument 𝐸𝑖,2007 and polynomials of firm j’s and firm i’s total assets. Similar to
above, we focus on the sample in which both firm i and firm j have total assets between €51m and
€121m. The resulting estimate (standard error) for the spillover over is also positive, large, and
statistically significant at 0.098 (0.049).76 This effect is robust to using EPO and UK patent out-
comes, narrowing or widening the sample for firm i and firm j, and constructing firm i-firm j pairs
based on the firms’ technological proximity instead of their main technology field.77 The results
from this complementary “dyadic” spillover specification are qualitatively consistent with the find-
ings from our main spillover specifications, thus further confirming the presence of R&D spillo-
vers on innovations.
     Besides spillovers in technology space, there may be some negative R&D spillovers through
business stealing effects among firms in similar product markets. To address this concern, we fol-
low Bloom et al. (2013) and construct 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11 = ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜙𝑖𝑗 𝑟𝑑𝑗,09−11 that captures the

74
   If we narrow the sample used to calculate the instrument 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 to firms with total assets between
€61m and €111m or between €71m and €101m, the corresponding spillover effects (standard errors) are 0.103 (0.072)
and 0.220 (0.109). If we narrow (widen) the sample for both calculating the instrument and estimating the spillover
effect to firms with total assets between €56m and €116m (between €46m and €126m), the corresponding spillover
effects (standard errors) are 0.137 (0.085) and 0.209 (0.079).
75
   A firm’s main technology field is defined at 3-digit IPC level using information on all patents filed between 1900
and 2008. We exclude patents filed after 2008 and firms patenting only after 2008 due to concern that patenting be-
havior after 2008 could be endogenous to the policy change, thus leading to endogenous sample selection.
76
   The corresponding specification includes second order polynomial controls separately on each side of the threshold
for both firm i and firm j. Standard errors are clustered by firm i and firm j’s common main technology field. Result
is robust to using different orders of polynomial controls and to double clustering standard errors by firm i and firm j.
77
   The estimated spillover effect (standard error) on EPO patents is 0.055 (0.031), on UK patents is 0.122 (0.066),
when narrowing (widening) the sample to firms with total assets between €56m and €116m (between €46m and
€126m) is 0.071 (0.074) (0.200 (0.065)). If we construct firm i-firm j pairs as those with technological proximity not
less than 0.25 or 0.5, the corresponding spillover effects (standard errors) are 0.206 (0.106) and 0.232 (0.115).

R&D spillovers in product market space, where 𝜙𝑖𝑗 is a measure of product market distance be-
tween firms 𝑖 and 𝑗.78 We also construct 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑆𝑀𝐸𝑖,2007 = ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝜙𝑖𝑗 𝐸𝑖,2007 as instrument for
𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11. We found no significant effects of 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑅𝐷𝑖,09−11 on either R&D or patents.
     In summary, these findings provide evidence that policy-induced R&D have sizable positive
impacts on not only R&D performing firms but also other firms in similar technology areas, as
measured by innovation outputs. This further supports the use of R&D subsidies in the UK context.

8. Conclusion
     Fiscal incentives for R&D have become an increasingly popular policy of supporting innova-
tion across the world. But little is known about whether these costly tax breaks causally raise in-
novation. We address this issue by exploiting a change in the UK R&D tax regime in 2008 which
raised the size threshold determining whether a firm was eligible for the more generous “SME”
tax regime. This enables us to implement a RD Design and assess impact of the policy on R&D
and innovation (as measured by patenting). Using total assets in the pre-policy period of 2007 we
show that there was no evidence of discontinuities around the threshold prior to the policy, which
is unsurprising as the new threshold was only relevant for the R&D tax incentive scheme and not
for other programs targeting SMEs.
     The policy caused an economically and statistically significant increase in R&D and patent-
ing, and there is no evidence that the new patenting was of significantly lower value. Hence R&D
tax policies do seem effective in increasing innovation, they are not simply devices for relabeling
existing spending. The elasticity of R&D with respect to changes in its (tax adjusted) user cost is
around 2.6. We argue that this is higher than existing estimates because we focus on firms that are
smaller than those conventionally used in the extant literature and are more likely to be subject to
financial constraints. The policy seems to be cost effective, in aggregate stimulating £1.7 of R&D
for every £1 of taxpayer subsidy. Over the 2006-2011 period we calculate that the tax scheme
meant aggregate business R&D was 10% higher than it would otherwise have been, halting the
secular decline of the UK’s share of business R&D in GDP.
     There are many caveats when moving from these results to policy. Although the results are
optimistic about the efficacy of tax incentives, the large effects come from smaller firms and should
not be generalized across the entire size distribution – this does imply that targeting R&D policy


78
  𝜙𝑖𝑗 = 1 if firm 𝑖 operates in the same industry as firm 𝑗 and 𝜙𝑖𝑗 = 0 otherwise. To calculate 𝜙𝑖𝑗 , we use firms’
primary industry codes at 3-digit Standard Industry Classification (SIC). These data are available from FAME.



                                                       28
on financially constrained SMEs is worthwhile (although a first best policy would be to deal di-
rectly with credit market imperfections).
    We have partially examined general equilibrium effects by demonstrating that the R&D tax
policy stimulated patenting activity not only for the firms directly affected, but also created spill-
overs for other firms who were indirectly affected. However, there may be other equilibrium effects
that reduce innovation. For example, subsidies are captured in the form of higher wages rather than
a higher volume of R&D, especially in the short-run. We believe that this is less likely to be a first
order problem when there is large international mobility of inventors, as is the case in the UK (e.g.
Akcigit, Baslandze and Stantcheva, 2015, and within the US see Moretti and Wilson, 2015). Fi-
nally, it is unclear if tax breaks are the optimal form of support for innovation. Direct support of
basic R&D in the science base and increasing the supply of future talent into the innovation sector
(e.g. Bell et al., 2015; Toivanen and Väänänen, 2016) are policies that may have more powerful
effects on innovation and growth in the long term.

        Figure 1. McCrary test for no manipulation at the SME asset threshold in 2007




Note: McCrary test for discontinuity in distribution density of total assets in 2007 at the SME asset threshold of €86m.
Sample includes firms with total assets in 2007 between €46m and €126m. The discontinuity estimate (log difference
in density height at the SME threshold) is -0.026, with standard error of 0.088.

Note: The figure corresponds to the baseline R&D expenditure regression using a Regression Discontinuity (RD)
Design. The dependent variable is average R&D expenditure over 2009-11. The running variable is total assets in
2007 with a threshold of €86m. The baseline sample includes firms with total assets in 2007 €25m above and €25m
below the cut-off (i.e. between €61m and €111m). Controls for the running variable are estimated separately on each
side of the threshold. The OLS discontinuity estimate at the €86m threshold is 138,540 with a standard error of 55,318.
Bin size for the scatter plot is €3m.

                                    Note: The figure corresponds to our baseline reduced-form patent regression using an RD Design. The dependent
                                    variable is average number of patents over 2009-11. The running variable is total assets in 2007 with a threshold of
                                    €86m. Baseline sample includes firms with total assets in 2007 €25m above and below the cut-off (i.e. between €61m
                                    and €111m). Controls for running variable separately for each side of the threshold are included. The OLS disconti-
                                    nuity estimate at the €86m threshold is 0.073 with a standard error of 0.026. Bin size for the scatter plot is €3m.

tax-price elasticities are 4.8 among young firms and 1.6 among old firms.

A.1 SME definition

     The UK Tax Relief Scheme’s SME (Small and Medium Sized Enterprise) definition is set according
to the European Commission’s Recommendations 1996/280/EC (effective up to December 31st 2004) and
2003/361/EC (effective from January 1st 2005). The definition is based on assets (“balance sheet total”),
employment (“staff headcount”) and sales (“turnover”) as described in Section 2. There are also some
restrictions on the type of eligible enterprises. Below is a summary of the SME definition according to
Recommendations 2003/361/EC. For further technical details on many parts of the tax rules see
http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD91400.htm.
      Measurements of staff headcount, assets, and sales turnover for ceiling tests: Assets is the gross
amount of assets shown in the accounts. The staff headcount of an enterprise represents the number of
full-time person-years attributable to people who have worked within or for the enterprise during the year
under consideration.1 The staff headcount and financial data used for the “ceiling tests” (the maximum
values possible for a firm to be eligible for SME status) are those relating to the latest approved accounting
period, calculated on an annual basis and aggregated according to the rules described below. Assets and
sales figures are converted to Euros using the exchange rate on the last day of the relevant accounting
period, or the average exchange rate throughout that accounting period (whichever is more beneficial for
the enterprise). An enterprise passes the ceiling tests if its staff headcount and either its aggregated assets
or its aggregated turnover fall below the respective ceilings. An enterprise loses (acquires) its SME status
if it fails (passes) the ceiling tests over two consecutive accounting periods.
     Account aggregation rules for different enterprise types: In the case of an autonomous enterprise,
the staff headcount and financial data are determined exclusively on the basis of the accounts of the
enterprise (or the consolidated accounts) of the enterprise itself.2 In the case of a “linked” enterprise, the
ceiling tests are applied to the aggregates of the figures in its own accounts and those from the accounts
of all other enterprises to which it is linked (including non-UK ones), unless the linked enterprises’
account data are already included through account consolidation.3 For further details of the European
Commission’s recommendations for SME definition, see Recommendation 1996/280/EC and


1
  The contributions of part-time workers, or those who work on a seasonal or temporary basis count as appropriate
fractions of a full-time person-year. The term staff includes employees, persons seconded to the enterprise, owner-
managers, partners (other than sleeping partners); it excludes apprentices or students engaged in vocational training
with an apprenticeship or vocational training contract, and any periods or maternity or parental leave.
2
  An autonomous enterprise is defined by exclusion: one that is not a linked enterprise or a partner enterprise.
Generally, an enterprise is autonomous if it has holding of less than 25% of the capital or voting rights in one or
more enterprises and/or other enterprises do not have a stake of 25% or more of the capital voting rights in the
enterprise.
3
  Linked enterprises are those in which one enterprise is able to exercise control, directly or indirectly, over the
affairs of the other.

A.2 UK R&D Tax Relief Scheme

     The UK R&D Tax Relief Scheme includes a SME Scheme and a Large Company (“LCO”) Scheme.4
Since its introduction in 2000 up until 2012, more than 28,500 different companies had made claims
under the SME Scheme, and over 7,000 under the Large Company Scheme, claiming more than £9.5bn
in total R&D support. The annual amount of R&D support had risen to over £1bn by 2008, reaching
£1.4bn in 2012, and covered qualifying R&D expenditure worth £13.2bn (HMRC, 2014).
     Both SME and Large Company Schemes are volume-based, i.e. the tax relief accrues on the total
R&D spending rather than the incremental R&D over a prior base (the main US tax credit scheme is
incremental). It works mostly through enhanced deduction of current R&D expenditure from taxable
income, thus reducing R&D-performing companies’ corporate tax liabilities.5 In addition, under the SME
Scheme, a company that has taxable loss after the additional deduction can also claim payable tax credit
up to the amount of payable credit rate       enhanced qualifying R&D expenditure.6 This payable tax credit
can only be used to reduce the company’s PAYE (Pay-As-You-Earn) or NIC (National Insurance
Contributions) liabilities. Alternatively, the company (either as an SME or as a large company) can choose
to carry the loss forward as normal.7
     Qualifying R&D expenditure must be allowable as a deduction in calculating trading profits, which
includes all flow costs, employee costs, staff providers, materials, payments to clinical trials volunteers,
utilities, software, or subcontracted R&D expenditure (only if the contractor is an SME).8 To be eligible
for R&D tax relief, a company must also spend at least £10,000 a year on qualifying R&D expenditure
in an accounting period. If an SME works as a subcontractor for a large company, only the subcontractor
SME can claim R&D tax relief, under the Large Company Scheme.9 There is also an upper limit of €7.5m


4
   For further details, see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD90000.htm (SME Scheme) and
http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD85050.htm (Large Company Scheme).
5
  For example, if a company is allowed an enhancement rate of 75%, for each £100 of qualifying R&D expenditure
it spends, it can deduct an additional £75 from its taxable income before calculating its tax liability.
6
  For example, if a company is allowed an enhancement rate of 75% and payable credit rate of 14%, spends £10,000
in R&D, and has no taxable income before the additional deduction, it can claim payable tax credit of 0.14
£10,000         1 0.75       £2,450. If instead the company has £1,500 in taxable income before the additional
deduction, it can first use £2,000 of its R&D to reduce its taxable income to zero (i.e. £1,500 = 75% x £2000, then
claim payable tax credit of 0.14     £8,000     1 0.75         £1,960. This latter case is called a combination claim.
7
  A large company that has taxable loss before the additional deduction therefore may still benefit from R&D tax
relief by carrying the “enhanced” loss forward to further reduce its taxable income in the next period. However, this
reduction is only meaningful when the company has enough taxable income in this next period.
8
  Qualifying R&D expenditure could include R&D performed outside of the UK by foreign branches of UK holding
companies, as foreign branches’ revenues and costs are directly consolidated into their UK holding companies’ tax
revenues and costs for UK tax purpose. Qualifying R&D expenditure is unlikely to include R&D performed outside
of the UK by foreign subsidiaries of UK holding companies, as foreign subsidiaries’ net profits are indirectly
incorporated into their UK holding companies’ tax revenues as dividends for UK tax purpose instead.
9
  An SME already receiving another form of notified state aid for a project cannot claim R&D tax relief for that
same project under the SME Scheme (which is also a notified state aid), as total state aid intensity cannot exceed
25% under European Commission’s State Aid rules. However, from April 2003 onward, SMEs were allowed to
claim R&D tax relief for such projects under the Large Company Scheme.

on the total amount of aid a company can receive for any one R&D project under the SME Scheme.10
     The evolution of the UK R&D Tax Relief Scheme is summarized in Table A1. It was first introduced
in April 2000 only for SMEs (Finance Act 2000), then later extended to large companies starting from
April 2002 (Finance Act 2002).11 Between April 2000 and December 2004, the UK followed
Recommendation 1996/280/EC for SME definition, which set the ceilings for staff headcount, assets, and
sales at 249, €27m, and €40m respectively. From January 2005, the UK adopted Recommendation
2003/361/EC and accordingly increased its SME ceilings to 249, €43m, and €50m. Throughout the period
from April 2000 (April 2002) to March 2008, the enhancement rates were set at 50% for SMEs and 25%
for large companies, and the payable credit rate for SMEs was 16%.12
     As discussed in the main paper, numerous changes to the scheme, in both SME eligibility thresholds
and relief rates, became effective at different points in 2008.13 First, from April 2008, the enhancement
rate for large companies was increased from 25% to 30%. Then from August 2008, the enhancement rate
for SMEs was increased from 50% to 75% and the payable credit rate for SMEs was reduced from 16%
to 14% (to ensure that state aid intensity stays below the EU imposed limit of 25%). Also from August
2008, the SME Scheme was extended to “larger” SMEs as the SME ceilings were doubled to 499, €86m,
and €100m for staff headcount, assets, and sales respectively. This change in SME definition is applicable
only for the purpose of the R&D tax relief and therefore is the main focus of our paper, as it allows us to
separate the impacts of the R&D Tax Relief Scheme from other programs. It should also be noted that
even though these new SME ceilings were announced in Finance Act 2007, the date on which they
became effective (August 1st 2008) was appointed much later, in July 2008.14
     There were tweaks to the system in 2011 and 2012. From April 2011, the SME enhancement rate
was increased to 100% and the SME payable credit rate was reduced to 12.5%. From April 2012, the
SME enhancement rate was again increased to 125%. However, the SME definition as announced in
Finance Act 2007 and the large company enhancement rate of 30% remained unchanged throughout this
period.

A.3 Model of R&D demand

          Consider a CES production function in R&D capital ( ) and non-R&D capital ( ). If input
markets are competitive we can write the long-run static first order condition for relative factor demand



10
   In practice, most companies prefer R&D Tax Relief’s SME Scheme over other notified state aids, as the scheme
is sufficiently generous (the maximum relief intensity under the SME Scheme is close to 25%) and is straightforward
to         apply       for.       For       further       details      on        other       conditions,        see

   One exception to this differential treatment of SMEs and large companies was the Vaccine Research Relief
Scheme (VRR) launched in April 2003, which extended the higher 50% additional allowance to cover specific areas
of vaccine and drug research conducted in large companies (Finance Act 2003, Chapter 14, Schedule 31). The VRR
enhancement rate was later reduced to 40% from August 2008 onward.

where    is the user cost of R&D capital,                  is is the user cost of non-R&D capital and                               is a technological
constants representing factor bias terms in the production function. Assume that                                                  can be described by
the perpetual inventory formula                       1                           where rdt is the R&D expenditure in period t.
Since in steady state, the R&D just offsets the depreciated part of the R&D stock                                                         , we can re-
write the first order condition in steady state as:

                                ln                        σ ln        σ ln        ln            ln       B

This is essentially the equation we estimate in equation (1). Around the R&D SME threshold the user
cost of non-R&D capital and technology are smooth. Non-R&D capital (assets) is the running variable
so we have a polynomial approximation to lnZ. The only departure from this first-order condition is that
we cannot estimate R&D in logarithms because of the presence of firms who do not do any R&D, so we
estimate the left hand side in levels instead of logs. To obtain the proportionate change in R&D we use
the empirical averages of lagged R&D spending in the pre-policy change period (or explicitly condition
on the firm’s lagged R&D). We also show that the calculations are robust to using a Poisson regression
whose first moment is the exponential log-link function and so is equivalent to estimating in logarithms.

A.4 Tax-adjusted user cost of R&D

      The full formula for tax-adjusted user cost of R&D as described in sub-section 5.2 is:

                                     1                1      ,
  ,     Pr                                                             Pr                                     1           ,   1       ,
                                              1

where    is the effective corporate tax rate,                is the enhancement rate,                   is the payable credit rate,             is the
real interest rate,   is the depreciation rate, denotes year, and                               denotes the whether the company is an
SME or a large company. Note that                 ,   varies over time with                 ,     ,   , and       ,   .
      For simplicity, we do not consider the possibility that a loss-making large company may still benefit
from R&D tax relief by carrying the “enhanced” loss forward to reduce its taxable income in the next
period, as this reduction is only meaningful if the company makes enough profits in this next period. This
simplification may overestimate large companies’ tax-adjusted user cost of R&D and, as a result,
underestimate R&D tax-price elasticity (by overestimating the difference in tax-adjusted user cost of
R&D between SMEs and large companies). We also do not consider combination claims (cases in which
an SME combines tax deduction with the payable tax credit as there are almost none of them in our
baseline sample.
      The evolution of tax adjusted user costs of R&D for SMEs and large companies over time is
summarized in Table A11. For large companies (for which the payable credit rate is always zero), there
are slight decreases in the corporate tax rate over 2006-12 (from 30% to 28% to 26%) coupled with slight

                                                                       4
increases in the enhancement rate (from 25% to 30%) over the same period. This resulted in a relatively
stable tax-adjusted user cost of 0.190 throughout this period. It is therefore reasonable to use the baseline
sample’s average R&D over 2006-08 as a proxy for how much an average firm in the baseline sample
would spend on R&D if it remained a large company over 2009-11, after the policy change. For SMEs,
large increases in enhancement rate (from 50% to 75% to 100%) more than offset the slight decrease in
corporate tax rate and payable credit rate (from 16% to 14% to 12.5%), leading to a steady reduction in
SMEs’ tax-adjusted user cost of R&D from 0.154 in 2006 to 0.141 in 2011. This widens the difference
in tax-adjusted user cost of R&D between SMEs and large companies over time, from an average log
difference of -0.219 over 2006-08 to an average log difference of -0.271 over 2009-11.
      Finally, as a robustness check, we also consider using the small profit rate (from 19% to 21% to 20%
over 2006-11) instead of the main rate for corporate tax rate. As the tax deduction is less generous with
a lower corporate tax rate, the resulting tax-adjusted user cost in the tax deduction case is higher for both
SMEs and large companies and their gap is smaller in magnitude (average log difference over 2006-08 is
-0.185 and over 2009-11 is -0.229).

A.5 Cost effectiveness analysis of R&D Tax Relief Scheme

      A full welfare analysis of the R&D Tax Relief Scheme requires both an analysis of the benefits in
terms of (say) the increased GDP generated by the R&D induced by the policy (including spillovers) and
the deadweight cost of taxation. We would also need to take a position on other general equilibrium
effects such as the increase in the wages of R&D workers due to increased demand (Goolsbee, 1998). As
an interim step towards this we follow the convention in the literature which is to calculating a “value for
               ∆
money” ratio       where ∆    is the amount of R&D induced by the policy and ∆        is the total amount of
               ∆

additional taxpayer money needed to pay for the scheme (which we call “Exchequer Cost”, EC).

A.5.1 2008 extension of the SME Scheme

      With respect to the 2008 extension of the SME Scheme to cover “larger” SMEs, ∆            measures the
increase in R&D induced by more generous tax relief under the SME scheme by a firm benefitting from
the scheme thanks to the new thresholds. That is, ∆                        where          and           are the
firm’s R&D’s under the new and old policies respectively. Similarly, ∆                          where
and         are the firm’s corresponding Exchequer costs due to the policy change.
                                                                     ⁄
   Rearranging the R&D tax-price elasticity formula                  ⁄
                                                                             gives

                                       ln                  ln

where    is the tax-adjusted user cost of R&D. For simplicity, we consider the tax deduction case and the
payable tax credit case separately.

SME Tax deduction case

      In this case,

where     is the effective corporate tax rate,         is the enhancement rate,                 is the real interest rate, and      is
the depreciation rate. As the above firm moves from being a large company pre-2008 to being an SME
post-2008, its enhancement rate increases from 25% to 75%. At the same time, corporate tax rate
decreases from 30% to 28%. Combining                                 0.25,              0.75,           0.30,            0.28 with

estimated R&D tax-price elasticity of                   2.63 gives ln                        0.23 and               1.84. That is,

R&D increases by 84% in response to a 23% reduction in its user cost.
      On the cost side, we have
                                                                                           0.075
                                                                                                0.21.
      Putting all the elements together gives
          ∆                                                            1.84                                0.84
                                                                                                                    2.70.
          ∆                                             1.84         0.21                       0.075      0.31
so the value for money ratio in the tax deduction case is 2.70. In other words, £1 of taxpayer money
generates £2.70 in additional R&D.
         Finally, note that ∆          could be rewritten as
 ∆                                             0.21                  0.075          Δ      0.21                   0.21      0.075
where the first element represents the Exchequer costs associated with new R&D and the second term
reflects additional Exchequer costs paid on existing R&D due to more generous tax relief. In this case,
the majority of the additional costs are because of the new R&D generated, i.e. Δ                                 0.21
0.18 makes up close to 60% of ∆                ∆                     0.31 .

SME Payable tax credit case

      In this case,

where     – the payable credit rate – is always zero for large companies and 14% for SMEs post-2008.
Combining                 0,           0.14,          0.25,                  0.75, and             2.63 gives ln               0.28

and            2.09 (i.e. R&D increases by 109% in response to a 28% reduction in its log user cost). On

the cost side,                 0 and                                           1                            0.25. Putting all the
elements together gives
                      ∆                                               2.09                       1.09
                                                                                                         2.13.

The value for money ratio in the payable tax credit case is 2.13. In this case, the amount of additional
R&D’s Exchequer costs due to newly-generated R&D Δ                       0.25                    0.27 constitutes more than
50% of ∆         ∆                   0.51 .

A.5.2 R&D Tax Relief Scheme over 2006-11

     To evaluate the overall R&D Tax Relief Scheme over 2006-11, we calculate
                         ∆
                         ∆
separately for each of three cases, SME tax deduction case (Table A13, Panel B), SME payable tax credit
case (Panel C), and large company tax deduction case (Panel D), in each of the years using the same
approach as described in detail above. We generalize our estimated tax-price elasticity of 2.6 to the whole
population of SMEs, but use a more conservative tax-price elasticity of 1.0 for the population of large
companies as these firms are less likely to be credit constrained and therefore less responsive to tax
incentives. In addition, we use the small profits rate (19%-21%) instead of the regular corporate tax rate
(26%-30%) for the population of SMEs as most of them are much smaller than the “larger” SMEs in our
baseline sample and therefore most likely qualify for the small profits rate.
     As reported in Table A13, the SME tax deduction’s value for money ratio decreases from 2.9 in
2006 to 2.7 in 2011 as SME tax deduction becomes significantly more generous over time. On the other
hand, SME payable tax credits and large company tax deduction’s value for money ratios are stable at
around 2.1 and 1.4 respectively as these schemes do not change much over this period. The fact that all
the value for money ratios are well above unity indicates that the R&D Tax Relief Scheme is effective in
inducing additional R&D at relatively low cost to the Exchequer.
     Finally, we estimate the amount of additional R&D induced by the R&D Tax Relief Scheme as
         ∆                                                               ∆
∆                        using the calculated value for money ratios             and Exchequer costs national statistics
         ∆                                                                   ∆

(HMRC 2015). We do this for each of the three schemes in Panels B, C and D and then aggregate them
together in Panel D.
     To give an example, consider the SME tax deduction case in Panel B for 2009. The user cost is
                                                               .         .
calculated using the policy parameters given, i.e.                               0.05     0.15       0.160. This compares
                                                                    .

to a user cost of 0.20           0.05    0.15 in the counterfactual world without any tax relief (e = 0). The log
difference in user cost is -0.222. Applying the formula we obtain:

                                     ∆                1                          1
                                                          1
                                     ∆                             exp           ln

or                   1                          2.811 as in the second row of Table A13 Panel B. From HMRC
     .       .                   .   .

data we know that £130m was paid out in the SME deduction in this year. Hence, we can calculate that
the total amount of additional R&D induced was £365                      130          2.811 (fourth row of Panel B).


                                                           7
      As discussed in sub-section 5.4, our estimates suggest that the overall impact of the R&D Tax Relief
Scheme is large in Panel E. Over 2006-11, the policy, which costs less than £6 billion in lost tax revenue,
induced close to £10 billion in additional R&D. On an annualized basis, spending £0.96b produced
£1.64b of additional R&D.
      These calculations show our estimates of what the counterfactual path of R&D would have been in
the absence of the R&D Tax Relief Scheme. The bottom row of Table A13 gives the yearly breakdown.
For example, the final column shows that on average 2006-11 we estimate that R&D would be a full 16%
lower in the absence of the tax scheme.
      It is important to note that throughout our analysis we have been focusing on qualifying R&D, i.e.
that part of business R&D that is eligible for tax relief. Aggregate qualifying R&D is lower than the
figures for Business Enterprise R&D (BERD) reported in Figure 4. For example, in 2011 aggregate
BERD was £17bn and aggregate qualifying R&D was £12bn. There are various reasons for this
difference, including the fact that BERD includes R&D spending on capital investment whereas qualified
R&D does not (only current expenses are liable). It is also the case that HMRC defines R&D more
narrowly for tax purposes that BERD which is based on Frascati definition.
      We present counterfactual BERD to GDP ratios in Figure 4. To calculate the counterfactual (the
dotted line “UK without tax relied” in Figure 4) we simply deduct the additional qualified R&D that we
estimate were created by the R&D tax relief system (Table A13, Panel D “Total Additional R&D”) from
the        aggregate        BERD          numbers         from         OECD          MSTI          Dataset
(https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MSTI_PUB). Since BERD is greater than qualifying
R&D, the 16% fall in qualifying R&D translates to about a 10% fall in BERD.

Appendix B: Data
B.1 CT600 dataset

         The CT600 dataset is constructed by the UK tax authority (HMRC) and is a confidential panel
dataset of corporate tax returns or assessments made from the returns for the universe of companies that
file a corporate tax return in the UK. We can only access the dataset from within an HMRC facility
(similar to a US Census Bureau Research Data Center) and merging with other datasets requires approval
from HMRC. It is currently not possible to merge CT600 with other government secured datasets
available at different facilities.15 The CT600 dataset covers all accounting periods whose end dates fall
between April 1st 2001 and March 31st 2012 and consists of all information on the UK Company Tax
Return form (which is called the CT600 form). Specifically, an extension of CT600, the Research and
Development Tax Credits (RDTC) dataset, provides detailed information on tax relief claims. However,
CT600 contains little information on financial statement variables (e.g. assets and employment are not
included) as they are not directly required on corporate tax forms.
      We convert the original observation unit of firm by accounting period in CT600 to firm by financial
year by aggregating all accounting periods the end dates of which fall in the same financial year.16 This
conversion affects a very small number of observations as only 3% of our firm by year observations are
aggregates of multiple accounting periods. Our converted dataset then contains 15.7 million firm by year
observations over 12 financial years from 2000 to 2011 (covering 3.2 million firms), including 9.1 million
firm by year observations over our study period from 2006 to 2011 (covering 2.5 million firms).
     Our key variables of interest are those related to firms’ R&D tax relief claims from CT600’s RDTC
dataset, which include the amount of qualifying R&D expenditure each firm has in each year and the
scheme under which it makes the claim (SME vs. Large Company Scheme). These variables, originally
self-reported by firms on their CT600 forms, have been further validated and corrected by HMRC staff
using additional tax processing data available only within the tax authority. It should also be noted that
R&D tax relief variables are only available for R&D-tax-relief-claiming firms for the years in which they
make the claims. While it is possible to infer that non-claiming firms have zero qualifying R&D
expenditure, it is not possible to construct their precise SME eligibility without full information on
employment, assets (balance sheet total), sales, and ownership structure.
     Table B1 shows that over our study period between 2006 and 2011, we observe claims in 53,491
firm by year observations (by 20,730 firms), 81% of which are under the SME Scheme. The total
qualifying R&D expenditure and estimated Exchequer costs under the SME Scheme are in nominal terms
£11.2bn and £1.8bn respectively; the corresponding figures under the Large Company Scheme are
£48.5bn and £3.9bn (excluding claims by SME subcontractors). These figures are in line with the official

15
   For example, it is currently not possible to merge CT600 with the BERD firm survey which is used to build the
national estimate of R&D.
16
   Financial year t begins on April 1st of year t and ends on March 31st of year t+1. So the last year that is currently
available to use is 2011.

R&D Tax Relief Scheme statistics released in HMRC (2014).
     We also use the data on sales and on investment in plant and machinery from CT600. Sales are
reported for 93% of firm by year observations and annualized to account for different accounting period
lengths. CT600 tax-accounting sales, which is calculated using the cash-based method, is not the same as
financial-accounting sales (reported in the FAME data – see below), which is calculated using the accrual
method and used to determine SME eligibility.17 However, CT600 sales provides a good measure for
firms’ growth and performance, given its relatively wide coverage.

B.2 FAME dataset

     FAME is a database of UK companies provided by Bureau Van Dijk. The panel dataset contains
companies’ balance sheet and income statement data from companies’ annual accounts filed at the UK
company registry (Companies House), together with additional information on addresses and industry
codes. Like other countries, UK regulations for reporting accounting variables vary with company size,
so some balance sheet and income statement variables are missing – we discuss the implications of this
below.18
     Our FAME dataset also covers 12 financial years from 2000 to 2011 and contains 19.6 million firm
by year observations (covering 3.8 million firms), including 11.5 million firm by year observations over
our study period from 2006-11 (covering 3.1 million firms). Our key SME-eligibility variable from
FAME (for R&D tax relief purpose) is total assets (i.e. balance sheet total). As almost all UK companies
are required by the Companies House to send in their balance sheets (either full or simplified) for their
annual accounts regardless of their size, total assets coverage in FAME is close to complete, at 97% over
our study period of 2006-11. On the other hand, sales (financial-accounting sales used to determine SME
eligibility) is reported by only 15%, as smaller firms are not required to provide their income statements.19
The proportion of firms who report employment is even lower at 5%, as employment reporting is not
mandatory. Even in our baseline sample of relatively larger firms (i.e. firms with total assets in 2007
between €61m and €111m), the proportion of firms who report sales is 67% and the proportion who report
employment is 55%. For this reason, while we do use FAME sales and employment as running variables
in some alternative specifications, our baseline sample and key results are derived using total assets as
the running variable.



17 The cash-based method focuses on actual cash receipts rather than their related sales transactions. The accrual
methods records sale revenues when they are earned, regardless of whether cash from sales has been collected.
18
   All UK limited companies, public limited companies (PLC), and limited liability partnerships (LLP) are required
to file annual accounts with the Companies House. An annual accounts should generally include a balance sheet,
an income statement, a director’s report, and an audit report. However, smaller companies may be exempt from
sending in income statement, director’s report, or audit report. All UK registered companies are required to file
annual returns with the Companies House, which contain information on registered address and industry codes.
19
   Small companies (those having any 2 of the following: (1) sales of £6.5m or less, (2) assets of £3.26m or less, (3)
50 employees or less) are only required to send in balance sheets. Micro-entities (those having any 2 of the
following: (1) sales of £632,000 or less, (2) assets of £316,000 or less, (3) 10 employees or less) are only required
to send in simplified balance sheets.
                                                         10
        Besides total assets, sales, and employment, other FAME variables used in our paper include primary
industry code (UK 4-digit SIC), register address postcode, and fixed assets as a proxy for capital stock.

B.3 PATSTAT dataset

        Our patent data are drawn from the World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) maintained by
the European Patent Office (EPO).20 PATSTAT is the largest international patent database available to
the research community and includes nearly 70 million patent documents from over 60 patent offices,
including all of the major offices such as the United States Patent and Trademark office (USPTO), the
Japan patent office (JPO) and the Chinese Patent and Trademark Office (SIPO) in addition to the EPO.
Therefore, PATSTAT data cover close to the population of all worldwide patents since the 1980s.
        PATSTAT reports the name and address of patent applicants, which allows matching individual
patents with company databases. The matching between PATSTAT and FAME is implemented by
Bureau Van Dijk and is available as part of the ORBIS online platform through a commercial agreement.
The quality of the matching is excellent: over our sample period, 94% of patents filed in the UK and 96%
of patents filed at the EPO have been matched with their owning company.
        A patent is a legal title protecting an invention. To be patented, a product or process must be new,
involve an inventive step and be susceptible of industrial application. Patents grant their owner a set of
rights of exclusivity over an invention. The legal protection conferred by a patent gives its owner the right
to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing the patented invention for
the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date, and in the country or countries where
the patent has been filed (and subsequently granted). In addition to the financial and administrative costs
of filing, there is a mandatory public disclosure of the description of the technology, which makes
imitation easier and facilitates future technological developments.
        To make things clearer, consider a simplified invention process. In the first stage, an inventor
discovers a new technology. She then decides where to market this invention and how to protect the
intellectual property associated with it. A patent in country i grants her an exclusive right to commercially
exploit the invention in that country. Accordingly, she will patent her invention in country i if she plans
to market it there. The set of patents in different countries related to the same invention is called a patent
family. The vast majority of patent families include only one patent (usually in the home country of the
inventor). Importantly, PATSTAT reports not only the unique identifier of each patent application, it also
indicates a unique patent family indicator for each patent (we use the DOCDB patent family indicator).
This allows us to identify all patent applications filed worldwide by UK-based companies and to avoid
double-counting inventions that are protected in several countries.
        In this study, our primary measure of innovation is the number of patent families – irrespective of
where the patents are filed. This proxies for the number of inventions a firm makes. This means that we

                                                         11
count the number of patents filed anywhere in the world by firms in our sample, be it at the UK Intellectual
Property Office, at the European Patent Office, at the USPTO or anywhere else, but we use information
on patent families to make sure that any invention patented in several places is only counted once. Patents
are sorted by the first year they were filed (the priority year).
     We use fractional counts to account for multiple applicants. For example, if two firms jointly apply
for a patent, then each firm is attributed one half of a patent. In practice, 8% of patents filed by UK-based
companies are filed jointly by at least two companies.
     There are many well-known issues with patents as a measure of innovation. As noted above, not all
inventions are patented, although it is reasonable to assume the most valuables are, so counting patents
screens out many of the low value inventions. Nevertheless, since patents are of very heterogeneous
importance we use several approaches to examine how our results change when looking at patent quality.
First, we distinguish between patents filed at the UK patents office and patents files at the EPO. 21 Since
the financial and administrative cost is about six times higher at the EPO than UK patent office, EPO
patents will, on average be of higher perceived private value. It is also worth noting that the EPO has not
experienced the same explosion of low value patents that the US has suffered since the late 1980s (Jaffe
and Lerner, 2004)
     A second measure of patent quality is the size of patent families, the number of jurisdictions in which
each patent is filed. There is evidence that the number of jurisdictions in which a patent is filed is an
indicator of its economic value as patenting is costly (see Guellec and van Pottelsberghe, 2000, and
Harhoff et al., 2003). A third measure of quality is to distinguish by technology class, as some classes
(e.g. pharmaceuticals) are likely to be more valuable than others (e.g. business process methods). Fourth,
we use patent citations, also available from PATSTAT. For each patent in the database, we know how
many times it was cited by subsequent patents (excluding self-citations). We use the number of
subsequent citations (referred to as forward citations) as a measure of value. Again, this measure is well
rooted in the patent literature (Hall et al., 2005, Lanjouw and Schankerman, 2004)
     In PATSTAT, patents are categorized based on the International Patent Classification (IPC). We use
IPC codes at three-digit level to construct measures of the technological distance between firms used to
investigate spillover effects.

B.4 Sample construction: merging datasets

     CT600 was merged with FAME using an HMRC-anonymized version of company registration
number (CRN), which is a unique regulatory identifier in both datasets. 95% of CT600 firms between
2006 and 2011 also appear in FAME, covering close to 100% of R&D performing firms and 100% percent



21
  Note that because of differences in the “technological scope” of patents across patent offices, two patents filed in
the UK may be “merged” into a single patent filed at the EPO. In this case, these three patents will constitute a
single patent family and the number of patent families is smaller than the number of UK patents. This configuration
happens very rarely, however.
                                                         12
of patenting firms in this period.22 Unmatched firms are slightly smaller but not statistically different from
matched ones across different variables reported in CT600, including sales, gross trading profits, and
gross and net corporate tax chargeable.23 Furthermore, that the match rate is less than 100% is due to
CRN entering error in FAME, which happens more often among firms that are much smaller than those
around SME-eligibility thresholds.24 For these reasons, we believe sample selection due to incomplete
matching between CT600 and FAME is unlikely to be an issue for us.25
     PATSTAT has been merged with FAME by BVD. As PATSAT comprehensively covers all UK
patenting firms, we can safely infer that non-matched firms have zero patents. Over our study period of
2006-11, 9,420 out of 2.5 million CT600 firms claim a total of 46,405 patent families (in 17,293 firm by
year observations), including 23,617 higher-quality EPO patents. These patents cover 90% of the total
recorded in PATSTAT.
     From the merged master dataset, we construct our baseline sample based on total assets in 2007, as
it is our key running variable. Specifically, our baseline sample includes 5,888 firms that satisfy the two
following conditions: (1) the firm’s total assets in 2007 is between €61m and €111m (within €25m below
and above the SME threshold of €86m), and (2) the firm appears in CT600 in 2008 or after (to exclude
firms exiting before the policy change in 2008). Baseline sample descriptive statistics are summarized in
Tables 1 and A2 and discussed in detail in sub-section 4.2.

B.5 Variable construction

     As FAME total assets and sales are reported in sterling while the corresponding SME ceilings are
set in euros, we convert sterling to euros using the exact same rule used by HMRC for tax purposes. That
is, the conversion should be done using the exchange rate on the last day of the relevant accounting period
or the average daily exchange rate throughout that accounting period, whichever is more beneficial for
the enterprise. The daily exchange rate is obtained from the OECD, exactly the same method as used by
HMRC.
     For qualifying R&D expenditure, we do not include the amounts claimed by SME subcontractors,
which do not benefit from more generous reliefs under the SME Scheme. Since SME subcontracting
makes up only a small portion of the overall R&D Tax Relief Scheme, we believe excluding SME
subcontracting does not materially affect our key findings. To account for price differences across years,


22 Out of 2,495,944 firms present in CT600 between 2006 and 2011, 2,358,948 firms are matched to FAME (94.5%
match rate). Over the same period, 20,627 out of 20,730 R&D-performing firms and 9,376 out of 9,420 patenting
firms are matched to FAME (99.5% match rate).
23
   Differences (standard errors) between matched and unmatched firms in sales (£’000), gross trading profits (£),
gross corporate tax chargeable (£) and net corporate tax chargeable (£) are 970 (3,286), 8,969 (13,703), 3,497 (3,898)
and 1,961 (2,291) respectively. None of these differences are statistically significant at conventional level.
24
   Because of confidentiality concerns, we do not get to work directly with CRNs but an anonymized version of
CRNs provided by the HMRC Datalab for both FAME and CT600 datasets. This prevents us from further cleaning
and matching of initially unmatched firms due to above issue.
25
   The correlation between ln(sales) in CT600 and ln(sales) FAME is 0.90. As noted above, the variables are not
measured in the same way, but the fact that their correlation is high is reassuring that the match has been performed
well.
                                                         13
we also convert nominal values of R&D expenditure to their real values in 2007 price, using UK annual
CPI as reported in the World Bank Economic Indicators database.26
     We address the presence of outliers in R&D spending or patenting by winsorizing our key outcome
variables, which include qualifying R&D expenditure and number of all patents as well as number of UK
patents, EPO patents and patent families. Specifically, for each variable, the top 2.5% of non-zero values
in each year within the sample of firms with 2007 total assets between €46m and €126m are set to the
corresponding 97.5 percentile value (i.e. winsorization at 2.5% of non-zero values). This translates into
“winsorizing” the R&D of top 5-6 R&D spenders and the number of patents of top 2-4 patenters in the
baseline sample in each year. It should be noted that our key findings are robust to alternative choices of
winsorization window (e.g. 1% or 5% instead of 2.5%), or to excluding outliers instead of winsorizing
outcome variables.
     Construction of other variables is generally in the notes to tables. Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is
calculated by estimating Cobb-Douglas value added functions using the Olley-Pakes method separately
by two digit industry using 2000-2005 data (i.e. prior to our estimation period). We also calculated TFP
as ln                      1 ∝ ln                  ∝ ln                   , where ∝ is the share of labor
costs in total revenue at the two-digit industry level across all firms in the FAME dataset averaged across
the 2006-2011 period as a robustness test. Value added is sales less materials and is are taken from CT600
and capital is fixed assets from FAME. Firm TFP is measured relative to the mean TFP in the two-digit
industry.

Note: To be considered an SME, a company must fall below the employment ceiling and either the total asset ceiling or the sales
ceiling (“ceiling tests”). The measurements and account aggregation rules for employment, total assets, and sales are set
according to 1996/280/EC (up to December 31st 2004) and 2003/361/EC (from January 1st 2005). A company loses (acquires)
its SME status if it fails (passes) the ceiling tests over two consecutive accounting periods (two-year rule). An SME working as
subcontractor for a large company can only claim under the Large Company Scheme. From April 2000 to March 2012, there
was a minimum requirement of £10,000 in qualifying R&D expenditure for both SMEs and large companies.

are included. Robust standard errors are in brackets. Panel A: Column 1 pools observations across 2009-11 with year dummies
and standard errors clustered at firm level. Columns 2-3 control for second or third order polynomials of running variable.
Columns 4-5 add lagged dependent variable controls. Columns 6-8 add industry (4-digit SIC), location (2-digit postcode), and
industry x location (2-digit SIC x 1-digit postcode) fixed effects. Columns 9-10 use Poisson specification instead of OLS, without
(column 9) and with (column 10) lagged dependent variable control. Panel B: Columns 1-4 use samples with different sample
bandwidths around the threshold. Columns 5-6 use Epanechnikov or triangular kernel weights. Columns 7-9 use samples with
different winsorization parameters or sample excluding outliers in R&D expenditure.

digit postcode), and industry x location (2-digit SIC x 1-digit postcode) fixed effects. Columns 9-10 use Poisson specification
instead of OLS, without (column 9) and with (column 10) lagged dependent variable control. Panel B: Columns 1-4 use samples
with different sample bandwidths around the threshold. Columns 5-6 use Epanechnikov or triangular kernel weights. Columns
7-9 use samples with different winsorization parameters or sample excluding outliers in R&D expenditure.

assets in 2007 in in [€61m, €111m] unless indicated otherwise. Treatment effect used in approaches 1, 2 and 6 is reported in
column 9 of Table 2. Treatment effects used in approaches 3 and 4 are reported in columns 4 and 9 of Table A3 Panel A
respectively. Treatment effect used in approach 5 is estimated using same specification as in column 9 of Table 2 for the specified
sample. Approaches 1 to 5 use the baseline log difference in tax-adjusted user cost of R&D capital between SMEs and large
companies as estimated in sub-section 5.2 and reported in Table A12. Approach 6 uses the same formulae as described in sub-
section 5.2 to calculate log difference in tax-adjusted user cost of R&D capital, but using small profit rate (20% in 2006-07, 21%
in 2008-10, and 20% in 2011) instead of main rate for corporate tax rate.

Note: Tax-adjusted user cost of R&D and value for money ratio are calculated using the formulae as described in Appendix A5
using the above policy parameters. In addition, real interest rate is 5% and depreciation rate is 15%. Tax-adjusted user cost of
R&D without any tax relief is calculated to be 0.200. Tax-price elasticity of R&D among SMEs is -2.63 as estimated in sub-
section 5.2. Tax-price elasticity of R&D among large companies is -1.00. Exchequer costs come from HMRC national statistics.
Additional R&D is calculated as value for money ratios times Exchequer costs.

  Figure A1. Discontinuities in average R&D expenditure over 2009-11 at “pseudo” SME asset thresholds




Note: Discontinuity estimate at each placebo threshold is estimated using the baseline first-stage R&D expenditure
regression (OLS Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) with average R&D expenditure over 2009-11 as the
dependent variable).The running variable is total assets in 2007. Baseline sample includes firms with total assets in
2007 €25m above and below the placebo threshold. Controls for first order polynomials of running variable
separately for each side of the placebo threshold are included. The dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence interval
for the discontinuity estimates.

Note: Discontinuity estimate at each placebo threshold is estimated using the baseline reduced-form R&D
expenditure regression (OLS estimates based on the RD design with average number of patents over 2009-11 as the
dependent variable).The running variable is total assets in 2007. Baseline sample includes firms with total assets in
2007 €25m above and below the placebo threshold. Controls for first order polynomials of running variable
separately for each side of the placebo threshold are included. The dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence interval

Note: McCrary tests for discontinuity in distribution density of total assets at the SME asset threshold of €86m,
year-by-year for 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Each sample includes firms with total assets in [€46m, €126m] in the
respective year. The discontinuity estimate (log difference in density height at the SME threshold) (standard error)
in 2006 is 0.029 (0.065), in 2009 is -0.125 (0.078), in 2010 is -0.006 (0.077), and in 2011 is -0.086 (0.075).

Note: McCrary test for discontinuity in distribution density of total assets at the SME asset threshold of €86m before
the policy change, pooling together total assets in 2006 and 2007. Sample includes firms with total assets in [€46m,

Note: Asset threshold is not binding for firms with 2007 sales in (€20m, €100m] and binding for firms with
2007 sales in (€100m, €180m]. Sales threshold is not binding for firms with 2007 total assets in (€6m, €86m]
and binding for firms with 2007 total assets in (€86m, €166m].
