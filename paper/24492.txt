The School-Entry-Age Rule Affects Redshirting Patterns and Resulting Disparities in Achievement

                                           ABSTRACT

Since, other things equal, older children do better in school, the extent and pattern of delayed
entry affects observed patterns in academic performance. This paper provides three new sets of
relevant findings, utilizing comprehensive data on birth cohorts of children who enrolled in first
grade in North Carolina public schools.: (1) Delayed entry (redshirting) reduces the male-female
achievement gap by 11%; (2) For each of 6 groups defined by sex and race/ethnicity, the
likelihood of redshirting is strongly inversely related to academic ability; and (3) A recent shift in
the cut date to earlier in the calendar year reduced redshirting, and provided clear evidence that
parental decisions are tied to the absolute age of the child rather than age relative to classmates.
The adaptation of redshirting to changes in the cut date is an important mechanism by which such
changes affect patterns in academic outcomes.

Redshirting Matters


Introduction

State mandatory attendance laws require children to attend school over a specified age range,
while also specifying the minimum age at which children may enroll in public school. For
example, in North Carolina, children are required to be at least five years old before enrolling in
a public kindergarten; children who turn five after August 31 are required to wait until the
following year before enrolling. Parents are allowed to delay their child’s entry, as long as the
child is enrolled by age seven. A recent literature has adopted the term “redshirting” for parents’
decision to delay their child’s entry into first grade (Deming and Dynarski 2008), importing the
term from college sports. 1 Bassok and Reardon (2013) offer two estimates for the nationwide
prevalence of redshirting, 4% and 5.5%, based on different data sets. It is also possible, due to
loopholes in the minimum age laws, that some parents enroll their child a year early, which by
analogy has been dubbed “greenshirting,” but that involves less than one percent of public school
children (Bassok and Reardon 2013).

The public interest in noncompliance with the minimum age rules stems from the well-
established fact that other things equal, being older conveys an academic advantage, at least in
elementary and middle school (Bedard and Dhuey 2006; Elder and Lubotsky 2009; Dobkin and
Ferrerira 2010; Bassok and Reardon 2013; Cook and Kang, 2016; Cascio and Schanzenbach
2016; Dhuey et al. 2017). For children who comply with the minimum age laws there is a one-
year spectrum of birthdays in each grade. The older children, born just after the cut date, tend to
perform better than their younger classmates, as measured by standardized test scores, likelihood
of on-time promotion, and the likelihood of being identified with a learning disability (Dhuey
and Lipscomb 2010; Elder 2010). Causal analysis of the effect of exact age on academic
performance, using regression discontinuity or IV methods, provides a consensus on these
beneficial effects, although with some disagreement about whether the effects are attenuated by
middle school (Bedard and Dhuey 2006; Elder and Lubotsky 2009; Cascio and Schanzenbach
2016; Cook and Kang 2016; Dhuey et al. 2017). There is every reason to believe that redshirting

keeping young athletes out of competition for a year to allow them to mature physically without
losing a year of NCAA eligibility.

(which tends in practice to be concentrated among children born just before the cut date) would
convey the same “old for grade” benefits.

Thus the extent and pattern of noncompliance with the minimum age rule affects levels and
patterns in academic outcomes. In recent studies from state and national data sets, there is
consensus that redshirting is much more common for males than females, and more common for
whites than blacks or Hispanics. Several studies report that the likelihood of redshirting
increases with socioeconomic status (SES) (Bassok and Reardon 2013; Dhuey et al. 2017),
although Dhuey and her colleagues find a countervailing pattern in Florida of retention in the
primary grades that has the effect of eliminating the correlation of age with SES by third grade.
Another dimension of interest is whether the decision to redshirt is influenced by the academic
preparation or ability of the child prior to enrollment. Two recent studies find a weak positive
relationship (Bassok and Reardon 2013) and null relationship (Dhuey et al. 2017).

This paper explores the patterns in on-time enrollment and the deviations therefrom, to better
understand what might be motivating parents and to determine the effects of “noncompliance”
on patterns in standardized test scores. We analyze a large administrative data set for a birth
cohort of children who enrolled in first grade in a North Carolina public school, finding that
92.5% were “on time” relative to the state regulation, while the others were either early (0.8%)
or late (6.7%). As expected, white males were greatly overrepresented in the late (redshirt)
group. We estimate the causal effect of age on the standardized end-of-grade test in third grade
(EOG3) using months of birth as instruments: an extra year of age raises scores by .36 of a SD
in reading, and .30 in math, and these estimated effects are quite similar across race-sex groups.
These estimates are used to assess the overall effects of redshirting on average EOG3 scores for
six groups defined by sex and race/ethnicity, finding, for example, that every group’s averages
are raised by redshirting, but that white males enjoy the biggest boost given a redshirting rate of
9.9%. 2


2
  The focus on third-grade outcomes is dictated by the limitations of the dataset. The positive
effects of being old for grade extend through middle school and beyond, including not only
standardized test scores but also the likelihood of an exceptionality designation and involvement
in criminal activity before age 16 (Cook and Kang 2016; Dhuey et al. 2017). And despite this
persistent advantage, old-for-grade youths are more likely to drop out before graduation (Dobkin
and Ferreira 2010; Cook and Kang 2016) and then turn to serious crime (Cook and Kang 2016).
                                                 3
Redshirting Matters


This approach allows us to assess the effects of redshirting on the usual test-score gaps by sex
(girls outperform boys) (Autor et al. 2016) and race and ethnicity (whites outperform blacks and
Hispanics) (Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor 2009). The largest effect is for the white female-male
gap in reading, which would be 11% larger if it were not for the fact that white boys are twice as
likely to redshirt as white girls. On the other hand, the male black-white test score gap is
increased by differential redshirting (albeit just 1%).

To better understand parents’ choices about redshirting, we propose and implement a method to
take account of academic ability, using hypothetical EOG3 scores (adjusted for delay) as a proxy
for academic ability at the time the redshirting decision is made. Contrary to other recent
reports, we find a strong negative effect of academic ability on the likelihood of redshirting, an
effect that is present for all six demographic groups. (The effect of household poverty is to
increase redshirting, but that effect is reversed in sign if academic ability is included as a
covariate.) This pattern has the effect, then, of differentially raising the observed EOG3 scores
for children of lower ability.

Given that redshirting patterns have noteworthy effects on the gender gap and average
performance of less able children, changes in public policy that affect the prevalence of
redshirting are of public concern. In particular, North Carolina recently changed its legislated
cut date for school entry from October 17 to September 1, a change that would be expected to
affect the prevalence of redshirting if parents’ to the extent that parents’ judgments about
whether to delay a child’s entry are influenced by absolute age (maturity, preparation), rather
than by age relative to potential classmates. We analyze redshirting patterns before and after this
change, with a clear finding: while the prevalence of redshirting drops to near zero following the
change in cut date, prevalence during July and August is unchanged. It appears, then, that it is
absolute-age-related considerations that influence parents’ decisions, and hence that the
prevalence of delayed entry is directly influenced by a state’s choice of cut date. That
consequence, intended or not, deserves consideration in making the choice of cut date.




Dobkin and Ferreira (2010) report that later earnings are unaffected by relative age in school,
which they interpret as the net result of the positive and negative effects of being old for grade.


                                                   4
Redshirting Matters


In what follows we begin with a brief discussion of the parents’ decision whether to delay their
child’s entry into kindergarten. The next three sections describe the data, report the results of
analyses of the effect of exact age on school achievement, and then provide estimates of how
observed redshirting patterns affect test-score gaps by sex and race. We then turn to a novel
assessment of the influence of academic ability on the redshirting decision, followed by a report
of results of a natural experiment that strongly suggests that parents are influenced by the
calendar age rather than the relative age of their child in school. A final section concludes.



    I.     The parents’ choice to postpone their child’s school entry

Here we sketch the considerations that may be relevant to parents who are considering delaying a
year before enrolling a child in public kindergarten. Their sense of the child’s maturity (school
readiness) and academic ability, possibly informed by consultation with a teacher or other
professional, may influence the parents’ decision. An extra year would yield a greater chance for
academic and social success. (For some parents, increasing the child’s likelihood of success in
school athletics may also be of interest.) The fact that boys are more likely to delay entry than
girls is one well-established pattern compatible with a parental concern with the child’s maturity
(DiPrete and Jennings 2011). But delayed entry comes at the cost of delayed graduation from
high school (if the child progresses on the normal schedule through school), or a greater chance
of dropout before graduation (Cook and Kang 2016; Angrist and Krueger 1991). Delayed entry
may also be costly to the household if it requires additional child care or paid nursery school.
Even if free public pre-school is available and attractive to the parents, the hours and
transportation arrangement may be less desirable than kindergarten.

Government policy may influence the prevalence of delayed entry. For example, a program that
subsidizes child care may make delayed entry more attractive, while state-supported pre-school
programming may reduce it. 3 Here we focus on the potential for another policy domain, the

  North Carolina has two state-wide programs to improve services and school preparation from
pre-school children. The Smart Start program provides funding to improve childcare services at
the county level for all children between the ages of 0 and 5. More at Four (now NC PreK)
provides funding for pre-school for disadvantaged 4-year-olds. Both programs have been shown
to be effective in improving educational outcomes through at least grade 5 (Dodge et al. 2016).
Possible effects on the redshirting decision have not been established.
                                                  5
Redshirting Matters


state’s cut date, to influence redshirting patterns. Whether the choice of date matters depends on
whether the parents’ decision is more influenced by the child’s absolute (calendar) age, or age
relative to potential classmates. For example, if the parents’ main goal is for the child to
someday make the high school basketball team, then age and maturity relative to classmates is
what matters, and the cut date would be irrelevant – there would always be the same incentive to
delay entry. If the primary goal is for the child to make normal progress in primary school, then
an absolute judgment of maturity (school readiness) may be the dominant concern.

In particular, North Carolina attendance law was amended to change the cut date from October
17th to September 1st beginning with the 2004 birth cohort. One consequence was that on-time
students born in August became younger relative to their class following the change, though of
course their absolute age did not change. To the extent that parents are concerned about their
child’s age relative to classmates, then we would expect an increase in redshirting for August
births following this reform, a prediction we test in what follows.

    II.    Data Description

Under current law in North Carolina, a child must reach the age of 5 on or before August 31 to
be eligible to enter a public kindergarten that year (NC G.S. 115c-364). 4 Some children delay
kindergarten entry by a year or two, skip kindergarten, or spend more than a year in kindergarten
before entering first grade, but this minimum age requirement for kindergarten entry largely
determines the age distribution in North Carolina classrooms. Most children born just before the
cut date, and nearly all children born after, begin school as soon as legally permitted, with the
result that there is a sharp discontinuity in age between first graders born in August versus those
born in September.

In order to examine the relationship between date of birth and school entry, and subsequent
schooling outcomes, we use student-level administrative data from the North Carolina public
school system, provided by the North Carolina Education Research Data Center (NCERDC). The

 The legal age requirement for public school entry (NC G.S. 115c-364) allows for two
exceptions: children born after the cutoff date are still eligible to enter kindergarten if 1) they
have been attending school in a different state in accordance of the laws of that state before
moving to North Carolina or 2) principals find them mature enough to enter school. As seen in
Table 4, this academic “greenshirting” is very rare in practice; the share of first graders below
age six is less than 1%.
                                                  6

data contain detailed information on demographic characteristics and schooling experiences of
students attending North Carolina public schools, including their gender, race/ethnicity, month
and year of birth, school attended, economic disadvantage (measured by their eligibility for free
or reduced price lunch), exceptionality status, and academic performance on end-of-grade (EOG)
reading and math tests. (EOGs are standardized achievement tests administered statewide for
students in grades 3 through 8.) For this analysis, we focus on the exceptionality status and EOG
reading and math test scores in grade 3 (standard normalized at the test year-by-subject level) as
measures of students’ early academic outcomes.

Our main sample consists of children born between November 2003 and August 2004, who later
attended a North Carolina public school between grades 1 and 3. Had everyone complied with
the minimum age and entered first grade in the year they turned 6, all of our sample students
would have entered first grade in fall of 2010. 5 Furthermore, we can express school starting age
among compliers as a simple linear function of their month of birth. For example, children born
                                10                                                       1
in November 2003 would be 6 12 years old and those born in August 2004 would be 6 12 years

old when starting first grade in September 2010. 6 In reality, however, children’s month of birth
and their timing of school entry are not perfectly correlated because of academic redshirting and
(to a lesser extent) grade retention in kindergarten.

We begin our analysis on the effects of school starting age and academic redshirting on
schooling outcomes by graphically illustrating the relationship between students’ month of birth,
school starting age, and several early schooling outcomes. Figure 1 plots students’ starting age if
they comply (line) and actual average school starting age (dots) against their month of birth.
Most students born in the fall comply with the minimum age requirement, as the actual and
predicted school starting age are closely aligned. The share of children entering first grade older
than expected noticeably increases in later months.

  Until 2008, the school entry cutoff date in North Carolina was October 16. Children born
between September 1st and October 16th, 2003 were thus eligible to enter school one year earlier
than our sample students.
6
  School year in North Carolina begins in late August or early September. The legal requirement
is that the opening date for school year cannot be earlier than the Monday closest to August 26
(NC G.S. 115C-84.2).

Redshirting Matters


[Figure 1]

Figure 2 shows that the rate of delayed school entry varies by birth month. It is evident that
delayed school entry (either due to academic redshirting or grade retention) is heavily
concentrated among those born just before the cutoff date. Less than 5 percent of children born
between November and March enter first grade older than expected, but that rate is more than
11% among July births and 15% among August births.

[Figure 2]

Figure 3 plots students’ average EOG3 reading and math scores by birth month. Children who
enter school older (because they were born in earlier months) also perform better on reading and
math achievement tests. Furthermore, the relationship between test scores and birth months is
nearly linear for both reading and math scores. A recent study finds that children born in winter
months tend to come from households with greater disadvantage relative to those born in
summer months (Buckles and Hungerman 2013), but that does not appear to be the case in the
North Carolina data.

[Figure 3]

Figures 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the shares of students diagnosed as learning disabled (Figure 4), or
speech impaired (Figure 5), or identified as academically and intellectually gifted (Figure 6) in
grade 3 by birth month. While the relationship is more noisy than the relationship between
months of birth and test scores (Figure 3), the figures show that children who were born in earlier
months and entered school older are less likely to be diagnosed as disabled and more likely to be
considered as academically gifted, compared to their classmates born in later months.

[Figure 4]

[Figure 5]

[Figure 6]

Table 1 presents summary statistics on various characteristics of the sample. With respect to
race and ethnicity, it is 52% white, 25% black, and 15% Hispanic students, with 8% other. Based
on their free or reduced price lunch eligibility in grade 3, 56% are low income. The average age
at entry to first grade is 6.5; 92%of students enter first grade in the year predicted by their month

                                                  8

of birth, while 7% enter school older than expected. When they reach third grade, 5.4% are
diagnosed as having learning disability, 4.9% a speech impairment, and 9.1% are considered
academically and intellectually gifted (AIG).

[Table 1]



    III.    Effect of age on academic outcomes

If every child entered school in the first year they became eligible, it would be straightforward to
estimate the reduced-form effect of school starting age on schooling outcomes. Assuming that
month of birth is uncorrelated with other unmeasured determinants of outcomes, a regression on
observed school starting age (SSA) would provide unbiased estimates: 7

                                           𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖                   (1)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 is the outcome of interest, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is a vector of individual covariates, and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 is the school
starting age of student i. In reality, however, school starting age is to some extent endogenous,
and both the schooling outcome and school starting age are likely to be correlated with
unobserved characteristics of student i; among other considerations parents may delay sending
their children to school if they do not appear as mature and school-ready as their potential
classmates. Unless researchers control for children’s level of maturity and school-readiness in
Equation (1), school starting age (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 ) is likely to be correlated with the error term (𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 ), and the
OLS coefficient 𝛾𝛾 will be a biased estimator of the causal effect of school starting age.

Following the previous literature, we run an IV estimation to address this endogeneity problem.
In the first-stage estimation, students’ months of birth are used as instruments for their school
starting age:

                                 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 = 𝜁𝜁 + 𝜂𝜂𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + ∑10
                                                           𝑚𝑚=1 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜄𝜄𝑖𝑖          (2)


7
  Even with the perfect compliance with the age requirement for school entry, this reduced-form
estimation cannot separate the effect of relative maturity (i.e., entering school older than other
students) from the effect of absolute maturity (i.e., entering school older in an absolute sense).
Several recent studies, however, attempt to separately estimate the effects of relative and
absolute maturity on students’ academic achievement (e.g., Elder and Lubotsky 2009; Carlsson
et al. 2015; Cascio and Schanzenbach 2016;).
                                                         9
Redshirting Matters


where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 represents student i's school starting age, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 the vector of individual characteristics
(gender, race/ethnicity, and economic disadvantage), and 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 the month-of-birth indicator which
is equal to 1 if student i was born in month m and 0 otherwise. The month-of-birth indicators are
normalized with respect to the school entry cutoff date so that m = 1 if born in November 2003
and m=10 if born in August 2004. 𝜄𝜄𝑖𝑖 is an idiosyncratic error.

Using the predicted school starting age from the first-stage, the second-stage equation is:

                                                                �𝚤𝚤 + 𝜈𝜈𝑖𝑖
                                         𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝜅𝜅 + 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴                            (3)

                                                  �𝚤𝚤 is student i's predicted school starting age
where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 represents the outcome of interest and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴
from the first stage. 𝜇𝜇 can then be interpreted as the local average treatment effect (LATE), i.e.,
the average treatment effect for the subpopulation of those who complied with the minimum age
requirement and entered school in the first year of eligibility (Imbens and Angrist 1994).

Table 2 presents OLS and IV estimates of the effect of school starting age on several early
schooling outcomes. The OLS estimates presented in Panel (A) show that school starting age is
significantly negatively correlated with EOG3 reading and math scores. Moreover, children who
start school older are more likely to be diagnosed as learning disabled and less likely to be
considered academically and intellectually gifted in grade 3. As discussed above, however, the
endogeneity of school starting age is likely to cause OLS estimates to be biased. For example, if
academic redshirting is mostly done by parents whose school-aged children are not mature
enough, the OLS estimate for the effect of school starting age on academic achievement will be
downward-biased.

The IV estimates presented in Panel (B) tell a qualitatively different story. The month of birth is
strongly negatively related to EOG scores. Once self-selection about when to begin school no
longer influences the statistical results, a one-year increase in school starting age is associated
with significant increases in the EOG3 reading and math achievement scores (0.36 and 0.30
standard deviation increases, respectively). It also significantly decreases the likelihood of being
diagnosed as learning disabled (a 1.6 percentage point decrease) and speech impaired (a 1.0
percentage point decrease), and increases the likelihood of being considered academically and
intellectually gifted (a 2.3 percentage point increase) in grade 3. The F statistics for the joint
significance of excluded instrument variables, reported at the bottom of Table 2, show that use of

                                                     10
Redshirting Matters


month-of-birth indicators satisfies the conventional weak IV test (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker
1995).

To put these magnitudes in the context of previous studies, Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff
(2014) report that a 1 standard deviation improvement in teacher quality leads to 0.10 (0.14)
standard deviation increases in English (math) test scores, based on test scores and teacher
assignment data in grade 3-8 from a large U.S. school district. Dobbie and Fryer (2011) evaluate
the effect of attending the Promise Academy in the Harlem Children’s Zone on schooling
outcomes, and find that attending the Promise Academy elementary school, a “No-Excuse”
charter school, increases students’ English and math scores by 0.2 standard deviations per year.
Thus the beneficial effect of entering school a few months older on early academic achievement
is of a similar magnitude as having an unusually effective teacher or attending a highly effective
school.

[Table 2]

The prevalence of redshirting differs widely among groups defined by sex and race or ethnicity,
and it is of interest to determine whether the academic effects of redshirting also differ. To
explore the potential heterogeneity in the effect of school entering age, IV analyses (Equations 2
and 3) were run separately for each race-by-sex group and report the results in Table 3. 8 Panel
(A) shows the IV estimates obtained from the aggregate sample (from Table 2), and subsequent
panels present IV estimates obtained from each race-by-sex group separately. Across all race-by-
sex groups, we find that the effect of school starting age on early academic achievement is
significantly positive. The effect of entering school one year older on EOG 3 reading score
ranges from a 0.27 standard deviation increase for black females to 0.43 standard deviation
increase for Hispanic females; the same two groups bracket the range for EOG3 math scores (.21
to .38). Figure 7 graphically illustrates the magnitudes of group-specific IV estimates for the
effect of school starting age on EOG3 reading and math scores. With a possible exception of
black females, the estimated effects for both EOG3 reading and math scores are quite
homogeneous.

[Figure 7]

In addition to the IV analysis presented above, we also ran an analysis comparing academic
outcomes of students born in August and September of 2004. Since the school entry cutoff date
was August 31, those born in August typically enter school one year earlier than those born in
September. This comparison, which exploits the sharp discontinuity in school entry age among
similar-aged children, amounts to a regression discontinuity (RD) analysis. Our RD estimates,
presented in more detail in Appendix B, are consistent with the IV estimation results shown
above; children who enter school older (September births) perform significantly better on EOG 3
reading and math tests, are less likely to have learning disability and speech impairment, and
more likely to be considered to be academically and intellectually gifted in grade 3. These
findings closely align with the RD estimates presented in a recent working paper by Dhuey et al.
(2017), which compared academic achievement, educational attainment, and juvenile
incarceration outcomes of children born just before and after the cutoff date using administrative
data from Florida.

   IV.       Academic Redshirting and Achievement Gaps

The results above motivate the question to what extent the early achievement gaps across race
and sex groups can be explained by the difference in their school entry age. Panel (A) of Table 4
shows the rates of early, on-time, and delayed school entry for each race-by-sex group. We find
that early school entry is rare, less than 1% for all the groups. Delayed school entry is more
common and more differentiated across sex and race. Within each racial group considered,
female students are more likely to enter school on-time than male students (94.5% vs. 89.5% for
whites, 95.0% vs. 91.5% for blacks, and 94.0% vs. 91.3% for Hispanics). Among males, Blacks
(92.3%) and Hispanics (92.2%) are more likely to enter school on time than Whites (90.1%).

Panel (B) presents students’ average EOG3 reading score (“Actual Mean”), as well as the EOG3
reading score predicted by their birth year (“Hypothetical Mean”). For example, for students who
entered first grade one year older than expected by their birthdates, 0.359 (the IV estimate for the
effect of entering school a year older) is subtracted from their actual EOG3 reading scores.
Similarly, the IV estimate (0.359) is added to the EOG3 reading scores of students who entered


                                                 12
Redshirting Matters


school a year earlier than expected. Overall, this age-adjustment lowers students’ average EOG3
reading score by a 0.016 standard deviation, demonstrating that the overall level of academic
achievement among 3rd graders would have been slightly lower in the absence of academic
redshirting or greenshirting.

The rates of early and delayed school entry differ across different race and sex groups. Black
females have the lowest rate of delayed school entry (4.0%), and the score-adjustment only leads
to a 0.01 standard deviation decrease in the average EOG3 reading score. On the other hand,
9.9% of white males delay school entry, and adjusting for their age advantage leads to a 0.03
standard deviation decrease in the average EOG3 reading score. The same type of adjustment is
made to EOG3 math scores. The results are presented in Panel (C). Again, the magnitude of the
age adjustment is the highest among white males whose average EOG3 math score would have
been 0.02 standard deviation lower in the absence of redshirting, and the least for black females
whose average score would have been just 0.006 lower. We also performed this score-adjustment
by school starting age using group-specific IV estimates from Table 3, and obtained similar
results (See Appendix Table A1).

[Table 4]

Table 5 reports how much of the observed racial and gender gaps in EOG3 reading and math
scores is driven by differential patterns of academic redshirting and greenshirting. The observed
gap in EOG3 reading score between white males and females is 0.151 standard deviation. The
gap would have been 0.017 standard deviation (11%) larger if all children had entered first garde
on time. Similarly, adjusting for the early and delayed school entry would have increased the
black female-male gap in EOG3 reading scores by 0.012 standard deviation (6%) and Hispanic
female-male gap by 0.009 standard deviation (8%). We also find that correcting for the different
patterns of school entry timing lowers the white-black and white-Hispanic male achievement
gaps, but the magnitude of this correction is much smaller (around 1%).

[Table 5]

   V.       Determinants of Delayed School Entry

It is well documented that delayed school entry is more common among males and whites, but
only few studies investigate other correlates of the delay. Dobkin and Ferreira (2010), using

                                                13
Redshirting Matters


birth-certificate data from Texas and California, find that minorities and children with less-than-
college-educated parents are more likely to comply with the school entry laws (as opposed to
redshirting). Based on data from the kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal
Survey (ECLS-K), Bassok and Reardon (2013) find that redshirting is more common among
white, male, and high-SES children.

In this section, we explore determinants of delayed school entry using the sample of North
Carolina public school students born between November 2003 and August 2004 (see Section III).
The dependent variable in the logit regression analysis is delayed school entry (1 if entered first
grade older than expected, 0 otherwise). The regressors include indicators for months of birth,
race-by-gender group, and economic disadvantage, as well as hypothetical academic
achievement in grade 3. The results are reported in Table 6.

[Table 6]

In the baseline specification (first column), only month-of-birth indicators are included as
explanatory variables; in this specification and others, the likelihood of delayed school entry is
monotonically increasing in the month of birth. In the second column, race-by-sex indicators are
included. Compared to white females all three male groups (white, black, and Hispanic) are
significantly more likely to delay school entry, and white males are most likely to delay.

In the third and fourth columns, we additionally control for students’ economic disadvantage and
then the hypothetical performance on EOG3 reading and math achievement tests. To compute
the hypothetical reading and math scores in grade 3, we proceed as before, “correcting” the
observed test scores if the student was younger or older. For example, for those who entered
school one year older than expected, we compute their predicted EOG3 scores by subtracting our
IV estimate of the school starting age effect (0.36 for reading and 0.30 for math) from their
actual EOG3 reading and math scores. For students who entered school on-time, the predicted
EOG3 scores are equal to their actual scores.

The hypothetical academic performance in grade 3 is a strong and significant predictor of
delayed school entry. A reasonable interpretation is that parents are more likely to delay sending
their children to school if they expect their children’s academic performance to be weak if they
begin school on time.


                                                 14
Redshirting Matters


Interestingly, the inclusion of academic ability as explanatory variables leads to a qualitative
change in the effect of economic disadvantage (from positive to negative) and in the estimated
effects for the two groups of minority males (also from positive to negative).

To further explore the differences between race-sex groups in the correlates of redshirting, we re-
ran the logit analysis with a full set of covariates for each of the race-sex groups separately, thus
allowing for a full set of interactions between demographic group and all other covariates. The
results are reported in Table 7. Month of birth has the strongest effect for whites (both male and
female). Economic disadvantage is associated with reduced redshirting for white and Hispanic
males, but increased redshirting for black males; the effect on females is negligible. Of greatest
interest is that the decision to redshirt is highly sensitive to academic ability (hypothetical EOG3
reading scores especially) for all of the race-sex groups. The effect for the reading score is quite
homogeneous across five of the six groups, the exception being white males.

[Table 7]

The discovery that academic ability has an important effect on the decision to delay entry
suggests that within each race-sex group, redshirting tends to disproportionately benefit weaker
students.

   VI.      The effect on redshirting of a change in the cut date

The analysis so far shows that students’ age and academic ability are important determinants of
delayed school entry. Parents’ judgments about whether their child is ready to start school could
be made relative to some absolute standard of school readiness, or influenced by a comparison
with the reference groups of potential classmates, as discussed in Section II. The distinction
becomes relevant in predicting the effect of a change in the state’s cut date. North Carolina
recently did change the minimum age for school entry, providing clear evidence that the absolute
judgment is dominant.

Until 2008, North Carolina law specified that children had to be at least 5 years old before
October 17 to be eligible to enter a public kindergarten that year. Thus, children born in
September and early October were among the youngest students in class if they entered on time,
and it was common for that group to delay entry to the following year and begin school older
than most of their classmates. In 2009, however, the cutoff date was shifted to September 1, and

                                                 15
Redshirting Matters


thereafter children born in September and October were all required to wait an extra year to enter
kindergarten, making them older than most of their classmates without redshirting. On the other
hand, under the new regime, children born in July and August who entered on time became the
youngest children in the classroom.

This cutoff change creates a unique natural experiment to gauge the role of students’ absolute
and relative age in the parents’ school entry timing decision. If the decision to delay school entry
is mainly driven by students’ absolute age, the rate of redshirting among July and August births
would remain unchanged after the change in cut date; regardless of the cut date change, they will
start kindergarten at the same biological age, i.e., just after turning five. However, if students’
relative age is the main determinant of redshirting, the cut date change should increase the rate of
redshirting among August births; more parents would delay sending their child to school so that
the child would not be the youngest in his classroom. If relative age were all that mattered, then
the redshirting pattern in August would mimic the previous redshirting pattern in the four weeks
prior to October 16th.

For this analysis, data were obtained from the NCERDC on the exact dates of birth for students
who 1) were born between July and December in 2003 and 2004 and 2) attended a North
Carolina public school for first grade. Figure 8 shows the 5-day averages of the rate of delayed
school entry for the two cohorts. The two vertical bars represent the new cutoff date, September
1 (day -47), and old cutoff date, October 17 (day 0).

Consider the 2003 cohort first, who were subject to the old cutoff date. Children born before
October 17, 2003 were eligible to enter school a year earlier than those born after October 17,
2003, but a large number of children born just before the cut date delayed their school entry; the
5-day average rate of delayed school entry was more than 20 percent at the end of August and
reached nearly 40 percent just before the cutoff date. By contrast, among the 2004 cohort, the
rate of delayed school entry for children born between September 1 and October 16 was close to
zero, which is not surprising. What is noteworthy, however, is that the rate of delayed school
entry among July and August births remained essentially unchanged, even though their relative
age in the school cohort had changed significantly. If on time they were now the youngest in
their classroom, but there is no evidence that their rate of redshirting increased after the change



                                                  16
Redshirting Matters


in cut date, let alone jump to the level of the late September/ early October births under the
previous regime.

There is a chance that the lack of an adaptation by parents was because the new cut date was in
some sense a surprise, in which case there might be greater effect in subsequent years. To test
this possibility we checked against the redshirting patterns for another cohort, children born in
the second year of the new regime, 2005. The pattern remained virtually unchanged. The results
are depicted in Appendix Figure C1.

These findings suggest that children’s absolute age, rather than age relative to classmates, plays
the dominant role in the decision to redshirt. The policy-relevant implication is that the
prevalence of redshirting is affected by the cut date, and in particular that a state that changes to
an earlier cut date, as did North Carolina, should expect to experience a reduction in redshirting –
for better or worse. 9



    VII.    Relevance to Policy on School Starting Age

Students who attend public school in North Carolina are governed by the mandatory attendance
laws, which specify the minimum age at which children may be enrolled in kindergarten, but
allow parents to delay enrollment if they so choose. Delayed entry (redshirting) is quite
common, especially for children who would be the youngest in their class if they started on time.
But delayed entry was even more common before the state changed its cut day from October 17
to September 1. That result, demonstrated here by a simple comparison of redshirting patterns in
the relevant years, was not obvious, since it is plausible a priori that redshirt decisions are
primarily influenced by parents’ concern about their child’s age relative to classmates, rather
than absolute age.

How should the reduction in redshirting be evaluated? The research literature has established
that educational outcomes are affected by the child’s age. In every measurable respect, older is


9
  It is possible that some parents were operating under a rule of thumb that children should not
start kindergarten until they were 5 years old. Under the old regime, children with September
and early October birthdates could start school at age 4, but that was no longer the case under the
new regime. In that case, the calendar age would be serving as an absolute standard.
                                                  17
Redshirting Matters


better, at least in grade school. From the public perspective, “older is better” primarily pertains
to relative standing, and is not of obvious concern to the public interest. But the literature also
demonstrates certain patterns in redshirting; not only that children born just before the cut date
are more likely to be held back, but also that white boys are more likely to be held back than
other sex-race groups. Our findings reproduce and extend these findings. One implication is
that for whites, the female-male gap in reading is reduced 11% by the net effect of parental
decision making around school entry. Perhaps of greatest interest is a new discovery, that for
each of the six groups defined by sex and race/ethnicity, the likelihood of redshirting is strongly
inversely related to academic ability. The apparent effect is that redshirting patterns tend to
benefit weaker students relative to stronger students. The social value of these effects can be
disputed, but without a doubt the concern about boys lagging girls in school is frequently voiced
(Orr 2011; Fortin, Oreopoulos and Phipps 2015), and an assist for weaker students seems
desirable on the face of it. On the other hand, redshirting patterns tend to increase the black-
white gap for males (though not much). And children who start school older are more likely to
drop out before graduating, a clearly undesirable consequence of redshirting (Cook and Kang
2016).

Thus, when it comes to the patterns in academic outcomes, the change in cut date in North
Carolina would be predicted to have a variety of effects, both positive and negative, through the
mechanism of changes in redshirting. These effects are worth considering in a comprehensive
evaluation of reforms in school attendance laws.

Appendix B: Regression Discontinuity Analysis

In addition to the IV analysis presented in the main text, we also ran a regression discontinuity
analysis on North Carolina students born near the school entry cutoff date. Specifically, we
compare the set of schooling outcomes between children who were born in August and
September 2004 and later attended North Carolina public schools for grades 1-3 by estimating
the equation below:

                                     𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 represents the outcome of interest for student i (i.e., EOG3 reading and math
achievement scores, learning disability and speech impairment, and AIG status in grade 3). 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 is
the binary indicator for September-births, and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 represents the set of individual covariates (race-
by-gender and economic disadvantage indicators). Since the school entry cutoff date (September
1) creates a one-year difference in the timing of school entry eligibility among children of similar
age, this comparison amounts to a regression discontinuity analysis with a rectangular kernel,
where all students born in August and September are given equal weights. In particular, it
represents the causal, intention-to-treat effect on educational outcomes of receiving school entry
eligibility a year earlier than a comparable control group.

The IV analysis presented in the main text estimates the effect of school starting age on early
educational outcomes by comparing children born between November 2003 and August 2004,
most of whom are in the same academic cohort but differ in their school entry age because of
their birth month. On the other hand, the RD analysis compares educational outcomes of August-
and September-borns, who should be very much similar in individual characteristics but are
expected to be placed in different academic cohorts. Although the two study designs differ (intra-
cohort vs. inter-cohort comparison), they both exploit the plausibly exogenous variation in
students’ timing of birth relative to the legal school entry cutoff date to estimate the causal effect
of school entry timing on educational outcomes.

Estimation results are presented in Appendix Table B1. First row corresponds to estimates
obtained from the full sample, and subsequent rows show estimation results obtained from each
race-gender group separately. From the full sample, we observe a large discontinuity in school
starting age (0.72 year) at the cutoff date, but this discontinuity is noticeably smaller than a full

year difference, suggesting a non-negligible rate of non-compliance (mainly in the form of
academic redshirting). The estimated discontinuities substantially vary across different race-
gender groups, ranging from 0.63 year for white males to 0.80 year for black females. The
pattern of age discontinuity across different race-gender groups strongly suggest that academic
redshirting is more common for males than females, and more common for whites than blacks
and Hispanics. Turning to the discontinuities in academic achievement and exceptionality status
at the cutoff date, we find that students born just after the cut date perform significantly better on
the EOG 3 achievement tests, are less likely to be diagnosed as learning disabled or speech
impaired, and more likely to be considered academically and intellectually gifted in grade 3.
These findings are consistent with the IV estimation results presented in the main text.
