An Analysis of the Performance of Target Date Funds

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper presents a thorough evaluation of target date funds for the period 2010-2020. These
funds have grown enormously in assets, reaching $1.4 trillion by the end of 2019. They account
for approximately 24 percent of all of the assets in 401(k) accounts. The paper reports on the
results of a style analysis evaluation of TDFs which results in their effective asset allocation. It
examines the constant in the style analysis regressions which reflects the over- or under-
performance of the funds relative to a passive benchmark with the same asset allocation. Lower
cost TDFs tend to match the benchmark, whereas higher cost TDFs deviate considerably from
theirs. We examine how TDFs performed in the stock market crash between 2/19/20 and 3/23/20.
In this five week period, broad market averages fell by about one-third. We find that the value of
long-dated TDFs (those with a target date of 2045 and beyond) fell by between 30 and 35
percent, whereas the 2025 funds, designed for people roughly 60 years old, lost between 20 and
25 percent of their value. We find that past performance only weakly influences future expected
performance. As with equity funds in general in this period, TDFs with actively managed
ingredient funds, on average, trailed the performance of their cheaper passively managed
counterparts.

1. Introduction


Target date funds have become enormously important assets in defined contribution
retirement accounts. More than half of all 401(k) participants have at least some money in
target date funds and approximately 24 percent of the total assets in 401(k) accounts are in this
type of fund. The total amount invested in TDFs was approximately $1.4 trillion at the end of
2019.


The performance of target date funds was subject to considerable scrutiny in the Great
Recession of 2008-09, leading to Congressional hearings and a report from the General
Accountability Office (GAO, 2011) suggesting changes in disclosures about them. What
prompted us to initiate this review of the performance of target date funds was the stock
market crash in February and March of 2020. How did they do this time? This led us to take a
broad look at target date funds and their performance over the past 5 to 10 years.


We create a database of all target date funds and balanced funds in existence in the U.S. in the
2010-2020 timeframe. We examine their expense ratios and find that the distribution is
bimodal with roughly half of the money in TDFs facing expenses of less than twenty basis points
and most of the other half facing fees between 50 and 70 basis points. Target date funds are a
type of "fund of funds" with the ingredient funds being mostly different kinds of equity and
fixed income funds. By and large, the lower fee funds are based on passive (indexed) ingredient
funds and the higher expense funds are based on actively managed component funds.


We examine the "glide paths" of target date funds (their asset allocation over time) by
examining their monthly returns between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2019 and
finding the best fit relative to the returns on 13 factor ETF funds. This is an exercise in style
analysis as introduced by William Sharpe (1992). In general, we find that the style analysis
reveals that target date funds change their effective asset allocation in a manner consistent
with their advertised glide paths.


                                                                                                    1
We examine the constant in the style analysis regressions. This constant reveals whether the
TDF had a higher or lower average monthly return than the best fitting set of reference or
factor funds. It is a close relative to the CAPM alpha of the target date funds. The target date
funds with relatively low cost, those with expense ratios of less than 30 basis points, have style
analysis constants close to zero. This indicates that they perform very similarly to their best
fitting set of factor funds. On the other hand, the higher cost TDFs have a relatively disperse
distribution of style analysis constants. On average, the more expensive funds have lower and
negative constants, but they are overrepresented amongst the worst and best performing TDFs.
All 35 of the funds with a constant of negative 10 basis points per month or lower are higher
expense TDFs.


We look at how target date funds performed during the stock market crash between February
19 and March 23, 2020. The broad U.S. stock market fell by about one-third in this five week
period. We consider this period a kind of "natural stress test" for target date funds. Most of
the long-horizon funds (those with a target date of 2045 and beyond) lost between 30 and 35
percent of their value. That is, they did not do significantly better than a pure equity fund.
More interestingly, most of the short-horizon funds, such as the 2025 funds, lost between 20
and 25 percent of their value over the five weeks. While this didn't surprise us after having
done the style analysis, it may have disappointed participants anticipating retirement in
approximately five years. While the glide path does move to more conservative asset
allocations as retirement approaches, for many funds it never becomes what could be
considered low risk or safe. On average, the lower cost funds did slightly better than the higher
cost funds, but the more impressive difference was that there was a significantly wider range of
outcomes among the higher cost funds.


We examine the Sharpe ratio, the ratio of the average excess return to risk, of the funds for the
2015-19 period. Once again, the pattern is that the average low-cost fund had a superior
Sharpe ratio compared to the higher cost funds. Finally, we examine the connection between
returns in the 2010-14 period and the subsequent returns in the 2015-19 period. We find a


                                                                                                     2
weak positive connection on average between performances in the two periods. A one percent
per year better performance in the first period predicts 9 basis points per year better
performance in the second period. In other words, there is a large reversion to the mean. The
implication of this is that even a high cost fund with a very strong prior record of returns has a
lower expected future rate of return than a low cost fund.


We end the paper with a discussion of whether a moderate risk balanced fund with some
guidance on how to choose amongst a family of balanced funds might present a better default
option than a target date fund. TDFs have a one size fits all aspect to them where the only
difference between employees is their age and hence target retirement date. People differ in
many other important dimensions. A set of balanced funds (also called target risk funds)
might allow people to better sort themselves out in terms of their risk tolerance and hence
optimal asset allocation.



2. Data

The data used in the analysis come from several sources to get as comprehensive a view as
possible of the universe of target date funds and balanced funds. We scraped both Morningstar
and Yahoo! Finance databases for all funds with a "target date" or "balanced allocation" label,
coming up with a total of 4,116 unique tickers, with 1,547 of those tickers bearing the label of
"balanced funds" and 2,569 of the tickers being labeled as "target date funds." Historical
returns, net asset value (NAV), and assets under management (AUM) come from the WRDS
CRSP database of mutual funds, while current prospectus data comes from Morningstar,
Yahoo! Finance, and Google Finance. Historical data runs from January 1, 2010 to April 30,
2020, and returns and NAV are recorded on a daily basis, while AUM is reported monthly.


An important feature of mutual funds is the various share classes available to the investor.
Many funds have several share classes, and some offer 10 or more different types of shares.
Importantly, share classes within a fund differ in fees and expenses charged to shareholders, as
well as in other dimensions such as services offered or administration support to the sponsor. A

                                                                                                     3
typical retail investor will likely not have access to all share classes of a given fund due to
minimum investment requirements. Share classes of mutual funds can be roughly divided into
two categories: retail and institutional. Retail share classes generally have higher fees and
expenses but feature low minimum required balances, while institutional share classes usually
have lower fees and expenses but high minimum required investments. Consequently, retail
share classes are more accessible to individual investors, while the high minimum investment
requirements restrict institutional shares to investments made by institutions. It is important to
note, however, that shares of retirement-oriented funds available to an individual through their
employer such as a 401(k) or 403(b) account will often be institutional-type shares, since the
employer will have many employees' accounts invested in the same fund, thus meeting the
required minimum investment for an institutional share class.


Much of our analysis examines the relationship between the expense ratio and historical
returns of a fund, so we seek a way to aggregate the expenses across share classes of a fund
into a single representative number that describes how "expensive" any given fund is, without
referring to a specific share class. Such an aggregation allows comparison of fees across funds.
This aggregation is achieved by taking a weighted average of expense ratios across share classes
within a fund on a monthly basis, where the weights are proportional to the AUM of each share
class 1. This weighting permits us to calculate the average expense charged on a dollar invested
in the fund, across all investments in the fund. This means that, all else equal, a fund with more
dollars in retail shares will have a higher average expense ratio than a fund with more dollars in
institutional class shares. One can calculate an average weighted return as well in the same
manner, either by taking a weighted average of the given returns of the various share classes,
or by taking any share class return, adding back the expenses taken out over the interval of the
return, and subtracting the average expense ratio calculated above.



1
  AUM for share classes are given on a monthly basis in the CRSP historical data, while expense ratios for share
classes are given on an annual basis, as determined in the annual prospectus in the CRSP historical data. However,
the historical expense ratio data for many funds is incorrect or incomplete, so we use the current expense ratio for
each share class and fund and assume it is constant over time. This is reasonable, since historical data on expense
ratios for share classes show they generally vary by 5 basis or less points over time.

                                                                                                                   4
Once we take a weighted average of the share classes, we are left with data at the fund level.
This aggregate data contains 977 distinct funds, 612 of which are categorized as target date
funds, and 365 of which are balanced funds. Table 1 shows a more detailed count of funds by
category. Target date funds come in 5-year vintages, with the year being the expected date of
retirement, or closest date to expected retirement. Balanced funds, on the other hand, are
distinguished by the percentage of fund assets invested in equities; the general idea is that
funds with higher equity exposure will have higher risk and higher expected returns.

3. The Growth of Target Date Mutual Funds


The growth of TDF mutual funds between 2000 and 2020 was nothing short of astounding.
Figure 1 shows the assets under management (AUM) data assembled by the Investment

                                                                                                 5
Company Institute (ICI, 2020). The bar for 2000 is so short as to be hard to see, but the total
assets at the end of that year in target date funds amounted to $8 billion. At the end of 2019,
the assets had grown to $1,395 billion, representing an average compound annual growth rate
of more than 31 percent. About 80 percent of TDF assets are held in defined countribution
retirement accounts, with another 15 percent held in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs),
leaving only 5 percent in other types of accounts.




Figure 1: AUM in Target Date Funds by year




A significant contributor to this growth was the fact that in 2006 the Department of Labor ruled
that target date funds could be a "Qualified Default Investment Alternative" (QDIA) in tax
deferred retirement plans. The authority to designate QDIA status was part of the 2006
Pension Protection Act. This status provides plan sponsors some degree of protection from
lawsuits resulting from poor investment performance if they use a TDF family as the default
option in a plan with automatic enrolment. Balanced funds and professionally managed

                                                                                                  6
accounts also were given QDIA status, but target date funds proved to be far and away the
most popular defaut option in such plans..


Figure 2 shows the growth of particular vintages of target date funds (such as 2025 or 2045
funds) over time. By 2019, both the 2025 and the 2030 funds had total assets which equaled
the entire TDF assets only ten years earlier. Both ended the year with more than $200 billion in
assets. It is not surprising that the funds with the most assets today are those whose target
dates are relatively soon. The figure also hints at the fact that even the 2025 and 2030 funds
took a big hit in the market crash of February and March 2020. The slowly growing but smooth
line is the retirement class of target date funds and the one showing essentially no growth since
2015 is the 2015 target date fund category.




Figure 2: AUM in Target Date Funds by vintage over time




Target date funds can be thought of as an innovation on traditional balanced funds, which hold
asset classes in roughly fixed proportions such as 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds.


                                                                                                 7
Target date funds are a kind of dynamic balanced fund which becomes more conservative as
the target date approaches. Figure 3 shows the growth in assets under management over time
for balanced funds. The biggest balanced funds are those whose equity allocations range from
50 to 70 percent. But even this most popular type of balanced fund has experienced a growth
of AUM much slower than target date funds. In fact, the growth of assets in balanced funds has
trailed their returns, indicating that they have not attracted positive net cash flows for the past
five years. The extremely conservative and extremely aggressive funds have attracted very few
assets over the past 20 years. The net flows of cash into balanced funds is shown in Figure 4.




Figure 3: AUM in Balanced Funds by risk category over time




                                                                                                      8
Figure 4: Cash Inflows into Balanced Funds, 2001-2020


The growth of target date funds has been impressive in other dimensions. For instance, by the
end of 2016, fully 53 percent of all 401(k) participants had at least some money in TDFs. This
figure is up from 19 percent at the end of 2006. Similarly, by the end of 2017, 23.8
percent of all 401(k) assets are held in TDFs, up from 3.1 percent in 2006. These 2016 and
2017 numbers are the latest available from the Investment Company Institute (2019), but the
penetration of TDFs in 401(k) accounts has almost certainly continued since then. Most large
401(k) accounts offer TDFs. The figure was 82.4 percent in 2017. TDFs are even more prevalent
in the accounts of young participants. In 2016, almost half (47.6%) of assets in accounts of
participants in their 20s were invested in TDFs. People in their 60s, with their much larger
accounts, held almost 20 percent (18.4% to be exact) in TDFs. It is too soon to say whether
today's young people will continue to hold TDFs at a very high rate or whether they will change
investment approaches as they age and their accounts grow.


These facts lead us to the fairly obvious conclusion that target date funds are large and
important financial instruments. We feel that this justifies looking closely at their performance
in recent years.

                                                                                                 9
4. Expenses

Target date funds can be found with an extremely wide range of annual expense ratios, ranging
from .08 percent to 1.98 percent per year. However, if you look at the assets under
management in different expense ranges, you get the results shown in Figure 5. The
distribtution is roughly bimodal, with nearly half of the total assets in target date funds
imposing expense fees below 20 basis points (0.20%) with the bulk of the rest being subject to
50 to 70 basis points. Target date funds are a type of fund-of funds, where the ingredient funds
are mostly various types of equity and fixed income mutual funds. The low cost TDFs are
exclusively made up of passive (indexed) ingredient funds whereas the more expensive TDF
funds have actively managed ingredient funds




Figure 5: AUM in TDFs by Expense Ratio



Figure 6 displays much the same information in the form of a cumulative distribution function.
It displays what fraction of the total assets in TDFs have expenses less than or equal to the
expense ratios shown on the horizontal axis. In both figures the most striking fact is that almost
no money in TDFs faces expense ratios between 20 and 40 basis points. The TDFs based on

                                                                                                10
index funds are cheaper than that and those based on active portfolio management are more
expensive than that. The separation in expense ratios is quite clean.




Figure 6: CDF of AUM in TDFs by Expense Ratio


Figure 7 shows the expense structure faced by investors in traditional balanced funds. It has a
similar bimodal pattern to what Figure 5 shows for target date funds. This time there are very
few dollars in balanced funds with expense charges between 20 and 50 basis points. The
money in balanced funds facing expense charges between 80 and 120 basis points is much
greater than with TDFs. We think that the explanation is that the bulk of TDF assets are in
defined contribution plans which tend to be offered in the less expensive share classes (such as
R classes or an institutional class). Balanced funds are more likely to be held in IRA accounts or
taxable brokerage accounts and be held in more expensive retail share classes.




                                                                                                11
Figure 7: AUM by Expense Ratio for Balanced Funds


Figure 8 displays the same information as Figure 7, but this time in the form of a cumulative
distribution function. Comparing Figures 6 and 8, one can see that the less expensive passive
funds have a bigger share of the assets in target date funds than they do in balanced funds.
With TDFS, almost half of the total assets face expense charges of 20 basis points or less. For
balanced funds, less than 30 percent of the assets face such low fees. At the other end of the
spectrum, only a very small percentage of the assets in TDFs face expense ratios of greater than
80 basis points, whereas with balanced funds, about 25 percent of the assets face expense fees
of 80 basis points or more.




                                                                                                  12

5. Style Analysis

To explain returns of a fund, it makes sense to determine the exposures of a fund's investments
to various broad asset classes, such as large capitalization growth stocks, small-cap stocks,
corporate bonds, government-issued debt, and so on. A fund may report its various holdings
and one may use that data to determine exposures, but an interesting alternative is to simply
use past returns of the fund and past returns of index funds that track the various broad asset
classes in order to find what combination of asset classes best fit the past returns, thus
determining the "effective" exposures of the fund's investments. Such a method was pioneered
by William Sharpe (1992), and is often used in mutual fund analysis. We first describe the
methodology of our style analysis before giving our results and discussing them.


Since style analysis determines a fund's exposure to a range of asset classes over time, we first
need to select a period of data for which the investment style and asset allocation of the fund is
relatively stable. This is important for target date funds, since they are advertised as changing
exposure to risky asset classes over time, to decrease risk as the individual approaches

                                                                                                    13
retirement. On the other hand, to achieve the most accurate estimators, we would like to use a
long period to have as many observations as possible. We chose the 5 year period beginning in
January 2015 and ending in December 2019 to satisfy the tradeoff between more data and
having a period of stable asset allocation. The target date funds themselves are labeled in 5-
year intervals and are intended for any individual retiring in a 5-year window, indicating that it
is likely for the fund to have similar asset allocations over a given 5 year period. Another subtler
point in choosing data for style analysis consists of the return periods to use, where again there
is a tradeoff; shorter return periods result in more data points, but tend to be noisier, having
higher variance of annualized returns. We chose monthly returns to balance noise and
observation frequency; and this appears to be a popular choice in the literature as well.
Therefore, our data set used in the estimation of exposures consists of returns data on a
monthly basis from January 2015 to December 2019, giving a total of 60 observations per fund.
Note that this relies on the assumption that the fund exists for the entire period. This condition
is not satisfied for every fund in the dataset, so we dropped all funds for which there wasn't a
full time series of returns for the 5-year period. In particular, this had the effect of removing
funds that were established since the beginning of 2015, which are mainly funds with a distant
target date, such as the 2055, 2060, and 2065 funds.


We do not rule out the possibility of survivorship bias in the data as well, since we cannot tell
how many funds that no longer exist are not included in our dataset, therefore our results
concern the population of funds conditional on their survival through the analysis period. In
total, the filter left us with 395 funds that reported returns during the 5-year period. We model
each target date fund's return as a convex combination of the returns of its respective
exposures, plus a constant, , which is a measure of average performance of the fund relative
to a portfolio that solely consists of diversified investments with the same exposures to the
asset classes. We used 13 asset classes to explain fund exposures, using ETFs whose holdings
are representative of the various asset classes. These ETFs and the asset classes they cover are
given in Table 2. We refer to them as "factor funds" or reference funds.

For the purposes of our analysis, we do not remove fund expenses from returns, so the
interpretation of the constant  includes differences in the management costs of funds. Thus,
returns are modeled as

This constrained least squares problem is a quadratic program, for which there exist many
efficient numerical optimizers.


We ran the above constrained regression for all funds that existed during the entire Jan 2015-
Dec 2019 period. Figure 9 shows the average effective asset exposures by three major classes
(equities, bonds, and alternative investments), that are the sums of all the exposures within
their respective categories, for each fund, and then aggregated by averaging over all funds
within a given vintage. The "wicks" at the top of the bars in the graph display the 5th and 95th
percentile allocation to the three major asset classes. The results are consistent with the
publicized glide paths of target fund providers. The 2020 funds, on average, have an asset
allocation of about 50 percent equities. The long duration TDFs have 85 to 90 percent equities.
One may think of the different vintages (2020, 2025, 2030, etc.) as snapshots of how a single
target date fund may choose effective asset allocations over its lifetime. For example, 5 years
from now, we would expect a 2030 fund's exposures to look like a current 2025 fund's
exposures. When retirement is far away, as in the 2045-2060+ target date funds, the funds
have very high effective exposure to equities, over 80%, and correspondingly low exposure to
bonds and alternative investments. As retirement becomes closer, the glide path to lower-risk
investments sets in, and the exposure to equities decreases while exposures to bonds rise.
While exposure to alternative investments is low for all vintages of funds, it is higher for funds
closer to or already in retirement. From this evidence, we conclude that target date funds in

                                                                                                   16
effect are keeping their promise of following a glide path, moving to lower-risk and lower-
expected return assets as the target retirement date approaches. Another way to empirically
investigate the glide paths is to directly estimate expected return and volatility from past
returns, rather than look at exposures to broad asset classes. We perform this type of analysis
in Section 8.

are not surprising. Effective equity exosure from the style analysis exactly corresponds to the

6. A Natural Stress Test: February 19, 2020 to March 23, 2020

Even near term target date funds suffered large losses in the 2008-09 financial crisis, prompting
Congressional hearings on their perceived poor performance. The market crash from February
19,2020 until March 23, 2020 offers a recent test of their performance in a dramatically bad
equity market. In that five week period, the S&P 500 stock index fell 33.8 percent whereas the
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTI) fell 35 percent. The Vanguard Total Bond Market
Index ETF (BND) had a total return of about -1.5 percent. Figure 11 shows how target date
funds performed in the form of a "box and whiskers" graph. The vertical dimensions of the box
shows the 75th and 25th percentile outcomes, the line in the middle of the box shows the
median outcome and the end of the whishers show the 95th and 5th percentile outcomes. The
points shown with diamound shapes are outliers. The figure indicates the most of the distant
future TDFs (the 2045, 2050, 2055 and 2060+) lost between 30 and 35 percent of their value

                                                                                               18
over this five week period, failing to do significantly better than an all equity portfolio invested
in the S&P 500. Most of the near future TDFs (the 2025 funds) lost between 20 and 25 percent
of their value. While the 2025 funds, presumably held by workers within roughly five years of
retirement, did better than the long duration TDFs, they still lost more than one fifth of their
value in five weeks which may have disappointed their shareholders given the promise of the
glide paths becoming safer and more conservative as retirement approaches.




Figure 11: Returns for stress test period (Feb 19 to Mar 23, 2020, non-annualized), TDFs



Figure 11 shows other findings regarding returns during this stress test period. The figure
divides target date funds into two groups in terms of expense ratios, those with fees less than
30 basis points (categorized as low expense funds) and those with fees over 30 basis points (the
high expense category). Recall that few if any funds have expenses in the immediate
neighborhood of 30 basis points. What is apparent is that the median performace is worse for

                                                                                                   19
the expensive funds than the low cost funds. However the range of outcomes is much wider
for the high-cost funds. In all categories except the retirement one, the 95th percentile high-
cost fund outperformed the 95th percentile low-cost fund. For several vintages, the 75th
percentile high-cost fund outperformed the 75th percentile low-cost fund. For the poor
performers in each category, the high-cost funds did worse than the low-cost funds. For
instance, the 25th percentile high-cost fund did worse than the 25th percentile low-cost fund for
all vintages. We think that the right interpretation of this is that the high-cost funds are almost
all actively managed and deviate from the overall market in their portfolios. In some cases
those deviations (or bets) pay off and in other cases they don't. The low-cost funds track the
overall market much more closely.


We characterize target date funds as dynamic balanced funds. Figure 12 looks at how
traditional balanced funds did in the stress test period, February 19, 2020 to March 23, 2020.
The answers are not surprising. The balanced funds with 30 to 50 percent exposure to equities
did approximately as well as the 2020 target date funds, whereas the balanced funds with 85+
percent equity exposure performed similarly to the 2045. 2050, 2055 and 2060+ target date
funds. In terms of expense category, the balanced funds display exactly the same pattern as
TDFs. In particular, the range of returns was much wider for the higher cost actively managed
balanced funds than for the lower cost passive ones. We do note that while the 85+ percent
equity balanced funds and the long duration TDFs performed similarly, the 85%+ balanced
funds failed to attract assets in the marketplace.




                                                                                                  20

7. The Style Analysis Constant

The style analysis approach, as described above, serves a role beyond simply determining asset
class exposures; it also creates a benchmark for each fund, against which we may measure a
fund's performance. The regression constant  is equal to the difference  - 13
                                                                           =1   -  ,

so in words, the estimate of  is the average deviation in returns of the fund and the returns of
the portfolio of best fitting ETFs, since the errors average to 0. A positive constant indicates that
the fund outperformed the best fitting set of reference ETFs, whereas a negative constant
indicates underperformance relative to reference funds with the same asset allocation. This
estimate, which we will call , thus measures the fund's performance relative to its asset
allocation. The constant is closely related to the classic portfolio analysis measure also known
as alpha, which is the difference between an asset's expected return and the expected return of
a diversified portfolio of the same beta. Indeed, we expect that the portfolio of best fit from
style analysis has a beta and expected return that lies on or very close to the capital market


                                                                                                   21
line, and we expect the actual fund and the benchmark portfolio to have the same beta, since
the style analysis minimizes the variance between the fitted portfolio returns and the actual
fund returns. To be clear, the returns used as an input to the style analysis regression are net of
expenses; that is, the fund's net expense ratio is subtracted from the gross returns, for both the
fund returns on the left hand side, as well as the ETF returns on the right hand side. This means
that  is more relevant from an investor's perspective: it measures the net return performance
of a fund relative to its benchmark portfolio, and for tax-advantaged accounts, this is essentially
the take-home return.


In Figure 13, we plot the estimated constant  for each target-date fund against the expense
ratio of the fund given at the beginning of the period. Since percentage returns were used in
the style analysis estimations, the constant is in monthly percentage amounts, so, for instance,
a fund with  = -0.05 means that, on average for the 5-year period, the net return on the
fund is 5 basis points per month lower than the return of the fitted portfolio. The corresponding
annualized  would be equal to 100[(1 - 0.0005)12 - 1], which is approximately 60 basis
points (slightly less), or 12 times the monthly value. We also plot (in red) the least squares fit
from regressing the constant on an intercept and expense ratio, which is the equation
 = 0.012 - 0.079  .


We categorized funds with annual expense ratios greater than 30 basis points as "high-cost"
and those less than that as "low-cost." The average constant for a low-cost fund is -0.7 basis
points, while the average constant for a high-cost fund is -3.9 basis points. Since the low-cost
funds are generally passively managed index-type funds, we find that it isn't surprising for the
estimated constant for these funds to be tightly grouped around zero. From the figure, we
observe that the large majority of low-cost funds, especially those that charge less than 20 basis
points annually, have constants that are within 2 basis points of zero on a monthly basis. On the
other hand, we observe a distribution of constants for the high-cost funds that is highly
dispersed. Of the high-cost funds, 25% have constants greater than 0, and have a range of -16.7
basis points to +4.7 basis points. All of the TDFs with a constant of negative 10 basis points per


                                                                                                     22
month or lower have an expense ratio of 60 basis points per year or higher. There are 35 of
them. Almost all of the funds with a constant of more than positive 2 basis points have expense
ratios of 30 basis points or higher. We argue that this indicates that the high-cost funds are
taking bets on specific securities within the various asset classes. Some sets of bets paid off and
some didn't. Since the fitted portfolio represents returns just from taking positions in various
asset classes, the constant accounts for how much of the return is due to the fund's individual
selections within asset classes, e.g., picking individual stocks or bonds.




Figure 13: The relationship between net expense ratio of target-date funds and the fitted style
analysis constant . The constant scale is in percentage points per month, while the expense
ratio scale is in percentage points per year.


A quarter of the high-cost funds are successful in at least meeting the market return, while the
other three quarters fall short. Furthermore, the funds that appear to even have a chance of

                                                                                                   23
having a positive constant charge less than 80 basis points, with the most successful funds
charging around 60 basis points. We think that the negative relationship between constants
and expense ratios can be explained by the idea that the various positions taken by actively
managed funds will likely aggregate out to be a diversified portfolio, which will on average
deliver the market return, scaled by the amount of systematic risk taken on, but with the
additional disadvantage of removing high expenses from the fund's return. From the fitted
slope of -7.9 basis points in the monthly constant per 1 percentage increase in expenses, this
translates to approximately -95 basis points per year. This means that the constant decreases
approximately 1 for 1 with an increase in net expense ratio. A 95% confidence interval for the
yearly value of -95 basis points contains -1, so we cannot rule out the hypothesis that, on
average, once we control for asset allocation, high-cost funds produce gross returns equal to
their low-cost counterparts, but net returns that differ by the difference in net expense ratios.


We also run the analogous exercise for the set of balanced funds, and the results are displayed
in Figure 14. Balanced funds have a wider range of constants in general than the target-date
funds. This is likely due to the class of balanced funds capturing a wider range of funds with
different objectives, including varying active strategies, while the target-date funds have a
narrower set of objectives. The low-cost funds exhibit a greater clustering around zero than
high-cost funds, following the same pattern as the target-date fund data. The regression of the
constant on an intercept and expense ratio for the balanced fund data results in  =
0.024 - 0.105  . Comparing this to the TDF result, the balanced funds have a
greater constant by 1.2 basis points, while the slope coefficient is less by 2.5 basis points.
However, the error bounds on these estimates do not rule out that the balanced funds and
target-date funds have the same intercept and coefficient, as confirmed by a Chow test.




                                                                                                 24

8. Return vs. Risk and Longer-Term Performance


In this section, we analyze the performance of target-date funds over the 5-year period
beginning in January 2015 going through December 2019. We first look at the return vs. risk
tradeoff on a monthly basis through the empirical Sharpe ratio. The empirical Sharpe ratio is
constructed by first computing excess monthly returns for all funds, which is the monthly return
minus the risk-free return. We used the monthly return on the 3-month Treasury bill as a
measure of the risk-free return. We then calculated the empirical Sharpe ratio as the ratio of
the mean excess return to the standard deviation of the excess return on a monthly basis over
the 5-year period. The results are plotted in Figure 15 against the net expense ratio. The red

                                                                                                 25
line is a regression fit, and shows a significant downward trend. For reference, we have
included the Sharpe ratios calculated for three ETFs that are market benchmarks: the S&P500
(VOO ticker) in light blue, the total bond market (BND ticker) in green, and the total stock
market (VTI ticker) in purple.




Figure 15: The relationship between the net expense ratio and the Sharpe ratio for target-date
funds.


Since target-date funds are mostly a combination of stocks and bonds in terms of the style
analysis of previous sections, we expect that the Sharpe ratios for most target-date funds will
be somewhere between the total bond and total stock Sharpe ratio values. This is validated in
Figure 15, as 82% of the target-date funds in the dataset3 fall between the green and purple
lines. The plot demonstrates once again that it is difficult for expensive funds to overcome their
fee disadvantage. As the Sharpe ratio is a measure of excess return per unit of standard
deviation, the high-expense funds with the same level of risk as low-expense funds must
provide returns that exceed the market return by at least the expense ratio, and it appears that


3
 Funds that did not exist over the entire period Jan 2015 to Dec 2019 were excluded from the Sharpe ratio
analysis, just as in the case of the style analysis.

                                                                                                            26
they are unable to do so on average. The slope of the regression line is -0.045 (significant at the
99% level). The interpretation of this is that an increase in net expense ratio by 1%, measured
on an annual basis, or about 8 basis points per month, results in an expected loss of Sharpe
ratio of 0.045, which is a loss of 4.5 basis points in excess return per 1% of standard deviation.
The average standard deviation of monthly return is approximately  = 2.35%. We can
calculate the average difference in excess return between two funds that have the average
standard deviation but expense ratios that differ by 100 basis points as
    1
       -   =  -  = 0.045
    
                           -  = 0.00105.
So the difference in excess returns is expected to be about 10.5 basis points, which is not
statistically distinguishable from 8 basis points, which is the decrease in expected return due to
the expense ratio. This is a result similar to the test from the style analysis; we cannot conclude
that the excess gross returns (before fees) of high- and low-cost funds differ systematically.

Figure 16 is another visualization of the glide path present in the target-date fund vintages. The
bars roughly follow the same pattern of equity portions in Figure 9. This is perhaps a more
direct verification of the goal of target-date funds: that they decrease the riskiness in returns as
one approaches retirement. Notably, the standard deviation of funds with vintages 2040-2060+
are not all that different; most of the slope of the glide path occurs when one gets within 15
years of retirement.


We now examine the determinants of future performance for target-date funds. In essence, we
are asking the question, "given what I can observe about a target-date fund today, which fund
has the best 5-year expected future returns?" In particular, we have data on past returns,
expense ratios, assets under management, vintage of fund, and factors obtained from style
analysis. We are particularly interested in whether or not past returns have predictive power
for future returns, and whether or not the negative effect of expense ratios persists when we
control for all of these dimensions. We calculated 5-year annualized returns between January
2010 and December 2014 as the past return (10), and 5-year annualized returns between
January 2015 and December 2019 as the future return we are trying to predict (15). The data
used for this analysis thus only includes funds that existed over the entire 10-year period 2010-
2019.

Table 3: Regression of annualized Jan 2015-Dec 2019 return on predictors with robust standard
errors.

We specify the regression
               15 =  + 10 +  +  ( ) +  +  + 
Where  is a vector of factors determined from the style analysis fit over 2010-2014 and  is a
vector of dummies indicating the vintage of the fund. All of the explanatory variables are
information available to an investor at the beginning of 2015, so the expense ratios and AUM
given are as of the beginning of 2015. We ran the regression with weights determined by the
AUM, and computed heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. The results are presented in
Table 3. We find that the previous 5-year return has a statistically significant coefficient of
0.0897. This can be interpreted as the increase in expected return from having a 1% higher past
return, so a 1% higher return per year over 2010-2014 translates to an increase in expected
return of about 9 basis points (annualized). This indicates large regression to the mean for past
good performers, though there is still a small effect. The expense ratio coefficient is -1.0478,
which a z-test confirms is indistinguishable from -1. This is one more test that gross returns
(before expenses) from high- and low-cost funds are on average the same, though as in the


                                                                                                   29
Sharpe ratio analysis, the estimate assigns a higher expected gross return to low-cost funds.
The log AUM also has a small but statistically significant positive effect on expected returns, a
possible indicator that larger funds may have slightly better information or more talented
management. The factor coefficients have the signs one would expect, negative for bonds and
alternatives, and positive for equities, though they are not statistically significant. They are
interpreted as the increase in expected return from a 1% increase in portfolio weights to the
factor. Finally, the target date dummies are almost all insignificant, since once we control for
fund factors, it is reasonable that all target-date funds are similar.


We do one more exercise to demonstrate the differences between high- and low-cost funds.
Given that past returns are small but positive predictors of future returns, how much better
would a high-cost fund have to have performed in the past to justify its investment over a low-
cost fund? The AUM-weighted average expense ratio is 13.3 basis points for the low-cost funds,
and 63.7 basis points for the high-cost funds. Keeping all else equal, for a low-cost fund with
13.3 basis point expense ratio and a high-cost fund with 63.7 basis point expense ratio to have
the same predicted 5-year return, the required difference in the previous 5-year return
                              1.0478 (0.637-0.133)
is 10 - 10 =                        0.0897
                                                     = 5.89%. For a 50-basis point gap in expense

ratios, then, the expensive fund needs to perform almost 6% higher annually for the past 5
years to close the gap.



9. One Size Fits All or One Size Fits Almost Nobody

The asset allocation of target date funds in defined contribution plans takes one factor into
account: the employee's age. While age is an important determinant of risk aversion, it is not
the only one by any means. At any given age, people would exhibit a wide range of risk
tolerance. Some of this is simply because people are different in terms of their preferences and
some of it is that people face different situations. Their circumstances would differ in
important ways such as marital status, whether they have children, spouses' employment,
whether they anticipate supporting their parents in old age or receiving an inheritance from

                                                                                                    30
them, their financial assets outside of employer-sponsored retirement accounts, the risk
characteristics of their profession (their human capital), their education, their homeownership
status, and their financial liabilities such as student loans. None of these factors are taken into
account in plans which default workers into target date funds based solely on age.


The recent paper by Mitchell and Utkus (2020) finds that participants in plans where low-cost
TDFs are introduced as the default option improve their asset allocation in a number of
important ways. They increase their allocation to equities and bonds and decrease the
allocation to company stock and cash, for instance. While their evidence indicates improved
investment exposures, it does not make the case that target date funds are the optimal default
investment for retirement saving.


The case for the kind of glide path offered by TDFs is best made by Bodie, Merton and
Samuelson (1992). They argue that a proper life cycle model would account for human capital
as well as financial capital. Human capital, the present value of future anticipated labor market
earnings, naturally declines as one's career progresses and as retirement approaches. When
young, human capital is likely the predominant form of wealth. If one's human capital is low
risk or has riskiness similar to high-grade bonds, then it may make sense to have a very large
fraction of financial wealth in risky categories such as equity. As human capital becomes less
important with age, it would then make sense to increase bond exposure in financial assets
such as 401(k) accounts. While this logic may support an asset allocation glide path, it certainly
does not support the one size fits all nature of target date funds. Some forms of human capital
may have equity-like risks (for instance, real estate agents or tech workers, whose
compensation features bonuses and equity grants) whereas other careers may generate low
risk human capital (e.g. tenured public school teachers). Bodie, Merton and Samuelson's work
suggests that the risk characteristics of one's human capital are an important determinant of
optimal asset allocation in financial investments.

Table 4: Regression of Annualized 2015-2019 return on pooled target-date fund and balanced
fund data controlling for fixed effects of target-date funds (with robust standard errors).


There is an alternative to target date funds as the default option in defined contribution
retirement plans. That is to use their close relative, traditional balanced funds, which are also
known as target risk funds. It is then worth asking if balanced funds and target-date funds with
similar investment profiles differ systematically in terms of returns. Table 4 reports the results
of a regression specification similar to that of Table 3 where both target-date and balanced
fund data are pooled and an indicator is included for target-date funds. The coefficient on this
indicator is positive but small and statistically insignificant, which serves as a test of systematic
differences between target-date funds and balanced funds with similar investment profiles, and
we conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to say they are different.

                                                                                                       32
An alternative to a target date fund as the default option in an automatic enrollment
retirement plan could be the moderate risk balanced fund with equity exposures ranging from
50 to 70 percent. But, all five target risk categories (very conservative, conservative, moderate,
aggressive and very aggressive) would be available in the defined contribution plan. Employees
could be strongly encouraged to take a risk tolerance questionnaire every five years to
determine which of the target risk funds best matches their circumstances. By using two of the
target risk offerings, employees could precisely choose their desired level of equity exposure. If
this became the norm, it is almost certain that advice services, both online and in person, would
become available. The advantage of this approach is that individual employees could take into
account their personal circumstances in choosing their retirement portfolio and the glide path
of their asset allocation over their working life. Potentially, this would replace a one size fits all
default offering with a custom-fit portfolio. We are not advocating this switch in default
options, simply suggesting that it might be worth further research and consideration.


10. Conclusion


While finance economists may have found little surprising in our in-depth analysis of target
date funds, we think some participants and 401(k) and 403(b) committee members at
employers may find some of the findings useful. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that even the
near term target date funds still have considerable stock market exposure. For instance, we
find that 2025 target date funds lost between 20 and 25 percent of their value in five weeks in
February and March, 2020. Our guess is that these losses were larger than anticipated by

We find that the average higher-cost actively managed target date funds failed to perform as
well as the cheaper indexed competition in the 2015-2019 period. Some of the actively funds
did very well in relative terms, but most did not. We found that past performance is only
weakly predictive of future performance. The implication is that even an active fund with a


                                                                                                    33
superior record has an expected future return below the passive alternative TDFs. These results
may be specific to the 2010-2020 period examined, but only time will tell. We know that this
was a period where active funds, in general, had difficulty matching passive funds. It is also
possible that some actively managed TDFs can systematically outperform the market and the
competition. The data indicate that such performance would be an outlier.


The last section of the paper discussed the one size fits all nature of target date funds and
suggests that a traditional family of balanced funds (AKA target risk funds) offer an alternate
default approach. One thing should be emphasized - even though there are a lot of flavors of
target date funds, an employee participating in a defined contribution plan typically only is
offered one such family of funds. The 2025 vintage might feature a particular level of equity
exposure between 50 and 65 percent. It is not hard to imagine circumstances for an employee
where the optimal equity exposure at age 60 would be 20 percent (or 80 percent). This
illustrates the drawback of a one size fits all offering such as a target date fund.


Target date funds have clearly passed the market test in that they have attracted enormous
investments over the past twenty years. Their size alone merits monitoring their performance.
Markets provided a natural stress test in February and March of 2020. Even the short duration
TDFs suffered large valuation losses over a five week period. Fortunately, markets completely
recovered in the subsequent three months, so few participants suffered substantial losses. But,
the episode did reveal that TDFs expose even those near retirement to substantial market risks.
