Do Firms Issue more equity when markets are more liquid?

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper investigates how public equity issuance is related to stock market liquidity. Using quarterly
data on IPOs and SEOs in 36 countries over the period 1995-2008, we show that equity issuance is
significantly and positively related to contemporaneous and lagged innovations in aggregate local
market liquidity. This relation survives the inclusion of proxies for market timing, capital market conditions,
growth prospects, asymmetric information, and investor sentiment. Liquidity considerations are as
important in explaining equity issuance as market timing considerations. The relation between liquidity
and issuance is driven by the quarters with the greatest deterioration in liquidity and is stronger for
IPOs than for SEOs. Firms are more likely to carry out private instead of public equity issues and to
postpone public equity issues when market liquidity worsens. Overall, we interpret our findings as
supportive of the view that market liquidity is an important determinant of equity issuance that is distinct
from other determinants examined to date.

1. Introduction

    If the demand for a firm’s shares is perfectly elastic, an increase in the supply of that firm’s

shares resulting from an equity issue has no effect on the share price keeping everything else the

same. The existing empirical literature presents considerable challenges to the view that the

demand for shares is perfectly elastic. First, many studies build on the finding in Shleifer (1986)

that a firm’s stock price increases when it experiences an increase in demand because of being

added to a stock index such as the S&P 500. Second, studies that have access to data that make it

possible to directly measure the demand for shares find that it is downward-sloping (e.g.,

Bagwell, 1992). Third, there is a vast literature showing that in many countries stock prices fall

when an equity issue is announced, a result that is consistent with the existence of downward-

sloping demand curves as well as other explanations (see Eckbo, Masulis, and Norli (2007) for a

review of the literature). Fourth, more generally, the theoretical and empirical market liquidity

literature suggests that buy and sell orders (which tend to involve far fewer shares than equity

issues) can move share prices (e.g., Kyle, 1985; Easley and O’Hara, 1987; Glosten and Harris,

1988; Breen, Hodrick, and Korajczyk, 2002). Fifth, a more recent literature shows that market

liquidity affects the expected cost of underwriters in placing an issue, their fees, and the price at

which shares are sold (e.g., Butler, Grullon, and Weston, 2005; Ellul and Pagano, 2006; Gao and

Ritter, 2010).

    Imperfect liquidity is a common thread to these findings from the literature. As a firm’s

shares trade in a less liquid market, investors have to be given more of a discount to absorb these

shares. We would therefore expect that equity issuance is more costly for existing shareholders

when a firm’s stock is less liquid. As issuance becomes more costly, firms are expected to issue

less equity, everything else equal. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that security

issuance is inversely related to illiquidity. We find very strong evidence across the world that

firms become less likely to issue equity when the liquidity of equity markets worsens.



                                                 2
    The liquidity of a firm’s common stock can worsen because aggregate liquidity worsens or

because of idiosyncratic shocks. Idiosyncratic liquidity shocks could be caused by shocks to firm

attributes related to firm value, so that it would be difficult to identify the impact of liquidity as

opposed to the impact of shocks to factors that affect liquidity but other firm characteristics as

well. For instance, adverse information about a firm could lower the stock price and increase

information asymmetry which would then lower liquidity as well. Since one would expect an

increase in information asymmetry to make it more expensive for a firm to issue equity,

identification of the liquidity effect when liquidity changes because of information asymmetry

would be challenging. In this paper, we resolve this identification issue by focusing on equity

issuance at the country level and by examining the relation between aggregate equity issuance

and aggregate liquidity. Aggregate liquidity could affect a firm’s decision to issue equity because

there are strong common factors in liquidity (e.g., Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam, 2000) and

because aggregate liquidity could proxy for the general capacity of the market to absorb new

shares.

    We create a sample of equity issues that covers 36 countries from 1995 to 2008. Like earlier

papers that investigate equity issuance globally, such as Henderson, Jegadeesh, and Weisbach

(2006) and Kim and Weisbach (2008), we obtain the equity issues from SDC and include both

initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Our dataset has 1,872

country-quarters. We use two measures of equity issuance. The first measure consists of counts

normalized by listings. The second one uses proceeds normalized by market capitalization. Most

of our work focuses on the counts measure as the proceeds measure can be affected by a single

large issue in many countries. We use the Amihud (2002) liquidity measure estimated across

countries by Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012). Since the country-level Amihud measures are

non-stationary and since their levels are not comparable across countries due to differences in

trading volume definitions and currency units, we first construct time-series of market liquidity

innovations as the residuals from country-by-country AR(1) regressions, and subsequently

                                                  3
standardize these series to make them comparable across countries. We would expect differences

in levels of liquidity across countries to affect equity issuance. Further, as noted by recent studies

(e.g., Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2012; Kim and Weisbach, 2008; McLean, Zhang, and Zhao,

2011), countries differ along many dimensions that affect equity issuance. We therefore estimate

our regressions with country fixed effects and year fixed effects. All of our regressions use

quarterly data.

    When we regress our equity issuance counts measure on lead liquidity innovations,

contemporaneous liquidity innovations and four lags of liquidity innovations controlling for

market returns, we find that while the coefficient on lead liquidity innovations is not significant,

the contemporaneous as well as three of the four lagged liquidity innovation variables have a

positive and significant coefficient.

    The unconditional mean of the quarterly counts variable is 2.52%. We find that a one

standard deviation shock to liquidity is associated with a contemporaneous increase in equity

issuance of 28 basis points, representing an increase of 11%. The coefficient on liquidity

innovations in three of the four prior quarters is at least half the magnitude of the coefficient on

contemporaneous liquidity innovations. The cumulative increase in equity issuance over the next

five quarters associated with a one standard deviation improvement in liquidity is 101 basis points

(or roughly 40% of the unconditional mean of the quarterly counts variable). Treating liquidity

innovations as an explanatory variable for equity issuance, we find that liquidity innovations

explain as much of the variation in equity issuance as stock returns. Stock returns are often used

as a proxy for market timing.

    After having established that equity issuance is positively related to liquidity innovations, we

examine whether this relation could be explained by variables known to be correlated with

aggregate liquidity that might affect equity issuance on their own. For example, U.S. studies

predicting aggregate seasoned equity issuance (e.g., Choe, Masulis, and Nanda, 1993) and the

aggregate rate at which firms go public (e.g., Lowry, 2003) show that equity issuance is affected

                                                  4
by the state of capital markets and aggregate economic activity, which are variables known to be

related to liquidity as well.

    Our first battery of tests therefore controls for proxies for general capital market conditions,

such as market volatility, turnover, and liquidity risk. It is already known from the literature that

aggregate equity issuance is lower when market volatility is higher (e.g., Schill, 2004). While we

find a negative coefficient on lagged market volatility in our regressions, its inclusion does not

affect the coefficients on the liquidity variables. We find no evidence that variation in market

turnover is related to equity issuance, and again the coefficients on the liquidity variables remain

significant when we include this variable. We do find that one-quarter lagged conditional

volatility in liquidity (a measure of liquidity risk) is strongly negatively related to equity issuance,

and reduces the explanatory power of lagged liquidity innovations, which suggests that firms not

only care about the level of liquidity, but also about the risk that it deteriorates.

    Next, we control for a number of valuation proxies. Market-to-book is used in studies of

market timing (e.g., Loughran and Ritter, 1995, 1997; Baker and Wurgler, 2002; DeAngelo,

DeAngelo, and Stulz, 2010). There is also evidence that more liquid firms in the U.S. have a

higher market-to-book ratio (Fang, Noe, and Tice, 2009), so that liquidity could proxy for market-

to-book in our regressions. After controlling for liquidity and market returns, we find no

significant effect of the aggregate market-to-book ratio on equity issuance, while the relation

between liquidity and equity issuance is unchanged. We do find a strong positive

contemporaneous relation between the aggregate price-earnings ratio and equity issuance, but this

does not materially change the relation between liquidity and equity issuance.

    Recent literature shows that liquidity is a predictor of economic activity (e.g., Næs, Skjeltorp,

and Ødegaard, 2010). Since at least Miller (1963), it is known that poor economic activity is

associated with lower equity issuance and, not surprisingly, this finding holds in our sample. We

find that when we control for proxies for future levels of economic activity, the coefficients on

the liquidity measures remain significant.

                                                    5
    Baker and Stein (2004) argue that liquidity is higher when more irrational investors are in the

market and that the presence of these investors (in combination with short sales constraints) is

associated with overvaluation. Their prediction is that firms issue more equity as liquidity

improves. When we control for various measures of sentiment, we find that these measures are

not related to equity issuance in our sample and the coefficients on the liquidity variables are

unaffected. Also, we examine whether positive and negative liquidity shocks have a similar

relation with equity issuance. We find that negative shocks have a much stronger relation with

equity issuance and that there is little evidence that positive shocks have any relation with equity

issuance. This finding is not supportive of Baker and Stein (2004) and other models whose key

prediction is that an increase in liquidity leads to greater equity issuance.

    We then turn to tests that focus more directly on the nature of the mechanism that explains

this relation between liquidity and equity issuance. We would expect that many factors that affect

equity issuance would be the same for public and private equity issues. However, private equity

issues do not increase the supply of traded shares as typically the investors in a private equity

issue face restrictions on selling the shares. We would therefore expect firms to have a private

equity issue rather than a public equity issue when liquidity deteriorates. We investigate this

hypothesis and find support for it. Next, we would expect adverse liquidity shocks to be

accompanied by postponements and cancellations of equity issues. We find that postponements

are more likely following adverse liquidity shocks, although cancellations are not. When we

examine whether the relation between liquidity and IPOs is similar to the relation between

liquidity and SEOs, we find that it is stronger for IPOs. Through most of the paper, we measure

equity issuance by dividing counts of equity issues by the number of listed firms. We would

expect the results to be weaker when we use proceeds instead of counts because the proceeds

measure is extremely skewed and can be heavily influenced by one single extremely large issue.

When we investigate whether there is a relation between liquidity innovations and aggregate

equity issuance proceeds, we find that such a relation exists, but only for IPOs.

                                                   6
    Our paper contributes to several literatures. Our primary contribution is to the equity issuance

literature. We find that liquidity is an important determinant of equity issuance across the world.

While the recent literature on equity issuance has focused on market timing motivations for

equity issuance, we show that liquidity’s importance is of the same magnitude as the market

timing motivation. A growing recent literature emphasizes the interaction between market

liquidity and funding liquidity, following the work of Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009). The

empirical literature on this interaction has focused on financial institutions. The results in this

paper suggest that market liquidity affects funding liquidity more generally. Several papers

investigate how stock liquidity affects some aspects of the equity issuance process. In particular,

Butler, Grullon, and Weston (2005) show that underwriters charge more when liquidity is lower

and Gao and Ritter (2010) demonstrate that underwriters affect the slope of the demand function

for shares through their marketing activities. Our paper adds to that literature by showing that

aggregate liquidity has a powerful relation with security issuance. Finally, there is a large

literature on the role of liquidity in the pricing of financial assets. In this paper, we provide

evidence consistent with the view that the role of liquidity extends beyond financial markets and

that it has a pervasive impact on corporate financial policies. While Fang, Noe, and Tice (2009)

and Lipson and Mortal (2009) show that stock liquidity is related to a firm’s capital structure,

such a finding does not necessarily mean that firms are more likely to issue equity in more liquid

markets. Our contribution therefore helps understand one mechanism whereby more liquid firms

have less leverage, namely that higher liquidity makes it less costly to issue equity.

    The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our sample. In Section 3, we show

that equity issuance is related to liquidity. In Section 4, we check whether equity issuance is

related to liquidity because liquidity proxies for other variables that are known to affect equity

issuance. In Section 5, we investigate in more detail the mechanisms linking equity issuance to

liquidity. We conclude in Section 6.

2. Data

    We collect data on the number of issues and the amount of proceeds (in US$) raised from

both IPOs and SEOs (both public and private) in 36 countries from January 1995 to December

2008 from the Securities Data Company (SDC) database. Our sample consists only of common

stock offerings (ordinary common shares). In discussions with SDC representatives it was

brought to our attention that there is a limited number of outdated security classifications that

refer to common shares and were applied in the early part of our sample for certain countries. For
                                                                                                          1
these cases, we extend our sample of equity offerings to include the earlier definitions as well.

We include only primary offerings, since pure secondary issues by current shareholders do not

increase the supply of a firm’s shares, and therefore fall outside the scope of the present study.

We exclude issues by utility companies, which are heavily regulated (2-digit SIC code 49), as

well as issues by financial firms (2-digit SIC code 60). We also exclude foreign issues and issues

of depository receipts (DRs). In addition, we discard issues that although announced, were

eventually withdrawn (cancelled or postponed) from our main sample – but we use them in a

separate analysis. For the U.S., we only include offerings from companies traded on the NYSE

because our liquidity measure is not comparable across exchanges.2 SEOs consist of public

follow-on offerings, as well as private placements and rights offerings. The sample includes both

underwritten issues and rights issues. In almost every market, the overwhelming majority of

equity offerings are underwritten (the exceptions are Australia and Japan).

    We aggregate equity issues at a quarterly frequency on the basis of their issue date. We

deflate the quarterly number (US$ proceeds) of issues by the total number (market capitalization

in US$) of all publicly listed companies in the country as of the end of the previous year. The

resulting issuance measures reflect the relative increase in the supply of equity given the size of

each market. We use the World Development Indicators database to obtain information on the

number of listed companies and the aggregate market capitalization of each market.

       As a measure of time-variation in liquidity, we use the market-wide Amihud (2002) proxy

constructed by Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012) that is available for the 36 countries in our

sample.3 The Amihud proxy is designed to capture the marginal impact of a unit of trading

volume on the stock price. It is computed as the daily ratio of the absolute stock return over the

local currency trading volume of the stock. This measure stays close to the intuitive description of

liquid markets as those that accommodate trading with the least effect on price. Amihud (2002)

shows that this measure is strongly positively related to microstructure estimates of illiquidity for

the U.S. stock market. Hasbrouck (2006) and Goyenko, Holden, and Trzcinka (2009) show that

the Amihud measure performs well relative to other proxies in capturing high-frequency

measures of transaction costs based on U.S. data. Lesmond (2005) reports a high correlation

between the Amihud measure and bid-ask spreads in 23 emerging markets. Many recent

empirical studies use the Amihud proxy to measure stock market liquidity, both for the U.S. and

for other countries. Examples include Acharya and Pedersen (2005), Spiegel and Wang (2005),

Avramov, Chordia, and Goyal (2006), Kamara, Lou, and Sadka (2008), Watanabe and Watanabe

(2008), and Beber and Pagano (2013). Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012) take a log

transformation of the Amihud measure and multiply it by -10,000 to obtain a measure that is

increasing in liquidity. To mitigate the effect of outliers, we winsorize their monthly liquidity

time-series at the 1st and 99th percentiles by country. We then transform the monthly market

liquidity time-series to a quarterly frequency by computing the average within each quarter. We

apply the same procedure to their monthly turnover time-series.

       Because market liquidity is characterized by persistent long-term trends (e.g., Chordia, Roll,

and Subrahmanyam, 2008; Næs, Skjeltorp, and Ødegaard, 2011), we test for stationarity using the

panel unit root test of Levin, Lin, and Chu (2002) and find evidence of non-stationarity.

    The data on liquidity are available at http://mathijsavandijk.com.

Therefore, all our regressions include a measure of liquidity innovations (rather than liquidity

levels), taken as the residuals from country-by-country AR(1) regressions of the level of market

liquidity.

    We obtain the daily (value-weighted) total market return index for each country in our sample

from Datastream. We then compute the average of the daily market returns within each quarter to

obtain the corresponding quarterly time-series. We construct a quarterly time-series of market

volatility for each country as the standard deviation of the daily market returns within the quarter

and a quarterly time-series of liquidity risk as the conditional volatility of the raw quarterly

liquidity series based on a GARCH(1,1) model.

    We also construct quarterly time-series of idiosyncratic volatility and of “stock price

synchronicity” (Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000) based on the value-weighted average standard

deviation of the residuals and the value-weighted average R2, respectively, from a simple market

model run for individual stocks based on daily data within the quarter. For this purpose, we use

Datastream to collect the daily total return index (RI) and monthly market capitalization (MV;

expressed in millions of local currency) for all individual stocks traded in the 36 countries in our

sample. To be consistent with Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012), we limit our sample to only

stocks from major exchanges.

    Data on quarterly aggregate market-to-book ratios, price-earnings ratios, and dividend yields

are also obtained from Datastream. As proxies for macroeconomic conditions we use quarterly

GDP growth and sales growth rates from OECD and Datastream (following, e.g., Lowry, 2003;

Næs, Skjeltorp, and Ødegaard, 2011). For the same purpose, we use the amplitude-adjusted

composite leading economic indicator from the OECD, which is a compilation of several key

economic indicators that provide signals on future turning points of economic activity.

    To account for investor sentiment we use three different proxies: the U.S. investor sentiment

index of Baker and Wurgler (2006), which is increasing with investors’ optimism; the local

closed-end country fund discount (Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler, 1991), which is available for 22

                                                10
countries in our sample; and a global sentiment indicator computed as the equally-weighted

average of the discounts of local closed-end fund discounts as in Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk

(2012). For the latter two variables, lower numbers indicate more optimistic investors.4

       A detailed description of all variables and data sources is included in the Appendix.

       Table 1 presents summary statistics for the number of equity issues, equity issuance proceeds,

and market returns, liquidity, and volatility for each of the 36 countries in our sample. The table

distinguishes developed and emerging countries based on the classification by the International

Finance Corporation (IFC). The total number of equity issues (IPOs plus SEOs) in the sample is

47,399 (of which 36,400 took place in developed countries and 10,999 in emerging countries).

The number of equity issues in Australia (12,013) is striking and may be due to the mining boom.

We have carefully inspected the SDC data for Australia and found no reasons to assume that the

number of equity issues is incorrect. Nonetheless, we have rerun all our analyses without

Australia to make sure the results are not driven by this particular country.

       The second and third columns of Table 1 show the time-series mean and standard deviation

of the quarterly number of equity issues scaled by the number of listed stocks by country. This is

the main dependent variable in our analyses. On average, the countries in our sample experience a

number of equity issues per quarter that corresponds to 2.52% of the number of listed stocks on

the local equity market. There is considerable variation in the average equity issuance counts

variable across countries. The mean ratio of equity issues to listed stocks varies from 0.26% for

South Africa to 15.31% for Australia. The ratio is larger in developed than in emerging countries

(3.24% vs. 1.62%), even when we exclude Australia (2.61% vs. 1.62%). The time-series standard

deviations in the third column of Table 1 suggest considerable time-variation in equity issuance.

Consistent with prior studies, we find that equity issues tend to be clustered in time. The slope

coefficient in a pooled AR(1) model of the quarterly equity issues counts variable across

countries is 0.81.

    Data for these variables are available at http://mathijsavandijk.com.

                                                        11
    The fourth and fifth columns of Table 1 show the time-series mean and standard deviation of

the quarterly proceeds of these equity issues (expressed in US$) scaled by the local stock market

capitalization (also in US$). We use this equity issuance proceeds variable as an alternative to the

counts variable in some of our tests. On average, firms in the countries in our sample raise public

equity capital per quarter corresponding to 0.22% of the local equity market capitalization. This

number is much smaller than the average counts variable of 2.52% and thus indicates that the size

of the average equity issue is much smaller than the average market cap of the firms listed on the

local stock market. Average equity proceeds are somewhat greater in emerging countries than in

developed countries, at 0.27% vs. 0.18%. China displays an outlier for this variable, with average

equity proceeds per quarter corresponding to 0.77% of the local market capitalization, or 3.5

times the average across all 36 countries. Again, we have found no reasons to question the SDC

data for China and suspect this number is driven by several large privatizations early on in the

sample when the Chinese stock market was still relatively undeveloped.

    It is important to note that a direct comparison of the level of the Amihud measure across

countries is not possible because of differences in currency units and trading volume definitions.

Therefore, we standardize the quarterly time-series of market liquidity innovations for each

country to have zero mean and unit standard deviation in our tests.



3. Does liquidity help explain time-variation in equity issuance?

    Table 2 shows the estimation results of pooled tobit models to explain quarterly variation in

the equity issuance counts variable (i.e., the number of IPOs + SEOs scaled by the number of

listed stocks) in the 36 countries in our sample over 1995-2008 (in unreported tests, we obtain

similar results when we exclude the years of the recent global financial crises 2007-2008). We

use tobit specifications since the dependent variable is truncated at zero; many of the countries in

our sample have zero equity issues in at least some quarters. Almost all models include country

fixed effects to account for time-invariant country characteristics that can explain cross-country

                                                12
variation in equity issuance intensity. To be conservative, we also include year fixed effects in

almost all models to account for any common global trends – although they subsume some of the

time-variation in equity issuance that could potentially be due to liquidity. These year fixed

effects may capture the impact of the increased financial globalization on equity issuance shown

to be important by Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2012). As prior studies (e.g., Lowry, 2003) argue

that there may be institutional reasons that cause equity issuance to be less intense in the first

calendar quarter, we also include a quarter one dummy in many of the tobit models. In the last

model of Table 2, we also include a lagged dependent variable. Standard errors are clustered at

the country-level. The last two rows of Table 2 report the results of F-tests on the joint

significance of all liquidity variables, and of only the lagged liquidity variables.

    Model (1) of Table 2 includes one-quarter lead local stock market liquidity innovations,

contemporaneous liquidity innovations, and four quarterly lags of liquidity innovations as

explanatory variables. The coefficients on the contemporaneous and the first three lags of

liquidity innovations are all positive and statistically significant, which is consistent with the

hypothesis that firms issue more equity in and following quarters of improving market liquidity.

The coefficient on lead liquidity innovations is close to zero and statistically insignificant. There

is thus little evidence of liquidity timing in the sense that firms are able to time their equity issues

before market liquidity worsens.

    The economic significance of the coefficients on contemporaneous and lagged liquidity

innovations is substantial. A one standard deviation increase in market liquidity is associated with

a contemporaneous increase in equity issues by 28 basis points (equal to the magnitude of the

coefficient, since the liquidity variables have been standardized to have zero mean and unit

standard deviation), which corresponds to 11% of the unconditional average ratio of equity issues

of 2.52% (from Table 1). The coefficients on the lagged liquidity variables tend to be slightly

smaller, but still sizable at more than half of the contemporaneous coefficient. The cumulative

change in equity issuance over the next five quarters associated with a one standard deviation

                                                  13
improvement in liquidity is 101 basis points (or around 40% of the average fraction of issues in

any given quarter across all countries in our sample).

    One could argue that the contemporaneous relation between liquidity and equity issuance

may be driven by reverse causality, since equity issues could affect local stock market liquidity.

However, there are at least three reasons why this is unlikely to be a concern in our analyses.

First, equity issues correspond to a tiny fraction of existing listings on each market (counts are on

average 2.52% of the number of listed stocks and proceeds are on average 0.22% of local market

capitalization) and we measure market liquidity based on the value-weighted average liquidity

across the existing stocks on a market. We thus expect the impact of equity issues on our liquidity

variables to be very small. Second, if anything, we would expect the effect of equity issues on

market liquidity to be negative, while we find a positive coefficient on contemporaneous liquidity

innovations in Table 2. IPOs tend to involve relatively small stocks that are less liquid than the

average existing stock, so a wave of IPOs could depress aggregate market liquidity. SEOs create

the equivalent of a large sell order imbalance on the market for existing stocks, which is likely to

temporarily depress liquidity. Third, in each of the models in Table 2 at least two of the

coefficients on the lagged liquidity variables are significant (in addition to the significant

coefficient on contemporaneous liquidity), which suggests that liquidity matters even when

disregarding the contemporaneous relation because of potential reverse causality concerns.

    In model (2) of Table 2, we use the same specification as in model (1) but then for lead,

contemporaneous, and lagged local market returns instead of market liquidity innovations (for the

same sample of country-quarters). These results serve two purposes. First, they confirm the

finding of prior work that equity issuance is positively and significantly related to

contemporaneous and lagged market returns, and negatively and significantly related to lead

market returns.5 Second, they provide a benchmark for the importance of the relation between


5
  Whether the latter finding can be attributed to market timing abilities by managers is subject to debate
(e.g., Butler, Grullon, and Weston, 2005).

                                                   14
liquidity and equity issuance in model (1). In our regressions, the relation between liquidity

innovations and equity issuance is as strong as the relation between market returns and equity

issuance. The cumulative change in equity issuance over the next five quarters associated with a

positive one standard deviation shock to market returns is 102 basis points (not taking into

account the coefficient on lead market returns), which is almost identical to the cumulative

change in equity issuance of 101 basis points for liquidity innovations discussed above.

    In model (3), we include liquidity innovations and returns at the same time. The effects on

equity issuance diminish somewhat relative to the first two models (for example, the coefficient

on one-quarter lagged liquidity innovations becomes insignificant), but both liquidity and returns

are still statistically and economically significant determinants of time-variation in equity

issuance and still have comparable cumulative effects. The coefficient on the quarter one dummy

is negative and significant, but its inclusion does not materially affect the coefficients on the

liquidity and return variables. In model (4), we drop the lead liquidity innovations as well as the

three- and four-quarter lags of market returns as they are not significant in model (3). Models (5)

and (6) demonstrate that the relations between liquidity and returns and equity issuance are

roughly equally strong when we drop either the year fixed effects or both the year and country

fixed effects. Model (7) includes a lagged dependent variable, which has a coefficient of 0.544

and is statistically significant. The effects of liquidity and returns survive. In most of the other

analyses we present below, we do not include a lagged dependent variable since our purpose is to

understand which economic forces drive time-variation in equity issuance rather than to develop

the best possible econometric model to explain the dynamics of equity issuance.

    In unreported robustness tests, we estimate the specifications in Table 2 using panel tobits

with random effects (instead of country fixed effects) and using regular panel models (instead of

tobits) and obtain similar results. We also estimate the specifications in Table 2 with liquidity

changes rather than liquidity innovations as independent variables. We still find a statistically and

economically significant effect of the market liquidity variables (the F-tests on the joint

                                                 15
significance of the coefficients on contemporaneous and lagged liquidity changes are significant

at the 5% level or better), though overall the results are slightly weaker. It thus seems that firms

respond particularly strongly to contemporaneous and lagged unexpected changes in liquidity (as

captured by the liquidity innovations variables).

    In sum, Table 2 presents evidence that equity issuance is positively related to innovations in

liquidity. The relation between liquidity and equity issuance survives controlling for market

returns and is roughly equally important as the relation between market returns and equity

issuance uncovered by earlier studies.



4. Is the relation between liquidity and equity issuance due to other factors?

    The results in the previous section show that equity issuance is positively related to liquidity,

even after controlling for market returns. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that

managers take the costs associated with downward-sloping demand curves into account in their

decision to issue equity. However, it could also be the case that our liquidity variables proxy for

other factors that affect equity issuance and are correlated with liquidity. In this section, we

investigate whether the effects of liquidity can be explained by other financial and economic

variables, including capital market conditions, (expected) economic activity, asymmetric

information, and investor sentiment.

    Table 3 reports the results of tobit regressions that include various other measures of capital

market conditions in addition to market liquidity innovations and market returns. All models

include country and year fixed effects as well as the quarter one dummy. Significance is again

based on standard errors clustered at the country-level.

    In model (1), we add contemporaneous and lagged market volatility to our baseline model

that includes market liquidity and returns. We know that liquidity is negatively related to

volatility (e.g., Chordia, Sarkar, and Subrahmanyam, 2005) and Schill (2004) shows there are

fewer equity issues in volatile times. It is thus possible that the effects of liquidity in Table 2

                                                 16
capture the role of market volatility. Consistent with Schill (2004), we find a negative and

significant coefficient on (one-quarter lagged) volatility. However, there is virtually no change in

the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficients on the liquidity variables.

    Baker and Stein (2004) argue that market liquidity is a sentiment indicator and that periods of

positive sentiment coincide with intense equity issuance. Using turnover as a liquidity proxy, they

show that liquidity is positively correlated with aggregate time-variation in U.S. equity issuance.6

Model (2) of Table 3 shows that the relation between liquidity and equity issuance in our global

sample is not driven by turnover. None of the coefficients on market turnover are significant and

the coefficients on the liquidity variables are unaffected. These coefficient estimates suggest that

our results are distinct from those of Baker and Stein (2004) and that there is no relation between

turnover and equity issuance in our global sample once returns and liquidity are controlled for.

    Model (3) shows that the contemporaneous relation between liquidity and equity issuance

survives controlling for a proxy for liquidity risk (conditional liquidity volatility based on a

GARCH(1,1) model). However, the significantly negative coefficient on one-quarter lagged

liquidity risk and the weakened effects of lagged liquidity innovations suggest that equity

issuance is in part related to liquidity because firms respond to uncertainty about liquidity in the

recent past. Uncertainty about liquidity can deter equity issues since it leads to uncertainty about

the discount that investors have to be given to absorb the additional supply of shares – and thus to

uncertainty about the equity issue proceeds.

    Although we control for potential market timing effects using lead, contemporaneous, and

lagged market returns, many studies use the market-to-book ratio as a proxy for market timing.


6
  Turnover can proxy for other stock characteristics besides liquidity. For instance, it can proxy for
diversity of opinion. More generally, turnover does not seem to be widely accepted as a good liquidity
proxy. A common counterexample is that turnover tends to be high during financial crises, while liquidity
tends to be low. Recent studies that evaluate liquidity proxies for U.S. and international equity markets
(Goyenko, Holden, and Trzcinka, 2009; Fong, Holden, and Trzcinka, 2011) do not even include turnover as
a proxy for liquidity. Lesmond (2005) studies the liquidity of emerging equity markets using different
proxies (including turnover) and concludes: “These results cast doubt on a wide range of studies employing
turnover as a principal liquidity proxy.” (p. 423). In our sample, market turnover is only weakly correlated
with the liquidity variables, at 0.12 with liquidity levels and 0.06 with liquidity innovations.

                                                    17
Since more liquid firms in the U.S. have a higher market-to-book ratio (Fang, Noe, and Tice,

2009), we want to make sure that liquidity is not picking up the effect of market-to-book. Model

(4) shows that issuance is not related to the aggregate market-to-book ratio after controlling for

liquidity and returns, and the effects of liquidity are not diminished. Model (5) shows a significant

effect of the contemporaneous price-earnings ratio on equity issuance, but again the effects of

liquidity are intact. The coefficients on the dividend-price ratio in model (6) are not significant.

Consequently, the relation between liquidity and equity issuance cannot be attributed to these

valuation proxies.

    The estimation results of model (7) indicate that even when controlling for all of these

variables as well as a lagged dependent variable, there is still a statistically and economically

significant relation between contemporaneous liquidity innovations and aggregate equity

issuance. The coefficients on the lagged liquidity innovations are no longer significant. We note

that this specification stacks the odds against finding a significant effect of liquidity, since the

year fixed effects, quarter one dummy, and lagged dependent variable absorb a significant

fraction of the quarterly variation in equity issuance that could potentially be due to variation in

liquidity. In addition to the significantly positive coefficient on contemporaneous liquidity

innovations, model (7) still shows a significantly negative coefficient on lagged liquidity risk. In

sum, the significant coefficients on liquidity and liquidity risk are not explained by a host of other

capital market conditions.

    Recent studies show that liquidity forecasts economic activity (e.g., Næs, Skjeltorp, and

Ødegaard, 2010) and we know from the equity issuance literature that firms issue more equity in

anticipation of better economic conditions. Following Lowry (2003), we proxy for expectations

about economic conditions using contemporaneous and lead GDP and sales growth in models (1)

through (3) of Table 4. Lowry introduces these variables as proxies for the demand for capital. In

model (3), we also include the composite leading economic indicator by the OECD. (We note that

data on the sales growth and leading economic indicator variables are available for relatively few

                                                 18
country-quarter observations.) In line with the results of earlier studies that document that firms

issue more equity in (anticipation of) good economic times, the coefficients on contemporaneous

GDP growth and sales growth are positive and significant – though only when these variables are

considered in isolation. Moreover, the coefficients on the liquidity variables are still significant.

    It is well-documented that the liquidity of a stock is inversely related to the degree of

asymmetric information about the stock’s value. More asymmetric information is also likely to

lead to greater costs of raising equity capital, so changes in information asymmetries could

influence liquidity and equity issuance simultaneously and in the same direction. As argued in the

introduction, this identification issue is unlikely to be of great concern in our analysis of the

relations between aggregate liquidity and aggregate equity issuance.7 Nonetheless, it may be the

case that market-wide fluctuations in information asymmetries affect aggregate liquidity and

aggregate issuance at the same time and in a similar way. In model (4) of Table 4, we include two

proxies for market-wide variation in information asymmetries. The first is idiosyncratic volatility,

computed as the value-weighted average of the residual volatility from market model regressions

run for each individual stock within a country. The second is “stock price synchronicity,” which

is computed as the value-weighted average R2 from market model regressions run for each

individual stock within a country. Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000) argue that greater stock price

synchronicity is associated with less-informative stock prices. Model (4) shows that the inclusion

of these variables does not materially affect the coefficients on the contemporaneous and lagged

liquidity innovations.

    Models (5) through (7) of Table 4 include various proxies for investor sentiment. In the

model of Baker and Stein (2004), irrational investors can drive up stock prices above their

fundamental value in the presence of short-sales constraints, and irrational investors also make

the market more liquid. If market liquidity and sentiment are related, the relation between


7
 Baker and Stein (2004, p. 272) state that it seems “a stretch to argue that there are large swings in the
degree of asymmetric information about the market as a whole.”

                                                   19
liquidity and equity issuance could thus be driven not by managerial concerns about downward-

sloping demand curves, but by their incentives to issue equity when their stock is overvalued.

Investor sentiment should be reflected in market returns and valuation ratios, so our evidence that

the effects of liquidity are robust to the inclusion of returns and valuation proxies (such as

market-to-book) is hard to reconcile with a sentiment-based explanation for our main results.

Moreover, we find no evidence that market turnover – the variable that Baker and Stein use to

proxy for this sentiment effect – has an impact on equity issuance in our international sample.

    To further examine the sentiment hypothesis, we also include direct proxies for sentiment in

our tobit models. We use local and global closed-end country fund discounts (Lee, Shleifer, and

Thaler, 1991) and the U.S. investor sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006) as proxies for

variation in investor sentiment. We obtain the country fund discount variables from Karolyi, Lee,

and van Dijk (2012). They construct time-series of local closed-end country fund discounts for 22

of the countries in our sample based on a sample of 42 closed-end funds. The global sentiment

indicator is the equally-weighted average of the discounts of these 42 country funds. None of the

sentiment variables is significant in models (5) through (7) and the coefficients on liquidity

remain significant even after controlling for these sentiment proxies. The magnitudes of the

coefficients on liquidity innovations are somewhat attenuated in model (7), but this model can

only be estimated based on 840 country-quarter observations (compared to 1,800 in Table 2) and

the F-tests in the bottom two rows of Table 4 confirm that the joint effects of all liquidity

variables and of only the lagged liquidity variables are still significant at the 5% level.8

    Overall, the results in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that the positive relation between market

liquidity and aggregate equity issuance is not due to economic or financial variables that are


8
  Since the global and U.S. sentiment factors are the same for all countries, including year fixed effects in
the tobit models may be overly restrictive. We therefore re-estimate models (5) through (7) of Table 4
without year fixed effects. The results suggest that the number of equity issues is greater in quarters with
more pessimistic global sentiment and more optimistic U.S. sentiment, respectively. Neither of these effects
survives the inclusion of the other sentiment variables and the lagged dependent variable in model (7). The
coefficients on the liquidity variables remain significant.

                                                    20
unrelated to the aggregate demand elasticity of the stock market, but could simultaneously affect

liquidity and equity issuance for other reasons.



5. How does equity issuance depend on liquidity?

    In this section, we present the results of tests that focus more directly on the nature of the

mechanism through which equity issuance is related to liquidity. We explore asymmetries in this

relation, study the choice between private and public equity issues, and analyze postponements

and cancellations of equity issues. We conclude with an analysis of the relation between liquidity

and IPOs vs. SEOs and of the relation between liquidity and equity issue proceeds rather than

equity issue counts.

    Table 5 allows for an asymmetric effect of declines and improvements in liquidity by

introducing dummy variables indicating quarters with the top 33% (Market liquidity UP) and the

bottom 33% (Market liquidity DOWN) of observations by country based on liquidity innovations.

The table contains five different models that differ in the number of lags of these dummy

variables and in the extent to which we control for market returns. The results are consistent

throughout the table: the relation between liquidity and equity issuance is driven by the quarters

with the greatest deterioration in liquidity. The coefficient on the contemporaneous DOWN

market liquidity dummy is always statistically significant at the 5% level or better. Its magnitude

suggests that the ratio of equity issues is about 30 to 40 basis points lower in quarters with the

most negative liquidity innovations, or about 15% of the unconditional average ratio of equity

issues of 2.52%. In addition, in most models, the coefficients on at least two of the lagged DOWN

liquidity dummies are significant. In model (4), a large deterioration in liquidity is associated with

a decrease in equity issues over the next five quarters (based only on the significant coefficients

on the DOWN liquidity dummies) by 89 basis points, or around 35% of the average fraction of

issues in any given quarter across all countries in our sample. This effect is close in magnitude to

the cumulative change in equity issues associated with a one standard deviation shock to liquidity

                                                   21
documented in Section 3 based on Table 2. In contrast, we find only weak evidence that equity

issuance goes up during or following quarters with large improvements in market liquidity. The

coefficient on the contemporaneous UP market liquidity dummy is positive and significant at the

10% level, but only in models (1) and (2) and none of the lagged UP market liquidity variables

has a significant coefficient.9

    These results seem to be at variance with the intuition of the model of Baker and Stein

(2004), which predicts that liquidity is related to equity issuance because – in the presence of

short-sales constraints – stocks can become overvalued and more liquid at the same time, and

managers tend to issue more equity during these times. In contrast, our results are driven by

periods of deteriorating liquidity. More generally, stories about managers exploiting mispricing

on the equity market tend to focus on episodes of overvaluation and high liquidity when the

overvaluation is associated with active participation in the markets of noise traders. The

asymmetric effects of liquidity innovations on equity issuance documented in Table 5 thus seem

hard to reconcile with alternative explanations based on investor sentiment. In contrast, they

accord well with the intuition that firms shun equity issues when markets are illiquid to avoid the

large discount they need to offer investors to absorb the additional supply of shares in such

market conditions.

    It is interesting to note that although Baker and Stein (2004) argue that liquidity and

sentiment are positively related, they do not necessarily attribute the positive empirical relation

between market turnover (their proxy for liquidity) and aggregate U.S. equity issuance they find

to managers having some comparative advantage in assessing mispricing and therefore timing

equity issues to exploit overvaluation. In fact, footnote 7 of Baker and Stein (2004) discusses that

their preferred interpretation is that “managers care about market liquidity per se – i.e., they

simply wish to avoid large price impacts when issuing equity.” The bigger point Baker and Stein


9
  In unreported robustness tests, we obtain almost identical results for the UP and DOWN liquidity
dummies when we allow for asymmetric effects of market returns in a similar way.

                                                22
make is that managers may appear to time the market successfully even when they base their

decision to issue equity on the demand elasticity of the equity market, which happens to be

correlated with investor sentiment.

    The results in Table 5 lead us to conclude that it is unlikely that the relation between liquidity

and equity issuance is due to sentiment. First, sentiment should be picked up by the market return

variables and valuation proxies. Second, including direct measures of sentiment in our regressions

does not affect the relation between liquidity and equity issuance. Third, that relation is driven by

large deteriorations in liquidity, which is not consistent with common stories about how sentiment

affects public capital raising.

    We would expect that many of the other factors that could affect equity issuance (and that

may not have been perfectly controlled for in Tables 2 through 5) should have similar effects on

public and private equity issues. However, downward-sloping demand curves are less of a

concern for private equity issues since investors in a private issue tend to face restrictions on

selling the shares, which implies that a private equity issue has less of an effect on the supply of

shares in the public market. We therefore expect that poor liquidity conditions lead managers to

opt for a private rather than a public equity issue. We test this conjecture in Table 6 by estimating

tobit models to explain time-variation in the quarterly number of privately placed SEOs scaled by

the number of public SEOs plus the number of privately placed SEOs. All models in Table 6

contain contemporaneous and lagged market liquidity innovations and market returns as well as

lead market returns. Models (2) through (6) also include proxies for capital market conditions,

future economic activity, or asymmetric information. The bottom line is that liquidity has a

negative and significant relation with the fraction of private equity issues. In other words, firms

tend to issue more private equity relative to public equity when market liquidity deteriorates. In

model (1), a one-standard deviation deterioration in liquidity is associated with an increase in the

fraction of private equity issues over the next two quarters by around 3.1% (where the

unconditional average fraction of private SEOs in our sample is 25.0%). The negative relation

                                                 23
between liquidity innovations and the fraction of private equity issues survives the inclusion of

market volatility, market-to-book, idiosyncratic volatility, and stock price synchronicity.

    If firms are concerned about the price impact of equity issues, adverse liquidity shocks should

make them more likely to postpone or cancel equity issues previously filed. We investigate this

hypothesis in Table 7. We obtain quarterly data on the number of postponements and

cancellations from SDC. We scale the number of postponements (cancellations) in a country-

quarter by the number of realized equity issues plus the number of postponements (cancellations).

Models (1) through (4) explain time-variation in postponements, while models (5) through (8)

explain time-variation in cancellations. Like in Table 6, we control for market returns and for

proxies for capital market conditions, future economic activity, or asymmetric information in

different models. One drawback of the SDC data on postponements and cancellations is that they

are reported by the filing date of the equity issue and not by the postponement or cancellation

date. We expect that most postponements and cancellations are announced within six months of

the filing date, so we include only contemporaneous and two quarterly leads of the explanatory

variables in Table 7. The aggregation of postponements and cancellations by filing dates prevents

us from making strong statements about the exact timing of postponements and cancellations

relative to changes in market liquidity, returns, capital market conditions, and economic activity.

    Model (1) of Table 7 shows that postponements are negatively related to both market

liquidity innovations and to market returns, consistent with the hypothesis that firms tend to

postpone equity issues during times of deteriorating liquidity and decreasing valuations. The

economic effect of liquidity is large and of the same order of magnitude as that of returns. The

effects of liquidity and returns both survive the inclusion of additional variables in models (2)

through (4). In contrast, we find no significant relation between the liquidity variables and the

fraction of cancelled equity issues. A potential explanation is that cancellations of equity issues

are more costly (if only as a signal about the issuing firm’s prospects) and are therefore less likely

to be based on capital market conditions alone. We still find a significantly negative effect of

                                                 24
market returns, though it is weaker in models (5) through (8) than in models (1) through (4).

Unreported results show that the relation between liquidity and postponements of equity issues is

similar for IPOs and SEOs.

    In Table 8, we examine whether the effects of market liquidity innovations are different for

IPOs and SEOs. Models (1) through (4) have the ratio of IPOs to listed stocks as dependent

variable, while models (5) through (8) are based on SEOs over listed stocks. There are a number

of interesting results in Table 8. First, liquidity is significantly related to time-variation in both

IPOs and SEOs. Second, the relation is stronger for IPOs. A one standard deviation shock to

liquidity is associated with a change in equity issuance over the next five quarters (based only on

the significant liquidity coefficients in models (1) and (5)) that is equal to 65 basis points for IPOs

and 25 basis points for SEOs. The correlation of contemporaneous liquidity innovations is

stronger with IPOs than with SEOs throughout. In models (4) and (8) – which control for all

explanatory variables in this table – four of the five liquidity coefficients are significant for IPOs,

versus only two for SEOs. That said, the number of observations is significantly reduced in

models (4) and (8) and, if anything, the F-tests reported in the last two rows of Table 8 seem to

suggest a stronger joint effect of lagged liquidity for SEOs. Third, the effects of market returns

are considerably stronger both statistically and economically for SEOs than for IPOs. Most

notably, the negative effect of one-quarter lead returns reported in previous tables is only

observed in the SEO specifications. In other words, the evidence consistent with market timing is

much stronger for SEOs than for IPOs.

    In Table 9, we investigate whether our finding that firms issue less equity when market

liquidity deteriorates is robust to using equity issue proceeds instead of equity issue counts. We

estimate similar tobits as before, but use quarterly equity issue proceeds scaled by the local stock

market capitalization (both expressed in US$) as dependent variable. We again distinguish

between IPOs and SEOs; models (1) through (4) try to explain time-variation in IPO proceeds,

and models (5) through (8) focus on SEO proceeds. Ex ante, we expect these results to be weaker

                                                  25
since the proceeds measure is highly skewed and is more sensitive to individual extreme

observations. We therefore drop China from the sample for this analysis, as Table 1 shows that

there were a number of issues with very large proceeds that are likely to influence the results.

(We obtain slightly weaker results when we include China.) Further, financial globalization

makes it possible for firms to issue shares abroad (Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2012, and Caglio,

Weiss-Hanley, and Marietta-Westberg, 2011, show the growing importance of global IPOs during

our sample period), so that proceeds may overstate the amounts sold domestically. Also, firms

might choose to issue more abroad when domestic liquidity has suffered an adverse shock but

liquidity abroad has not.

    Models (1) through (4) of Table 9 show a strong relation between liquidity innovations and

IPO proceeds. At least two of the coefficients on contemporaneous and lagged liquidity

innovations are significant in each model. A one standard deviation shock to liquidity is

associated with a change in IPO proceeds over the next five quarters (based only on the

significant liquidity coefficients in model (1)) that is equal to 0.09% of local market

capitalization, which corresponds to around 40% of the unconditional average fraction of equity

issues of 0.22% in our sample – an economic effect that is comparable in magnitude to the effect

on equity issue counts documented in Section 3 based on Table 2. In contrast, models (5) through

(8) show almost no significant relation between liquidity innovations and SEO proceeds.



6. Conclusions

    In this paper, we have shown that equity issuance across the world is strongly related to

equity market liquidity. We provide evidence that this relation between liquidity and equity

issuance cannot be attributed to liquidity serving as a proxy for future economic growth or market

sentiment. Further, we show that it is not plausible that the relation could be due to reverse-

causation. Using liquidity as an explanatory variable for equity issuance, we find that liquidity

explains as much of equity issuance as contemporaneous and past market returns. The relation

                                               26
between liquidity and equity issuance is stronger for decreases in liquidity than increases. As one

would expect, the fraction of private equity issues to public equity issues increases as liquidity

worsens since private equity issues do not increase the supply of traded shares in the short run

because of restrictions on selling the shares from such issues. We interpret our findings to be

supportive of the view that in imperfectly liquid markets, the demand for shares is downward-

sloping and that corporations take into account the slope of the demand curve for shares in their

financing decisions.

   This table reports the total number of equity issues (IPOs and SEOs from SDC), and the time-series average and standard deviation (based on quarterly
   data) of the number of equity issues scaled by the number of listed stocks, of the total proceeds (in US$) of these equity issues scaled by the local stock
   market capitalization (in US$), of local stock market returns (in local currency, expressed in % per day), and of market liquidity, as well as the time-series
   average of local market volatility. The sample covers the period from the first quarter of 1995 through the fourth quarter of 2008 (with the exception of
   Brazil and Germany, for which the data start in 1999QI, and Poland, for which the data start in 1996QII). Market returns are the total returns on the
   value-weighted local market index from Datastream. The liquidity time-series are taken from Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012) and are based on the
   value-weighted average of the daily estimates of Amihud’s (2002) price impact proxy for individual stocks – computed as the absolute stock return
   divided by local currency trading volume. The Amihud measure is multiplied by -10,000 so that we obtain a measure that is increasing in liquidity.
   Volatility is the standard deviation of daily market returns within a quarter. The table also depicts the total number of equity issues and the average of the
   other variables for developed countries and for emerging countries, as well as the grand total / average for developed and emerging countries jointly.

              Table 2: Tobit models to explain quarterly variation in equity issues in 36 countries

      This table reports coefficient estimates of pooled tobit models to explain variation in the quarterly number of equity
      issues (IPOs and SEOs from SDC) – scaled by the number of listed stocks – in each of the 36 countries in our
      sample over the period 1995-2008. Independent variables include lead, contemporaneous, and lagged local market
      liquidity innovations and local market returns, a dummy for the first calendar quarter, and a lagged dependent
      variable. The liquidity time-series are taken from Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012) and are based on daily estimates
      of Amihud’s (2002) price impact proxy for individual stocks – computed as the absolute stock return divided by
      local currency trading volume. The Amihud measure is multiplied by -10,000 so that we obtain a measure that is
      increasing in liquidity. Since the level of Amihud market liquidity is non-stationary in most countries, we use
      market liquidity innovations (taken as the residuals from country-by-country AR(1) regressions of the level of
      market liquidity) as independent variable. Market returns are the total returns on the value-weighted local market
      index from Datastream. All independent variables are standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation,
      so the coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of a one standard deviation (1SD) shock in the independent
      variable. The last two rows present the results of F-tests on the joint significance of all lagged market liquidity
      variables and of all market liquidity variables, respectively. Significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level is indicated
      by ***, **, and *, respectively (based on standard errors that are clustered by country).

                                  Controlling for capital market conditions
      This table reports coefficient estimates of pooled tobit models to explain variation in the quarterly number of equity
      issues (IPOs and SEOs from SDC) – scaled by the number of listed stocks – in each of the 36 countries in our
      sample over the period 1995-2008. Independent variables include lead, contemporaneous, and/or lagged local
      market liquidity innovations, returns, volatility, turnover, liquidity risk (conditional liquidity volatility based on a
      GARCH(1,1) model), market-to-book ratio, price-earnings ratio, dividend-price ratio, a dummy for the first calendar
      quarter, and a lagged dependent variable. The liquidity time-series are taken from Karolyi, Lee, and van Dijk (2012)
      and are based on daily estimates of Amihud’s (2002) price impact proxy for individual stocks – computed as the
      absolute stock return divided by local currency trading volume. The Amihud measure is multiplied by -10,000.
      Since the level of Amihud market liquidity is non-stationary in most countries, we use market liquidity innovations
      (taken as the residuals from country-by-country AR(1) regressions of the level of market liquidity) as independent
      variable. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. All independent variables are standardized. The last two rows
      present the results of F-tests on the joint significance of all lagged and all market liquidity variables, respectively.
      Significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively (based on standard errors that
      are clustered by country).

This table reports coefficient estimates of pooled tobit models to explain variation in the quarterly number of equity
issues (IPOs and SEOs from SDC) – scaled by the number of listed stocks – in each of the 36 countries in our
sample over the period 1995-2008. The key independent variables are (contemporaneous and lagged) dummy
variables indicating quarters with the top (Market liquidity UP) and bottom (Market liquidity DOWN) 33%
observations based on liquidity innovations by country. Other independent variables include lead, contemporaneous,
and lagged local market returns, and a dummy for the first calendar quarter. Variable definitions are in the
Appendix. All independent variables are standardized. The last two rows present the results of F-tests on the joint
significance of all UP and DOWN market liquidity variables, respectively. Significance at the 1%, 5% and 10%
level is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively (based on standard errors that are clustered by country).

         This table reports coefficient estimates of pooled tobit models to explain variation in the quarterly number of
         postponed equity issues (models (1) through (4)) scaled by the number of realized equity issues plus the number of
         postponements and in the quarterly number of canceled equity issues (models (5) through (8)) scaled by the number
         of realized equity issues plus the number of cancellations – in each of the 36 countries in our sample over the period
         1995-2008. Postponements and cancellations of IPOs and SEOs are obtained from SDC. Independent variables
         include lead and contemporaneous local market liquidity and returns, proxies for capital market conditions (market-
         to-book ratio), the state of the business cycle (GDP growth), and asymmetric information (idiosyncratic volatility,
         “stock price synchronicity” or average R2 from market model as in Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000). Variable
         definitions are in the Appendix. Since SDC does not report postponements and cancellations by the postponement or
         cancellation date but by the filing date, we only include contemporaneous and lead independent variables. The last
         row presents the results of F-tests on the joint significance of all market liquidity variables. Significance at the 1%,

                                                   IPOs vs. SEOs

         This table reports coefficient estimates of pooled tobit models to explain variation in the quarterly number of equity
         issues (separate regressions for IPOs and SEOs from SDC) – scaled by the number of listed stocks – in each of the
         36 countries in our sample over the period 1995-2008. Models (1) through (4) have IPOs scaled by listed companies
         as dependent variable. Models (5) through (8) have SEOs scaled by listed companies as dependent variable.
         Independent variables include lead, contemporaneous, and/or lagged local market liquidity innovations and returns,
         proxies for capital market conditions (market volatility, market-to-book ratio), business cycle proxies (GDP growth,
         OECD leading indicator), asymmetric information proxies (idiosyncratic volatility, “stock price synchronicity” or
         average R2 from market model as in Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000), investor sentiment (global closed-end fund
         discount), and a dummy for the first calendar quarter. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The last two rows
         present the results of F-tests on the joint significance of all lagged market liquidity variables and of all market

         This table reports coefficient estimates of pooled tobit models to explain variation in the quarterly US$ proceeds of
         equity issues (separate regressions for IPOs and SEOs from SDC) – scaled by the US$ local market capitalization –
         in 35 countries in our sample (we drop China because of its very large proceeds) over the period 1995-2008. Models
         (1) through (4) have IPO proceeds scaled by local market cap as dependent variable. Models (5) through (8) have
         SEO proceeds scaled by local market cap as dependent variable. Independent variables include lead,
         contemporaneous, and/or lagged local market liquidity innovations and returns, proxies for capital market
         conditions (market volatility, market-to-book ratio), business cycle proxies (GDP growth, OECD leading indicator),
         asymmetric information proxies (idiosyncratic volatility, “stock price synchronicity” or average R2 from market
         model as in Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000), investor sentiment (global closed-end fund discount), and a dummy for
         the first calendar quarter. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The last two rows present the results of F-tests
