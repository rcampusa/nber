        EARNINGS GROWTH ON THE JOB AND BETWEEN JOBS

                                           ANN   P.    BARTEL

           This paper uses detailed data on the salary histories of in-
        dividuals to shou' how an individual's observed earnings
        growth can be decomposed into growth occurring on the job
        and growth occurring between jobs. it is shown that the rela-
        tive contributions of these two components to overall earnings
        growth differ across race and education groups. Further, as
        predicted by the specific training hypothesis, the more mobile
        individuals are found to have smaller on-the-job earnings gains
        in absolute terms than the less mobile.

    Job mobility is an important characteristic of the working life histories
 of men. According to the U.S. Department of Labor,' a young man at age
 20 can expect to ha e 6.6 job chaiigcs in the next forty years of his
 working life with 60 percent of these nmves occurring before he reaches
 the age of 35. Until recently, the scarcity of detailed data on work his-
 tories has resulted in mobility being studied as an aggregate phenome-
 non.2 With the emergence of longitudinal data sets, however, economists
 have begun to study mobility from the point of view of the individual.
 These studies have considered such topics as the relationship between an
 indiv,duals characteristics and his turnover behavior and the estimation
 of a standard earnings function when information on an individual's job
 history is known.3
    An important issue relating to an individual's work history has still
 not been addressed; namely, how important is job mobility for earnings
 growth? Although job changing is a common characteristic of workers,
 what proportion of earnings growth actually takes place between jobs
 and how does this proportion differ across groups of individuals? This
 paper provides direct evidence on this question by calculating, for
 different race-education grtiups, the actual amounts of earnings growth
 that occurred on the job and between jobs. Further, the relationship
 between these two magnitudes is shown to depend on the existence of
specific training. Specificity of training produces a positive correlation
between job duration and job investment which, in turn, results in

smaller on-the-job earnings growth For mobile individuals. The extent to
which this smaller growth is offset by earnings growth between jobs is
examined.
   Part I of the paper discusses the manner in which earnings growth can
be decomposed into its two components and shows the implications of
specific training. Part II presents the calculations of the earnings growth
components for the white and black men in the Coleman-Rossi Retro-
spective Life History Study. In Part III the relationships between the
earnings growth components suggested by the theory of specific training
are documented for this data set. The effects of education and experience
are also analyzed. A summary is provided in Part IV.

                          I. DECOMPOSING EARNINGS GROWTH


  Let an individual's current price-deflated earnings be given by Y,,
and his initial leg. first full-time job after completion of schooling) price-
deflated earnings be given by Y.1. The observed differential between
current and initial earnings can be decomposed into earnings growth on
the job and earnings growth due to mobility. Let I',. be final earnings
on the first job, Y, initial earnings on the second job, Y,.2 final earnings
on the second job, etc. Then earnings growth on the job is given by:

where the individual           has worked at n firms. Earnings growth due
to mobility is given by:
                                      n—I

   To what can we attribute observed earnings growth? Some portion of
Jand M is certainly due to economy-wide increases in labor productivity;
this can be netted out by using a productivity deflator. The remaining
growth in earnings is largely due to the individual's acquisition of human
capital over time. Many studies have shown that the life cycle pattern of
earnings can be explained by the time profile of investments in human
capital.4 Thus the productivity-deflated J and M can be viewed as esti-

mates of the returns on job investment and mobility investment.5
   l'he theory of specific training leads to an important prediction about
the absolute magnitude of J, namely, that more mobile individuals will
have smaller J than the less mobik. This prediction should not be con-
fused with the obvious result that the mobik individuals will achieve a
smaller proportion of their earnings growth on the job as compared to the
less mobile. Kather, it can be shown that specificity of training will
actualk lead to smaller J in absolute terms for the more mobile it then
becomes an important empirical issue as to whether this smallerJ is more
than compensated b a larger M, i.e. whether mobility actually leads to
larger earnings growth.
   This prediction is obtained by noting that when some portion of on-
the-job training is specific, the amount of investment in a job will be
positively correlated with the completed duration of that job. i.e.
earnings will grow faster in longer jobs. This occurs because specific
training raises the worker's productivity only in the job in which it is
rece'ive(l: its proiital)ilitv. therefore', dept'ruls on the duration of that job.
While longer expected job duration will lead to larger investments, the
larger investments will, in turn, lead to lower turnover rates since the
incentives for quits and layoffs will be reduced in order for the worker
and the employer to collect the returns on their investments.6 The result
is. therefore, a positive correlation between job investment i.e. the rate
at which earnings grow on the job) and job duration.
   Since more mobile individuals have, on average, shorter job durations
thait the less mobile, they will therefore have smaller on-the-job earnings
growth if specific training exists. Consider the following example: in-
dividuals A and B have the same education and experience but A has held
two different jobs during the course of his working life while B has held
only one. This can be represented by the following diagram:

               where J          earnings growth on A's first job
                          J = earnings growth on A's second jot)

                               = time period when A changes jobs
                                   current time period

 Since B's job is of longer duration than eithcr of A's jobs, 11w ratc ol
 growth of his earnings will exceed the rate of growth on either ol A's jobs.
 This implies that J > J + J; the more mobile individual will base
 smaller observed on—the—job earnings growth even though his total oti—Ihe—
 job experience is the same as that of the less mobile person. Since indi-
 vidual A will probably have some earnings growth (actually, a once-and—
 for-all shift) occurring between his two jobs (i.e. at period t svftile
 individual B will not have this component of earning growth, it is still
 possible that A's total earnings growth exceeds that 01 B. This rentatits art
 empirical question which will be explored in Part Ill. One problem with
 this example, however, is that it ignores the timing ol job changes. For
 example, suppose there exists an individual C who makes one job change
 during his working life at a point that is very close to his (late of entry into
 the labor market, Individual C should not be treated the same as indiviti-
 ual A, since C has a job that is longer than either of A's jobs. Fortunately
 the data enable us to distinguish among these types of mobility pattrtts;
 this is discussed further in Part 11.

               N. ESTIMATES OF THE COMPONENTS OF EARNINGS GROWTH

    The discussion in Part I showed that earnings growth could be decom-
posed into its two components if information on the starting and ending
salaries for each of the individual's jobs was available. The Coleman-
Rossi Retrospective Life History Study provides data of this nature for a
national sample and a supplementary black sample of males aged 30-39
in l968. Tables 1 and 2 present the results of decomposing the earnings

    7 While mobile individuals do spend some time between jobs, this represents a serv sniall
 fraction of their overall work experience. In fact, for the data set that is used, whites who worked ,it
 more than one firm spent 1% of their time between jobs while blacks whi, worked at snore than uric
firm spent 3% of their time between jobs Thus it is reasonable to argue that the mobile and the non-
mobile have the same amount of on-the-job experience. The finding below that the mobile isiiliviilis,ils
do. in fact, have smaller on-the-job earnings growth can not be said to be due to signilicantlv less
time spent on jobs in total.
   8. it should be pointed out that the longitudinal data sets that are available e.g. Michigan
Income Dynamics, National Longitudinal Survey) can not he used for this analysis since they di, not
provide information on the starting and ending salaries for each of the individual's jobs. The data iii
the coleman-Rossi Study were collected in January 1969 through personal interviews coiidiicted
by the National Opinion Research Center. Along with data on the individual's jobs, inforrnatiiin was
also gathered on geographic mobility, marital status, wife's labor force characteristics, tic. I
restricted the sample to those individuals who always worked full-time since the completion of
schooling and who reported beginning and ending salaries for each full-time job they held.

growth of the white and black males by using the method described in
Part I. The analysis includes only those individuals who worked full-
time since the completion of schooling.
   The data in Tables 1 and 2 show that, in 1969, a 35-year-old
                                                                average
white male with approximately fifteen years of labor force experience
had achieved gains in annual price-deflated earnings of $4,358 while his
black counterpart had only experienced gains of $2,64I. This large
racial differential was not due to the blacks having completed fewer
years of schooling; within each education group, whiles experienced
larger earnings gains than blacks and this differential actually increased
with education. Some portion of the observed earnings gains for the two
groups was, of course, due to increases in the overall productivity of the
economy. In other words, an individual's price-adjusted earnings grew,

 in part, because improvements in technology made workers more pro-
 ductive.One would not want to attribute this earnings growth to invest-
 ments made by the individual. When the earnings gains are deflated for
 these economy-wide increases in productivity, whites are now found to
 have achieved increases of $1,805 while blacks only had gains of $827.10
 Note that the productivity deflation sharpens the racial differential
 because the blacks experienced smaller earnings growth over this



    10. The productivity deflators were obtained from Table 4.3 in Mincer 119741. Mincer calculated
 these deflators by comparing the growth rate of the income of a given cohort (stratitied by education)
 from 1956 to 1966 with the growth rate over the ten-year period estimated in the 191,6 cross section.
 The difference in these growth rates is an estimate of economy-wide secular growth. I used his
 estimates for individuals who were 25 years old in 1956. lucy are as tollows: Under S wars ot
 schooling, 3.2 percent: 8 years of schooling, 2.2 percent; 9-Il years of schooling, 2.4 percent: 12
 years of schooling, 2.7 percent; 13-15 years of schooling, 3.5 percent; and lb years of schooling. 4.0
 percent.

iwrnxl. ['0 the extent that blacks have not shared equally in the gains
fruit, teciinological change, however, the pnxluctivitv dellators are too
high for this group; productivity deflation may, therefore, serve to over-
estimate the racial dillerential in earnings gains.
   l'he decomposition of the earnings gains shows that, for the white
males. 13 percent of the earnings gains that are unadjusted for economy-
wide increases in productivity took place between jobs. When earnings
gains are deflated for productivity changes. 26 percent of the growth in
earnings occurs between jobs: productivity deflation has a stronger effect
on job earnings gains than on mobility earnings gains because more time
is spent on the job than between jobs.t2 In the case of the black males,
24 percent of their unadjusted earnings growth and 64 percent of their
adjusted earnings growth takes place between jobs. The decomposition
analysis therefore shows that most of the earnings gains of whites occurs
on the job while the split is more even for blacks. This occurs despite the
fact that the blacks in this sample are only slightly more mobile than the
whites, having worked at 4.6 firms as compared to the whites' average
oF four firms. The data in Tables I and 2, therefore, show that the racial
differential in earnings growth occurs because of differences in the rate
at which earnings grow on the job for the two groups.
   The results in Tables 1 and 2 also demonstrate that the relative con-
tribution of mobility to earnings growth depends on the individual's
education. For both race groups, individuals with less than twelve years
of education receive a substantially larger proportion of their earnings
growth between jobs as compared to individuals with more education.
The true effect of education on absolute earnings growth can be meas-
ured only when experience is held constant. While Tables 1 and 2 show
earnings gains per year of experience for each education group, a more
accurate measure is obtained through the regression analysis which is
discussed below.




   II Consider the following example of a white individual and a black individual isbn have the
same education, the same productivity deflator, and jobs of equal length. tin fact. the blacks' jobs
are approximately three months shorter than the jobs of the whites.) The white individual has a
starting annual salar of $5,000 and an ending salar- of $10,000 after five years of emplosnient at
this firm, The black individual starts at $4,000 per sear and five sears later when he leases the firm

tenure at a firm is forty months.

            III.   REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS GROWTH COMPONENTS


    The components of earnings growth that were calculated in Part II
can be used to analyze several issues that other researchers have studied
through the use of cross-sectional earnings functions)3 For example, we
can analyze directly whether more educated individuals, in fact, have
larger earnings gains, and how earnings grow with experience. Further,
as was discussed in Part I, a direct test for the existence of specific train-
ing can be performed on the earnings growth components. Finally, it can
be determined whether mobility leads to larger overall earnings growth
and how this differs for the two race groups.
   Tables 3 and 4 present regressions on total earnings gains, earnings
gains on the job and earnings gains between jobs for the two race groups.
Equations were estimated for both earnings gains that were deflated for
productivity and for gains that were not deflated for productivity; all
earnings gains were price-deflated, however. The results show that for the
white males the more educated individuals schieve larger total earnings
gains even when adjustments are made for economy-wide increases in
productivity. Thus, individuals who invest more in schooling are also
found to spend more on post-school investments. This is a very reasonable
finding since greater ability and better access to financing are important
factors in both types of investment. While the correlation between
schooling and post-school investments has been inferred from cross-
sectional data,'4 the analysis of individual earnings growth shows the
relationship directly. Further, the decomposition of earnings growth
shows that the correlation between schooling and post-school investments
does not hold for all types of post-school investment. The results in Table
3 show that education has a positive effect on job earnings gains but not
on mobility earnings gains even though number of firms is held con-
stant.t5 This indicates that the factors that induce individuals to invest
in schooling and on-the-job training are not important determinants of
mobility investment.16
   In the case of the black males, education has a positive effect on
earnings gains when the gains are not deflated for economy-wide in-
creases in productivity. Since the productivity-deflated gains are a more
accurate measure of the returns to job investment, the results show that

  IS. In spite of this, education has a positive effect on total earnings gains because, as Table I
showed, most earnings gains occur on the job. This is also the reason why the positive correlation
between schoohng and total post-school investments was observed in cross-sectional data.
  16. Alternatively, the Imdings could indicate that the gains from mobility can not be interpreted
ss returns on investment. These gains may reflect the individual's ability to capitalize on existing
disequilibrium in the labor market.

 estimates of the post-school ins'estnwrit profile. Since the productivity-

 Assuming a rate of return of ten percent,18 the expressions in (4) imply
 that, looking across individuals, there is an average initial investment of
 $1 108 r ear for whites and $345 for blacks. Further, the white invest-
 rnent profile (le('lines by $24 per sear while the black profile declines by
 $80 annually. Thus blacks invest less than whites initially and their
 investment profile is considerably steeper.
    The analysis in Part I showed that, ii specific training exists, there will
 be a positive correlation between job investment and job duration, It was
shown that this implied smaller absolute earnings gains on the job for
the more mobile individuals. The results in Table 3 show that, among
the white males, those individuals who have worked at more firms have
significantly smaller job earnings gains, thereby confirming the specific
training hypothesis. For the black males, the results are less clear. From
Table 4 we observe a positive effect of NFIRMS on job earnings gains but
this becomes negative when a quadratic term on NFIRMS is included

in the regression)9 Similarly, for the whites, total mobility earnings gains
increase with the number of firms while they have an inverted-U shape
for the blacks.2°
   As was discussed in Part I, the use of NFIRMS as a measure of mobility
ignores the timing of job changes which has implications for the indiv-
idual's job investments. One way of accounting for this problem is to
define three mobility patterns:
Pattern 1 — the individual has worked at only one firm (ONEFIRM);
Pattern 2 — the individual has worked at more than one firm but he has
been at the current firm the longest (CLONG); and
Pattern 3 — the individual has worked at more than one firm but he has
not been at the current firm the longest. The timing problem would show
up in a comparison of Patterns 2 and 3. The specific training hypothesis
would predict that Pattern 2 individuals should have larger absolute
earnings gains on the job than Pattern 3 individuals since their (Pattern
2) mobility took place early in their working lives. In other words they
searched for a satisfactory job and, having found it, have remained in
it until the present time. This would have increased their incentives
for job investment. Of course, Pattern 1 individuals would also be pre-
dicted to have larger absolute earnings gains on the job than Pattern 3
individuals. Whether Pattern 1 or Pattern 2 individuals would have the
larger job earnings gains is not clear if Pattern 2 mobility takes place very
early in the working life.
   Table 5 reports the coefficients on CLONG and ONEFIRM which are
taken from earnings gains regressions in which EDUC, EXPER and
EXPER2 are also held constant. In other words, Pattern 3 individuals
are the excluded group. As predicted by the specific training hypothesis,
ONEFIRM and CLONG have positive signs in the job earnings gains
regressions for whites and for blacks. The significance levels are some-
what higher when the earnings gains are not deflated for productivity.
Accounting for the timing of job changes appears to clarify the am-
biguous results for the blacks that were obtained when the NFIRMS
specification was used.
   Although the specific training hypothesis predicts that more mobile
individuals will have smaller job earning gains, it says nothing about the
effect of mobility on total earnings gains. Will the smaller job earnings
gains of the more mobile be offset by their larger earnings gains between
 jobs? The results in Tables 3 and 4 show that mobility has a positive
 (almost significant) effect on the total productivity-deflated earnings
 gains of the whites, but an insignificant ellect on the gains ol the blacks.

 ever, the (-value on NFIIIMS rises to 1.40.21 The mobility patterns
 specification in Table 5 also indicates an ambiguity in the returns to
  mobility for blacks. Among the whites, individuals who have worked at
  more than one firm hut have been at the current firm the longest have
 signilicantlv higher overall earnings gains. In other words, mobility that
 take's place early in the working life pass. Among the blacks, however,
 there is no significant difference in the earnings gains of the individuals
 iii the three patterns. In other words, individuals who are still changing
jobs (Pattern 3; are' not worse off than individuals whose mobility took
place early in their working lives.

                                         IV. SUMMARY


   This paper has shown how detailed data on an individual's salary
history can be utilized to decompose his observed earnings growth into
growth occurring on the job and growth occurring between jobs. This
decomposition made possible the study of several questions that could
not be handled with standard longitudinal data sets.

  21. The coefficient on NFIRMS becomes 111.78 While that on NFIRMS is —4.99 with a t-
value of —1.08. Therefore, total earnings gains increase up until eleven firms. For the whites,
NF'IRMS' is also negative but the t-vaiue is only —.50.

   1. It was shown that the proportion of earnings growth that occurs
between jobs varies across race and education groups. While unIv 26
percent of the price-and-productivity deflated earnings gains of the white
males took place between jobs, 64 percent of the similarly deflated gailis
of the blacks occurred between jobs. Although the least educated jisdivid-
uals in both race groups had the largest proportion of earnings gains
occurring between jobs, the differences between whites and blacks held
within education groups. Further, it was shown that the racial dillereri-
tial in total earnings growth occurred because of differences in the rate at
which earnings grew on the job for the two groups.
    2. The positive correlation between schooling and post-school invest-
ments that has been inferred from cross-sectional data was shown here
not to hold for all types of post-school investment. In particular. educa-
tion had a positive effect on job earnings gains but not on mobility
earnings gains even though number of firms was held constant.
     3. Among the whites, the more mobile individuals were shown to
have smaller on-the-job earnings gains (in absolute terms) than the less
mobile which is a prediction of the specific training hypothesis. In spite
of this, however, the mobile individuals had larger total earnings growth
because their smaller on-the-job earnings gains were more than offset by
larger earnings growth between jobs. Further, it was shown that the
timing of mobility was important since individuals who had changed
firms but had been at the current firm the longest had the largest total
earnings growth. Among the blacks, the effect of mobility on job earnings
gains and earnings gains between jobs conformed with the predictions
 of the specific training hypothesis when one accounted for the timing of
job changes. The effect of mobility on the total earnings gains of blacks
 was ambiguous.

                                   APPENDIX


   J, earnings growth on the job, is an upper bound estimate of the returns
 on job investment while M, earnings growth between jobs, is a lower
 bound estimate of the returns on mobility investment. This can be shown
 as follows. An individual's observed earnings at any time t can be
 expressed as:

                                      t—I
 (A-l)                                I
                                     ko
 where E. is initial earnings capacity, the summation represents returns on
 dollar investment through period t — 1, and C, is current investment.
 Returns on investment in period t are not collected until the next period.

     Using equation (A-I). the absolute change in earnings on the jIb job
 can be written as:

                                       '—I
 (A-2)                                        rC,,.—(C,,—C,,)
                                         —I

 where G1, is initial investment on this job, G,.I is linal investment on this
job and the summation is the returns on the investment undertaken in
 period t through period I — I on this job. Since dollar investment costs
 are likely to decline over the job (see Ben-Porath, 1967), observed
earnings gains will tend to overestimate returns on job investment.
   Similarly, the change in earnings I roin the last period of the jth job to
the first period of jobj+ 1 can be expressed as:


(A-3)          1,,,, — Y,, = r,.C_ + nC,,, — (C1,1 — C1.) — p


 where r_C_ is the return on mobility investment, r,C,, is the return on the
 investment in the last period of the jth job, (C1.1,, — C,,,) is the change in
 investment costs and the last term is the loss in returns on specific train-
 ing from the jth job. Since investment costs are likely to increase when a
job change occurs (see Bartel and Borjas, 1977b) and some portion (p) of
 training is specific, the observed change in earnings is likely to under-
estimate the returns on mobility investment.
