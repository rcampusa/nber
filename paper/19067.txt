The global crisis of 2008 raises many questions regarding the longterm response to crises. We know
that households that lost access to credit, for example, were forced to adjust and increase saving. But,
will households keep on saving more than they would have done otherwise had the global financial
crisis not occurred? And for how long will this increased saving persist? Here, we study the degree
to which past adverse income shocks increase the saving rates of affected households. We find evidence
consistent with historydependent dynamics: more experience of past crises tends to increase household
saving. We follow up with an investigation of the importance of historical exposure for current account
dynamics, but find no strong indication that our measure of past exposure is important to the current
account’s determination. We conclude by estimating the likely impact of the 2008 GFC on future saving.

1. Introduction

   The global financial crisis raises many intriguing questions regarding the long‐term

response of the economies impacted adversely by the crisis. Households that lost access

to credit, for example, were forced to adjust and increase saving. It is not clear,

however, whether that forced transition will last; will households remain higher savers

than they would have been had the global financial meltdown not occurred? For how

long will this increased saving last? Will it have any aggregate perceptible impact in the

decades to come?

   Here, we study the degree to which past catastrophic aggregate income shocks affect

the saving rates of households in impacted countries. Public discussions and cursory

observations frequently lead to speculation that painful past experience increases the

demand for precautionary saving, and widens the spread of ‘neither a borrower nor a

lender be’ attitudes; especially in the generation that grew up during the Great

Depression. Our results here are consistent with this history‐dependent dynamics; we

find evidence that the actual past occurrence of crises that were experienced by a given

population tends to increase the aggregate household saving rate. We follow up on

these findings with an investigation of the importance of historical exposure for current

account dynamics, but find no strong indication that our measure of past exposure is

important to the current account’s determination.

   Section 2 discusses the behavioral literature on tail events and the limited relevant

literature that ties this to economic magnitudes and dynamics; section 3 details our

construction of an index measuring past exposure, and section 4 focuses on the

empirical results. We close with a discussion of limitations, policy ramifications, and an

assessment of the potential long‐term impact of the recent global financial crisis.

2.   Literature on History and Saving Behavior

     The theory on the ways households react, in the long‐term, to adverse shocks does

not lead to clear‐cut predictions. Two important questions are of special relevance:

whether previous shocks (adverse fat‐tail events) have any impact on the households’

perceptions of the future probability of these events occurring, and whether the

households then translate this perceived probability into a rational expectations

framework or through a probability weighting function that places additional weight on

low probability events.1 The ‘cumulative prospect theory’ of Tversky and Kahenman

(1992) posits that it will be the extreme events (fat‐tails) that will change preferences

not because they will shift the underlying assigned probabilities, but because the

probability weighting function places more weight on these. Importantly, in earlier work

Tversky and Kahenman (1974) argue that the assignment of probabilities is dependent

on ‘availability heuristics’, whereby the likelihood of an event is assessed based on a

person’s ability to recall past instances of this event occurring.

     Here, we are not able to distinguish whether the patterns we observe below, in the

aggregate data, are a result of ‘availability heuristics’ changing the assigned likelihood of

low‐probability fat‐tail events, or whether the experience of past events changes the

probability weighting function, by placing higher weight on these low‐probability events.

In any case, we argue that an income shock that occurred decades ago is important in

beliefs into preferences.

                                                    3
that it will lead to, ceteris paribus, to a higher saving rate in either framework (whether

the event changed the probability assessment or the probability weighting function.2

    The more general literature on uncertainty and saving behavior is extensive, with

early theoretical contributions by, for example, Levhari and Srinivasan (1969) and

Sandmo (1970).3 At the aggregate macroeconomic level, a spate of recent papers

starting from Barro (2006), has looked at various implications of the probability of large

catastrophic income shocks to macroeconomic variables, with a particular emphasis on

pricing in asset markets.4 More recently, Gurio (2012) shows how, in a real business

cycle framework, a shift in disaster risk can change macroeconomic dynamics and lead

to business cycles that are not related to shifts in productivity. An increase in disaster

risk, in his model, leads to more precautionary saving and a movement toward safer

assets, and ultimately to declines in employment and income. In Nakamura et al. (2013),

the persistence of the income shock leads households to increase saving for a longer

period of time; and this increased saving dampen the effect of the shock on asset prices.

These last two papers, however, while focusing on disaster risk, posit different

mechanisms than the one we propose. In their model, it is the persistence of the

probability itself, or of the income shock, that generates prolonged impacts. In our case,

we are focusing on disasters that have occurred decades earlier. We argue that it is the

individuals assessed probabilities (driven by ‘availability heuristics’) or their probability




2
  Russett and Slemrod (1993) raise an intriguing possibility. In their work, the perception of an
increased likelihood of a future catastrophe (Nuclear Armageddon), actually lowers the propensity to
save for individuals (as the survival probability is assessed to be lower). Income shocks in high‐income
countries have not been associated with a major increase in mortality since 1945, so we hypothesize
that this causal link most likely does not apply for our investigation.

weighting functions that have changed as a result of the direct experience of these

historical shocks, and not the underlying risk itself.

    Previous empirical research on the determinants of saving behavior focuses almost

exclusively at the household level, but these do not examine the importance of long‐

past shocks in determining saving behaviour.5 Given our interest in the importance of

aggregate country‐level historical experiences and the implications for macroeconomic

dynamics, we prefer to investigate this using countrywide data. Recent evidence also

suggests that individuals respond to peer pressure in making financial decision, so that

our aggregate macro approach may also be more relevant than a micro/household one

as it allows us to account for these peer effects.

    Several recent papers have shown that personal experiences matter for individuals

when making other types of financial decisions. Malmendier and Nagel (2011 and 2014)

examined the impact of exposure to a history of stock‐market returns on household

actual risk‐taking in investment, and the impact of inflation experience on the formation

of expectations of future inflation, respectively; while Malmendier et al. (2011)

investigated the impact of the Great Depression on the behavior of Chief Executive

Officers who grew up in the 1930s. In all these papers, the results emphasized the

importance of long‐ago life experiences in shaping current economic decision‐making.

Similarly, Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2014) show that people’s beliefs regarding the




5
  The literature on the determinants of saving behavior at the micro level (for households or
individuals) is much too extensive for us to discuss here. A few projects examine aggregate macro‐
economic data at the local/regional level within a country (e.g., Horioka and Wan, 2007, is an
investigation of Chinese saving rates at the provincial level).

                                                  5
merits of individual efforts and government interventions are affected by exposure to

recessions over their lifetime.6, 7

     We hypothesize that past large and adverse income shocks are empirically important

in determining current saving behavior and that this effect is important enough to be

observable in the aggregate data. We examine this by constructing an index that

measures the past exposure to ‘income catastrophes’ across the generations living in

recent times and examine whether this index is correlated with concurrent domestic

saving. We are not aware of any investigation of this question by other authors, nor of

any work that used an index similar to ours—a demographically‐weighted measure of

past exposure to aggregate income shocks.



3.   The Data

     In order to examine the possibility that the historical experience of income shocks

affect present behavior we need to construct an ‘exposure to income catastrophes’

index (henceforth EIC index) for every country and time observation in our dataset. The

EIC index is essentially constructed from country‐wide demographic data on the size of

each cohort and the history of each cohort’s exposure to catastrophic recessions since

birth.




6
  Instead of relying on market‐wide exposure, Kaustia and Knüpfer (2008) and Choi et al. (2009) show
that individuals’ past experiences with investment decisions affects their consequent investment
decision‐making.
7
  Schrooten and Stephan (2005) observe that saving rates increased significantly in the 1990s in the
transition countries, following a few years of dramatic economic decline (and declining saving rates).
While they examine different reasons for that, our hypothesis seems consistent with this observation.
Households increased their saving after they were exposed to significant negative economic shocks,
and this effect degenerates over time. Similarly, Mody et al. (2012) observation of a large increase in
saving following the 2008 global financial crisis, and their examination of its dependence on labor
market uncertainty, is also consistent with our premise.

                                                   6
    Since the EIC index does not change much annually (neither the population

demographics nor the historical record changes that rapidly), we construct our dataset

in 5‐year gaps. As saving data is typically available reliably only from the early 1980s, we

calculate the index for 7 observations per country (for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000,

2005, 2010, and 2015). Because of the Global Financial Crisis starting in 2008, we

decided to exclude the last two observations (for 2006‐2010, and 2011‐2015) from the

empirical estimations. Regression results including the GFC observations are available in

an appendix.

    We construct five alternatives of our EIC index. However, the five alternatives were

closely correlated, and statistical results very similar, so we present here only the results

for the benchmark index (see Aizenman and Noy, 2013b for more detail). The other four

versions are described in the appendix.



3.1.     The historical shocks: Constructing the EIC index

       The Barro and Ursua (2012) dataset includes annual income per capita and

consumption data for a large set of countries going back to the 19th century. Most of this

data was collected from national sources. Following their own work, we define a

catastrophic shock as a time period in which the cumulative decline in per capita income

(peak to trough) was larger than 10 percentage points. For our sample of high‐income

countries, the most frequent occurrences of these catastrophic shocks are around the

times of both World Wars, with some countries experiencing very dramatic declines in

per capita incomes.8 The last catastrophic shock (until the recent GFC) was experienced



8
 Belgium, for example, experiences a 47% decline associated with WWI, while Germany experienced a
73% at the end of WWII.

                                               7
by Finland in the early 1990s, after a long period starting in the 1960s in which no

country in our dataset experienced a catastrophic income shock. We only examine these

catastrophic shocks, rather than the annual fluctuations in incomes as determinants of

saving, as we hypothesize that it is only these dramatic shocks that have a long‐lasting

effect on saving behavior.9

    We next examine the exposure of a typical person from each age group in each

country (for all age groups between 25 and 80 in five year gaps). A typical 30 year old in

1985, for example, was exposed to all crises occurring in her country starting in 1955.

We calculate a weighted average of her exposure; with linearly declining weights. Our

choice to use linearly declining weights with zero weight at birth is based on

Malmendier and Nagel (2011).

    Malmendier and Nagel (2011) experimented with several functional forms for the

weights and concluded that linearly declining weights fit their dataset better than most

non‐linear alternatives.10 Thus, for a person born in year s, is of age (t‐s) at time t. For

her, the weight for a shock she experienced at time f is w(t‐s,f), and is defined by the

following three conditions:

∑                ,        1

         ,                    ,   1,                    0      for all s‐1 < f ≤t

         ,      1     0

The first equation imposes the condition that weights sum up to 1, the second that the

difference between the weight on a shock in a fixed period (f) and the period before



9
  This corresponds to the ‘availability heuristics’ mentioned earlier and the vividness of the memory of
dramatic adverse events.
10
   Their work admittedly did not consider memory of past income shocks, but of stock market
volatility, but theirs is the closest attempt to ours at constructing a historical exposure index.

                                                   8
that (f‐1) is constant for a person of a certain age cohort (t‐s), as long as that person was

alive at time f. The last condition specifies that the weights will linearly decline to zero at

the last period before birth (period s‐1).11

     Figure 1 describes the weights for people of several age groups (30 through to 70);

as can be seen from the graph, the assumption of linear weights implies that young

people put significantly more weight on the recent past, and they do not place any

importance to anything that happened before their birth while an older person will put

significantly less weight on the recent past and will have a significantly longer backward

horizon going back to her birth (the slope of their declining weight would be much

smaller in absolute terms).

     Once we have calculated the (weighted) average exposure of a representative

person from each age group/cohort, we use demographic data to calculate the

(weighted) average of the exposure of the saving‐age population.12 We collected data

on the demographic composition of each country during the time period of interest

(1981‐2015).13 The demographic data is available from the World Development

Indicators for 5‐year cohorts, and we collect the data for all people aged over 25.

     The weighted average of the EIC index for 2005 in New Zealand, for example, is thus

the calculated exposure for each cohort living in 2005 as described above, weighted by

their number in the overall living population of people aged over 25.

     1        5    log ∑               ,   ∑          , ,                                        (1)



11
   In the Malmendier and Nagel (2011) notation, we assume       1 in their equation (1), page 383.
12
   With constant population shares, and no new shock events, the index will decline linearly as do the
individual weights. However, population shares are not constant over this time period (25 years), and
the differing population share compositions for each country make the index decline at different rates
for different countries.
13
   Given that the demographic composition changes only very slowly, we collected this data in five‐
year gaps (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010).

                                                  9
   The New Zealand index for the year 2005 (t=2005) is constructed for each cohort (s)

size as share of the national population       ,   , the magnitude of the reduction in per

capita income for each catastrophic income shock in the historical record         , and the

weights          ,   constructed as described above. For the 2005 index for New

Zealand we used information about New Zealand income shocks going back to 1925; to

account for the experience of those people who were born in the cohort of 1925‐1929.

Similarly to the New Zealand index for 2005 described above, we calculate the index, for

New Zealand, for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2010 and 2015; the index for 1985,

in this case, used the catastrophic shocks data going back to 1905 to account for the

experience of those born in the cohort of 1905‐1909. We calculate similarly the index

for the other countries in our sample.

   Overall, we have data for 23 high‐income countries; the constraint on the list of high‐

income countries included is the availability of information about past recessions going

back to 1905. In the final section, we describe a more recent observation of the index

for 2010 and 2015, in an attempt to evaluate the likely impact of the 2008 global

financial crisis on current and future saving behavior.



3.2.   Alternative versions of the EIC index

   In order to verify the robustness of any results we present, and since there is no

precedent or a previously used alternative to our EIC measure, we proceeded with

several different ways to construct our EIC index. All of these variants of the index are

constructed from demographic data and the history of past exposure to income shocks

described earlier, and each cohort’s exposure to income shocks is calculated as a

weighted average of its history (linearly declining weights) and the overall population

                                           10
exposure is the weighted average of each cohort’s exposure (weighted by the cohort’s

share of the population).

    In a second version of this index, we remove the log transformation from the

benchmark index:           2          5           1   . In the third alternative, we calculate the EIC

Index by using only the cohorts aged 40‐65 since these are the prime ‘saving’ cohorts:

       3      2    log ∑                  ,   ∑            , ,     . Our fourth and fifth

alternatives EIC indices are calculated by assuming a non‐linearity of the income

catastrophe’s impact (i.e., we use convex and concave functions of the measured per

capita income decline during the recession):

       4      2    log ∑                  ,   ∑            , ,                         (2)

       5      2    log ∑                  ,   ∑            , ,                         (3)

   The equations (2) and (3) variants are concave and convex transformations of the

crisis depth measure, respectively. For the concave transformation, we are

hypothesizing that the measurable depth of the downturn is less important than the

actual event occurring, and with the convex transformation we are examining whether

severe catastrophic collapses in incomes have a more pronounced effect on saving

behavior.



3.3.       Other Data

       In the regressions described below, we estimate the determinants of measures of

saving rates across countries.

SAV Tit   it   X it1   EICit                                            (4)




                                                      11
         T
where SAV it is the measure of saving we include as the dependent variable (always

included as share of GDP) for country i and time t (t=1985, 1990,…,2005). We estimate

private and household saving, and also examine government saving and total national

saving to provide additional confidence in our results (as we do not hypothesize a

similar connection between our EIC index and government policy determination).

Throughout, we report on the results for the first version of the index (equation 1), but

other versions are available on request. Details about these measures and their sources,

as well as details about the other variables included, are available in a data appendix.

   Papers most similar to ours in their empirical estimation of saving behavior at the

aggregate level are Loayza et al. (2000), Kinugasa and Mason (2007), Cavallo et al.

(2015) and Becerra et al. (2015). Kinugasa and Mason’s (2007) main interest is the

demographic determinants of national saving, so it is the least similar to ours. Loayza et

al. (2000) use a panel dataset of saving rates for 1965‐1994 and a very large sample of

countries to estimate their determinants. They pursue a reduced‐form approach that

attempts to identify broad regularities in the data rather than be wedded to a specific

theory of saving. In their view, the theoretical literature, as well as the micro‐empirical

literature, is not cohesive enough to suggest a specific structural specification that

would be empirically preferable. Becerra et al. (2015) pursue a similar approach, while

attempting to estimate the degree to which Latin American countries are under‐saving.

   Our main independent variable of interest is the EIC described in the previous

section, but we rely on Becerra et al.’s (2015) specifications and start with their list of

controls variables ( X it 1 ). Their work, however, focuses on an annual panel, so our 5‐

year panel of high‐income countries yields somewhat different results. After an initial

estimation without the EIC index (results provided in appendix table A3), we include the

                                            12
index and then narrow down the list of controls progressively using a statistical

significance criterion. The decision to pursue this algorithm is aimed at increasing the

number of observations in our estimated models. Our list of variables includes:

population under the age of 14 (% of total), population over the age of 65 (% of total), a

government stability index, law‐and‐order index, bureaucratic quality index, housing

bubble indicator, average per capita GDP growth in previous five years, average GDP in

previous five years, currency crisis in past five years (binary), stock market crash in past

five years, a corruption index, average years of schooling (in total population), insurance

coverage (premiums as % of GDP), and the unemployment rate.



4.      Description of the Index

     We first examine some of the properties of the index we constructed. Figure 2

includes a detailed comparison of the index, calculated for the year 2005, for all the

countries in our sample. Finland has the highest index for 2005; this is wholly

determined by the fact that it is the only country in the dataset that had an income crisis

of sufficient magnitude in recent times, so that all adults living in 2005 were exposed to

it. Most other countries in the group we examine had not had a significant enough

income catastrophe since the aftermath of the Second World War.

     Germany has the second highest index, given its exposure to very catastrophic

declines in income in the interwar period and most notably around the end of the war in

1945. Singapore also has a high index, as it experienced large income shocks later than

most high‐income countries (in the early 1960s). Canada, Portugal, Sweden and




                                            13
Switzerland have the lowest index measures in 2005; the English‐speaking countries

tend to have median readings of the index.14

     In the figures 3A‐3C, we document the evolution of the index, over the years 1981‐

2005, for the countries in our dataset. We distinguish between emerging high‐income

countries over this period (Korea, Greece, Iceland, Portugal, Singapore and Spain),

Continental Western Europe, and a group of English speaking countries (and Japan). In

most of these cases, the most noticeable observation is the consistent decline in the

measured index over this time period, the slope of this decline is different mostly

according to the demographic changes in these countries, and the exact historical

exposure record they have.

     The most obvious reason for this secular decline is that all these countries have not

experienced any dramatic negative shocks to per capita income (more than 10%) since

the beginning of the sample in 1980 (excluding Finland), and as the memory of the

earlier shocks receded, so does the measured index. An earlier version of the paper,

Aizenman and Noy (2013b), includes some bi‐variate correlations of the EIC index and

saving behavior. In this bi‐variate investigation, we also examined the correlation

between the index and international saving (the current account). However, since there

does not appear to be correlation between the two, we do not report any further results

on the current account.



5.      Regression Results


14
  In a companion paper that looks at the recent global financial crisis, we point out that many
countries that have experiences the recent banking crisis most severely have index measures that are
close to the median (including the USA, UK, Greece, Iceland, and Spain). We speculate that lack of a
culture of thrift, related to fairly benign past experiences, is related to the asset bubbles that
appeared in these markets (Aizenman and Noy, 2013a).

                                                 14
       Appendix Table 3A reports the result of the initial regression specifications,

without the EIC index. While the number of observations is fairly limited when we

include all variables (because of missing observations), the predictive power of the

model is fairly good (R‐squared of 0.47‐0.58, and adjusted R‐squared of 0.32‐0.46), and

several of the variables appear to be statistically relevant. In order to increase the

number of observations, we narrow down the list of controls using a general‐to‐specific

procedure (progressively deleting variables with the least statistical significance).

       Our main results are described in Tables 1. In separate specifications, we

investigate the determinants of private saving (column 1), household saving (column 2),

government saving (column 3), and total saving (column 4). As we do not want our

results to be ‘contaminated’ by the events surrounding the GFC, we present our

benchmark specification only for 1980‐2005. Results including the full sample, including

the 2010 observations are included in Appendix Table 4A.

       For table 1 reporting on the determinants of private and household saving and

household saving, the variables whose coefficients are statistically different from zero,

also have plausible signs. Both the crisis variables that appear to matter, currency crises

and housing bubbles appear to have a positive impact on saving (recent experience of a

crisis leads to higher saving). Higher dependency ratios (of both the young and old)

decrease saving. Improved government stability and bureaucratic quality both appear to

increase the incentive to save (the higher numbers for these variables denote higher risk

in those areas); while corruption reduces saving. Higher per capita GDP growth rate

increases saving, though countries with higher average years of schooling appear to save

less. Overall, the predictive power of this model explaining private and household saving

across countries and across time, the adjusted R‐squared, is 0.35‐0.36.

                                           15
           The EIC index, in contrast always positive – i.e. increases past exposure to

income catastrophes increases saving. For private and household saving, the EIC index is

also statistically significant, usually at the 1% level. In real terms, the EIC index has a

larger coefficient for private sector saving rather than for household saving, but that

difference can also be because of the different samples (101 vs. 77 observations15).

More importantly, the real impact of the EIC index appears to be quite substantial, with

a one standard deviation (0.71 units) increase in the index associated with an increase of

about 2.4 (1.9) percentage points increase in private sector (household) saving,

respectively.

           The results for government saving are consistently, for all specifications, not

statistically significant, and the coefficient estimate is very small. The estimate for total

saving in the economy shows smaller coefficients than for private and household saving,

and reduced statistical significance. This is not surprising given the results reported in

column 3 for public sector saving.



       6. Saving after the Global Financial Crisis and beyond

       We documented that households respond to past shocks by increasing their saving

rates, and that this effect is long‐lasting; countries whose households experienced large

adverse shocks in the past (even the distant past) have higher household saving rates.

Public saving, in contrast, appears to be less responsive and may be compensating for

higher household saving with larger deficits. As a result, we observe no impact of this

past exposure on the current account. We document these relationships for high‐

income countries, and leave an investigation of the impact of past shocks on household

and public saving in emerging markets for when better data may become available.

    A better understanding of the effects we describe may require some insights into

households’ expectations regarding the viability and credibility of public safety nets and

their ability to cushion against large income shocks. Our findings also raise important

questions about the unintended consequences of policies that aim to assist households

in dealing with adverse macroeconomic environments. Without the exposure to the

discipline imposed by shocks, households precautionary saving may be insufficient.16

After all, a pervasive concern in almost all high income countries is that saving rates do

not reflect the demographic trends that lead to much longer life in retirement and

changes in the aggregate dependency ratios that will place gradually increasing strains

on public finances.

    The dynamic impacts we document are bound to play important roles in the coming

decades given the unprecedented nature of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). Table

2 documents one possible measure of the cumulative output loss in the aftermath of

the GFC in the countries in our sample.17 Given the global nature of this event, all

countries experienced some loss with the highest loss and the most prolonged

downturn recorded for Greece (25.0%). Barro and Ursua use a threshold of 10% decline

in income per capita to denote a catastrophic shock, and we have followed them in the

empirical work that this paper presented above. However, only Greece has experienced




16
   This comment does not imply we view this cushioning as a policy mistake. It, however, may suggest
that governments should find ways to increase saving rates with the realization that the low rates are
to a certain extent a function of public safety nets.
17
   For alternative ways to measure the GDP declines associated with a crisis/recession, see Hutchison
et al. (2010).

                                                  17
such a catastrophic shock in the recent GFC, and given the benign nature of the last few

decades, we decided to use a somewhat lower threshold of 8%.18

     Figure 4 describes the evolution of the EIC index for the four countries that have

experienced a cumulative decline of at least 8% in per capita income. Clearly, all

experienced a significant increase in their exposure index, with the most notable

increase for Iceland and Spain; both of which had low previous index level, but

experienced a significant income catastrophe during the initial years of the GFC. In

contrast, Finland’s significant GFC contraction resulted in the mildest GFC‐related

increase, as it already had experienced an earlier increase associated with its early

1990s crisis.

     Table 3 records the expected impact of the increase in the exposure (EIC) index on

household saving that we project given our empirical results. Finland, Greece, Iceland

and Spain are all projected to see increases in their private saving rates. Finland is only

projected to have a small increase in the private saving rate, as the country already had

a high index pre‐GFC (as a consequence of the 1990s crisis). The other three, in contrast,

experienced a sharp increase in their EIC index as a result of the GFC, and consequently

are projected to increase saving by around 3 percentage points (of GDP) – see column 4

in table 3). In the last columns of table 3, we compare the projected increase in private

saving rates to the actual increase in this measure – the comparison is between the

average rate for 2001‐2005, and the most recent couple of years for which the data is

available (2013‐2014).




18
  The decision to use of lower thresholds only matters in so much as it allows us to include three
other countries in the results we report in table 3.

                                                  18
     We find an observed increase in household saving rates, that is materially very

similar to the one we project, for two countries, Iceland and Spain. Maybe somewhat

surprisingly, Finland has seen a decline in its private saving rate post GFC, even though

our model predicts a very small increase. The largest deviation is observed in Greece,

where all the data indicates the shock is still clearly (and painfully) ongoing.19 In spite of

a dramatic decline in incomes, and probably because this decline is so large, the Greeks

have not increased their private saving, and have actually decreased it quite

significantly.

         None of these countries, however, is systematically important to the world

economy and therefore to the imbalances in global saving that have persisted even in

the aftermath of the GFC. None of the three largest economies—the US, Japan, and

China—has experienced as large a catastrophic shock as the ones we have focused on in

this paper. It is possible, however, that at least in the case of the US, the shock was

drastic enough to engender long term changes in private and households saving rates.20

Yet, the distribution of the post‐GFC declines in incomes and consumption between US

households may have been such that higher‐income households that provide much of

the saving were less affected. This implies that the crisis would therefore not lead to

very big changes in aggregate household saving behavior.




19
   We write this a few hours after the Greeks voted to reject the Troika’s bailout proposal, and
Greece’s future in the Euro zone looks very uncertain.
20
   This is especially true if the experienced shock is evaluated against the more recent history, rather
than in its absolute magnitude. The GFC recession in the US, after all, is by some metrics the most
severe since the Great Depression.

The table describes the cumulative per capita income decline experienced during the global financial
crisis in the countries in our sample. The decline is calculated as the cumulative reduction in per capita
GDP growth from the peak years trough the crisis experienced in each country. For most, the trough
was in 2009, with the exception of New Zealand, that experienced a briefer one year decline and
Greece whose decline appears to be continuing. GDP growth data is from the Word Development
Indicators (NY.GDP.PCAP.KD).

The table describes the projected impact on the average saving rate/GDP ratio for the five years
following the GFC (2005 to 2015) for the four countries in our sample whose per capita output loss
during the global financial crises exceeded 8%. The actual change in household saving is calculated
as the difference between the average private saving rate in the most recent two years available
(2013‐2014) and the pre‐GFC average for the period of 2001‐2005. The Gross Private Saving rate is
calculated as gross national saving rate minus the government net borrowing, taken from the IMF’s
World Economic Outlook database (April 2015 version).
