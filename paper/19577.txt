                                              ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to convince the reader that the Continental dollar was a zero-interest bearer
bond and not a fiat currency—thereby overturning 230 years of scholarly interpretation; to show that
the public and leading Americans knew and acted on this fact, and to illustrate the ideal performance
of the Continental dollar as a zero-interest bearer bond. The purpose of establishing the ideal performance
is to create a benchmark against which empirical measures of depreciation can be evaluated in future
papers.

    The Continental Dollar: How the American Revolution was
Financed with Paper Money—Initial Design and Ideal Performance

                                              Farley Grubb

           On the commencement of the late revolution, Congress had no money. The external
           commerce of the states being suppressed, the farmer could not sell his produce, and of
           course could not pay a tax. Congress had no resource then but in paper money. Not being
           able to lay a tax for it’s redemption they could only promise that taxes should be laid for
           that purpose so as to redeem the bills by a certain day.
                                                                 Thomas Jefferson, Jan.-Feb., 17861


           The purpose of this paper is to convince the reader that the Continental dollar was a zero-

interest bearer bond and not a fiat currency—thereby overturning 230 years of scholarly

interpretation; to show that the public and leading Americans knew and acted on this fact, and to

illustrate the ideal performance of the Continental dollar as a zero-interest bearer bond. The

purpose of establishing the ideal performance is to create a benchmark against which empirical

measures of depreciation can be evaluated in future papers.

                                                .....
           In a series of resolutions from 22 June through 26 December 1775, Congress determined

the quantity, nominal value, denominational spacing, and redemption method for the first two

emissions of Continental dollars. Congress maintained this structural design in all subsequent

emissions, changing only the quantity emitted and denominational spacing, see Table 3.1.

Separate emissions are identified by the dates printed on the bills (see Newman 2008, pp. 37, 63-

73). In total, there were 11 emissions. The dates on the bills allowed the public to distinguish

between emissions and identify the corresponding congressional redemption instructions for each

emission. Congressional debates were closed to the public and the delegates were placed “under

the Continental dollars as the 2 January 1779 resolution specified would entail raising the annual payments over the
18 year period (1780 to 1797) from $6,000,000 to $10,277,222. See also note d. This number is net of some
undetermined amount of Continental dollar remittances received from the states after 1779 that the resolution
allowed to be re-spent to pay off loan office certificate principal and interest incurred before 1780. Total state
remittances after 1779, therefore, had to be somewhat higher than $10,277,222 per year to account for permanently
removing these re-spent Continental dollars from circulation.

           On 25 July 1775, Congress ordered $1,000,000 struck in $30 bills (JCC v. 2, p. 207). This is not possible.
Either $999,990 or $1,000,020 can be struck, but not $1,000,000. Which was done and whether other denominations
of emission #1 were adjusted to accommodate the $1,000,000 target in $30 bills is not known. Because no change in
the $1,000,000 total authorized was ever noted by Congress or the Board of Treasury, it is assumed that the
discrepancy was made up by adjusting the printing of bills of other denominations from this emission, thus yielding
the reported total here of $199,989,995. However, the total cumulative net new emissions could vary between
$199,989,985 and $199,990,015 depending how Congress resolved its order to emit $1,000,000 in $30 bills on 25
July 1775—an outcome that is currently unknown.


the strongest obligation of honor” to keep such secret. Why congressmen structured the

Continental dollar the way they did, therefore, must be deduced primarily from their actions.2

         The face value of a Continental dollar was set equal to a Spanish silver dollar—so

indicated on the face of each bill (see Newman 2008, pp. 37, 63-73). For the first emission, the

initial three million—those with the date May 10, 1775 printed on the bills, Congress passed

redemption instructions on 29 July 1775. States were to remit fixed quotas of Continental dollars

to the Continental Treasury to be burned. Each state’s quota was roughly proportional to its

respective population share in the union. Congress explicitly left each state free to decide how

best to redeem Continental dollars from the citizens within its jurisdiction. State remittances to

the Continental Treasury were to be in four equal yearly installments spread over a contiguous

four-year period, beginning on 30 November 1779 and ending on 30 November 1782. No

contemporaneous taxes or other debts payable to the states in these Continental dollars were

required before the redemption years indicated. No state was required to remit more than its

quota, and Continental dollars paid no interest. States with a quota deficiency of Continental

dollars were to make it up in specie at face value. The Continental treasurer was to retain this

congressmen reveal little (Bolles 1884, v. 1, p. 27; Smith 1976, v. 1-2).

                                                                                                                     4
specie and advertise its availability. Citizens with Continental dollars in states that had filled

their quotas and had ceased redeeming Continental dollars could redeem them at face value for

specie directly from the Continental Treasury, in effect claiming the specie remitted by the states

with a quota deficiency of Continental dollars.3

           The adoption of this last provision indicated that Congress anticipated that by 1779, when

state redemption of Continental dollars would commence, a geographic imbalance of Continental

dollars relative to state redemption quotas would exist. The exigency of war would cause paper

money spent on troops and supplies to be concentrated in the theaters of war. These theaters

were unlikely to be spread evenly among the states per their population shares in the union.

Congress provided an ingenious solution to the anticipated geographic imbalance in the location

of Continental dollars that rebalanced the availability of these dollars with state quota claims.

This rebalancing was necessary to insure fairness and stem jealousies among the states regarding

who would shoulder the financial burden of the war. This provision also anchored the value of a

Continental dollar to its face value in specie at the specific future date set for its redemption.

           Before the Revolution, colonies had employed this same method for rebalancing paper

money redemption requirements within their respective colonies. When a colony emitted paper

money, it also set future taxes to redeem and remove that paper money from circulation. Upon

redemption, the paper money would be destroyed. Colonial assemblies realized that future tax

burdens to retire the paper money and the possession of that paper money among its subjects

would not be perfectly synchronized. The transaction costs of trading paper money among a

colony’s subjects to perfectly realign each subject’s possession of paper money with that

subject’s tax obligations by the time taxes were due were burdensome and fraught with potential

                                                                                                     5
hold-ups and leveraged rent-seeking of one subject against another.

        Colonial assemblies solved this problem by allowing subjects to pay their taxes either in

the colony’s paper money or in some other medium, such as in grain or specie at a fixed rate to

the colony’s paper money. Subjects that did not have, or could not acquire in time, the colony’s

paper money, paid their taxes in these other media. Subjects that had more paper money than

they owed in taxes could then directly cash in their excess balances of paper money at the

colony’s treasury for the grain or specie paid by the subjects who did not have the paper money

to pay their taxes. Because final paper-money-redemption taxes were set equal to the quantity of

paper money emitted, this method perfectly rebalanced tax obligations and paper money claims

among the colony’s subjects.4 As such, the specie redemption option in the Continental dollar

resolutions, namely the provision that allowed citizens in states where redemption quotas were

already filled to cash in their excess Continental dollars at the Continental Treasury for their face

value in specie thereby claiming the specie paid in by states with a deficient amount of

Continental dollars, would have been familiar to Americans. Its presence, design, and purpose in

these Continental dollar resolutions were likely expected and understood by the public.

        Congress placed the redemption of the first emission four to seven years into the future

because that was when the war was expected to be over. For example, Silas Deane, congressman

from Connecticut, wrote 1 July 1775, “The Warr will not last Seven Years if I have any

Judgment in Matters.”5 At that point, trade would resume and generate the income necessary to

pay the taxes needed to redeem Continental dollars at face value in specie. Most congressmen

understood that the United Colonies were rich in assets, e.g. possessing abundant land, slaves,

oxen, etc., but poor in cash. Specie to pay taxes rested on foreign trade—Americans selling their

produce to foreigners for specie. This trade was disrupted by war via import and export

embargos imposed by Congress and the British blockade of foreign trade. Congress opened

American ports to non-British trade on 6 April 1776.6 This trade disruption also meant that the

ability to acquire specie to pay interest to the holders of Continental dollars in the interim before

redemption was in doubt. As such, being unable to make interest payments certain, no interest

payments were attached to the Continental dollar in Congress’ redemption resolutions.

         For the second emission, the next three million—those with the date November 29, 1775

printed on the bills, Congress passed redemption instructions on 26 December 1775. These

instructions were identical to those for the first emission, except that the four-year redemption

window was explicitly voted to be moved forward to begin after the last of the first emission was

redeemed, namely to begin on 30 November 1783 and end on 30 November 1786.7 Richard

Smith, congressman from New Jersey, wrote in his diary on 23 December 1775 that “[James]

Duane [congressman from New York] gave in a Sett of Resolves for Sinking the last 3 Millions

of Dollars, similar to those of the former 3 Millions & to be sunk in the same Years. They were

all agreed to except the Time of Sinking which required further consideration.” That further

consideration was taken up three days later. Smith wrote in his diary on 26 December 1775,

“Duanes Proposition for sinking the last 3 Million of Dollars were gone thro, the Vote was taken

Whether that Money shall be sunk in the Years 1779, 1780, 1781 & 1782 as the last 3 Million, or

in the Years 1783, 1784, 1785 & 1786 and carried for the latter.”8

        This vote is important because it shows that the selection of a redemption window was

not an afterthought or just some resolution boilerplate. It was a significant choice based on

serious deliberations among alternatives. It was an issue that mattered. This vote established that

redemption windows would be emission specific and created a precedent that would govern how

expectations would be formed for forecasting the redemption of future emissions. It also

provides insight into what motivated the particular structural design of the Continental dollar

adopted by Congress.

        The redemption of the first emission of Continental dollars amounted to $750,000 per

year, which implied an average tax per white-capita per year of $0.33. In the 13 colonies

between 1770 and 1774, the average tax per white-capita per year for all taxes was $0.41.9

Spreading the redemption of the first emission over a contiguous four years in order to lower per

white-capita per year taxes to historically acceptable and feasible levels is the only sensible

explanation for adopting a multi-year redemption window.

        In general, multi-year redemption windows were problematic. They caused uncertainty in

the realized values of Continental dollars from the same emission. While the average or expected

value of a Continental dollar from the first emission can be estimated given the four-year span of

the redemption window, not knowing which specific Continental dollar would be redeemed in

1779 and which in 1782 meant that the realized value of a Continental dollar varied around that

average by the waiting cost spanned by the redemption window. If citizens could determine

                                                                                                                      8
which dollar would be redeemed in which year, they would be willing in 1775 to pay more for a

dollar redeemed in 1779 than for one redeemed in 1782. When visually identical dollar bills are

not necessarily of equal present value, this makes for a cumbersome medium of exchange.

       As such, the only reason to have a four-year redemption window for the first emission

rather than a one-year redemption point was to hold per year per white-capita redemption taxes

within historically acceptable and feasible limits. If redemption was not fiscally credible, the

system would collapse as citizens would doubt that their dollars would be redeemed at face value

as promised. In setting the redemption structure of the first emission, Congress made a tradeoff

between fiscal credibility and ease-of-use as a medium of exchange, siding with fiscal

credibility. As long as the redemption window for a given emission was relatively short, the

variance in the realized value of Continental dollars from that emission would only be a minor

inconvenience. This interpretation plays through the second emission and makes sense of the

vote over the redemption window for that emission.

       Duane’s proposal to redeem the second emission in the same time window as the first

emission would have doubled the redemption quotas for 1779 through 1782. This in turn would

have doubled the taxes each state would have to impose on its citizens to an average tax per year

per white-capita of $0.66, or 61 percent above that for all taxes raised per year per white-capita

in the years preceding the Revolution. A tax level well above the historically acceptable and

feasible range would threaten the fiscal credibility of the system and risk precipitating its

collapse. When Congress voted to push the redemption of the second emission into a four-year

redemption window that started immediately after the last redemption year of the first emission,

they were voting to keep the per year per white-capita tax level constant at $0.33 for redeeming

both emissions, and thus voting to maintain the system’s fiscal credibility.



                                                                                                     9
       Adopting Duane’s proposal would have had one good consequence. By having both the

first and second emissions redeemed in the same four-year window, Duane’s proposal would

have caused the expected value of a Continental dollar to be the same regardless of emission, i.e.

regardless of the date on the bill. Emissions would be fully fungible. Using Continental dollars as

a medium of exchange would be easier under Duane’s proposal because the expected value of

Continental dollars at any point in time would not differ by emission. The realized values of

Continental dollars of both emissions would still be subject to the same variance around a

common average as discussed above, but that would be a minor inconvenience compared with

values varying between emissions.

       When Congress rejected Duane’s proposal in favor of different redemption windows per

emission, they were explicitly accepting that Continental dollars from different emissions at the

same point in time would have different expected values. In 1775, having a Continental dollar

that would be paid off in specie at face value in 1779 was more valuable than having one that

would be paid off in specie at face value in 1786. Not only was there some minor variance in the

realized values of Continental dollars per each emission around the average for that emission, but

now at any point in time there was a difference in the expected value of a Continental dollar

between emissions. The expected value of a Continental dollar was now contingent on the date

printed on the bill. This outcome added to the cumbersomeness of using Continental dollars as a

medium of exchange. Again, the only sensible explanation for why Congress voted for this

redemption structure was that they were making a tradeoff between holding per year per white-

capita taxes within historically acceptable and feasible limits thus giving the system fiscal

credibility, and making Continental dollars an easily tradable or fungible medium of exchange.

Again, they sided with fiscal credibility.



                                                                                                 10
        This choice foreshadows a continuing conflict that by 1779 was won by those

congressmen, like Duane, who did not understand the need for fiscal credibility or who believed

that current tax levels could be pushed substantially above what had been historically

experienced without doing harm. These congressmen either did not see a connection between the

fiscal credibility of redemption and the value of the Continental dollar or were willing to

sacrifice that connection for other political and economic goals. They gravitated toward

reinterpreting the Continental dollar as a pure fiat currency, despite its documented structural

design, and viewed the Continental dollar’s value as being determined primarily by a naïve

interpretation of Hume’s quantity theory of money.

        Continuing with the analysis of the structural design of the initial emissions of

Continental dollars, on 23 November 1775 Congress appointed an ad hoc committee on paper

money. Richard Smith wrote in his diary on 11 January 1776, “A Report from the Comee. on the

Paper Currency was ably argued for 4 Hours, the Report recommended that the present 6

Millions of Dollars be called in and large Notes issued to that Amount bearing Interest... ”10

Again, Smith’s comments show that Congress debated the structural design of the Continental

dollar at length. The choices made were not afterthoughts or just resolution boilerplate. They

were based on serious deliberations among alternatives. Having the Continental dollar pay yearly

interest between emission and redemption was one such alternative design. This proposal was

made, debated upon, and not adopted. Most likely the majority of congressmen saw the paying of

yearly interest as impractical given the absence of wartime tax revenue with which to pay

interest. The Continental dollar would remain a zero-interest bearer bond with defined future

specie payoff dates.

          Richard Smith’s influence on the initial structural design of the Continental dollar may go

deeper than just diary observations. He was present for all congressional paper money

deliberations from 10 May 1775 to 30 March 1776. He would be appointed by Congress to a

standing committee created on 17 February 1776 for superintending the treasury and overseeing

the emission of Continental dollars.11 Among the documents and letters that have survived, he

was the only congressman to note the congressional debates on redemption windows and interest

payments for the first two emissions. Smith’s brother, Samuel Smith, was New Jersey State

Treasurer, and Richard left Congress on 30 March 1776 to succeed his brother, who had died, as

New Jersey State Treasurer. Richard Smith’s public finance expertise and intimate knowledge of

colonial New Jersey’s paper money system may have influenced the congressional debates that

crafted the initial structural design of the Continental dollar.

          The Continental dollar and the colonial New Jersey paper pound shared many unique

circumstances and design features. Colonial New Jersey’s last emission of paper money was

during a war, namely the French and Indian War, 1755-1764. The redemption of these wartime

emissions was designed to take place well after the war had ended. The Continental dollar was

emitted under similar wartime circumstances with the same post-war redemption intention. Both

the Continental dollar and the colonial New Jersey pound had their specie value printed on the

face of each bill, see Figure 3.1 and compare it with Newman (2008, pp. 37, 63-73). Most

colonial paper monies did not have this feature.12 Both the Continental dollar and the colonial

New Jersey pound paid no interest. Both had explicit redemption dates set well into the future

and spread out to hold per year per-white capita taxes within fiscally feasible limits.

          Notes: “Plate” refers to silver (specie). 20 penny-weight, of 24 grains each, equals one troy ounce of silver

          of silver, or 0.3429 New Jersey pounds equals one ounce of silver, at face value. One pound sterling equals
          3.8715 ounces of silver, or one ounce of silver equals 0.2583 pounds sterling. Therefore, by equating both
          to one ounce of silver, 0.3429 New Jersey pounds at face value equals 0.2583 pounds sterling, or 1.3275
          New Jersey pound at face value equals one pound sterling. See McCusker (1978, pp. 8-10).


          Each year the French and Indian War continued, New Jersey emitted more bills of credit

to meet unexpected war expenses until by 1764 a total of 347,500 New Jersey pounds,

approximately $1,189,944, in new bills had been emitted, see Table 3.2. This was over 2.5 times

the amount New Jersey had emitted over its entire prior history of issuing paper money (1709-

1754).13 Similarly, new emissions of Continental dollars would be required as long as the War

for Independence continued, with the total amount emitted rising to many times what would be

considered normal during peacetime. With each new wartime emission, the New Jersey

legislature established explicit redemption provisions (maturity dates) by fixing future tax

obligations to be paid in its bills. Bills redeemed via taxation were destroyed. The redemption

procedure chosen for the Continental dollar was similar to that used by colonial New Jersey.

        Finally, as the French and Indian War continued and emissions mounted, the New Jersey

legislature deliberately spread the redemption of its wartime emissions evenly over a 27-year

time horizon, from 1757 through 1783, see Table 3.2. For the sequence of new emissions from

1755 through mid-1758 and from 1762 through 1764, the New Jersey legislature deliberately

staggered their respective redemptions forward in time. In addition, most individual emissions

had a three- to six-year contiguous redemption window with per year redemption amounts held

constant within that window. For emissions from mid-1758 through 1761, the New Jersey

legislature deliberately placed the redemption windows for these emissions so as to even out per-

year redemptions for the entire amount of wartime emissions over the 27 year redemption time

horizon. In the end, between the last wartime emission in 1764 and 1773, redemption ended up

being exactly 12,500 and from 1774 to 1782 ended up being exactly 15,000 New Jersey pounds

per year. This put the average redemption tax per white-capita per year for New Jersey residents

between $0.37 and $0.45, close to the tax level for redeeming the first two emissions of

Continental dollars.14 This deliberate spreading of redemptions evenly over a long horizon held

per white-capita per year taxes within feasible limits, thus giving New Jersey’s commitment to

its paper money fiscal credibility.

        Like the redemption of the New Jersey pound, each emission of Continental dollars was

designed to have a different contiguous multi-year redemption window sequentially pushed

further into the future for each new emission. In addition, like the New Jersey pound, this

estimates. Currency conversions are taken from McCusker (1978, pp. 8-10). In face value, 1 £NJ (New Jersey pound)
= 2.9163 ounces of silver = 0.7533 £S (pounds sterling). This means that 1.3275 £NJ = 1£S = $4.5457 (Spanish silver
dollars). Therefore, 1 £NJ = $3.4243. See also the notes to Figure 3.1.

redemption structure was designed to hold taxes within fiscally feasible limits. In conclusion, the

circumstances of emission, the patterns of redemption, and the structural design of the

Continental dollar closely mimicked that of recent colonial New Jersey paper pounds.

          New Jersey successfully redeemed its bills at face value on time as legislatively

promised, until the Revolution intervened. Preliminary estimates show that the present value of

New Jersey’s paper money, time-discounted back from its designated redemption dates, closely

tracked its current specie exchange rate. These rates fluctuated between 55 and 85 percent of the

money’s face value.15 In other words, the New Jersey paper pound was a savings bond type

money where time-discounting explained almost all its current value, i.e. there was little

preference or unique liquidity premium to this paper money. It traded below face value not

because it had depreciated, but because it was a bond that paid no interest and would not be

redeemed at face value until sometime in the future, i.e. it was like a current U.S. savings bond,

except that it was transferable.

          The initial design of the Continental dollar was virtually identical to, and had all the

features of, the colonial New Jersey paper pound. As such, it was not totally new and would

likely be familiar and well understood by many Americans. The history of the colonial New

Jersey pound also provided a precedent for what Americans could expect regarding the future

performance and redemption structure of the Continental dollar. In particular, redemption at face

value would only start post-war, would be pushed successively into the future with each

subsequent emission, and would be spread over enough years to keep tax levels within

historically acceptable and feasible limits, thus giving the system fiscal credibility.

        THE CONTINENTAL DOLLAR WAS A ZERO-INTEREST BEARER BOND

         Congress’ legislated redemption instructions for the first two emissions indicate that

Continental dollars were designed to be zero-interest bearer bonds, not fiat currency. They

resembled today’s U.S. savings bonds more than today’s U.S. dollar bills, with the exception that

they were transferable. As such, the current par value of a Continental dollar was not its face

value, but its present value, namely its face value reduced by time-discounting from its fixed

future redemption (maturity) dates. This present value provides the benchmark against which

empirical measures of depreciation should be evaluated.

         Figure 3.2 illustrates the ideal present-value performance of the first two emissions of

Continental dollars, and shows the medium-of-exchange problems arising from its redemption

design. Values are discounted back continuously from the final redemption window at 6 percent

and expressed as a percentage of face value at each respective point in time.16 The ideal present-

value path assumes that redemption is viewed as credible or certain and that 6 percent represents

the opportunity cost or time-preference for such a certain payoff. The expected present value of a

Continental dollar starts well below its face value due to time-discounting, 72 and 57 percent of

face value in November of 1775 for dollars from emissions #1 and #2, respectively. From

November 1775, these values rise continuously, reaching face value by the last year of their

   On 17 January 1777, Robert Morris said that 6 percent was the opportunity cost of capital placed in private
securities (Smith 1980, v. 6, p. 117). Six percent was also the rate used by the national government for loans
between 1776 and 1790, and the most common rate mentioned throughout this period, see Barlow (2012, pp. 110,

respective redemption windows, 1782 and 1786 for emissions #1 and #2, respectively.

       Figure 3.2 illustrates the two tradeoffs (discussed above) that Congress made between the

fiscal credibility of redemption and the cumbersomeness of using Continental dollars as a

medium of exchange. For a given emission, a four-year rather than a one-year redemption

window increased the fiscal credibility of redemption, but at the cost of making a Continental

dollar from a given emission at any point in time have a range of realized values. For example, in

1777, not knowing if a particular Continental dollar from emission #1 would be redeemed in

1779 or in 1782 meant that the realized value of that Continental dollar discounted back from its

possible redemption dates ranged between 87 and 74 percent of face value. For a Continental

                                                                                                 18
dollar from emission #2 this range was between 70 and 58 percent of face value, see Figure 3.2.

These ranges made using Continental dollars as a medium of exchange cumbersome. When a

dollar is not necessarily equal in realized value to an identical-looking dollar at the same point in

time and space, trade becomes problematic, i.e. costlier than when a dollar is always equal to an

identical-looking dollar.

       If a citizen could not determine when any particular Continental dollar from a given

emission would be redeemed within its redemption window, the best guess of its present value at

any point in time would be the expected discounted value for that emission (the solid lines in

Figure 3.2). Given that citizens likely could not determine which dollar would be redeemed when

within its respective redemption window, the variance in realized values noted above may have

been considered only a minor inconvenience. As long as the redemption window for a given

emission was relatively short, trade could function relatively smoothly using the expected

present value of Continental dollars from the same emission.

       More problematic was Congress’ choice of staggered sequential redemption windows for

subsequent emissions. Congress spread the redemption of subsequent emissions successively

forward in time to maintain the fiscal credibility of redemption. By contrast, if Congress would

have chosen the proposed alternative of having all new emissions redeemed in the same

redemption window, the required redemption taxes would have been beyond historically feasible

and acceptable limits, making redemption doubtful. The tradeoff of not choosing this proposed

alternative was to make the Continental dollar an even more cumbersome medium of exchange

than what it already was for each separate emission.

       Figure 3.2 illustrates this problem. Emissions #1 and #2 have different expected present

values at each point in time. For example, in 1777, the expected present value of a Continental



                                                                                                   19
dollar from emission #1 was 81 percent, whereas for emission #2 it was 64 percent, of its face

value. In other words, Continental dollars from different emissions, in effect, were different

monies. Citizens would have to use the dates printed on the bills to determine what expected

present value to assign to each particular bill of the same denomination. Such values varied by

the dates on the bills. Each new emission multiplied this problem, making for an increasingly

cumbersome medium of exchange. The Continental dollar could still function as a medium of

exchange, but it would necessitate citizens’ pricing goods and services separately by Continental

dollar emissions (by the dates on bills), and trading Continental dollars from different emissions

at values other than one-to-one, namely at their expected present value differential at each point

in time.

         The cumbersomeness of the Continental dollar’s medium-of-exchange function may not

have been a concern to Congress, at least pre-1777, or viewed as a costly tradeoff for

establishing a fiscally credible redemption structure, because Continental dollars were not

expected to be used extensively as a medium of exchange. Congress may have expected most

citizens who received Continental dollars to hold them for future redemption, namely hold them

as bonds. Early on, this may have been particularly true given that the primary recipients of

Continental dollars were soldiers. For example, on 6 August 1779, General Parsons explained,

         I have not concerned myself with Commerce to increase my Estate Since the War...
         I...collected my dues [army salary] in Bills [Continental dollars] at their nominal Value in
         full Confidence...that at Some future Period my Country would do that Justice which they
         had promis’d me by paying their Debt at the nominal Value of the Bills they had emitted
         ...to render old age free from those miseries arising from Indigence... If my Country fails
         to Support her Independence, I shall be happy in possessing Nothing, but my Life.17

         The denominational size and spacing of Continental dollar emissions were consistent

with their not being expected to be easily used as a medium of exchange. Table 3.3 shows that

Continental dollars were large-valued bills. The smallest emitted in 1775 was a $1 bill,

equivalent in face value and expected present value to $31 and $21 in 2012 dollars, respectively.

Some relative sense of the contemporary value of one Continental dollar can be taken from

Congress’ payment of $1 per week in 1775 to cover an enlisted man’s entire weekly subsistence

expense while waiting in quarters post-recruitment to join the Continental army.18 Over 60

percent of the bills emitted in 1775, in face value and expected present value, were equivalent to,

or larger than, $124 and $86 in 2012 dollars, respectively. Large currency denominations were

difficult to use as a medium of exchange. Transactions that required change could not be made

unless change was given in some other medium. Fractional Continental dollars were only issued

in emission #3, early in 1776, and never again thereafter. When Congress asked the states on 22

November 1777 to stop emitting their own paper monies, they specifically exempted small

denomination state paper monies, recognizing that such was needed to make change.19

         Soldiers’ pay absorbed nearly half of all Continental dollars emitted through 1777 (Grubb

2011b, pp. 273-5). American army privates were paid $80 per year. Privates were the primary

recipients of military pay, receiving 78 percent of the money paid to each military company.

British army privates were paid $55 per year. American privates were paid in paper Continental

dollars, whereas British privates were paid in specie. In November 1775, the expected present

value of 80 Continental dollars of the first emission was between $63 and $53, or comparable

with the present value of a British private’s yearly pay. Relative to privates’ pay, the pay of

upper ranks increased less in the American than in the British army. Thus, by-rank comparisons

above private are less informative.20 That Congress initially set an American army private’s pay

to be equal to a British army private’s pay in expected present value terms rather than in face

value terms is an acknowledgement by Congress of the zero-interest bearer bond nature of the

Continental dollar that it was creating.

consistent with Congress’ intending to pay soldiers in large bills that would be held for future

redemption, rather than spent as currency. Throughout the American colonies, as well as in

modern economies, currency denominations were typically spaced by factors of two, three, or

five, and in a pyramid structure with more units in the lower than in the higher denominations.

These features reduced the transaction costs of using that money as a medium of exchange in

terms of making change. Table 3.3 shows that the denominational structure of the Continental

dollar did not have these features.21

        The unusual denominational structure of the Continental dollar becomes sensible if

Congress’ intent was to pay soldiers in the fewest bills necessary, and thus in large-valued bills

that were not intended to circulate easily as currency. Three months pay for a private, $20, could

be accommodated with one or various combinations of three, four, or five large-valued bills. One

month’s pay for a private after clothing deductions, $5, could be accommodated with one or

various combinations of two large-valued bills. For higher ranked military personal, paying them

with a few large-valued bills was even easier.

        Soldiers’ pay was fixed by Congress in nominal terms in June and July of 1775. As the

war continued, the present value of soldiers’ pay when made in subsequent emissions fell. In

November 1775, the expected present value of a full year’s pay for an American private, when

paid with dollars from the second emission, would be between $50 and $41—below the present

value of a British private’s yearly pay. For subsequent emissions, it was even lower. In effect,

Congress was financing the war by systematically reducing the real pay of its citizen soldiers and

increasingly so as the war progressed. The necessity of Congress to adjust nominal military pay

to realign it with the new present value of each successive emission of Continental dollars may

have been overlooked or just deemed too complicated to constantly address. Keeping the pay

structure of the military fixed in the nominal values as set before August 1775 made it both

easier for Congress to estimate and budget military expenses, as well as finance the war via

military-pay price controls.

         This action, however, created problems for the financing system regarding military pay

over a long war. At some point, soldiers would no longer re-enlist and fight for a fraction of the

present value of their original pay. Late in the war, Congress moved to solve this problem by

promising military personnel that Congress would make up “the deficiency of their original pay”

when feasible.22 This promise is consistent with Congress’ acknowledging the zero-interest

bearer bond design of the Continental dollar monetary system it had created, along with its

declining present value as new emissions pushed redemption farther into the future.

                     DID THE PUBLIC KNOW? WERE THEY INFORMED?

         Congress’ redemption instructions for the first and second emissions were widely

disseminated. Congress circulated a handbill that contained its Continental dollar resolutions

passed before 30 July 1775, including all the relevant redemption provisions for the first

emission, see Figure 3.3. This handbill was reprinted in its entirety in numerous newspapers—

the first being in the Connecticut Journal, & New-Haven Post-Boy, 25 October 1775. Between

25 October and 4 December 1775 all three newspapers in Connecticut, three of the four in

Massachusetts, one of the two in Rhode Island, one of the four in New York, and two of the five

in Pennsylvania reprinted it. Out of the surviving newspapers consulted, 10 of 24 reprinted the

Pennsylvania Evening Post, 12 March 1776. This information was also disseminated when

Congress published its journals at the end of 1775 and later in 1776.24 Between the direct

circulation of the handbill, the reproduction of it in the nation’s newspapers, publication of

Congress’ journal, and publication of congressional resolutions in The Pennsylvania Evening

Post, the public was well informed, with the possible exception of citizens in the Southern

colonies, of the Continental dollar’s structural design and redemption procedures.

ON BILL] Spanish MILLED DOLLARS, or the Value thereof in Gold or Silver, according to a

Resolution of CONGRESS passed at Philadelphia [date of the authorizing resolution]”, (Newman

2008, pp. 37, 63-73). The congressional resolution referred to on the bill laid out the redemption

dates when the bearer would receive the Spanish silver dollars, or value thereof, designated on

the face of the bill. This language differed from that typically printed on colonial paper monies,

New Jersey and post-1766 Maryland excepted, which indicated that colonial bills were intended

to be used more as current money than long-term bonds, namely “This BILL by LAW shall pass

current in [colony’s name], for [the amount printed on the face of the bill].”25 Language was

important and precisely used. Everyone could see and grasp the difference.

        Once the public was informed of the Continental dollar’s structural design, they acted as

if they understood that it was a zero-interest bearer bond requiring time-discounting to ascertain

its present value. The first reports of Continental dollars trading below face value appeared

before Congress in Philadelphia on 23 November 1775. This event occurred immediately after

the structural design of the Continental dollar was first reported in Pennsylvania newspapers.26

After the public was told that Continental dollars were zero-interest bearer bonds with defined

maturity dates, they started to accept them below their face value.

        The first congressional committee to investigate reports of depreciation was formed in

November of 1775. It was comprised of John Jay, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, Thomas

Johnson, George Wythe, Edward Rutledge, and Thomas Jefferson. This committee recognized

that Continental dollars were being accepted below their face value, but the resolution and

published announcements that were adopted did not explicitly condemn such. They only

condemned the non-acceptance of Continental dollars. Not explicitly condemning this

“depreciation,” but only condemning non-acceptance, was consistent with Congress recognizing

that time-discounting was not really depreciation per se, and that the public was right to accept

Continental dollars below their face value given that they were zero-interest bearer bonds.27

     DESCRIPTIONS BY NATIONAL LEADERS OF THE CONTINENTAL DOLLAR

        Numerous important citizens and national leaders knew about time-discounting and the

present-value calculation that reduced a future value to a current value. They explained the

Continental dollar as a zero-interest bearer bond needing such discounting to understand its

current value. In their descriptions, the Continental dollar was not a pure fiat currency, and time-

discounting was not depreciation per se. These ideas were not totally new. Numerous colonial

writers had articulated the time-discounting embedded in many colonial paper monies.28

        Pelatiah Webster, an influential contemporary writer, saw the impact of time-discounting

on the Continental dollar almost immediately after its structural design was revealed in the

handbill circulated by Congress. In an essay published in the Pennsylvania Evening Post, 5

October 1775, he asked in reference to the Continental dollar, “Why should the soldier,

tradesman, farmer, &c. be paid in promises, which are not so good as money, if fulfilment is at a

distance?”29 Webster considered the Continental dollar not to be proper current money because

it was a promise to pay money at a future date, namely a bond with a fixed maturity date.

        On 19 April 1776 Congress created a committee to ascertain the comparative value of

different silver and gold foreign coins. The committee consisted of James Duane, George Wythe,

John Adams, Roger Sherman, Joseph Hewes, Thomas Johnson, and William Whipple. Thomas

Jefferson joined the committee on 24 July 1776. The structural design of the Continental dollar

required that Congress rate the relative value of foreign coins. This can be seen by remembering

what was printed on the face of each Continental dollar, namely “This Bill entitles the BEARER

to receive [AMOUNT ON BILL] Spanish MILLED DOLLARS, or the Value thereof in Gold or

Silver, according to a Resolution of CONGRESS passed at Philadelphia [date of the authorizing

resolution].”30 This language meant that future redemption could be in Spanish silver dollars or

its specie equivalent. It is that equivalence in other foreign specie coins that had to be established

by Congress. That this task was the sole initial purpose of this 19 April 1776 committee is

seldom noted. However, the committee’s report, both on 22 May 1776 and 2 September 1776,

clearly stated that that was its purpose.31 The second paragraph of the committee’s report says,

                Whereas, the holders of bills of credit [Continental dollars] emitted by authority
        of Congress will be entitled, at certain periods appointed for redemption thereof to
        receive out of the treasury of the united colonies the amount of the said bills in spanish
        milled dollars, or value thereof in gold or silver; and the value of such dollars, compared
        with other silver and with gold coins, is estimated by different standards in different
        colonies, whereby injustice may happen in some instances to the public, as well as to
        individuals which ought to be remedied. ... Therefore,
                Resolved, that the several gold and silver coins passing in the said colonies shall
        be received into the public treasury of the continent, and paid out in exchange for bills
        emitted by authority of Congress, when the same shall become due, at the rates set down
        in the following table:

This committee clearly operated with the understanding that Continental dollars would not be

redeemed until some future date, and at that date their redemption would be, or could be, in

specie coins paid out of the Continental Treasury. In other words, the Continental dollar was a

type of bearer bond anchored to face-value specie payments at some future date.

        In January of 1778 the Commissioners of the New England states, along with

                                                                                                                29
Commissioners from New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey met in New Haven, Connecticut

to discuss economic issues related to the Revolution. In their letter to Congress, 30 January 1778,

they concluded with the following observation:

        Before we Conclude we beg leave to mention that the public have never yet been
        notified, when the Continental Bills are to be redeemed, except the two first Emissions.
        Their being at an uncertainty about this matter has been complained of as having a
        tendency to lessen the Credit of the bills, Whereas if they were to be Ascertained when
        they were to be redeemed, Especially if it was at a short period, it would give them a
        confidence in the money, and greatly tend to Establish its Currency.32

The Commissioners’ observations were consistent with understanding the Continental dollar to

be a zero-interest bearer bond rather than a pure fiat currency. They noted that the time to

redemption influenced the value of the bills, with a more distant redemption window being

associated with a lower current value. They also noted that Congress had not yet fixed the

redemption windows of emissions that came after emission #2, and so people had to guess or

forecast what those redemption windows would be. If they guessed a more distant redemption

date, that would lessen the current value of the bills. Therefore, if Congress set a redemption

window that was closer to the present, that would raise the current value of the bills.

        Roger Sherman was a delegate from Connecticut to the Continental Congress from 1774

through 1781. He was often a member of Congress’ finance committees, took an active part in

congressional debates on money, and was regarded as knowledgeable about monetary matters. In

a letter to the Governor of Connecticut, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., on 27 October 1778, Sherman

gave a clear explanation of the nature of the Continental dollar. He wrote,

        A note for £100 on compound interest, payable at the expiration of 20 years would be
        equal to one for £321 for the same term without interest. If the Bills of public credit
        [Continental dollars], so far as they exceed a sufficient quantity for a medium of trade,
        are to be considered only as securities for money without interest, rebating the compound
        interest for the time before they are redeemable will determine their present value, and

this last observation. These other observations will be dealt with in future papers.

                                                                                                            30
         they will gradually appreciate as time of their redemption approaches. Enclosed is a
         computation of the annual increase of £100 for 21 years on compound interest.33

         Sherman’ description of the Continental dollar is that of a zero-interest bearer bond. He

views a Continental dollar as a security for money to be delivered in the future without interest

paid in the interim, as opposed to money itself. He also describes the time-discounting that must

be done to determine a Continental dollar’s current value. He even uses the term present value to

describe that current value. He also describes the rise, or appreciation, in that value as the time to

redemption approaches. In his example, the implied interest rate that discounts £321 from 20

years in the future to £100 in the present is 5.83 percent, i.e. 100 = 321 * e(-0.583*20). Sherman

even provided his correspondent with a table to do time-discounting calculations.

         Gouverneur Morris was a delegate to Congress from New York, attending between 20

January 1778 and late November 1779. He was a member of Congress’ 1778 committee

attempting to reorganize the treasury and sort out the government’s currency finance system. He

would go on to become a central actor on monetary issues for the U.S. government under Robert

Morris when Robert Morris was Superintendent of Finance, and then a key shaper of the

monetary provisions in the U.S. Constitution at the 1787 Constitutional Convention.34 In the

course of working on the 1778 congressional committee’s report on currency finance, of which

he was the author, he wrote a treatise on money. That committee’s report was delivered on 19

September 1778 and was largely shelved by Congress as too controversial. In Morris’

preparatory treatise on money, alluding to paper money like the Continental dollar, he reasoned,

                If a Legislature...should utter a Paper Medium payable at a distant Day it would or
         would not be received according to the Want of such Medium among the People. And
         when received it’s Value would depend on the Consideration 1st. of the Want 2ly. of the

        Distance of the Day of Payment & 3ly. of the Certainty or Uncertainty of such Payment.35

        Gouverneur Morris viewed the value of paper money, such as the Continental dollar, as

being determined by: (1) the preference or liquidity premium attached to that money compared

with its next best alternative, i.e. the “Want”; (2) the time to redemption, i.e. time-discounting;

and (3) the fiscal credibility of the future promised payment. Therefore, if no excess preference

or liquidity premium existed and future redemption was certain, then the present value of a

Continental dollar would depend only on time-discounting, i.e. the Continental dollar was a zero-

interest bearer bond. Morris saw the credibility of the government’s promise of a future money

payoff, namely the government’s will and ability to meet that payoff at the time of redemption,

along with the time to redemption, as key determinants of the present value of the Continental

dollar. It is hard to interpret this passage without saying that Morris understood the Continental

dollar, at least potentially, to be a zero-interest bearer bond and not a fiat currency.

        James Madison was elected to Congress on 14 December 1779. To prepare for this role,

he studied the finances of the United States and, sometime between 14 December 1779 and 18

March 1780, wrote down his thoughts. While these observations—his treatise on money—would

not be published until 1791, it seems unlikely that he wrote in a vacuum. Fellow Virginians

familiar with the history of congressional paper money emissions were likely consulted by

Madison before he made his way to Philadelphia. If so, his observations may reflect some

consensus beyond the reasoning of just one man. Madison’s treatise on money is the most clear,

consistent, and cogent analysis of the nature and structural design of the Continental dollar

written by any American during, or in the decade after, the Revolution, including anything

written by the financial luminaries of the American Revolution, namely Benjamin Franklin,


35
   Barlow (2012, pp. 73, 75). Gouverneur Morris’ analysis of money involves alternatives that are inconsistent with
the passage quoted here. These alternatives will be taken up in future papers.

                                                                                                                 32
Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Robert Morris, and Pelatiah Webster. Madison’s entire

treatise is recommended reading. A brief portion highlighting the zero-interest bearer-bond

nature of the Continental dollar follows:

                 If the circulating medium be a municipal one, as paper currency....
                 It consists of bills or notes of obligation payable in specie to the bearer, either on
        demand or at a future day. [Madison indicates that for the illustrative exercise to follow,
        the credibility of redemption whether on demand or at a fixed future day will always be
        assumed.] Of the first kind is the paper currency of Britain [banknotes], and hence its
        equivalence to specie. Of the latter kind is the paper currency of the United States [the
        Continental dollar], and hence its inferiority to specie.
                 Let us suppose that the circulating notes...instead of being payable on demand,
        were to be redeemed at a future day, at the end of one year for example, and that no
        interest was due them. ... They would in that case represent not the nominal sum
        expressed on the face of them, but the sum remaining after a deduction of one year’s
        interest. ... We may extend the time from one, to five, or to twenty years; but we shall
        find no other rule of depreciation than the loss of the intermediate interest.
                 [The United States] Being engaged in a necessary war without specie to defray
        the expense, or to support paper emissions for that purpose redeemable on demand, and
        being at the same time unable to borrow, no resource was left, but to emit bills of credit
        [Continental dollars] to be redeemed in the future. The inferiority of these bills to specie
        was therefore incident to the very nature of them. If they had been exchangeable on
        demand for specie, they would have been equivalent to it; as they were not exchangeable
        on demand, they were inferior to it. The degree of their inferiority must consequently be
        estimated by the time of their becoming exchangeable for specie, that is the time of their
        redemption.
                 Suppose the period necessary for its [the Continental dollar’s] redemption to be
        18 years, as seems to be understood by Congress;36 100 dollars of paper 18 years hence
        will be equal in value to 100 dollars of specie; for at the end of that term, 100 dollars of
        specie may be demanded for them. They must consequently at this time be equal to as
        much specie as, with compound interest, will amount, in that number of years, to 100
        dollars. ... Admit, however the use of money to be worth 6 per cent. about 35 dollars will
        then amount in 18 years to 100. 35 dollars of specie therefore is at this time equal to 100
        of paper; that is, the man who would exchange his specie for paper at this discount, and
        lock it in his desk for 18 years, would get 6 per cent. for his money.37

        Madison explained the difference between a paper currency convertible to specie at face

value on demand versus one convertible to specie at face value but only at some future date.


36
   Madison is referencing Congress’ 2 and 14 January 1779 resolutions on the redemption of the Continental dollar,
see Table 3.1.
37
   Hutchinson and Rachel (1962, v. 1, pp. 304-5, 308, 310). Madison’s treatise on money was published in the
National Gazette on 19 and 22 December 1791. I thank Alan Gibson for bringing Madison’s treatise to my attention.

                                                                                                               33
Assuming certainty of convertibility, the one convertible on demand will circulate at its face

value because it is equal at any point in time to its face value in specie. But even assuming

certainty of redemption, the present value of the one convertible at some future date, by its very

nature, will not equal its face value, but only its face value reduced by time-discounting from the

future date of redemption. Madison even gives an example of what the value of 100 Continental

dollars redeemed in 18 years for 100 silver dollars would be today at a 6 percent discount rate,

namely 35 silver dollars. Madison terms this reduced value “depreciation,” but means only the

loss of interest, not depreciation per se or a loss of principal at redemption. He also concludes

that its present value is governed by the time-span to redemption. The further into future is the

promised redemption, the lower must be the present value. As such, Madison does not mean

depreciation as everyone else used the term for there was no loss in value separate from time-

discounting. Madison also notes the importance of, and even uses the phrase, “credibility of

redemption” for determining a Continental dollar’s present value. Future redemption based on

levied taxes had to be fiscally possible, a burden able to be sustained by the public, to prevent

depreciation beyond time-discounting. Madison understood Continental dollars, by the “incident

to the very nature of them,” to be zero-interest bearer bonds, and not pure fiat currency.

       Lastly, on 17 February 1780, Gouverneur Morris, who was out of Congress and working

as a lawyer in Philadelphia at the time, published an analysis of America’s finances in the

Philadelphia newspaper Pennsylvania Packet, or General Advertiser, he ended with the

following observation,

               I have spoken of paper [money] hitherto without marking particularly the effects
       which follow from the idea of redemption. But now let us advert for this purpose to our
       paper [the Continental dollar]. Suppose a full confidence prevailed that in twenty years it
       would be appreciated to its nominal value; then every man possessed of forty dollars




                                                                                                    34
        would believe that if he kept it twenty years it would be worth forty dollars in specie.38
        Now if we reckon a compound interest of six per cent. forty dollars payable twenty years
        hence will be worth at present about twelve and a half, which deducting two and a half
        leaves ten. Wherefore it would follow, that he who purchases paper [Continental dollars]
        at the rate of four for one, would have the best possible security to receive a compound
        six per cent. interest on his money, with an ultimate additional profit of twenty-five per
        cent. at the end of twenty years.39

        As with Gouverneur Morris’ passage quoted earlier, Morris treats the Continental dollar

here as a zero-interest bearer bond and not a pure fiat currency. Its present value, under the ideal

condition of being paid off in the future with certainty, is determined only by time-discounting.

He goes on to give an example using 6 percent as the discount factor and 20 years as the time to

redemption. He calculates that $40 at face value in 20 years is only worth $12.5 today. He does

not call this lower present value today depreciation. It is just time-discounting.

        James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, Roger Sherman, Pelatiah Webster, the

Commissioners attending the January 1778 New Haven Conference, and the 1776 congressional

committee that rated foreign coins, i.e. James Duane, George Wythe, John Adams, Roger

Sherman, Joseph Hewes, Thomas Johnson, William Whipple, and Thomas Jefferson, all

explicitly articulated an understanding of the Continental dollar consistent with its being a zero-

interest bearer bond and not a pure fiat currency. Why that understanding was forgotten, even by

most of those listed above, and then by everyone else, and why it was supplanted and displaced

by the traditional historiography that views the Continental dollar as just another fiat currency,

will be addressed in future papers.

         FORECASTING THE REDEMPTION OF EMISSIONS #3 THROUGH #10

        For the first two emissions Congress issued timely redemption instructions. For the next


38
   Morris was referencing to Congress’ most recent resolutions that of 2 and 14 January 1779, which set redemption
of the Continental dollar to run to 1797, see Table 3.1.
39
   Barlow (2012, pp. 103, 109-10). Gouverneur Morris’ analysis of money involves alternatives that are inconsistent
with the passage quoted here. These alternatives will be taken up in future papers.

                                                                                                                35
eight emissions (emissions #3 through part of emission #10, totaling $95,500,300 in face value),

Congress issued no explicit redemption instructions. At best, statements were made indicating

that redemption would be “on the same security as the sums of money heretofore emitted by

Congress have been,” “in such manner...as Congress shall hereafter direct,” and for

“periods...that shall be fixed by Congress.” But most often nothing was stated. After 1775,

Congress shifted monetary matters from Congress, sitting as a whole, to standing sub-

committees. Redemption instructions for subsequent emissions fell between these administrative

cracks, each group apparently thinking the other was responsible for establishing the redemption

instructions for new emissions. Not until emission #11 did Congress sitting as a whole resolve

this administrative oversight.40

           This failure by Congress to explicitly give redemption instructions for emissions #3

through part of #10 was noticed, and the fact that everyone was “left to his own conjectures” as

to when redemption would occur was a concern. James Madison, in his treatise on money,

explicitly stated this concern and described the likely forecast that was made,

           Every one must have taken notice that, in the emissions of Congress, no precise time has
           been stipulated for their redemption, nor any specific provision made for that purpose. A
           general promise entitling the bearer to so many dollars of metal as the paper bills express,
           has been the only basis of their credit. Every one therefore has been left to his own
           conjectures as to the time the redemption would be fulfilled; and as every addition made
           to the quantity in circulation, would naturally be supposed to remove to a proportionally
           greater distance the redemption of the whole mass, it could not happen otherwise than
           that every additional emission would be followed by a further depreciation [meaning
           by depreciation a lower present value due to time-discounting].41

           The January 1778 meeting of state commissioners in New Haven also noted the lack of

redemption instructions for these emissions. In their letter to Congress, they concluded,

           ...the public have never yet been notified, when the Continental Bills are to be redeemed,

40
     See Table 3.1; JCC (v. 4, pp. 156-7); Smith (1978, v. 3, pp. 270-1).
41
     Hutchinson and Rachal (1962, pp. 305-6).

                                                                                                    36
          except the two first Emissions. ... if they were to be Ascertained when they were to be
          redeemed, Especially if it was at a short period, it would give them a confidence in the
          money, and greatly tend to Establish its Currency.42

They noted that the distance to redemption was critical, and so what the public conjectured about

redemption-distance was important to determining the current value of Continental dollars.

          By necessity, therefore, the pattern of redemption for these eight emissions (#3 through

part of #10) was being forecasted by the public. What a rational forecast would be is constructed

using the redemption pattern set by Congress for the first two emissions of Continental dollars,

those issued in 1775, and expectations based on how the colonies had financed the French and

Indian War. This was information the public had. Therefore, it would likely form the basis of any

forecast the public made of the unspecified redemption structure for the next eight emissions of

Continental dollars, i.e. those issued from 1776 through 1778. In general, redemption would only

start post-war and would be pushed successively into the future with each subsequent emission.

It would also be spread over enough years to keep tax levels within historically acceptable and

feasible limits, thus giving the system fiscal credibility.

          Three forecasts are consistent with the redemption pattern set by Congress in 1775. First,

a four-year contiguous redemption interval would be maintained for each subsequent emission

starting the year after the redemption interval for the immediately prior emission ended (Forecast

1). Second, redemption intervals would be adjusted to maintain a constant per year per white-

capita tax level until all emissions were redeemed at face value, with $0.33 being that level

(Forecast 2). Third, redemption intervals would be adjusted to maintain a constant $750,000 per

year redemption amount until all emissions were redeemed at face value (Forecast 3). Forecast 1

is identical to Forecast 3 when emission sizes are identical, which is approximately true for



42
     Hammond (1889a, p. 293).

                                                                                                     37
emissions #1 through #7. After emission #7, emission sizes get so large that by 1779 Forecast 3

would entail a redemption period of 267 years. As such, Forecast 3 is redundant before and

unrealistic after 1777, and so is not used. Forecast 2 requires making population growth

projections. That such projections were made regarding the redemption of Continental dollars

can be seen in John Jay’s published address to the public as President of Congress on 13

September 1779.43 The construction of Forecast 2 uses estimates of the actual growth in

population. Both Forecasts 1 and 2 are used to represent the public’s expectations about future

redemptions of Continental dollars.

           Table 3.4 presents the ideal expected present value of a Continental dollar at each

emission’s inception as a percentage of its face value based on face-value redemption dates, both

legislated and forecasted, using a 6 percent discount (interest) rate.44 Ideal means with certainty

regarding the promise of redemption at face value and with 6 percent being the average time-

preference or market opportunity cost of comparable investments. The third column calculates

the expected present value at inception, and Figure 3.4 draws the full ideal expected present

value time-paths from inception to redemption, for emissions #1 through #7, using legislated

redemption instructions for emissions #1 and #2 and Forecast 1 for emissions #3 through #7.

Each emission starts at an expected present value well below its face value due to time-

discounting and then rises to its face value by its last redemption date. Because each new

emission is forecast to have a four-year redemption window staggered successively forward in

time, each emission’s ideal expected present value time-path is positioned successively farther to

the south and east in Figure 3.4. This is not depreciation per se, but merely time-discounting.

           While each emission’s ideal expected present value time-path is rising over time, the

            This is the expected average par present values for the cumulative emissions outstanding to that date
weighted by their dollar size. In other words, if one had a random draw of Continental dollars currently outstanding
at this date, then this is what their average expected par present value would be. After emission #7 legal tender laws
make all expected values per specific emission average cumulative values for all currently outstanding emissions.

            See text and Grubb (2012b) for details about how legal tender laws work. Perfect foresight expectations
means that the public knew exactly how many Continental dollars would eventually be emitted. No foresight
expectations means that the public did not take future emissions of Continental dollars into account when calculating
the expected present value of a Continental dollar for the emissions issued so far and currently outstanding.

            This is the tax needed to redeem the promised or forecasted amount of Continental dollars at face value. It
applies to legislated and Forecast 1 values only. Forecast 2 by construction is set at $0.33. The range across the
redemption interval for each emission is underneath the average number for that interval. Population is extrapolated
linearly between decadal benchmarks and is for the white population only (Carter, et al. 2006, v. 1, p. 36; v. 5, p.
652). Only the tax needed to redeem Continental dollars at face value is reported. Taxes are expressed in Spanish
silver dollars. Taxes expressed in pounds sterling are converted to Spanish silver dollars following McCusker (1978,
p. 10). Legal tender laws merge emission redemptions after emission #7. Thus, for emissions after emission #7, the
average tax covers redemption across all prior emissions and redemption years. The high number in the tax range for
each emission after emission #7 represents the per year per white-capita tax for the fourth to last year of redemption.

            Only the $30,000,300 portion of emission #10 authorized before 14 January 1779 is used to estimate the

frequent addition of new emissions that start at successively lower present values pulls down the

average present value of all Continental dollars currently outstanding over the years of active

emissions. This occurred because the frequency and size of new emissions, which add

Continental dollars that start at relatively lower present values, outweigh the rising present value

of the Continental dollars from prior emissions. Suppose at a given date one took a random draw

of Continental dollars that were currently outstanding. The expected present value of that draw

would be the average of the expected present values of the individual emissions at the date they

were drawn. That average would, in turn, depend on the chance of randomly drawing bills from

various outstanding emissions which, in turn, would depend on the relative size of each

emission.

       Column four of Table 3.4 shows these average expected present values at inception for

each new emission through emission #7, weighted by the nominal dollar size of all emissions

currently outstanding. It uses the legislated redemption dates for emissions #1 and #2, and

Forecasts 1 and 2 for emissions #3 through #7. This average of the expected present values at an

emission’s inception, column four, is above that for that emission’s bills, column three, because

                                                                                                41
bills from earlier emissions with higher present values are being averaged in with this emission.

       Figure 3.5 illustrates the complete time-path for the ideal average expected present values

presented in column four of Table 3.4 for emissions #1 through #7 (1775 to 1777). Forecasts 1

and 2 are so close to each other that they appear as a single dotted line prior to 1777. Comparing

Figures 3.4 and 3.5 illustrates how the average expected present value is pulled down over time.

The frequency and size of new emissions with their lower expected present values at inception

outweigh the rise in the expected present value of earlier emissions. Given that the public’s

estimates of a Continental dollar’s current value at any point in time would likely be made on a

blind or random chance acquisition of Continental dollars among various outstanding emissions,

i.e. not knowing in advance which emission a given dollar presented to them would be from, the

times-paths in Figure 3.5 and column four in Table 3.4 represent the overall ideal present value

at any point in time of a Continental dollar through early 1777. This value shows that, even

under ideal conditions with no uncertainty or depreciation per se, the average expected present

value of a Continental dollar fell from 70 percent of its face value in May 1775 to 38 percent of

its face value by March 1777. This was not depreciation, but simply the effect of time-

discounting, i.e. the result of taking the value of time into account.

       While the public could operate on the basis of forecasting an overall average expected

present value of a Continental dollar as shown in Figure 3.5 through early 1777, it still faced the

problem that Continental dollars known to be from different emissions should trade at different

expected present values, see Figure 3.4. Once the emission date of a Continental dollar received

in trade was revealed, the expected present value of that dollar could depart substantially from

the overall average expected present value at that date as shown in Figure 3.5. Congress had

created these differences in their initial structural design of the Continental dollar. Such



                                                                                                   42

differences across emissions made for a cumbersome medium of exchange.

       Before the Revolution, individual colonies had solved this problem by making their

respective bills of credit a legal tender at face value within their respective jurisdictions. Legal

tender laws made bills from different emissions that were currently outstanding fungible, in

effect merging emission-specific redemption windows for currently outstanding bills into one big

window. Under legal tender laws, which bills were redeemed in which emission redemption

windows no longer mattered as long as cumulative redemptions over the entire redemption


                                                                                                                 43
window for all emissions matched cumulative emissions.

       Legal tender laws allowed the public to respond to what the expected present value of a

Continental dollar was at each point in time independent of emission dates for all bills currently

outstanding. In other words, assessing the expected present value of a Continental dollar no

longer depended on a blind random draw of bills currently outstanding. That assessment

remained valid even if a non-random composition of emissions in a sample of Continental

dollars was known ahead of time. Legal tender laws rendered the expected present value time-

paths for each emission in Figure 3.4 irrelevant. Only the overall expected present value time-

path in Figure 3.5 mattered for knowing the current value of any Continental dollar.

       Because legal tender laws made emission-specific redemption windows irrelevant, it

freed Congress from linking each emission to a unique authorization by breaking the relationship

between a specific emission and its accompanying emission-specific redemption instructions (or

its forecasted instructions). Congress could now authorize additional amounts at several

subsequent dates under the umbrella of the same emission. Table 3.1 shows this behavior. Before

legal tender laws, i.e. before emission #8, each emission had one authorized amount. After legal

tender laws, i.e. after emission #7, each emission now had multiple authorization dates when

additional sums were added to that emission. Under legal tender laws, emissions could and did

become much larger in size.

       As expectations of a brief conflict waned, the need for more emissions became clear, and

the public’s use of Continental dollars as a medium of exchange became more likely, Congress

moved to solve the structural problem they had created whereby different emissions should trade

contemporaneously at different expected present values. They did this by asking the states to

make the Continental dollar a legal tender within their respective jurisdictions. On the same day



                                                                                                  44
that emission #4 was authorized, 22 May 1776, a congressional committee consisting of James

Duane, George Wythe, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Joseph Hewes, Thomas Johnson, and

William Whipple recommended that Congress ask the states to make the Continental dollar a

legal tender. The committee, now including Thomas Jefferson, made the same recommendation

on 2 September 1776. Finally, on 14 January 1777, after emission #6 had been authorized,

Congress acted on the committee’s recommendation and asked the states to make the Continental

dollar a legal tender at face value within their respective jurisdictions.45 The states quickly

accommodated this request. For example, Pennsylvania made the Continental dollar a legal

tender on 6 February 1777, Delaware on 22 February 1777, and Virginia on 5 May 1777. By

emission #8, authorized on 22 May 1777, Continental dollars were legal tender at face value.46

         With emission #8, after May 1777, legal tender laws made Continental dollars from

different emissions have the same expected present value in contemporaneous trades. Before

May 1777, however, Continental dollars from emissions #1 through #7 should have traded

contemporaneously at different values. Little direct evidence of differential treatment across

emissions pre-1777 has been previously noted, in part because no one has looked for it, which in

turn may be due to data difficulties. Market participants typically recorded monetary transactions

in units of account and not media of exchange.47 For example, in Figure 3.6, out of 3,127

commercial advertisements placed in the Pennsylvania Gazette between March 1775 and April

1780 that listed a monetary statement, only 3 percent referred to a particular money or medium

   See Cushing (1981, v. 2, part 1, pp. 599-602); Hening (1969, v. 9, pp. 297-8); JCC (v. 4, pp. 294, 381-3; v. 5, pp.

When a state made the Continental dollar a legal tender within its jurisdiction, this meant that state-imposed fees and
taxes could now be paid in Continental dollars at a legally set equivalence to that state’s paper money. This may
have been an effort to add some current positive liquidity premium to the Continental dollar. Given that states did
not remit Continental dollars to the Continental Treasury until November 1779, state taxes paid in Continental
dollars under the auspices of their being a legal tender did not materially affect the redemption of Continental dollars
ahead of that legislatively scheduled and prudently forecast, see Grubb (2012a, pp. 156-60, 170).

of exchange as opposed to just listing the unit of account used, obscuring value distinctions

between particular monies. That said, on 20 February 1777, Congress’ Committee on Way and

Means for supplying the Treasury made a recommendation that entailed distinguishing between

the first two emissions and subsequent emissions. Such a distinction only made sense if




                                                                                                               46
Continental dollars from different emissions were perceived to have different present values.48

        After 1777, congressional payments for war supplies absorbed more Continental dollars

than soldiers’ pay.49 While soldiers’ pay had been fixed in nominal terms by Congress on 29

July 1775, when Congress spent Continental dollars in the marketplace for supplies and services,

prices could be raised by suppliers and service providers to reflect the expected present value of

the Continental dollars offered in payment. Suppliers and service providers were more likely to

re-spend the money paid them because they had subcontractors and employees to pay. Figure 3.6

shows that market participants in Philadelphia did not start denominating transactions in dollar

units, above that used prior to the first emission of Continental dollars, until sometime after mid-

1776. By mid-1777, the public was pricing goods primarily in Continental dollars.

        That Congress waited until 1777 to ask the states to make the Continental dollar a legal

tender is consistent with this transition in usage. As war supplies came to dominate congressional

spending, Continental dollars had to become a less cumbersome transacting medium of

exchange. This was difficult to achieve if Continental dollars with different emission dates had

different contemporaneous expected present values. Legal tender laws eliminated this problem.

The public could now think in terms of one overall expected present value for any Continental

dollar outstanding independent of the emission date on the bill.

        When Congress altered the redemption rules on 2 January 1779, see Table 3.1, they

explicitly made the expected present value of all Continental dollars identical regardless of

emission date. They did this by establishing one overall redemption window for all Continental

dollars ever emitted. Theoretically, this action had the same effect as states making the

Continental dollar a legal tender within their respective jurisdictions. That Congress explicitly

took this action for the first time in 1779 may have added to the certainty that all Continental

dollars now had the same expected present value regardless of emission date. A few market

participants took notice. Edward Bonsall and Abraham Shoemaker advertised in the 27 January

1779 Pennsylvania Gazette that they would sell a tract of land “For Continental Currency of any

date [italics in the original].” The implication of this previously unused phraseology is that prior

to 2 January 1779 Continental dollars from different emissions may occasionally have been

treated differently when settling accounts. Not all citizens may have understood that legal tender

laws had already implicitly accomplished what the 2 January 1779 congressional resolution

explicitly accomplished.50

           Legal tender laws altered the public’s present value forecasts. A simple average of the

expected present values of outstanding emissions weighted by emission size, used before legal

tender laws were enacted, i.e. Table 3.4 column four, was no longer valid. Prior to legal tender

laws, adding a new emission lowered the average expected present value of a random draw of

Continental dollars, but not by lowering the expected present value of any prior emission. It did

so merely by adding in the weight of the new emission’s lower expected present value. Under a

legal tender law, this was changed. By continuously merging and remerging all prior emissions’

redemption windows with each new emission’s redemption window into one big constantly

growing redemption window, legal tender laws caused each new emission to lower the expected

present value of all prior emissions. In other words, under legal tender laws, each emission

exerted a negative externality on all other emissions’ expected present values. Because future

emissions now impacted prior emissions’ expected present values, under legal tender laws the

public had to forecast future emissions in order to calculate a current expected present value of a

Continental dollar.

         Column five of Table 3.4 presents two alternative expectations of future emissions used

to recalculate the expected present value at inception for emissions #8 through #10 using

Forecasts 1 and 2 under legal tender laws. The first alternative assumes the public had perfect

foresight regarding the number and size of future emissions of Continental dollars. The second

alternative assumes the public was myopic and had no foresight regarding future emissions. In

other words, it assumes the public thought each current emission would be the last emission. The

perfect foresight alternative is likely the most reasonable. As early as mid-1777 and certainly by

1779 there was strong sentiment among Americans that the war had been won and would soon

be over. The public could gauge the yearly cost of the war and, and with some idea of when the

war would end, could then gauge future Continental dollar emissions. Congress had started

debating an end to emissions, and in 1779 set a $200 million limit for total cumulative

emissions.51 That the last emission occurred when the first redemptions were to be received by

the Continental Treasury was likely no coincidence, and so something expected by the public.

         Forecasting war costs that required Continental dollars after mid-1777, based on average

monthly war costs from 1775 into 1777, turned out to be fairly accurate. For example, the

present value of congressional spending of Continental dollars from emissions #1 through #7

was approximately $11 million, or $529,101 per month on average from September 1775

through April 1777. This is almost exactly what Thomas Jefferson estimated in July of 1775,

namely that each six months of war would cost $3 million.52 Using this number to forecast the

present value of Continental dollars needed per month to continue the war from May 1777

through March 1780 yields approximately $18.5 million. The total present value of Continental

dollars emitted after emission #7 equaled between $17.6 and $24.6 million using Forecasts 1 and

2 with perfect foresight expectations, respectively.53 As such, the projected $18.5 million in

present value needed to finish the war based on past behavior is close to the perfect foresight

expectation of the number and size of future emissions needed after emission #7, in present value

terms using Forecasts 1 and 2, to finish the war. Therefore, the perfect foresight expectation

approximates fairly closely the forecast of future emissions based on projecting past behavior.

        The difference between the perfect foresight and the no foresight forecast, see Table 3.4

column five and Figure 3.5, illustrates the size of the negative externality caused by legal tender

laws on the expected present value of currently outstanding Continental dollars. Under perfect

foresight, the adoption of legal tender laws after emission #7 caused the expected present value

to fall from 38.5 percent of face value at the inception of emission #7 to between 9.5 and 13.5

percent of face value at the inception of emission #8. This was the lowest forecasted expected

present value. From that point forecasted expected present values would rise continuously

between the inception of emission #8 and the year when the last Continental dollar ever emitted

would be redeemed. This result occurs because the public knows how many future Continental

dollar emissions will occur and what the size of those emissions will be. Thus, they know when

the last redemption year will be, and because the inception of emission #8 is the farthest away in

time from the last redemption year, its expected present value is the lowest.

        By comparison, if the public is myopic and has a no foresight forecast then, with the

adoption of legal tender laws after emission #7, the expected present value falls from 38.5

percent of face value at the inception of emission #7 to only 30 percent of face value at the

inception of emission #8. This is 18.5 percentage points less than the fall under the perfect

foresight assumption. From that point, the forecasted expected present value falls with each

successive emission under the no foresight calculation, while it continues to rise under the

perfect foresight calculation, until the two rejoin at the inception of the last emission in January

of 1779 (emission #11) at between 10.6 and 14.8 percent of face value, see Table 3.4 column

five and Figure 3.5. Thereafter the two foresight expectations yield identical expected present

value forecasts for both Forecasts 1 and 2. This last result is because, after the last emission,

assuming that the public pretends that no more emissions will occur, and assuming that the

public perfectly foresees that no more emissions will occur, are identical assumptions.

       The adoption of legal tender laws after mid-1777, assuming perfect foresight

expectations, produced a substantial collapse in the expected present value of Continental dollars

currently outstanding during the critical year of 1777. In effect, by requesting that the states

adopt legal tender laws, Congress was trading off a substantial reduction in the expected present

value of Continental dollars already outstanding for making Continental dollars a less

cumbersome medium of exchange. Even this improved medium-of-exchange function may not

have been realized due to the extreme length of the redemption window needed to create it.

       Legal tender laws made all Continental dollars regardless of emission number, or date on

the bill, have the same expected present value, thus making them a less cumbersome medium of

exchange. It accomplished this by merging the redemption windows for all emissions into one

large redemption window. This method, however, increased the variance in the realized value of

Continental dollars at any point in time. At the inception of emission #8, the redemption window

for Forecasts 1 and 2 under perfect foresight was 43 and 72.5 years, respectively. Under the no

foresight assumption, it was 31 and 34.5 years, respectively. These are much longer redemption

windows than the typical four-year window forecasted for each separate emission #3 through #7



                                                                                                    51
before legal tender laws were enacted. This long redemption window increased the range of

realized values around the now common average value.

       With emission #8 and the adoption of legal tender laws, under perfect foresight using

Forecasts 1 and 2, a given Continental dollar could now end up being redeemed at face value as

early as 1779 or as late as 1822 or 1852, respectively. If a citizen knew in advance which

Continental dollar would be redeemed in 1779 versus which in 1822 or 1852, they would be

willing to pay more than the expected average for the one redeemed in 1779, and less than the

expected average for the one redeemed in 1822 or 1852. For example, under perfect foresight

using Forecasts 1 and 2, at the inception of emission #8, while the expected present value of any

Continental dollar was 13.4 and 9.6 percent of face value, respectively, the range around these

averages was 86.1 to 6.5 percent of face value for Forecast 1, and 86.1 to 1.11 percent of face

value for Forecast 2. Under no foresight using Forecasts 1 and 2, at the inception of emission #8,

while the expected present value of any Continental dollar was 30.4 and 30.0 percent of face

value, respectively, the range around these averages was 86.1 to 13.4 percent of face value for

Forecast 1 and 86.1 to 10.9 percent of face value for Forecast 2, see Table 3.4.

       While most citizens did not know in advance which Continental dollar would be

redeemed in which year within the redemption window, and so would use the common expected

present value when transacting in Continental dollars, the shear range of possible realized values

around that common average imparted additional risk to using Continental dollars as a medium

of exchange. Congress had created no mechanism to determine which specific Continental dollar

would be redeemed in which year. If everyone rushed to the Continental Treasury in 1779 with

their Continental dollars, how the Treasury would decide which to accept to fill that year’s quota

and which to turn away was undetermined. Insider knowledge and political favors intruding into



                                                                                                  52
the actual redeeming process must have been a concern and something that would affect the

value-stability of the system. The variance in realized values produced by a four-year redemption

window may have been a minor inconvenience, but that produced by a 31 or a 73 year

redemption window had to be a major concern, carrying a substantial risk cost, when trading in

Continental dollars after emission #7.

       An additional rationale for Congress’ requesting that the states adopt legal tender laws in

1777 is shown in Figure 3.4. This rationale, however, is largely based on Congress’ assuming the

public had no foresight expectations regarding the number and size of future emissions. Table

3.4 column three and Figure 3.4 show that the expected present value of emissions #6 and #7 at

their inceptions were low, 23 and 18 percent of face value, respectively. If nothing was done, the

expected present value of the next emissions (#8) at its inception would be even lower. The

purchasing power Congress expected from a new emission, even with zero depreciation, was

rapidly vanishing due to forecasted time-discounting.

       If the public operated under a no foresight expectation regarding future emissions, then

adopting legal tender laws would twist and flatten the expected present value time-path of the

merged emissions #1 through #8 such that the expected present value of new emission #8 at its

inception would now be well above what it was for emissions #5 through #7 at their respective

inceptions, see Table 3.4 columns three and five, and Figure 3.4. This action made the expected

present value of emission #8 at inception 30 percent of face value rather than 15 percent of face

value if no legal tender laws were adopted, or almost twice as high in terms of percentage points.

Thus, the purchasing power Congress would enjoy with its new emission #8 was enhanced.

Similarly, the differential produced in Congress’ purchasing power for emissions #9 and #10 by

adopting legal tender laws was about 10 percentage points above what it would have been if no



                                                                                                  53
legal tender laws had been adopted. However, if the public had perfect foresight expectations

regarding the number and size of future emissions, then far less was gained by Congress in the

purchasing power of its new emissions, at best about a 4 percentage point higher expected

present value by emission #10 under legal tender laws compared with no legal tender laws.

           If this alteration in the time-path of redemption, solid line (1-8) in Figure 3.4, was

Congress’ intention, in addition to making the Continental dollar a less cumbersome medium of

exchange, it came at an additional cost. The adoption of legal tender laws sacrificed the present

value expected by holders of prior emissions in order to prop up the present value of the new

emission Congress was now spending. This was a kind of breach of faith that damaged the

credibility of Congress and the Continental dollar financing system. It amounted to a

retrospective change in the present value of outstanding zero-interest bonds through unilaterally

imposing a legal postponement in their likely day of redemption. This cost along with the sharp

and large collapse in expected present value in 1777 caused by the adoption of legal tender laws

under perfect foresight expectations put destructive pressure on the Continental dollar finance

system.54 Legal tender laws imposed additional costs and garnered no more benefits that those

mentioned here (Grubb 2012b). This raises questions about why Congress advocated the

adoption of legal tender laws. Whether it was out of ignorance, stupidity, or Machiavellian

politics, will be taken up in future papers.

                 IDEAL REDEMPTION PERFORMANCE AFTER EMISSION #10

           On 2 January 1779, 12 days prior to authorizing what would be the last emission (#11),

Congress changed redemption requirements for all Continental dollars. The Board of Treasury

and Congress finally responded to their administrative failure to explicitly establish redemption

windows for emission #3 through #10. This failure, and its ill effects, had been noted by the state

Commissioners meeting in New Haven in their January 1778 letter to Congress (discussed

above). The Board of Treasury’s preamble to the 2 January 1779 resolution read,

                Whereas, these United States, unprovided with revenues, and not heretofore in a
        condition to raise them, have, in the course of the present war, repeatedly been under the
        necessity of emitting bills of credit [Continental dollars], for the redemption of which the
        faith of these United States has been solemnly pledged, and the credit of which their
        honor and safety, as well as justice, is highly concerned to support and establish; and
        whereas, to that end, it is essentially necessary to ascertain the periods of their
        redemption, and seasonally establish funds which, in due time, without distressing the
        people, shall make adequate provision for the same:55

        All the structural procedures from 1775 were kept in place except the redemption

installment amounts and the length of the contiguous-year redemption window. The specie

redemption option for citizens at the Continental Treasury was not mentioned in the 2 January

1779 resolution. However, Congress indicated that it was still operative on 14 June 1779.56 All

past and future emissions were now to be fungible in redemption, explicitly codifying nationally

what had only been an implicit outcome of legal tender laws enacted piecemeal in 1777 by

individual states. The resolution also indicated that net new emissions would end in 1779. The

states were now to redeem $15 million in 1779, by 30 November, and an equal amount each year

through 1797, the amount needed to exhaust the remainder, see Table 3.1.

        On 1 September 1779, Congress set a $200 million limit for total net new emissions.57

Congress made sure it reached that limit by 29 November 1779, the day before the first

redemptions were scheduled to be received by the Continental Treasury. Thus, by the end of

1779 the states were required to remit 10,277,222 Continental dollars each year from 1780

through 1797 to the Continental Treasury to be burned. Eighteen years times 10,277,222 plus

15,000,000 for 1779 equals 199,989,995 net new Continental dollars actually emitted, versus the

$200 million Congress thought it had emitted, see Table 3.1. This number is net of some

undetermined amount of Continental dollars remitted by the states after 1779 that the resolution

allowed to be re-spent, rather than destroyed, to pay off loan-office certificate principal and

interest on loans issued before 1780. Total state remittances of Continental dollars after 1779,

therefore, had to be somewhat higher than $10,277,222 per year to achieve the permanent

removal of these re-spent Continental dollars from circulation.

         The current Board of Treasury that brought the 2 January 1779 resolution before

Congress consisted of Oliver Ellsworth, Elbridge Gerry, Richard Huston, Richard Henry Lee,

Gouverneur Morris, Edward Telfair, and John Witherspoon. Only Lee had been in Congress in

1775 for the debate and passage of the resolutions establishing the structural design and

redemption windows for the first two emissions of Continental dollars. Only Ellsworth, Gerry,

and Witherspoon from the Board of Treasury, however, were present in Congress for the 2

January 1779 vote on the resolution (members of the Board were all congressmen). The

resolution passed nine states to two, with only William Whipple of New Hampshire and John

Henry of Maryland opposed. Only six of the 23 congressmen voting on this resolution were

present in Congress in 1775 for the debates and passage of the resolutions establishing the

structural design and redemption windows for the first two emissions. These six included three

members of the New York delegation, namely John Jay, James Duane, and William Floyd;

Eliphalet Dyer of Connecticut; Samuel Adams of Massachusetts; and Francis Lightfoot Lee of

Virginia.58

present when that resolution passed.

emission #2 had been rejected by Congress, and Jay and Adams had sat on a committee that in

early 1776 had its proposal to call in all Continental dollars and replace them with much larger-

valued interest-bearer bonds rejected by Congress. For these three individuals, educating the

other congressmen in 1779 on the principles and rationale underlying Congress’ 1775 structural

design of the Continental dollar may not have been a priority or in their personal interest. It may

have even been outside their understanding. Whipple, who was not in Congress in 1775, but was

there in early 1776 and sat on the coin rating committee, may have absorbed enough about the

1775 structural design to understand that the changes to that design made by the 2 January 1779

resolution were problematic, thus explaining his vote against that resolution.59

           Establishing the time path of the ideal expected present value of Continental dollars

under the 2 January 1779 resolution comes with caveats. If these caveats are ignored, then that

ideal at the inception of emission #11 would become 62 percent of face value, which was 48 and

52 percentage points higher than that projected by Forecasts 1 and 2, respectively, see Table 3.4.

Figure 3.5 shows this revaluation in the ideal expected present value, and then how thereafter it

would slowly appreciated to face value by 1797.60 If this resolution was credible, a radical

revaluation of the Continental dollar would have been achieved.

           The 2 January 1779 resolution’s radical reevaluation of the ideal expected present value

of the Continental dollar, compared with Forecasts 1 and 2, was caused by substantially

shortening the redemption window from what prevailed in these forecasts. The resolution’s

redemption window ran for 18 years, from 1779 to 1797, with relatively more redeemed in the

first year than in subsequent years. By contrast, the redemption windows for Forecasts 1 and 2, at

the inception of emission #11, ran for 43 and 73 years, respectively. These windows also had

equal nominal amounts paid in each year. They were not frontloaded as the 2 January 1779

window was. Having more redeemed in the early years of a redemption window compared with

the latter years raised the ideal expected present value over that of an evenly spaced redemption

window. What Congress did with the 2 January 1779 resolution was consist with the advice sent

to them by the state Commissioners meeting in New Haven in January 1778 (discussed above).

These Commissioners recommended that Congress remedy the missing redemption instructions

for emissions after #2 by establishing a “short period” for the redemption. They thought that a

“short period” would give the public “confidence in the money” and “Establish its currency”.

Apparently Congress, in early 1779, agreed with this view.61

          While the 2 January 1779 resolution filled in the missing redemption instructions for the

eight preceding emissions, thus giving the system more certainty than before, it also altered the

redemption pattern set in the first two emissions passed by Congress in 1775. As such, the

expectations built into Forecasts 1 and 2 were no longer valid. Given that these expectations

were based on the likely fulfillment of ideal conditions, such as certainty of redemption at face

value in specie as promised, the ideal expected present value calculated under the 2 January 1779

resolution may be outside the bounds of reality.

          Emissions #1 and #2, and consequently Forecasts 1 and 2, were predicated on redemption

taxes being within historically acceptable and fiscally feasible limits. This allowed for the

calculation of an ideal expected present value. Table 3.4 shows that with emission #11, under the

2 January 1779 redemption structure, per year per white-capita taxes would need to be multiple

times above these historically acceptable and fiscally feasible levels. They were even multiple

times above the tax levels achieved by the Federal Government from 1792 through 1795 after it

had acquired direct taxing powers under the U.S. Constitution. These observations raise

questions about the fiscal credibility of the 2 January 1779 redemption structure and thus about

the presumed certainty of redemption as promised—an assumption needed to make an ideal

present value calculation. While the Board of Treasury in its preamble to the resolution intended

to “establish funds,” i.e. taxes, “without distressing the people,” it is hard to see the level of

implied taxation as anything short of “distressing.” As such, an ideal expected present value

calculation may not be valid for the 2 January 1779 redemption structure. The issue of credible

commitment will be taken up in more detail in a future paper.

        Given this caveat, the ideal expected present value of a Continental dollar under

Forecasts 1 and 2 are extended through emission #11 in Table 3.4 and Figure 3.5. These are

counterfactual ideal expected present value estimates under the assumption that the new

redemption window legislated in 1779 was not operative. They, rather than the 2 January 1779

redemption structure, should be used as the most credible benchmark against which empirical

measures of depreciation should be evaluated. Again, this is because the ideal must be based on

certainty of redemption and thus the fiscal credibility of the redemption taxes required. The 2

January 1779 redemption structure was not so based, while Forecasts 1 and 2 were.

        Finally, on 18 March 1780, Congress replaced the redemption structure legislated 2

January 1779 with a new redemption structure. States were now to redeem 15 million

Continental dollars each month over the next 13 months. Thirteen months times $15 million

equaled $195 million or 97.5 percent of the Continental dollars ever emitted. The remaining $5

million were due in the future from Georgia, which having been invaded was temporarily exempt

from sending remittances. The states were also allowed to substitute one Spanish silver dollar in

lieu of 40 Continental dollars when filling their quotas. The 18 March 1780 resolution did not



                                                                                                     59
remove the option citizens had to redeem their Continental dollars directly at the Continental

Treasury for their face value in specie, as stated in the 29 July and 26 December 1775 resolutions

and in congressional discussions on 14 June 1779.62

         Only six of the 28 congressmen, 21 percent, voting on the 18 March 1780 resolution had

voted on the 2 January 1779 resolution. While all six had voted for the 2 January 1779

resolution, two voted against the 18 March 1780 resolution, namely Thomas Burke of North

Carolina and Cyrus Griffin of Virginia. Only one member of the Board of Treasury crafting the 2

January 1779 resolution, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, was present and voted on the 18

March 1780 resolution, voting in favor. At best, only four of the 28 congressmen voting on the

18 March 1780 resolution, i.e. Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert R. Livingston and William

Floyd of New York, and Thomas McKean of Delaware or 14 percent, were congressmen in 1775

and present for at least some of the debate and passage of the initial structural design of the

Continental dollar embedded in the first two emissions. Of these, only McKean voted against the

18 March 1780 resolution. Finally, only Floyd, 3.6 percent, voted on both the 18 March 1780

and 2 January 1779 resolutions and was also present for part of the 1775 debate and passage of

the initial structural design of the Continental dollar.63 By 1780, there was little direct

institutional memory based on personal knowledge left in Congress regarding the rationale for

the initial structural design of the Continental dollar. The original designers, explainers, and

advocates were gone. No core group of congressmen involved with and voting on all monetary

and finance matters existed continuously from 1775 through 1780.

         The 18 March 1780 resolution passed six states in favor to five states opposed, with one

state divided. As such, this resolution was a more controversial change in redemption structure

than that passed on 2 January 1779. Interestingly, the vote split sharply on a North-South divide.

Not only did all the states south of Pennsylvania, i.e. Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North

Carolina, and South Carolina, vote against the resolution, but every single delegate from these

states voted against it (no vote from Georgia was recorded). By contrast, not only did every

single state north of Delaware vote in favor of the resolution (New Hampshire was divided), but

every single delegate from these states, with the exception of Nathaniel Peabody of New

Hampshire and John Fell of New Jersey, voted in favor of it.64 Explaining this North-South split

will be taken up in more detail in a future paper.

         As with the 2 January 1779 resolution, the time path of the ideal expected present value

of a Continental dollar under the 18 March 1780 resolution comes with caveats. If these caveats

are ignored, then the ideal expected present value of a Continental dollar would have instantly

appreciated to within a few percentage points of face value that year. However, Congress

allowed states to remit their quotes at a rate of 40 Continental dollars to one Spanish silver

dollar. If this rate was what states then turned around and used tax-wise to acquire Continental

dollars from their citizens, then the present value of a Continental dollar would be 2.5 percent of

its face value, see Table 3.4 and Figure 3.5. This present value, however, is predicated on

redemption being fully completed by May 1781, which it was not. Congress continued to credit

state remittances at the 40 to 1 paper to silver dollar rate into 1790.65

recommended on 20 March 1780 that the states “…revise their laws…making the continental

bills of credit a tender in discharge of debts and contracts, and to amend the same in such manner

as they shall judge most conducive to justice, in the present state of the paper currency…” From

late 1780 through mid-1781 states complied by revoking their laws making the Continental

dollar a legal tender in their respective states. For example, Delaware passed its law revoking the

legal tender status of the Continental dollar on 8 November 1780; New Jersey on 5 January

1781; Virginia on 5 May 1781; and Pennsylvania made its temporary suspension of legal tender

status permanent on 21 June 1781.66 The removal of legal tender laws in conjunction with the

new redemption structure legislated 18 March 1780 freed the states to redeem Continental

dollars from their citizens at whatever current value they wished to legislate or at whatever rate

they could impose on the market. It effectively broke the link between redemption per se and

redemption at face value in specie.

         The ideal present value calculation for the 18 March 1780 resolution is predicated on

redemption at face value being certain, i.e. fiscally feasible, which it was not. Table 3.4 shows

that the per year per white-capita tax level needed to accomplish the 18 March 1780 redemption

structure was multiple times above historically acceptable and fiscally feasible limits. Even using

the 40 to 1 paper to specie dollar conversion rate for state remittances, the per year per white-

capita tax level was still 6.6 time above that established in 1775 for the first two emissions of

Continental dollars. It was also 1.6 times above the level achieved by the Federal Government

from 1792 through 1795 after it had acquired direct taxing powers under the U.S. Constitution.

These observations raise questions about the fiscal credibility of this resolution’s redemption

structure and thus about the presumed certainty of redemption as promised, which is needed to

make an ideal expected present value calculation. Thus, an ideal expected present value

calculation may not be valid for the 18 March 1780 redemption structure. The issue of credible

commitment will be taken up in more detail in a future paper.

          Given these caveats, the calculated ideal expected present value of a Continental dollar

under the 18 March 1780 redemption may have been outside the bounds of reality. As such,

Forecasts 1 and 2 are used as counterfactual ideal expected present value estimates under the

assumption that the new redemption window legislated in 1780 was not operative. They, rather

than the 18 March 1780 redemption structure, should be used as the most credible benchmark

against which empirical measures of depreciation should be evaluated. Again, this is because the

ideal must be based on certainty of redemption, and thus the fiscal credibility of the redemption

taxes required. The 18 March 1780 redemption structure was not so based, while Forecasts 1 and

2 were.

          In summary, calculating the ideal expected present values of a Continental dollar for the

legislated redemption resolutions of 2 January 1779 and 18 March 1780 are dubious exercises.

Such calculations are outside the bounds of reality in that they entail tax levels that were not

realistic and so not credible in terms of the certainty of redemption. In their place, Forecasts 1

and 2 are projected past 1778 to 1790 as the best benchmark ideal expected present value of a

Continental dollar for these years, see Figure 3.5. These projections are counterfactual estimates

under the assumption that the 1779 and 1780 redemption resolutions were not operative. They

embed realistic constraints that make redemption fiscally credible and so certain. These

benchmarks will be used in future papers to evaluate empirical measures of depreciation and the

credibility of Congress’ commitment to the Continental dollar.

     THE CUMULATIVE VALUE OF CONTINENTAL DOLLARS EMITTED, 1775-1780

         Table 3.5 presents the cumulative value of Continental dollars emitted and currently

outstanding over the period of active emissions from August 1775 through November 1779. The

time-path of the cumulative face value, as well as the cumulative present value using Forecasts 1

and 2 under perfect foresight, are presented. For 1779, the cumulative present values, both for

the counterfactual applications of Forecasts 1 and 2 and for the new 2 January 1779 redemption

structure, are reported.

         When an amount was authorized, it was not instantly put into circulation. Some lag

existed between authorization and the spending of the bills by Congress. That lag is currently

unknown. From the comments in the JCC, the longest lag was with the first emission. Substantial

portions of that emission did not go into circulation until the fall of 1775. Thereafter, from the

statements by Congress that the Continental Treasury was empty prior to authorizing the next

issuance of bills, and from a rough tracking of the spending resolutions in the JCC, it appears

that each new authorized amount was spent between its initial authorization and the next

authorization of a new issuance of bills.67 Thus, the cumulative flows reported in Table 3.5 are

reasonably accurate from authorization date to authorization date.

         While the flow of spending between authorized amounts is currently unknown, the range

of that flow is depicted in Figure 3.7. Given that the public expected that a given authorized

amount would be spent before the next new amount was authorized, once Congress told the

public the amount being currently authorized, the public would know the amount that would be

soon spent. Therefore, because all bills from an authorization were put into circulation by the

next amount authorized, a low estimate of the amount currently in circulation is the cumulative

amount of past authorizations on the date Congress authorized the next new amount to be issued.

A high estimate is the cumulative amount of past authorizations on the date Congress authorized

the next new amount to be issued, inclusive of that new amount. Figure 3.7 presents these high

and low estimates for the cumulative face value in circulation over time. Up to mid-1777, the gap

between the high and low estimate is about $3 to $5 million. Between mid-1777 and mid-1778,

the gap is $1 to $3 million. After mid-1778 the gap grows to between $10 and $20 million.



                                                                                                                   66
Figure 3.7     Cumulative Value of Continental Dollars Emitted and Currently
               Outstanding from First Emission to Last, 1775 through 1780

       Sources and Notes: See Tables 3.5; Early American imprints (1983, microfiche S 269, nos. 16634, 16635;
       ‘U.S. Board of Treasury, 1779, A Table of First Year’s Interest. Philadelphia, 1779’ and ‘U.S. Board of
       Treasury, 1779. Table of the Sums Actually in Circulation. Philadelphia, 3 December 1779’, respectively).


       On 3 December 1779, the Board of Treasury reported the cumulative face value amount

in circulation each day from 1 June 1778 through 28 February 1779, and each day from 1 June

1779 through 28 February 1780. While the Board claimed these were the actual amounts in

circulation, they must have been estimates as the incremental increase from day to day is too

consistently the same number to capture the actual day-to-day flow of spending that put

Continental dollars into circulation. The Board’s report assumes that Continental dollar

emissions would total $200 million in face value with that entire sum still in circulation by the


                                                                                                              67
end of February 1780.

       Figure 3.7 shows the Board’s estimate. Except for a brief period in late 1779, the Board’s

estimate tracks the low estimate shown in Figure 3.7 for the cumulative face value in circulation.

This indicates that a good estimate of the cumulative face value amount in circulation on any

date would be to take the cumulative amount authorized so far in Table 3.5 and place that

amount on the date listed for the next authorized sum. The Board’s estimate also indicates that

they expected that the last sums authorized, those in late November 1779 amounting to $20

million in face value, would take three months to put into circulation.

       The trajectory of the cumulative face-value sums in circulation was approximately linear

from August 1775 through mid-1777, with $1,455,718 added on average each month. From

August 1777 through December 1777 this trajectory briefly flattened out, with only $600,000

added on average each month. This flattening of the trajectory coincided with the adoption of

legal tender laws. Thereafter, the trajectory changed to a steeper linear path, with $6,232,799

added on average each month from January 1778 through February 1780.

       Figure 3.7 also shows the cumulative amount in circulation in present value. The time-

path of these cumulative flows uses the low-estimate method, namely placing each sum

presented in Table 3.5 at the next authorization date and the last sum on 28 February 1780. From

August 1775 through March 1777, the cumulative present value in circulation, while rising at a

slower pace than the cumulative face value, was roughly half that of the cumulative face value.

The trajectories of the cumulative face value and the cumulative present value parted ways

around March of 1777. This departure coincided with the adoption of legal tender laws, and

illustrates the dramatic effect those laws had on the cumulative present value of Continental

dollars compared with their cumulative face value. From March to June 1777, cumulative



                                                                                                  68
present values collapsed 30 to 40 percent, while cumulative face values continued to grow.

Cumulative present values did not recover to their March 1777 level until between October 1778

and January 1779.

       The temporary gain in the purchasing power of new emissions gained by Congress with

the adoption of legal tender laws, see Figure 3.4, coincided with the deceleration in the growth of

the cumulative face value in circulation from March 1777 to January 1778. This gain came not

only at the cost of the collapse in the present value of the cumulative sums in the hands of the

public, but at the cost of accelerating the eventual collapse of the Continental dollar financing

system. Figure 3.7 shows that beginning in 1778 the growth in cumulative face value accelerated

relative to the growth in cumulative present values. The relatively constant widening gap

between their trajectories before March 1777 became an accelerating widening gap. It took an

ever increasing amount of face value emissions to generate a given increase in cumulative

present values. This widening gap meant that after January 1778 the Continental dollar financial

system would be unsustainable in the long run—a long run that was likely not that far off.

       Table 3.5 and Figure 3.7 also illustrate the idealized effort by Congress on 2 January

1779 to reflate present values through the adoption of a new redemption structure. If that

structure had been credible, it would have pushed the cumulative present value to approximately

62 percent of the cumulative face value. In addition, the trajectory of this cumulative present

value through 1779 would have been only slightly less than that for the cumulative face value,

roughly $5 million versus $8 million added on average per month, respectively. If this

redemption plan had worked, it would have made the Continental dollar financial system

sustainable for much longer. Figure 3.7 helps make sense of what Congress was attempting to do

in 1779 compared with the continue-as-before alternative. That they failed to understand that a



                                                                                                    69
successful execution of this change was unlikely will be taken up in future papers.

          Table 3.4 and Figure 3.5 provide the key points of this paper. The time-paths illustrated

by Forecasts 1 and 2 are the ideal present values of a Continental dollar under certainty of

redemption and zero depreciation. Future papers will use these present values as benchmarks to

evaluate empirical measures of depreciation and the ideal present value of loan office

certificates. Figures 3.4, 3.5, and 3.7 also illustrate the importance of legal tender laws. Their

adoption dramatically altered the present value of the Continental dollar. The history, purpose,

costs, and benefits of these laws—what they could and could not do—were poorly understood by

contemporaries and in current scholarship (Grubb 2012b). Because understanding legal tender

laws is critical to the story, they will be addressed in more detail with regard to the Continental

dollar in a future paper.
