                                             ABSTRACT

Objective: We evaluated the impact of Seguro Popular (SP), a program introduced in 2001 in Mexico
primarily to finance health care for the poor. We studied the effect of SP on pregnant women's access
to obstetrical services.

Data: We analyzed the cross-sectional 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT), focusing
on the responses of 3,890 women who delivered babies during 2001-2006 and whose households lacked
employer-based health care coverage.

Methods: We formulated a multinomial probit model that distinguished between three mutually exclusive
sites for delivering a baby: a health unit accredited by SP; a clinic run by the Department of Health
(Secretaría de Salud, or SSA); and private obstetrical care. Our model accounted for the endogeneity
of the household's binary decision to enroll in the SP program.

Results: Women in households that participated in the SP program had a much stronger preference
for having a baby in a SP-sponsored unit rather than paying out of pocket for a private delivery. At
the same time, participation in SP was associated with a stronger preference for delivering in the private
sector rather than at a state-run SSA clinic. On balance, the Seguro Popular program reduced pregnant
women's attendance at an SSA clinic much more than it reduced the probabilityof delivering a baby in the
private sector. The impacts of the SP program at the individual and population levels varied with the
woman's education and health, as well as the assets and location (rural versus urban) of the household.

Conclusions: The SP program had a robust, significantly positive impact on access to obstetrical services.
Our finding that women enrolled in SP switched from non-SP state-run facilities, rather than from
out-of-pocket private services, is important for public policy and requires further exploration.

1.      Introduction

        This paper contributes to three important strands in the health economics

literature. First, we add to the emerging body of knowledge on the impacts of novel

public policies to finance the health care of the poor in developing economies (Gaviria,

Medina et al. (2006); Trujillo, Portillo et al. (2005); Wagstaff (2007); Wagstaff, Lindelow

et al. (2007)), including recent innovative interventions in Mexico (Knaul and Frenk

(2005); Frenk, Sepulveda et al. (2003); Gakidou, Lozano et al. (2006); Sepúlveda,

Bustreo et al. (2006)). We find that the recently established “Seguro Popular” (or

“People’s Insurance”) program in Mexico has had a robust, significantly positive effect

on the access of poor women to obstetrical care, an important outcome measure of

maternal and infant health.

        Second, we add to the growing literature on the use of multinomial discrete choice

models of the selection of health care providers, including Schwartz, Akin et al. (1988) in

the setting of the Philippines, Akin, Guilkey et al. (1995) in Nigeria, Bolduc, Lacroix et

al. (1996) in Benin, and Leonard (2007) in Tanzania, as well as recent path-breaking

work on multi-equation models involving discrete variables (Balia and Jones (2004);

Deb, Munkin et al. (2006)) . We formulate a multinomial probit model that distinguishes

between three mutually exclusive sites for delivering a baby: a health unit specifically

accredited by Seguro Popular (SP); a non-SP-accredited clinic run by the Department of

Health (Secretaría de Salud, or SSA); and private obstetrical services. In what appears to

be the first instance of such a technique, we then modify the standard multinomial probit

model to explicitly account for the possible endogeneity of the household’s binary

decision to participate in Seguro Popular. Women in households that participated in the




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                        Page 5


SP program, we find, had a much stronger preference for having a baby in a SP-

sponsored unit rather than paying out of pocket for a private delivery. At the same time,

participation in SP was associated with a stronger preference for delivering in the private

sector rather than at an SSA-sponsored clinic. On balance, the Seguro Popular program

reduced pregnant women’s attendance at an SSA-sponsored clinic much more than it

reduced the probability of delivering a baby in the private sector.

        Third, we contribute to the nascent but expanding body of work on the

heterogeneous impacts of policy interventions in the developing world, including the

effect of antiretroviral treatment on labor force participation in Western Kenya

(Thirumurthy, Zivin et al. (2006)), the effect of conditional cash transfers on schooling

and nutrition in Nicaragua (Dammert (2007)) and Mexico (Djebbari and Smith (2005);

Chávez-Martín del Campo (2006)). Here, we find that the quantitative impacts of the SP

program at both the individual and population levels varied with the woman’s education

and health, as well as the assets and location (rural versus urban) of the household.

        In Section 2, we review the problem of access to obstetric care for poor women in

Mexico, the basic structure of the Mexican health care system, and the introduction of

Seguro Popular in 2001. In Section 3, we describe a discrete household decision-making

model concerning the use obstetrical services, which shows how a demand-side subsidy

such as Seguro Popular can affect the household’s relative ranking of service sites.

Section 4 explicitly converts our model into econometric form, and takes into account the

potential endogeneity of the decision to participate in Seguro Popular, as well as our

strategy for evaluating heterogeneous impacts. Section 5 describes our database, the

2006 National Survey of Health and Nutrition (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición,




                                              02-Oct-2007

or ENSANUT; see Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (2006)). Section 6 details our

empirical results. Section 7 summarizes our findings, discusses the limitations of our

research, and considers its implications for public policy and future research on health

policy in developing economies.




2.      Mexico’s Health Care System and the “Seguro Popular” Program


2.1.     Health Care Access and Financing in Mexico

        Historically, access to health insurance coverage in Mexico was tied to

employment in certain sectors of the formal economy. The principal sources of coverage

for workers in these sectors were the Mexican Social Insurance Institute (Instituto

Mexicano del Seguro Social, or IMSS), the Government Workers’ Social Security and

Services Institute (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del

Estado, or ISSSTE), as well as insurance programs for employees of such state-run

enterprises as PEMEX (petroleum) and SEDENA (national defense). Workers outside

these specific sectors and participants in the informal economy had to attend government-

sponsored facilities through the Department of Health (Secretaría de Salud, or SSA) or

pay out of pocket for medical care at private hospitals or doctors’ offices. These private

facilities varied considerably in price, quality, and availability. On the one hand, a

modern network of private health services for the middle and upper classes, located

mainly in urban areas, served those individuals who had insurance coverage or could pay

out of pocket for their health care. On the other hand, lower-priced private health

services of variable quality, including informal providers such as midwives and



                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                       Page 7


traditional healers, were available to poor urban and rural families (Parker and Wong

(1997); Nigenda, Troncoso et al. (2003); Pagan, Puig et al. (2007)).

        The poorest households in the informal sector were thus left with essentially three

options: foregoing health care; seeking whatever care was available from state-sponsored

SSA clinics or other low-cost informal providers; or spending a large part of their income

on private health care. This has, in fact, been the predicament of the poor in many

developing economies (Wagstaff (2007)).

        In recent years, Mexico has adopted public policies intended to overcome these

historical inequalities in health care coverage (Frenk, Sepulveda et al. (2003)). One

especially important initiative has been PROGRESA (Program for Education, Health and

Nutrition), later renamed Oportunidades, an incentive-based subsidy program designed to

improve the health, nutrition and education of poor families with children (Behrman and

Skoufias (2006); Gertler (2000); Gertler (2004); Hoddinott and Skoufias (2004); Skoufias

and Parker (2001; Skoufias (2005)). While PROGRESA/Oportunidades has increased

poor families’ demand for preventive health services and some types of primary care,

coverage for more advanced forms of care has remained lacking. For a poor family,

essentially any major illness requiring secondary or tertiary medical care was

catastrophic.


2.2.    Seguro Popular

        In 2001, the government of Mexico launched Seguro Popular, a major new effort

to improve access of the poor to qualified public health services. The Seguro Popular

program specifically targeted poor families in both urban and rural areas of Mexico

without access to any other form of private or public coverage (Torres and Knaul (2003)).


                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                     Page 8


Under this voluntary insurance plan, a household makes subsidized contributions, based

on ability to pay, to a public fund to prevent catastrophic spending on health care (Frenk,

Sepulveda et al. (2003)). Access to primary, secondary and more advanced medical care

is guaranteed and provided mainly through a publicly sponsored network of ambulatory

health units, general and specialized hospitals. All SP-sponsored health facilities are

certified as providing a minimum level of quality of care. Health centers and hospitals

are accredited on the basis of their infrastructure, equipment, health personnel, range of

medical services and other criteria.

        In order to accommodate the lengthy process of health unit accreditation, Seguro

Popular was rolled out gradually during 2001–2005. Five states (Aguascalientes,

Campeche, Colima, Jalisco and Tabasco) were incorporated into the program in 2001 as

part of a pilot study. An additional 15 states were integrated in the program in 2002; four

more states were incorporated in 2003; and the remaining states were incorporated in

during 2004 and 2005. By the end of 2005, all 32 of Mexico’s states had been

incorporated, and approximately 4 million families (comprising approximately 12 million

individuals) had signed up for the voluntary program (Secretaría de Salud (2006)).


2.3.    Maternal Health Services

        Access to adequate maternal health care is important for the health of both mother

and infant. During the past two decades, policy makers in Mexico have adopted three

different approaches in pursuit of this objective. One approach has been to enhance

access to services within the existing system of state-run SSA-sponsored clinics. A

second strategy, embodied in the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program, provides specific

economic incentives to poor families for seeking preventive health services, including


                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                        Page 9


prenatal care for pregnant women. The third strategy, reinforced by the Seguro Popular

program, entails investment in adequate infrastructure for the provision of the full range

of maternal health services, including gynecologic and obstetric care, to women of low

socioeconomic status.

        The first approach has had limited impact. In some cases, those state-run SSA-

sponsored units that did provide some obstetrical services lacked the full range of drugs

and equipment, hired deficiently trained personnel, and maintained reduced hours of

operation. As a consequence, a significant proportion of pregnant women preferred

delivering their babies in the private sector, even though they had direct contact with

state-run health facilities for their prenatal care, and even though many private-sector

providers were unqualified midwives and traditional birth attendants. This reversal of

preferences has been observed in other developing economies (Schwartz, Akin et al.

(1988)).

        The second approach has met with some success. There is evidence that the

PROGRESA/Oportunidades program enhanced the use of formal prenatal health services

by the poorest pregnant women (Gertler (2000); Gertler (2004)). However, the approach

did not clearly improve access to obstetrical care, especially in rural areas. During 1998–

2001, thirty-four percent of births in rural areas were attended by private providers,

including traditional midwives (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (2000)). The

principal explanation for this phenomenon was limited access to modern obstetrical

facilities in rural areas.

        The first approach, which focused on improving access to basic reproductive

health services available through the SSA, was associated with decline in maternal



                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                      Page 10


mortality at the national level since 1993 (Mojarro, Tapia-Colocia et al. (2003)).

However, such improvements in maternal mortality were not seen in the poorest areas of

the country, and substantial regional variations in maternal mortality persisted. During

1997–1999, the national maternal mortality rate was 6.16 per 10,000 live births, with

rates of 5.21 and 7.38 in urban and rural areas, respectively, and rates as high as 10.0 in

the state of Oaxaca, 9.5 in Tlaxcala, and 9.0 in Chiapas (Mojarro, Tapia-Colocia et al.

(2003)). These inequalities in maternal mortality have been attributed to inadequate

provision of maternal health services in the poorest regions of the country.

        One objective of the Seguro Popular program has been to remedy these persistent

deficiencies in maternal health services. Apart from subsidizing health insurance

coverage, the program has invested considerable resources in improving the quality and

availability of secondary medical provided in public facilities, including obstetric care.

Accordingly, in the present research, we sought to evaluate whether enrollment in SP has

specifically improved pregnant women’s attendance at SP-accredited obstetrical

facilities. Given poor women’s historical preference for private obstetrical services over

state-run facilities, we therefore distinguished between three different sites of care: an

SP-accredited obstetric facility; a non-SP state-run health unit; and a private provider,

including physicians and midwives delivering in hospitals or at home.




3.      Theoretical Model

        We begin with a deterministic model of utility maximization by a single,

representative household. We then address issues of heterogeneity across multiple

households and introduce a stochastic component to our model.


                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                         Page 11


3.1.    Deterministic Single-Household Model with Discrete Choice

        Although a household may have multiple members, we assume that it makes its

consumption decisions as a unified entity. Furthermore, we assume that one member of

the household is a pregnant woman who must decide where to have her baby. We posit a

strictly quasi-concave household utility function


(1)      U ( z0 , z1 , z2 , x, c )


where ( z0 , z1 , z2 ) denotes the pregnant woman’s consumption of obstetric care at each of

three different sites, where x measures the consumption of other forms of medical care

by any one of the household members, and where c is all other consumption. The three

possible sites of care include: z0 , a site run by the Department of Health (Secretaría de

Salud, or SSA); z1 , a facility specifically accredited by Seguro Popular (SP); or z2 ,

delivery by a physician or midwife in a private facility or at home. While we specify

only three possible sites, our model can be generalized to any larger number of sites. The

household’s budget constraint is


(2)      q0 z0 + q1z1 + q2 z2 + px + c = m


where ( q0 , q1 , q2 ) are the respective prices of obstetric care (net of insurance coverage) at

the three sites, where p is the net price of other medical care, where all other

consumption has a unit price, and where m is household income. We impose the

following non-negativity conditions


(3)      zi ! 0 , x ! 0 , c ! 0 , m > 0 , p > 0 , qi > 0



                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                      Page 12




In particular, the medical care net prices p and qi are assumed to include time and

transportation costs, so that they remain strictly positive even with full coverage.

        We further assume that the three different sites of obstetric care represent

mutually exclusive alternatives. In imposing such a constraint, we focus specifically on

the site of obstetric care where the pregnant woman chooses to deliver her baby, as

opposed to the sites at which she may seek prenatal care or to which she may be

transferred for treatment of postpartum complications. Our constraint on the site of care

converts the standard maximization model into a discrete choice problem.


(4)      z0 z1z2 = 0


        The household’s problem is to maximize the utility function (1) subject to the

constraints (2) through (4). The problem is solved in two steps. First, we define the

conditional utility functions


         u0 ( z0 , x, c ) = U ( z0 , 0, 0, x, c )
(5)      u1 ( z1 , x, c ) = U ( 0, z1 , 0, x, c )
         u2 ( z2 , x, c ) = U ( 0, 0, z2 , x, c )



For each i = 0,1, 2 , we maximize the conditional utility function


(6)      max ui ( zi , x, c )
         zi , x,c




subject to the conditional budget constraint


(7)      qi zi + px + c = m


                                                    02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                                        Page 13




        For each i = 0,1, 2 , let zi* ( qi , p, m ) , xi* ( qi , p, m ) , and ci* ( qi , p, m ) be the

corresponding conditional demand functions, and let


(8)                              (
         wi* ( qi , p, m ) = u zi* , xi* , ci*   )

be the corresponding indirect utility function conditional upon choosing site i . The

               {             }
quantities w0* , w1* , w2* provide a complete ordering among the conditional indirect

utilities for the three obstetric sites. The second step is to choose the site i of obstetric

care that yields the largest conditional indirect utility, that is,


(9)      max wi* ( qi , p, m )
           i




This two-step procedure not only yields an unconditional demand for a specific site zi ,

but also a specific quantity x of non-obstetric care. For future reference, we define the

discrete variable y1 as follows:


(10)                                 {
         y1 = i if wi* = max w0* , w1* , w2*         }

where y1 thus depends implicitly on prices q0 , q1 , q2 , p and income m .


3.2.    Effect of Changes in Price

        Seguro Popular subsides medical care for the entire household, and not simply for

individual members. Specifically, the program subsidizes non-obstetric medical care x

for all household members, as well as obstetric care, z1 , at a SP-sponsored site.

Equivalently, Seguro Popular reduces in the respective net prices p and q1 . Although


                                                         02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                             Page 14


the effects of these price reductions on the conditional demand functions are

straightforward, the effects on the unconditional demand functions are more complicated.

        First consider the effect of changes in prices p and q1 on the conditional demand

functions zi* ( qi , p, m ) and xi* ( qi , p, m ) . If the pregnant woman has chosen Seguro

Popular ( y1 = 1) , then we would ordinarily expect the own-price effects on conditional

                                     !x1*        !z *                                   !z *
demand to be negative, that is,           < 0 and 1 < 0 . The sign of cross-price effect 1
                                     !p          !q1                                    !p

will depend on whether SP-sponsored obstetrical care is a complement or substitute for

other types of medical care consumed by the household. For example, if these additional

types of care include pediatric care for newborns, prenatal or postpartum care for the

mother, or medical care for other family members who provide for the newborn child,

                                                            !z1*
then we would expect a complementary relationship, that is,      < 0 . On the other hand,
                                                            !p

if the additional care represents treatment for an elderly grandparent who does not

provide care for the newborn child, then we might expect to observe the opposite sign,

         !z1*
that is,      > 0.
         !p

        Continuing to focus on conditional demand, we note that if the pregnant woman

has instead chosen another site of obstetric care ( y1 ! 1) , then the cross-price effect of

                                                                      !zi*
subsidizing care at a SP-sponsored site is necessarily zero, that is,      = 0 . However, the
                                                                      !q1

                                                            !zi*
cross-price effect of subsidizing other medical care             can still be positive or negative.

Again, the sign depends on whether the additional care is a complement or substitute for

the mother’s obstetric care at site i ! 1 .

        Now consider the effects of changes in price on unconditional demand. Here, a

change in the price q1 of SP-sponsored care or in the price p of non-obstetric care can

alter the utility ordering of the alternatives. Since the conditional indirect utility function

w1* ( q1 , p, m ) is a decreasing function of both q1 and p , it is obvious that a reduction in

the price q1 of SP-sponsored care or in the price p of non-obstetric care will increase

wi* . Such price reductions may thus move the SP-sponsored site to a higher relative

position in the household’s utility ordering. However, our model does not require that

these price reductions necessarily place a Seguro Popular-sponsored site at the top of the

household’s ranking.

        What is more, a reduction in the price p of non-obstetric care can also affect the

relative ranking of the non-SP-sponsored obstetrical sites. The change in relative ranking

can operate through either the income effect or the substitution effect of a reduction in the

price p . The income effect, in particular, will tend to increase the consumption of those

types of obstetric care that are regarded as normal good and tend to decrease the

consumption of those types of obstetric care that are regarded as an inferior good. To the

extent that households regard SSA-sponsored obstetrical care z0 as an inferior good, a

subsidy of non-obstetric care could thus lower the relative ranking of a delivery at a SSA-

sponsored site. In concrete terms, SP’s subsidy of medications, doctor visits and

hospitalizations for all household members thus puts money in the family’s pocket, which

is then spent on those types of obstetric care that are normal goods and diverted away

from public SSA-sponsored obstetric care that is regarded as an inferior good.


                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                          Page 16


        What is less obvious, however, is that a reduction in the price p can also

influence the relative ranking of the obstetrical sites through the substitution effect,

without any requirement that one form of obstetrical care be an inferior good. Thus, a

decrease in p will not only increase the compensated demand for non-obstetrical care x ,

but it will also increase the consumption of any type of obstetric care that is a

compensated complement and decrease the consumption of any other type of obstetric

care that is a compensated substitute. Hence, SP’s subsidy of non-obstetric care for all

household members can raise the ranking of a private delivery if private obstetrical care

is highly complementary with non-obstetrical care. In concrete terms, Seguro Popular

thus raises the household’s valuation of a private delivery because it subsidizes the

evaluation of the newborn baby by a pediatrician in the hospital immediately after

delivery.

        In Appendix A, we illustrate the foregoing effect of a change in the price p of

non-obstetric care by means of a specific utility function.


3.3.    Introducing Heterogeneity and Stochastic Components

        We let the binary variable y2 represent the household’s decision to enroll in

Seguro Popular, where y2 = 1 if the household enrolls in SP, and y2 = 0 otherwise.

Since enrollment in Seguro Popular affects the net prices q1 and p , we can write the

household’s conditional indirect utility functions wi* as functions of y2 as well.

Moreover, there are likely to be other observed and unobserved determinants of the

household’s indirect utility. We summarize these considerations in the specification:


(11)     wi* = wi* ( qi , p, m, y2 , X ) + ! i


                                                 02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                             Page 17




where X is a vector of observed characteristics of the household, and where ! i is an

unobserved stochastic component with zero mean.




4.      Econometric Model

        We now specify a formal econometric structure on our theoretical model,

imposing functional forms on the indirect utility functions and making specific

distributional assumptions about the unobserved stochastic components. We address

issues of parameter identification, and display our measures of impact on specific

populations. Finally, we describe tests for heterogeneity of our model.


4.1.    Model Specification and Likelihood Function

        For a specific household, we write:


         w0* = X0! " 0 + # 0 y2 + $ 0
(12)     w1* = X1!"1 + # 1 y2 + $1 ;                                     {
                                                    y1 = i if wi* = max w0* , w1* , w2*   }
         w2* = 0


where ( X0 , X1 ) are vectors of observable explanatory variables, where ( ! 0 , !1 ) are

conformal vectors of unknown parameters, and where (! 0 , ! 1 ) are additional unknown

coefficients of the variable y2 that indicates enrollment in Seguro Popular. For clarity, in

equation (12), we have omitted subscripts that refer to the specific household. Only the

site of obstetric care with the highest indirect utility is observed as the discrete variable

y1 . In addition, we have specified a linear model for the determinants of indirect utility,

subsuming prices and income within the vectors of observable determinants ( X1 , X2 ) .


                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                       Page 18


Given that we observed only the choice with the highest indirect utility, we recognize that

we can identify only the differences in indirect utility, and therefore we set the utility of

private obstetric care equal to zero. Finally, we assume that the stochastic terms ! 0 and

!1 are independent unit normal N ( 0,1) variables.

        We further specify a probit model of enrollment in Seguro Popular:


                                                         "0, if y2* < 0
(13)     y = X2! " 2 + # 2 ;
          *
                                                    y2 = #
                                                         $1, if y2 ! 0
          2                                                      *




where y2* is an unobserved latent variable, where X2 is a vector of determinants of the

decision to enroll, where ! 2 is a conformal vector of unknown parameters, and where ! 2

is a stochastic error term.

        While the Mexican government has phased in Seguro Popular over time, thus

determining when specific communities will be eligible for the program, the household’s

enrollment nonetheless remains a voluntary decision. Accordingly, we cannot exclude

the possibility that the binary variable y2 is endogenous. This potential endogeneity is

captured by correlations between the error term ! 2 in equation (13) and the error terms

! 0 and !1 in equation (12). We parameterize these correlations as follows:


(14)     ! 2 = " 0! 0 + " 1!1 + #


where ! 0 and ! 1 are unknown parameters, and where ! is a unit normal N ( 0,1)

random variable that is distributed independently of ! 0 and !1 . This error structure

admits two types of unobserved heterogeneity. When the parameter ! 0 is non-zero,




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                                    Page 19


households have unobserved characteristics that influence their decision to enroll in SP

and, at the same time, influence the pregnant woman’s preferences for SSA-sponsored

public clinic over private health care. When the parameter ! 1 is non-zero, households

have unobserved characteristics that influence their decision to enroll in SP and, at the

same time, influence the pregnant woman’s preferences for an SP-sponsored unit over a

private site.

        Given (14), the error terms ( ! 0 , !1 , ! 2 ) are joint normally distributed:


         " !0 %    )" 0 % " 1      0        (0       %,
(15)     $ ! ' ~ N +$ 0 ' , $ 0    1        (1       '.
         $ 1'      +$ ' $                            '.
         # !2 &    +*# 0 & # ( 0   ( 1 1 + ( 0 + ( 1 & .-
                                             2     2




with correlation coefficients Corr ( ! 0 , ! 2 ) = "0 = # 0     $ and Corr ( !1 , ! 2 ) = "1 = # 1       $,

where ! = 1 + " 02 + " 12 . The variance-covariance matrix of the error terms is positive

definite for all values of the parameters ! 0 and ! 1 .

        We estimate the parameters ! = ( ! 0 , !1 , ! 2 ) , ! = (! 0 , ! 1 ) , ! = (! 0 , ! 1 ) in the

model of equations (11) through (13) by maximum likelihood. The details of construction

of the likelihood function and parameter estimation are given in Appendix B.


4.2.    Parameter Identification

        To identify the parameters of our structural model, we impose exclusion

restrictions on the explanatory variables in X = ( X0 , X1 , X2 ) . Specifically, we took

advantage of the fact that Seguro Popular has been gradually phased in over time in

different states within Mexico. We therefore constructed three dummy variables,



                                               02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                                           Page 20


indicating whether the woman’s locality of residence had been formally incorporated into

Seguro Popular by the years 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. In particular, a woman

living in a locality that was not incorporated until 2005 would have zero-values for all

three dummy variables, and thus serves as a reference case. Because SP was only in the

pilot phase during 2001, we did not specify a dummy variable for that year. We included

the three dummy variables in the participation equation (13) but excluded them from the

health care utilization equations (12).


4.3.       Measures of Impact: Individual versus Population


                                                           (       )
           Given estimates of the parameters !ˆ , "ˆ , #̂ , we can compute the respective


                                        {                              }
probabilities Pi! j ( X ) = Pr y1 = i, y2 = j X, "ˆ , #ˆ , $̂ , where i = 0,1, 2 and j = 0,1 , for

any given vector of household characteristics X . Given these joint probabilities, we can

                                                                           Pi! j ( X )
                                                          j( )
compute the conditional probabilities Pi                    X =                             , where, for example,
                                                                  Pi!0 ( X ) + Pi!1 ( X )

P2   1   (X)   denotes the predicted probability that a woman in a household with exogenous

characteristics X will choose a private obstetrical site given that the household is

enrolled in Seguro Popular. We can also compute the probability of enrollment in SP,


                            {                        }
that is, P1 ( X ) = Pr y2 = 1 X, !ˆ , "ˆ , #̂ = P0$1 ( X ) + P1$1 ( X ) + P2$1 ( X ) .

           At the level of the individual, our measure of the impact of SP on the probability

of choosing site i = 0,1, 2 is difference in conditional probabilities, that is,


(16)       I i ( X ) = Pi   1   ( X ) ! Pi 0 ( X )



                                                         02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                           Page 21


We note that, for a fixed vector of maternal and household characteristics X , the three

measures of impact of Seguro Popular necessarily sum to zero, that is,

I 0 ( X ) + I1 ( X ) + I 2 ( X ) = 0 . At the population level, our measure of the impact of SP on

the probability of choosing site i = 0,1, 2 is the difference in joint probabilities


(17)     Ri ( X ) = Pi!1 ( X ) " Pi!0 ( X )


The quantities Ri ( X ) measure the impact of the Seguro Popular program as a policy

intervention, because they account explicitly for the probability of enrolling in SP, and

not simply the individual treatment effect conditional on SP enrollment. Although a

pregnant woman without SP was not legally entitled to have a baby at an SP-sponsored

unit, we did not impose the constraints that P1      0   (X) = 0   and P1!0 ( X ) = 0 .

        We took advantage of the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood

            (       )
          ˆ ",ˆ #̂ to compute approximate 95% confidence intervals for the impact
estimates !,

measures I i ( X ) and Ri ( X ) . Specifically, we made repeated random draws from a


                                                          (        )
                                                 ˆ ",ˆ #̂ and estimated asymptotic
multivariate joint normal distribution with mean !,


variance-covariance matrix V̂ , and with each draw recomputed the impact measures

I i ( X ) and Ri ( X ) for a fixed value of X . The confidence intervals for each impact

measure were then computed from the range of recomputed values of I i ( X ) and Ri ( X ) .


4.4.    Analysis of Heterogeneity of Impact

        Because our model is nonlinear, the marginal effects of changes in the principal

treatment variable (that is, affiliation with Seguro Popular, or y2 ) depend on the values of


                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                        Page 22


the explanatory variables (that is, maternal and household characteristics, or X ).

Although it is commonplace to report these marginal effects at the sample means, we

focused on the extent of heterogeneity in the impact of Seguro Popular at the individual

and population levels. We therefore computed the impact measures I i ( X ) and Ri ( X )

for four prototypical households or “cases,” that is, four different sets of explanatory

variables X .


4.5.     Comparison with Simplified Bivariate Probit Model

         We compared our multinomial choice model (12) with a simplified bivariate

probit model, in which a pregnant woman has only two choices: a birth attended at a SP-

sponsored facility ( y1 = 1) , or a birth elsewhere ( y1 = 0 ) . In place of equation (12), we

write:


         w1* = X1!"1 + # 1 y2 + $1
(18)
         w =0
           *
                                     ;                          {
                                            y1 = i if wi* = max w0* , w1*   }
           0




which is equivalent to a probit specification in which a non-SP obstetric facility is the

reference category. Retaining equation (13) for y2 and setting ! 0 = 0 in equation (14),

we obtain a two-equation probit model with a discrete endogenous variable (that is, y2 )

and an unconstrained correlation coefficient between the error terms. Such a model can

be estimated by maximum likelihood as if it were a simple bivariate probit model without

endogenous variables. (See, for example, p. 183 in Maddala (1983) and p. 853 in Greene

(2000).) For this purpose, we used the “biprobit” routine in Stata (StataCorp (2005)).

5.      Data


5.1.    ENSANUT Survey Data and Analytical Sample

        Our principal source of data is the 2006 Mexican National Health and Nutrition

Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición, or ENSANUT), conducted during

November 2005 – May 2006 (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (2006)), a nationally

representative cross-section of 48,304 households containing 206,700 individuals.

ENSANUT contained information on respondents’ education, employment,

socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, prevalence of self-reported acute and

chronic illnesses, as well as health care utilization and source of payment.

        We focused on the 5,988 female respondents of reproductive age (15–49 years)

who reported having delivered their last baby during 2001–2006. We then excluded

1,900 respondents who reported delivering at a facility sponsored by employer-based

health insurance (IMSS, ISSSTE, and PEMEX), as well as an additional 198 observations

that had missing values of the explanatory variables to be described below. These

exclusions resulted in a sample of 3,890, which served as the principal basis for our

statistical analyses. We refer to this sample as the analytic sample.

        Households covered by Mexico’s employer-based plans are not legally entitled to

participate in Seguro Popular. Accordingly, the exclusion of households covered by

employer-based plans permitted us to focus sharply on the target population eligible for

the Seguro Popular program. Given the lack of flexibility in Mexico’s labor market, we

considered it unlikely that our exclusion of women covered by employer-based plans

produced a significant bias of self-selection. Nonetheless, in order to check the

sensitivity of our results to our exclusion criterion, we repeated our analyses with two



                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                       Page 24


alternative samples that were not drawn on the basis of household insurance coverage:

(1) an enlarged sample of 5,762 adult women who had a baby since 2001 and who had no

missing values for any explanatory variables; and (2) a restricted sample of 1,934 adult

women whose household resided in a locality with a moderately high or very high index

of socioeconomic marginality (“índice de marginación”) (CONAPO (2005)).


5.2.    Dependent Variables

        As noted in Section 4, our two discrete dependent variables were: y1 , the site of

obstetric care; and y2 , the binary decision to enroll in Seguro Popular. With respect to

the former, each respondent to ENSANUT who had her last baby during 2001–2006 was

asked where she delivered her baby. (Specifically, question 9.15 of the Adult

Questionnaire inquired: “¿En dónde le atendieron su último parto?” See Instituto

Nacional de Salud Pública (2006).) With respect to the latter, the person in charge of the

household (“la persona responsable del hogar”) was asked about each household

member’s medical coverage. (Specifically, question 2.08 of the Household

Questionnaire inquired: “¿Está [NOMBRE] afiliado o inscrito a algún seguro médico?”)

        Table 1 shows the joint distribution of the two dependent variables in our analytic

sample of 3,890 women. Among the households who did not participate in SP, nearly

half paid out of pocket for obstetrical services in the private sector, while the other half

had their babies in clinics sponsored by the Secretaría de Salud. Among the households

that did participate in SP, the great majority of women (72 percent) had their babies in an

SP-sponsored unit, but nearly 21 percent still paid out of pocket for private obstetrical

services.




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                      Page 25


        Given that the measurement of these dependent variables was based on self-

reported survey responses, we performed a number of checks for reliability. To check

whether the decision to participate in Seguro Popular is made at the household level, we

verified that 90 percent of the respondents who reported themselves as enrolled in SP

belonged to households in which the remaining members were likewise enrolled in the

SP program. Moreover, we verified that 95 percent of the women reporting participation

in SP lived in a household where the person in charge reported a date of affiliation in SP

for at least one household member. (Questions 8.03 and 8.04 of the Household

Questionnaire inquired, respectively, “¿Alguna de las personas que componen su hogar

ha estado inscrita en el Seguro Popular de Salud?” and “¿En qué fecha se inscribieron al

Seguro Popular?”)

        We also addressed the possibility that some women who reported current SP

participation were not in fact eligible for SP at the time of their delivery. Seguro Popular

was rolled out gradually over time in different states throughout Mexico, with most states

enrolling in 2002–2004 and all states enrolled by 2005. The official dates of

incorporation of each state in SP need to be regarded as approximate, as many localities

may not have complied with legally established deadlines. In a separate sensitivity

analysis, we reclassified a total of 195 women as not enrolled in SP and not delivering a

baby in an SP-accredited facility if the woman reported a date of delivery at an SP-

sponsored facility before the official year of incorporation of SP in the state or before the

reported date of enrollment reported on the household questionnaire. We then repeated

our analyses on this reclassified sample.

5.3.    Independent Variables and Instrumental Variables

        Our independent variables consisted of individual- and household-level data from

ENSANUT, supplemented by data from external sources on the characteristics of the

locality or state of the woman’s residence (Secretaría de Salud (2005)). Individual-level

variables included the woman’s age and age squared, educational attainment, marital

status, parity, primary language (indigenous versus Spanish), and the presence or absence

of three self-reported conditions: depression, diabetes, and high blood pressure. (With

respect to self-reported conditions, adult respondents were asked: “¿Alguna vez le ha

dicho un médico u otro personal de salud que sufre o ha sufrido depresión?” [Question

3.2] “¿Algún médico le ha dicho que tiene diabetes o alta el azúcar en la sangre?”

[Question 4.1] “¿Algún médico le ha dicho que tiene la presión alta?” [Question 5.1] See

Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (2006).) Household-level variables included: the

presence of young children; rural versus urban location; the proportion of women in the

locality who had employment-based health insurance (IMSS, ISSSTE, etc.); the density

of public health units in the locality; and an asset index, based upon household

infrastructure, building materials, and ownership of certain durable assets, as a proxy for

household’s wealth (McKenzie (2004)).

        Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the independent variables, as well as

the marginal proportions of the dependent variables, in our analytic sample.

Approximately half of the women had no more than a primary school education, more

than a third lived in a rural area, and nearly a quarter spoke an indigenous language. The

average family in our sample had low assets and lived in a locality where only 1 in 10

families had employment-based health insurance, and where there were fewer than 1




                                              02-Oct-2007

health center per 100 women. The ratio of the maximum to the minimum density of

health centers was nearly two orders of magnitude, and indicated enormous variability in

access to formal health services.

        For instrumental variables, as described in Section 4.2 above, we constructed

dummy variables for each of three years (2002, 2003, and 2004), where the dummy

variable for a particular year indicated whether the Seguro Popular had been officially

incorporated in the woman’s state of residence by that year. The process of incorporation

entailed decisions at the state and federal level, rather than at the level of the individual

client or health center. We know of no evidence that such decisions suffered from

“policy endogeneity,” that is, states with the highest probability of attracting a pregnant

mother to a health center were incorporated earlier. We recognize that the official dates

of incorporation are not exact indicators of program availability, since some health

centers were still undergoing accreditation by the end of the year. We therefore view

these instruments as indicators of likelihood that SP was available to each household in

the survey. Our use of year-of-incorporation dummies as instruments is thus analogous

to Duflo’s use of distance from schools as instruments in her study of impact of school

construction on educational attainment and wages in Indonesia (Duflo (2001)). The year-

of-incorporation dummies were thus excluded from the equations (12) determining the

effect of SP enrollment on the site of delivery.




6.      Results

        Table 3 presents the results of the simplified bivariate probit model of obstetric

care utilization and enrollment in SP for the analytic sample. We show the estimated



                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                     Page 28


marginal effects only for the utilization equation on the left (corresponding to equation

(18) above), but not for the enrollment equation on the right (corresponding to equation

(13) above). The estimates in the enrollment equation in Table 3 supported the validity

of our year-of-incorporation dummy variables as instruments. The dummy variables for

all three years were significant. The significant negative coefficient for the year 2003,

during which only four of Mexico’s 32 states were incorporated into SP, implies a lower

rate of enrollment than in the reference year 2005. Moreover, in the utilization equation,

the significantly positive coefficient for enrollment in SP supported the hypothesis that

Seguro Popular has had an effect on obstetric utilization. The estimated marginal effect,

which is equivalent to our measure of the impact of the individual-level impact of SP, is

0.430. That is, controlling for other factors affecting the choice of delivery site, a woman

in a family enrolled in SP had a probability of giving birth at an SP-accredited facility

that was 43 percentage points higher than a woman in a family not enrolled in SP.

        In Table 3, the estimated coefficient of correlation of the error terms is negative

and significantly different from zero. While the finding of a non-zero correlation

coefficient might support the conclusion that enrollment in SP is an endogenous variable,

the negative sign is difficult to explain on the basis of the estimates alone. The other

covariates in the enrollment equation do not reveal any related anomalies. In particular,

women in rural localities with a higher availability of health centers are more likely to

enroll in SP. One might conclude that unobserved factors enhanced the probability of

enrollment in SP and, at the same time, diminished the probability of having a baby at an

SP-accredited facility. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the simplified

bivariate model is not correctly specified.




                                              02-Oct-2007

         We therefore turn to Table 4, which shows the results of our full multinomial

probit model (equations 12-14) for the analytic sample. The column denoted “SSA vs.

Private” refers to a woman’s preference for giving birth at an SSA-sponsored facility in

comparison to a private facility, which serves as the reference category. It corresponds to

the equation for the latent variable w0* in equation (12) above. The column denoted “SP

vs. Private” refers to a woman’s preference for having a baby at a SP-sponsored facility

in comparison to a private facility. It corresponds to the equation for the latent variable

w1* in equation (12) above. Finally, the column denoted “SP Enrollment” refers to the

household’s preference for enrollment in Seguro Popular, and corresponds to the equation

for the latent variable y2* , that is, equation (13).

         In the column “SSA vs. Private,” the estimate of the parameter ! 0 is negative and

highly significant, while in the column “SP vs. Private,” the estimate of the parameter ! 1

is positive and highly significant. Accordingly, women in households that participated in

the SP program had a much stronger preference for having a baby in a SP-sponsored unit

rather than paying out of pocket for a private delivery. At the same time, however,

participation in SP was associated with a stronger preference for delivering in the private

sector rather than at an SSA-sponsored clinic. These results confirm the hypothesis,

posed in Section 3.2, that the household-level subsidy embodied in SP can affect the

relative ranking of all three sites of obstetric care. In the language of our model of

Section 3, reductions in the medical care prices q1 and p increased the household’s

indirect utility w1* ( q1 , p, m ) and decreased the indirect utility w0* ( q1 , p, m ) in relation to

the indirect utility w2* ( q1 , p, m ) .

        The estimated correlation coefficients !0 and !1 in the multinomial probit model

of Table 4 present a different pattern than that observed in the simplified bivariate probit

model of Table 3. The estimate of !0 is significantly positive, while the estimate of !1

is indistinguishable from zero. Accordingly, there were unobserved factors that enhanced

the probability of enrollment in SP and, at the same time, enhanced the probability of

preferring an SSA-sponsored facility to a private delivery. In less formal terms, mothers

in households attracted to Seguro Popular were more likely to have preferred to deliver in

state-run SSA-sponsored facilities than to pay out of pocket for a private delivery. The

ability of our multinomial model to differentiate between two different types of

endogeneity (as specified in equations (14) and (15)) thus permits us to resolve the

apparent paradox of a negative correlation coefficient in the simplified bivariate probit

model of Table 3.

        In Table 4, the estimates of the coefficients of the year-of-incorporation dummy

variables in the SP enrollment equation further support the validity of these variables as

instruments. Moreover, in the enrollment equation, residence in a rural locality, a lower

proportion of families enrolled in employment-based insurance, and a higher density of

health centers all had a significant positive effect, while the women’s speaking an

indigenous language had a significant negative coefficient. Self-reported diabetes,

education, and indigenous language had significant effects in the site of delivery

equations as well.

        Given the parameter estimates based upon the multinomial probit model in Table

4, we computed the measures of individual-level and population-level impact described

in Section 4.3. At the mean values of the independent variables, the predicted probability



                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                      Page 31


of enrollment in SP (that is, P1 ( X ) in Section 4.3) was 20.9 percent, and the

corresponding individual-level impact on having a baby at an SP-accredited facility (that

is, I1 ( X ) in equation (16)) was 70.6 percent (95% CI, 65.7–75.0). The latter measure of

impact was significantly larger than the marginal effect of 40.3 percent estimated from

the simplified bivariate probit model in Table 3. In less formal terms, our multinomial

probit model detected an impact of Seguro Popular on the decision to have a baby at an

SP-accredited site that was nearly double the impact estimated from a simplified bivariate

probit model.

        Table 5 and Figure 1 show our computations of the individual-level impact of SP

enrollment for four representative cases, that is, four profiles of women based on

different values of the explanatory variables. The details of each profile are shown in the

notes to Table 5. Cases 1 and 2 refer to women residing in rural areas. For Case 1 (a

rural woman without any formal education, who speaks an indigenous language, has low

socioeconomic status and reports all three medical conditions), the probability of

enrollment in SP was P1 ( X ) = 43.65 percent, while the individual-level impact was

I1 ( X ) = 82.09 percent (95% CI, 59.13–84.29). By contrast, for Case 2 (a rural woman

with at least primary school, who speaks Spanish, has comparatively higher

socioeconomic status and does not report medical conditions), the estimated probability

of enrollment in the SP was higher (51.51%), but the individual-level impact was notably

lower (61.24%; 95% CI, 43.00–72.05). The difference between the individual-level

impacts in Case 1 and Case 2 was 20.85 percent (95% CI, -6.96–35.88).

        Cases 3 and 4 refer to women residing in urban areas. For Case 3 (an urban

woman with primary education, who speaks Spanish, has low socioeconomic status and


                                              02-Oct-2007

reports depression, diabetes, and high blood pressure), the probability of enrollment in SP

was 54.43 percent, while the individual-level impact was 78.91 percent. By contrast, for

Case 4 (an urban woman with a university education, who speaks Spanish, has elevated

socioeconomic status and does not report medical conditions), the estimated probability

of enrollment in the SP was 0.16 percent. Among the very few women with this profile

who enroll in SP, the individual-level impact on delivering in an SP-accredited facility

was 65.15 percent.

        Table 5 and Figure 1 show not only the individual-level impacts on delivering at a

SP-accredited facility, but also the corresponding individual-level impacts on having a

baby at a SSA-sponsored health unit (that is, I 0 ( X ) ) and a private facility (that is,

I 2 ( X ) ). In each of the four cases, but especially in Cases 1 through 3, the Seguro

Popular program reduced pregnant women’s attendance at an SSA-sponsored clinic much

more than it reduced the probability of delivering a baby in the private sector.

        Table 6 and Figure 2 show our computations of the population-level impacts of

SP enrollment for four representative cases. The pattern of heterogeneity in population-

level impacts differed from the pattern observed for individual-level impacts. While the

individual-level impact I1 ( X ) was largest for Case 1, the population-level impact R1 ( X )

was largest for Case 3, a Spanish-speaking urban woman with primary education, low

socioeconomic status and multiple medical problems. For Case 4, the probability of

enrolling in SP was so low that the population-level impact was negligible.

        Appendix C shows estimates of the most important parameters for our three

sensitivity analyses: the extended sample, the restricted sample, and the reclassified

sample. In all cases, our multinomial probit estimates were robust with respect to

different assumptions about the study population and the definitions of the dependent

variables.


7.      Discussion and Conclusions

        In this paper, we found that the recently established Seguro Popular program in

Mexico has had a significantly positive effect on the access of poor women to obstetrical

care, an important outcome measure of maternal and infant health. Women in

households that participated in the SP program, we found, had a much stronger

preference for having a baby in a SP-sponsored unit rather than paying out of pocket for a

private delivery. At the same time, participation in SP was associated with a stronger

preference for delivering in the private sector rather than at an SSA-sponsored clinic. On

balance, the Seguro Popular program reduced pregnant women’s attendance at an SSA-

sponsored clinic much more than it reduced the probability of delivering a baby in the

private sector. These findings were robust with respect to variations in the population

under study and the classification of subjects’ survey responses.

        We formulated a multinomial probit model that permitted us to go beyond the

standard two-way dichotomy between utilization and non-utilization as outcome

measures in the evaluation of policies designed to subsidize and increase access to health

care. We found that the conventional bivariate probit approach suffered from apparent

problems of model misspecification, with a peculiarly negative correlation coefficient

between error terms in the obstetrical utilization and Seguro Popular enrollment

equations. What is more, estimates based the standard two-equation approach

understated the impact of Seguro Popular on obstetrical utilization by 40 percent.




                                              02-Oct-2007

        Our modification of the multivariate probit model to account of a discrete

endogenous variable appears to be the first instance of such a model specification. Early

applications of multinomial discrete choice models in the selection of health care

providers include the works of Schwartz, Akin et al. (1988) in the setting of the

Philippines, Akin, Guilkey et al. (1995) in Nigeria, and Bolduc, Lacroix et al. (1996) in

Benin, and most recently Borah (2006) in India and Leonard (2007) in Tanzania.

However, these papers did not explicitly incorporate endogeneity of the treatment or

policy variable into the multinomial choice framework.

        Other investigators have employed variations of the now-standard bivariate probit

model, in which an endogenous binary participation variable enters on the right-hand side

of a probit utilization equation. (See Bertranou (1998) in the setting of Argentina;

Cameron, Trivedi et al. (1988) in Australia; Gitto, Santoro et al. (2006) in Sicily; Sapelli

and Vial (2003) in Chile; Suraratdecha, Saithanu et al. (2005) in Thailand; and Waters

(1999) in Ecuador.) Trujillo (2003) specified a binary utilization variable as well as two

endogenous binary variables to represent participation in both public and private

insurance programs in Colombia.

        Still other researchers have considered multi-equation models in which one or

more equations entailed a discrete endogenous variable. Munkin and Trivedi (2003)

specified a three-equation model in which one demand equation entailed Poisson-

distributed count data, the second demand equation contained a continuous exponential

dependent variable, and the third participation equation involved a binary dependent

variable representing self-selection of insurance coverage. Deb, Munkin et al. (2006)

specified a multi-equation model for health care utilization, in which the first equation




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                    Page 35


was a probit model of non-zero health-care utilization, the second was conditional log-

linear expenditure model, and the third was a multinomial probit model for choice of

insurance coverage. The latter model, like that of Munkin and Trivedi (2003), was

estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Balia and Jones (2004),

in an interesting study of health habits and mortality, specified a recursive multi-equation

model, in which each binary lifestyle variable (such as smoking) served as a dependent

variable in a behavioral equation and as a regressor in a mortality equation. Our model in

this paper can be readily estimated by full maximum likelihood, taking advantage of

now-standard techniques to evaluate three-dimensional probit integrals, such as the GHK

simulator written by Cappellari and Jenkins (2006). (See Appendix B.)

        We based our analysis of heterogeneous impacts on four cases, which represented

different profiles of women based on the values of the observed independent variables.

While the simulated confidence intervals around the impact measures were relatively

wide, nonetheless we observed significant variability in individual-level impacts. A

comparison of Cases 1 and 2, both women residing in urban areas, is illustrative. A

woman in Case 1 spoke an indigenous language, had low socioeconomic status and

reported multiple medical conditions, while a woman in Case 2 had a primary school

education, spoke Spanish, had comparatively higher socioeconomic status, and did not

report any medical conditions. In Case 1, the individual-level impact of Seguro Popular

on the probability of having a baby at a SP-accredited facility was 21 percentage points

higher than in Case 2, and the 95% confidence interval of this difference in individual-

level impacts ranged from -7% to +36%.




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                        Page 36


        The pattern of variation in population-level impacts was even greater. An urban

woman in Case 4, with a university education, who spoke Spanish, had average assets

and no health problems had a very small probability of enrolling in SP. As a result, the

population-level impact was negligible. By contrast, an urban woman in Case 3, with a

primary-school education, who spoke Spanish, had minimal assets and reported multiple

medical conditions had a probability of enrollment greater than 50 percent and, as a

result, displayed a very substantial population-level impact.

        In our analysis of heterogeneous impacts, we did not specify interaction terms

between treatment variables and other explanatory variables, as would be required in a

purely linear model. Having specified a parametric joint distribution for the error terms

(! 0 , !1, ! 2 ) , we did not explore more generalized non-parametric procedures, such as
quantile treatment effects regression (Djebbari and Smith (2005); Dammert (2007)), and

thus our analysis does not capture the full extent of heterogeneity of program impact due

to variations in unobservables.

        We posited a simple theoretical model of household choice, in which the

household was regarded as a unified decision-making unit. This theoretical structure was

sufficient to predict the reversals in relative ranking of obstetrical sites that might result

from SP’s subsidizing medical care at the household level. We did not find it necessary

to posit potentially conflicting interests among household members. Recent work on

game theoretic models of decision making (Harris and González López-Valcárcel (2007))

and resource allocation within the household (Djebbari (2005); Chávez-Martín del

Campo (2006)) would be interesting to pursue in this context.




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                      Page 37


        Our empirical findings on the substantial impact of Seguro Popular confirm the

preliminary results reported by Gakidou, Lozano et al. (2006), who found a positive

relation between hospital discharge rates per capita and the rate of SP enrollment in a

regression analysis of a cross-section of Mexican municipalities. These authors also

reported a positive relation between the probability of using health services and SP

enrollment, conditional on perceived need, based upon a cross-sectional regression study

of the 2006 ENSANUT survey, but details of the methodology were not reported.

        This observational study has a number of limitations. We relied upon self-

reported data, which inevitably contains response errors. For example, in Table 1, out of

a total of 2,978 households did not report enrollment in Seguro Popular, 49 women (1.65

percent) reported delivering a baby in a SP-accredited facility. Although we performed a

number of reliability checks of our data, uncertainty due to errors in reporting cannot be

eliminated. Nonetheless, our results remained robust with respect to changes in the

sample analyzed and the definitions of the dependent variables. We have no direct

measures of the characteristics of the obstetric facilities selected by the pregnant women

and their families. It is well recognized that such characteristics are a critical determinant

of the choice of site of care (Leonard (2007)). In the case of obstetric services in Mexico,

direct measurement of the level of training of personnel, accessibility of rural sites, and

the state of medical equipment would be very valuable, especially if we are to assess the

adequacy of the accreditation process employed by Seguro Popular. Measurement of the

quality of state-run SSA-sponsored sites would be valuable in determining why SP-

enrolled women expressed a much stronger preference for SP-accredited sites over SSA-

sponsored sites.




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                     Page 38


        We distinguished between SP-accredited health units, SSA-sponsored facilities,

and private care. While we excluded women who had employment-based health

insurance from our analytic sample, the category of “private care” nonetheless remains

heterogeneous, ranging from the services of private obstetricians within hospitals to

traditional midwives who work outside the hospital setting. In our ENSANUT analytic

sample, the latter category comprised only 10.36 percent of all reported deliveries

(results not shown.) Increasing the number of sites of obstetric care would have required

additional computational resources to evaluate a four-dimensional probit model in

samples with up to 6,000 observations.

        Finally, our analysis covers the time period 2001–2006, during which the Seguro

Popular program was being gradually phased in throughout Mexico. Within the limits of

currently available data, we cannot test the hypothesis that the impact of Seguro Popular

has changed as the Mexican people have come to learn of its advantages, or as the quality

of SP-accredited facilities has further improved.

        A number of findings in Table 4 give us cause for concern. The coefficients for

women who speak indigenous language are negative, that is, non-Spanish speaking

women appeared less likely to enroll in and take advantage of Seguro Popular. The

family asset index has a negative coefficient in the equation for SSA versus Private,

suggesting that some poor families were still paying out of pocket for private care. The

coefficient for a rural household is significant in the SP enrollment equation, but is not

significant in the equation for SP versus Private, suggesting that rural households

enrolled in SP but pregnant women within those households did not take advantage of the




                                              02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                    Page 39


program. These findings suggest a continued focus on the availability of Seguro Popular

for the very poorest indigenous households in rural areas.

        Perhaps the most troubling findings, however, are the relative impacts on SSA-

sponsored and private obstetrical care that we observed in Table 5. On balance,

enrollment in Seguro Popular reduced deliveries at state-run SSA-sponsored facilities

much more than it reduced the use of private obstetrical services. One explanation is that

SSA-sponsored facilities, in which trained staff and adequate equipment are not

guaranteed, are perceived as low quality. There may also be problems of “crowding out,”

whereby SSA-sponsored facilities are simply too limited in availability. There is also the

potential concern that private facilities may be serving as alternatives to SP-sponsored

facilities with inadequate capacity. More research is required to determine why poor

uninsured Mexican women still pay out of pocket for obstetrical care despite the

substantial impacts of Seguro Popular documented in this paper.

Appendix A. Illustrative Example of Preference Reversals as a Function of Price

         To illustrate the effect of a change in the price p of non-obstetric care on

household rankings of obstetric care, we specify the household utility function


                                     2
                                                zi x
(A.1) U ( z0 , z1 , z2 , x, c ) = #                      + ln c
                                    i = 0 ! i zi + " i x




where ! i ," i > 0 , and where U ( 0, 0, 0, 0, c ) = ln c . Each of the terms in the summation is


                                                                  (
a CES utility function of the form fi ( zi , x ) = ! i zi" #i + $ i x " #i     )
                                                                                   "1 #i
                                                                                           , where !i = 1 . The last

term is an additively separable component that implies diminishing marginal utility of

income.

         The corresponding conditional demand functions are:


                                                     !i $ m '                  !i $ m '
(A.2) ci* ( qi , p, m ) = ! i ,              xi* =            # 1) ,   zi* =             # 1)
                                                     p &% " i    (             qi &% " i    (



              (                     )
                                        2
where ! i =        " i qi + # i p           for i = 0,1, 2 . These conditional demand functions hold so

long as m > ! i . Otherwise, when m ! " i , the solution is ci* = m and xi* = zi* = 0 , so that

the household spends all its income on the numeraire good. For each i = 0,1, 2 , the

conditional indirect utility is:


                  m
(A.3) wi* =          " 1 + ln ! i
                  !i




                                                        02-Oct-2007
Impact of Seguro Popular on Obstetric Utilization                                                Page 51


which is a decreasing function of ! i so long as m > ! i .

        For the utility function in equation (A.1), a reduction in the price p of non-

obstetrical care can alter the relative ranking of private care ( i = 2 ) and SSA-sponsored

care ( i = 0 ) . Specifically, there exist values of the parameters {! i ," i } such that the

differential utility w0* ( q0 , p, m ) ! w2* ( q2 , p, m ) is a strictly increasing function of p with a

                                 2
          % " 0 q0 # " 2 q2 (
root p! = '                 * > 0 , that is, w0 ( q0 , p!, m ) " w2 ( q2 , p!, m ) = 0 . If we
                                              *                   *

          &    $2 # $0 )

assume that the net price of private obstetrical care exceeds that of SSA-funded

obstetrical care, that is, q2 > q0 , these conditions imply that ! 2 q2 < ! 0 q0 and ! 2 > ! 0 .

        Our example is illustrated in Figure A.1, which plots w0* , w1* , and w2* as a

function of the price p of non-obstetrical care. A woman will choose a private obstetric

facility (where w2* > w0* > w1* and y1 = 2 ) when p is sufficiently low, while a woman will

choose an SSA public facility (where w0* > w2* > w1* and y1 = 0 ) when p is high. Our

example shows that coverage by Seguro Popular can result in preference reversals even

                                                                                           !zi*
though each of the three obstetric sites is conditionally a normal good, that is,               > 0.
                                                                                           !m

What matters is that private obstetrical care has a strong complementary relation with

non-obstetrical care.

Figure A.1. A change in the price p of non-obstetric care can reverse the ordering of the

 indirect utility functions for the three delivery sites: Secretaría de Salud ( i = 0 ) ; Seguro

   Popular ( i = 1) ; and private obstetrical care ( i = 2 ) . The specific parameters in this

               example are: m = 200 , ( q0 , q1 , q2 ) = (1,1, 5 ) , (! 0 , !1 , ! 2 ) = ( 20, 25, 2, ) , and

        (! 0 ,!1,! 2 ) = ( 2,12,16 ) .                 There is a reversal of preferences at price p! = 0.257 .




Appendix B. Construction and Estimation of Log Likelihood Function

              Here, we derive the contribution to the log likelihood for two of the six possible

cases   {( y , y )     1          2   y1 = 0,1, 2; y2 = 0,1} , leaving remaining cases to the reader.

              First, consider an observation where y1 = 2, y2 = 0 , that is, where the pregnant

woman chooses a private site to deliver her baby, and where the household decides not to

enroll in Seguro Popular. From equations (12) and (13), we conclude that


                                                                   02-Oct-2007

w0* < 0, w1* < 0, y2* < 0 . Given the error structure in equation (14), we conclude that the

contribution of this observation to the log likelihood is


                                                                  ' ' % X0& ! 0 * ' 1     0       #0**
(B.1)    L20 = ln Pr { y1 = 2, y2 = 0 X, ! , " , # }     = ln $ 3 ) ) % X1&!1 , , ) 0     1       #1 , ,
                                                                  ))            , )                  ,,
                                                                  )( ( % X & ! + ( #      #1      - + ,+
                                                                          2 2        0




In (B.1), the term ! 3 ( v, " ) denotes Pr {V < v} , where V is a 3-dimensional vector of

random variables with a trivariate normal distribution with zero means and 3 ! 3

variance-covariance matrix ! .

        Next, consider an observation where y1 = 0, y2 = 1 , that is, where the pregnant

woman chooses an obstetric site sponsored by the Secretaría de Salud, and where the

household decides to enroll in Seguro Popular. From equations (12) and (13), we

conclude that !w0* < 0, w1* ! w0* < 0, ! y2* < 0 . The contribution of this observation to the

log likelihood is therefore


(B.2)    L01 = ln Pr { y1 = 0, y2 = 1 X, ! , " , # } =
                                                  &&       X0" # 0 + $ 0       ) & 1          0          ,0 ))
                                                  (
                                            ln ! 3 X0" # 0 + $ 0 % X1"#1 % $ 1 + , ( 0
                                                     (                                        2       , 0 % ,1 + +
                                                  ((                           + (                             ++
                                                  (' '         X2" # 2         * ',0     , 0 % ,1         - * +*


        The individual terms of the log likelihood function entail three-dimensional probit

integrals, which we evaluated by means of the GHK simulator written by Cappellari and

Jenkins (2006).
