                                            ABSTRACT

Racial segregation is often blamed for some of the achievement gap between blacks and whites. We
study the effects of school and neighborhood segregation on the relative SAT scores of black
students across different metropolitan areas, using large microdata samples for the 1998-2001 test
cohorts. Our models include detailed controls for the family background of individual test-takers,
school-level controls for selective participation in the test, and city-level controls for racial
composition, income, and region. We find robust evidence that the black-white test score gap is
higher in more segregated cities. Holding constant family background and other factors, a shift from
a fully segregated to a completely integrated city closes about one-quarter of the raw black-white gap
in SAT scores. Specifications that distinguish between school and neighborhood segregation suggest
that neighborhood segregation has a consistently negative impact but that school segregation has no
independent effect (though we cannot reject equality of the two effects). We find similar results
using Census-based data on schooling outcomes for youth in different cities. Data on enrollment in
honors courses suggest that within-school segregation increases when schools are more highly
integrated, potentially offsetting the benefits of school desegregation and accounting for our findings.

         The racial gap in student achievement is a pervasive and divisive feature of American

life. Black-white differences in standardized test scores lie at the core of the debate over

affirmative action in college admissions (Bowen and Bok, 1998; Kane, 1998) and public

sector hiring (McCrary, 2004), and figure prominently in the recent No Child Left Behind

Act. Many years before the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board decision, segregation was

identified as a possible factor in the academic achievement of black children.1 Studies since

the Coleman Report (Coleman, 1966) have found that test scores are lower at schools with

higher black enrollment shares (see, e.g., Ferguson 1998, and the review by Schofield 1995).

Likewise, there is a strong negative correlation between education outcomes and the fraction

of black residents in a neighborhood (e.g., Massey and Denton, 1993).

         Establishing whether segregation actually causes lower achievement is difficult,

however, because individuals are not randomly assigned to neighborhoods or schools.2 A

credible research design has to address the possibility that students who attend schools with

larger black enrollment shares – or live in predominantly black neighborhoods – have other

characteristics that contribute to their lower achievement. In this paper, we circumvent the

endogeneity of school and neighborhood choice by aggregating to the metropolitan level and

relating the black-white achievement gap in a metropolitan area to black-white differences in

relative exposure to minority neighbors and schoolmates.3 Differencing eliminates the

effects of city-wide variables that may be correlated with racial segregation (such as the level



1 Crowley (1932) presents an early study of the effect of racially segregated schools on academic achievement,

based on comparisons of test scores for black students in two all-black and four mixed-race schools in
Cincinnati. She constructed matched samples from the two groups of schools, matching on age, grade, and
IQ, and found no difference in achievement test scores between the schools.
2 On the general problem of inferring peer group effects from observational data, see Manski (1993) and Brock

and Durlauf (2001).
3 Although cities with segregated neighborhoods tend to have segregated schools, school segregation also

depends on institutional features like the number of school districts (Urquiola, 2005) and the presence of
desegregation programs (Reber, 2005). We show below that the two have substantial independent variation.


                                                      1
of school spending or the efficiency of local schools). 4 We also control for a rich set of

measured differences in the family backgrounds of test-takers, and for other variables, like

city size and income inequality, that may affect black student’s relative achievement. We

apply this approach to a large sample of SAT-takers from the 1998-2001 cohorts of high

school graduates.

         We reach two main conclusions. First, there is a robust and quantitatively important

relationship between black relative test scores and the degree of segregation in different

metropolitan areas. Our estimates suggest that the move from a highly segregated city to an

integrated city is associated with a 45 point narrowing of the black-white SAT gap – about

one-quarter of the raw differential. Second, neighborhood segregation seems to matter more

than school segregation: In models that include both measures we consistently find that

neighborhood segregation exerts a strong negative effect on relative test scores, whereas the

effects of school segregation are small and statistically insignificant. We cannot reject,

however, that the two have equal effects.

         These findings are robust to a variety of specifications and estimation strategies. We

focus on two main problems that might lead us to overstate the effects of segregation:

differential sorting of white and black families across different cities, and the possibility that

segregation is affected by the relative abilities of black and white students in a city. We

show that our estimated segregation effects are unaffected by including a control for the

residual wage gap between black and white workers in a city, which should proxy for

unobserved family background differences that would result from either source of

endogeneity. We also examine the changing inter-city distributions of higher- and lower-

educated whites and blacks and find no evidence of selective migration, once we control for

4Throughout this paper we use “cities” to refer to metropolitan areas – specifically, Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (MSA’s) or, in the largest urbanized areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs).


                                                        2
observed city characteristics. Finally, we show that measures of residential and school

segregation in a city are highly persistent, and therefore unlikely to be responsive to recent

shocks to unobserved student ability. Even controlling for neighborhood segregation the

remaining component of school segregation is extremely stable, suggesting that the small

school segregation coefficients cannot be attributed to measurement error in this variable.

        A third potential concern is selective participation in the SAT. Our analyses all point

to the conclusion that, if anything, sample selection leads our results to understate the effects

of segregation on black relative achievement. As a robustness check, however, we estimate a

series of models using 2000 Census data on schooling outcomes of 16-24 year olds.

Estimates from these models are similar to our SAT results.

        The finding that black relative achievement is unaffected by differences in school

segregation, once we control for neighborhood segregation, leads us to consider the role of

within-school segregation. Holding constant the level of neighborhood segregation, white

students are more likely to enroll in honors classes in cities with more integrated schools,

whereas blacks are not. This behavior is consistent with the presence of ability tracking

programs that offset the integrative effects of between-school desegregation efforts

(Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor, 2003; Clotfelter, 2004), and may help to explain why

differences in school segregation have little effect on black relative achievement.

        We conclude with an analysis that attempts to distinguish between the direct effects

of racial segregation and “indirect” effects operating through school quality and the relative

exposure of black and white students to lower income peers. Measures of relative school

quality are uncorrelated with the relative exposure of black students to minority neighbors or

schools, so the potential for these variables to contribute to observed segregation effects is

very small. On the other hand, segregation is highly correlated with exposure to low-income



                                                3
peers at both the school and neighborhood levels. Consistent with our finding that

minority exposure at the school level has little or no effect on black relative achievement

(holding constant neighborhood exposure), exposure to high-poverty schoolmates also has

no effect. But relative neighborhood income does seem to be an important determinant of

test score gaps, and accounts for as much as half of our estimated residential segregation

effects.



II. The Effects of Segregated Schools and Neighborhoods on Student Achievement

a. Theoretical Channels

           The literature has identified four mechanisms through which racial or ethnic

segregation might affect the educational achievement of black students. First, what might be

called “direct” exposure effects arise in peer group models where minorities have lower

expectations or aspirations than non-minorities (all else held constant). For example, models

of race-based cultural norms (e.g., Ogbu and Forham, 1986; Ogbu, 2003) assert that black

children have lower norms of achievement than otherwise similar whites, and that exposure

to peers with lower aspirations reduces achievement. Since segregation by definition raises

the relative exposure of black students to black peers, pure exposure effects create a link

from segregation to the black-white achievement gap.5

           A second set of “indirect” exposure effects arise from the correlation between

minority status and other characteristics that may negatively effect achievement. Black

children, for example, are more likely to have a single parent than white children. If single-

parent families have lower educational aspirations, and if student performance is affected by
5 A similar prediction arises from Austen-Smith and Fryer’s (2005) model of endogenous peer group

interactions, although in this model the negative effect of black peers reaches a peak when the fraction black is
½, and disappears in an all-black setting. This model also predicts that the negative effects of exposure to
black peers are concentrated among black children with low potential achievement, whereas Ogbu’s (2003)
study focuses on black children with high potential achievement.


                                                        4
peer aspirations (Coleman, 1966; Sewell and Hauser, 1975) then a rise in segregation will

lower the relative achievement of black children.

        While theoretically important, the distinction between direct and indirect exposure

effects is empirically inaccessible. An important example is test score performance (Hoxby,

2000). Suppose that a given student’s achievement is affected by the average academic

ability of his or her classmates. Since black students have lower test scores than whites, and

much of this gap is unexplained by observed family background factors, one could argue

that a higher fraction of black peers exerts a direct exposure effect via the academic ability of

the peer group. Alternatively, one could argue that the black-white test score gap reflects

unmeasured background factors, and is properly interpreted as an indirect exposure effect.

In our main analysis we make no distinction between direct and indirect exposure effects,

although in later specifications we estimate minority exposure effects holding constant

exposure to low-income schoolmates and neighbors.

        Another channel through which racial or ethnic exposure could indirectly affect

relative achievement is through differences in school quality that are correlated with the

racial composition of schools. In the pre-Brown v. Board era, separate school systems made it

possible for white voters to divert resources from black to white schools (Boozer, Krueger,

and Wolkon, 1992). Even today, concerns over differential resources are central to litigation

over school finance rules (Schrag, 2003) and to accountability rules that hold schools

responsible for race-specific achievement levels.

        Finally, there may be “macro” influences that create a direct link from segregation to

black relative achievement. If, for example, the nature of the local broadcast media varies

across cities—with, perhaps, more racially targeted radio stations in cities with more

segregation—exposure to the media culture could produce effects of city-level segregation



                                                5
even on children who live in racially mixed neighborhoods. Models of statistical

discrimination (e.g. Coate and Loury, 1993) could yield similar results. Students’ education

choices might be influenced by local (white) employers’ attitudes toward blacks, which might

in turn depend on the extent of employers’ exposure to black neighbors and schoolmates.

These models imply impacts of city-level segregation that extend beyond any direct effects

of neighborhood- and school-level exposure.



b. Previous Evidence on Peer Group and Segregation Effects

        Much of the existing literature has equated the effect of segregation with that of

school-level exposure to black or minority peers, and has documented that student

achievement is lower in schools with a higher fraction of black or minority students.

Coleman (1966), for example, found that black students earned lower test scores at schools

with a higher black enrollment share. As subsequent critics have emphasized, the

interpretation of these findings is clouded by the lack of controls for the non-random sorting

of students to different types of schools (see e.g., Jencks and Mayer, 1990).

        Recent researchers have adopted three main approaches to address the sorting issue:

(1) using within-school variation in minority exposure; (2) using experimental or quasi-

experimental variation in exposure; and (3) aggregating to a level at which sorting is arguably

reduced or eliminated.

        Hoxby (2000) and Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2002) follow the first approach.

Both studies relate the achievement (or achievement growth) of students in different cohorts

at the same school with the racial and ethnic composition of their particular cohort. This

research design assumes that, while students may sort across schools on the basis of long-

run factors like average racial composition, choices are unaffected by cohort-specific



                                                   6
variation in these factors.6 Both papers find very large exposure effects. The estimates

reported by Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2002), for example, imply that excess exposure of

black students to black grademates causes the black-white test score gap to grow by 0.07

standard deviations with each year in school, enough to account for most of the black-white

test score gap by 12th grade.7

         Experimental evidence on the effects of neighborhood peers comes from the recent

Moving to Opportunity (MTO) project, which offered incentives for public housing

residents to move to lower poverty neighborhoods (Sanbonmatsu et al., 2006). MTO had a

modest effect on the quality of subjects’ neighborhoods (lowering the poverty rate by about

13 percentage points), but no significant effect on children’s academic achievement. The

experiment has very limited power to measure the effect of exposure to minority neighbors,

however, since it only lowered the fraction of minority neighbors of the treatment group by

about 7 percentage points.8

         Guryan (2004) conducts a quasi-experimental analysis of the effect of school

segregation on black dropout rates, using variation in the scope and timing of major court-

ordered desegregation plans in the 1970s and 1980s. He finds a modest but statistically

significant effect, with black dropout rates falling 3 percentage points relative to whites as a

result of policies that on average reduced relative black exposure to black schoolmates by


6 As in other contexts – for example between-twin estimates of returns to schooling (Bound and Solon, 1999) –
it is unclear whether this strategy reduces the covariance between racial exposure and unobserved ability
relative to the remaining variation in exposure. An additional concern in the Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin
(2002) study is that there may be systematic trends in the ethnic composition of schools that covary with trends
in average student characteristics at the school. Hoxby (2000) pays special attention to such trend factors.
7 This is based on Hanushek, Kane, and Rivkin’s (2002) computation that integration would reduce the black

share in the average black student’s classroom by 25 percentage points and raise the black share in the average
white student’s classroom by 5 percentage points. Using their estimated exposure effects (which vary by race),
this would narrow the gap in gain scores by 0.07 (in standard deviations of level scores) per year, for a
cumulative effect over 12 years of 0.83 standard deviations. A key implication of their model is that the black-
white test score gap rises with grade. This is not evident in aggregate data (Perie et al., 2005).
8 See Sanbonmatsu et. al (2006), Table 2. See also Jacob’s (2004) study of the effect of housing project

demolitions, which yields similar results but has similar limitations.

about 20 percentage points.9

         A final strand of recent research uses an aggregate research design similar to our

own. Although students of differing abilities may sort to different schools or neighborhoods

within a given city, these studies assume that the distribution of potential abilities across

metropolitan areas is as good as random (conditional on observed control variables). Evans,

Oates, and Schwab (1992) use the average characteristics of the metropolitan area as

instruments for peer group characteristics. Cutler and Glaeser (1997) extend this idea by

distinguishing between the outcomes of blacks and whites in the same city, under the weaker

assumption that the black-white difference in potential ability in a city is unrelated to the

degree of residential segregation. Our basic framework is very similar. We extend Cutler

and Glaeser’s (1997) analysis by including a much richer set of family background and

metropolitan-level control variables that may be correlated with segregation, by

distinguishing between the effects of school and neighborhood exposure, and by focusing

on test scores as a measure of achievement.



c. Empirical Specification

         We begin by assuming that the test score of a given student depends on his or her

own characteristics, the racial composition of his or her school and neighborhood, other

characteristics of schoolmates and neighbors, and an unobserved error with school- and

neighborhood-level components that may vary by race. Specifically, we assume:

(1)      yijsnc = Xijsncαj + Zsc βj + Wnc νj + Bsc γj + Rnc δj + ujsc + vjnc + εijsc ,

where yijsnc represents the test score (or some alternative measure of achievement) of student


9 As we discuss below, it is possible that in the longer run some of the integrative effect of desegregation

programs is offset by a rise in within-school segregation. Guryan’s (2004) estimates, which identify segregation
effects on the earliest affected cohorts, would not incorporate such offsetting effects.


                                                       8
i of race group j who attends school s and lives in neighborhood n in city c, Xijsnc is a vector

of characteristics of the student, Zsc is a vector representing the average characteristics of

the students in school s and other features of the school, Wnc is a vector of the average

characteristics of the neighborhood, Bsc represents the fraction of minority students in

school s, Rnc is the fraction of minority residents in the neighborhood, ujsc is a shared error

component for students of group j in school s and city c, vjnc is a similar error component for

residents of group j in neighborhood n, and εijnsc is an individual-level error (with mean 0 for

each race group in each school and neighborhood).10 The coefficients γj and δj capture the

direct effects of exposure to minority schoolmates and neighbors, while indirect effects

would arise from omission of components of Z and W that are correlated with B and R.

         Any non-randomness in the sorting of students to schools or neighborhoods

produces a correlation between the unobserved error components in equation (1) and the

measures of school- and neighborhood-level exposure, potentially biasing OLS estimates of

γj and δj from student-level data. The effects of non-random sorting within a city can be

eliminated by averaging the achievement outcomes of each race group to the city level.

Specifically, equation (1) implies that the mean outcome of group j in city c is:

(1’)     yjc = Xjc αj + Zjc βj + Wjc νj + Bjcγj + Rjc δj + μjc,

where Xjc represents the mean characteristics of students of group j in city c, Zjc and Wjc

represent the mean characteristics of the school-level and neighborhood-level peer groups of

race-j students, Bjc is the average fraction of minority students at schools attended by race

group j in city c, Rjc is the average fraction of minority neighbors of students in group j in

city c, and μjc is the average of ujsc+ vjnc across all students of race j in city c.

10 We do not include error components that vary by city or by race and city, since these will be absorbed by the

school × race effects. In our empirical specification, “minorities” are blacks and Hispanics; we have tested for
differential effects of exposure to the two groups and fail to reject equality in a wide range of alternative
specifications. Tables that report separate effects are available upon request.


                                                       9
         Although averaging eliminates the effects of within-city sorting, there still may be

differences in the average unobserved “abilities” of students -- or in the average quality of

the local schools -- that would lead to biases in the estimation of equation (1’) across cities.

Any differences that are common across race groups in a city can be “differenced out” by

comparing blacks and whites within the same city. Specifically, (1’) implies:

(2)      y1c - y2c = X1c α1 – X2c α2 + Z1c β1 – Z2c β2 + W1c ν1 – W2c ν2 + B1cγ1 – B2cγ2

                           + R1c δ1 – R2c δ2 + μ1c – μ2c,

where j=1 represents blacks and j=2 represents whites. If the coefficients in equation (1) are

the same for whites and blacks, equation (2) takes a particularly simple form:

(2’)     Δyc = ΔXc α + ΔZcβ + ΔWc ν + ΔBcγ + ΔRc δ + Δμc ,

where Δyc, for example, denotes the difference in mean test scores between blacks and

whites in the same city.

         The differences ΔBc and ΔRc in equation (2’) are closely related to standard

segregation indexes of “exposure” and “isolation.”11 When schools and neighborhoods are

fully segregated, B1c = R1c = 1 and B2c = R2c =0, so ΔBc = ΔRc = 1. When they are

completely integrated, B1c = B2c and R1c = R2c, so ΔBc = ΔRc = 0. ΔZc and ΔWc measure

other differences in the schools and neighborhoods of black and white children, such as the

gap in average school quality between the schools attended by blacks and whites, or the gap

in average incomes in the neighborhoods of black and white children.

         Although differencing eliminates any city-wide factors that affect blacks and whites

equally, there may be remaining differences in unobserved determinants of achievement

between the two groups. We posit that this remaining gap can be decomposed as:


11 In the segregation literature (e.g. Massey and Denton, 1988; Iceland, Weinberg, and Stienmetz, 2002), B and
                                                                                                            jc
Rjc are known as indices of exposure of race-j students to minorities, and ΔBc and ΔRc are similar to isolation
indices (Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor 1999).


                                                      10
(3)     μ1c - μ2c = Fcψ + ηc ,

where Fc is a vector of city characteristics—including measures of the city racial

composition—and ηc represents all remaining unobserved differences. This leads to a model

of the form:

(4)     Δyc = ΔXc α + ΔZcβ + ΔWc ν + ΔBcγ + ΔRc δ + Fc ψ + ηc .

OLS estimation of this equation will yield consistent estimates of γ and δ provided that ηc is

uncorrelated with ΔBc and ΔRc, conditional on the control variables included in (4).

        A key threat to the identification of the segregation effects in equation (4) is

differential sorting of black and white families to different metropolitan areas. For example, if

achievement-oriented black families migrate to cities where schools or neighborhoods are

less racially segregated, and if their characteristics are not fully captured in the measured

student background variables, then ηc may be negatively correlated with ΔBc and/or ΔRc.

Our main specifications include a rich set of controls for the observed characteristics of

black and white students in different cities, including parental education and income, as well

as various city-level variables. In Section V, however, we present some robustness checks

and additional analyses to evaluate the likely biases in these models.

        Our main analyses simplify equation (4) in two ways. First, as we noted in Section II,

it is unrealistic to assume that all the relevant characteristics of schoolmates and neighbors

can be measured. We therefore focus on a “reduced form” specification that excludes the W

and Z variables:

(5)     Δyc = ΔXc α’ + ΔBcγ’ + ΔRc δ’ + Fc ψ’ + ηc ,

where γ’ and δ’ are related to γ and δ by the usual omitted variables formulas. Thus, γ’ will

incorporate the direct effects of exposure to minority schoolmates, indirect effects associated

with the characteristics of the schools and neighborhoods that can be predicted from


                                                11
knowledge of ΔBc,, conditional on ΔRc, and any “macro” effects of city-wide school

segregation. In section V, below, we attempt to estimate the indirect exposure effects that

derive from school resources and the incomes of schoolmates and neighbors.

        Second, we present estimates both of equation (5) and of even simpler specifications

that include only one of the segregation measures at a time. School and neighborhood

segregation are highly correlated across cities, making it difficult to distinguish their separate

effects even when the combined effect is precisely estimated. When only residential

segregation is included, for example, the resulting coefficient provides an estimate of δ’+πγ’,

where π is the coefficient on ΔR from an auxiliary regression of ΔB on ΔR, ΔX, and F.

Empirically, π is close to one, so the coefficient is approximately the sum of δ’ and γ’.



d. Taking Advantage of Student-Level Covariates

        The aggregated model (5) has only as many degrees of freedom as the number of

metropolitan areas in the sample, limiting the flexibility of our controls for family

background factors. To fully exploit our rich microdata, we partial out the student-level

covariates observed in the SAT files (mother’s education, father’s education, and family

income), using a highly flexible specification that is fully interacted by race. We then

aggregate “residual” SAT scores to the city level, and include sparser parameterizations of

the ΔX vector in our city-level analysis. The procedure is described in greater detail in the

Appendix. Although the first stage adjustment may not fully eliminate the effect of

observable student characteristics, we anticipate that the inclusion of ΔXc in the second stage

model absorbs most of their remaining variation.



e. Adjusting For Selective Participation in the SAT

         A concern with the use of SAT test scores to measure achievement is selective test

participation. As discussed below, we restrict our sample to cities in states where a majority

of college-bound students write the SAT (rather than the alternative ACT test). Even within

“SAT states”, however, test participation rates vary. Presumably, students at “low

performing” schools are under-represented in the test-taking population, with greater under-

representation in cities with lower overall participation. Positive selection into participation

will tend to attenuate any negative effects of segregation on black relative test scores (Gronau,

1974; Heckman, 1979).12 We attempt to reduce such biases by re-weighting the average

scores from different high schools in a city to reflect their relative enrollments, and by

including a control function in our empirical model based on relative SAT participation rates

across high schools in a city.

         These adjustments are derived from a conventional bivariate normal model of test

participation and test score outcomes (Heckman, 1979). As shown in the Appendix, such a

model leads to a specification for the black-white difference in the adjusted, reweighted test

scores in city c that differs from equation (5) by the addition of two terms:

(6)      Δrc = ΔX’c α’ + ΔBcγ’ + ΔRcδ’ + Fc ψ’ + ζ Δλc + ζ Δθc + ηc + Δec .

In this equation, ζ is a coefficient that reflects the correlation between the unobserved

component of the individual test participation equation and the unobserved component of

the test outcome equation, Δλc is the black-white difference in the enrollment-weighted

average of the school-specific inverse Mills ratio function (evaluated at the test participation

rate of black or white students at each high school in the city), and Δθc is an unobserved

error component that reflects the black-white difference in the degree of within-school

12 The correlation of SAT-taking rates and average scores across schools is positive in our data, which would be

consistent with negative selection into test-taking. We strongly suspect that the individual level selection is
positive, but that large differences in the unobserved determinants of participation rates and mean scores
dominate the across-school correlation.


                                                      13
selectivity of test-writers.

         If test takers were randomly selected at each high school, but different fractions of

students wrote the test at different schools, the control function Δλc would fully correct for

selectivity biases in the observed test scores and Δθc would equal 0. In general, however, test

writers are not randomly selected within schools and so the error component Δθc will not

vanish. If a rise in school or neighborhood segregation causes black relative test scores to

fall but also causes a rise in the relative within-school selectivity of black test takers, the

presence of this term will lead to attenuation in the estimated negative effect of segregation

on relative test scores.



III. Data Sources and Sample Overview

         Our primary source of student achievement data is a sample of SAT records for

roughly one third of test takers in the 1998-2001 high school graduation classes.13 These

data include self-reported family background characteristics as well as high school identifiers,

which we use to match enrollment from the appropriate editions of the Common Core of

Data (CCD, for public school students) and the 1997-8 Private School Survey (PSS). To

minimize the impact of measurement errors we estimate the number of students, the

number of test takers, and the racial composition of each school using averages over the

four years in our data.14 We assign students to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) based

on year-2000 definitions, using school location information in the CCD and PSS files.15 We


13 The sampling rate was 100% for black and Hispanic test-takers and for those from California and Texas, and

25% for others. We use sampling weights in all computations of city-level averages. We exclude observations
for students who reported ethnicity other than white or black (primarily Hispanics and Asians) and those who
did not report their race/ethnicity.
14 This strategy cannot be employed with the PSS, as only one year of data is available.
15 Where a larger metropolitan area is designated a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) with

several sub-areas (Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or PMSAs), we treat the PMSA as the relevant city
definition. In every specification, however, we estimate standard errors that are “clustered” by CMSA.


                                                     14
restrict our analysis of SAT outcomes to MSAs in states with overall test participation rates

of 25% or higher, which we refer to as “SAT states.”

         As described above, we use the SAT microdata to estimate race-specific, within-

school models relating test scores to three key family background variables -- mother’s

education, father’s education, and income.16 We then form an enrollment-weighted average

of the residual scores for black and white students from the high schools in each city. Our

primary dependent variable is the black-white difference in this weighted average.

         Recognizing that SAT scores are influenced not just by the racial composition of a

student’s 12th-grade school but also by the composition of her schools in earlier grades, we

attempt to measure the average exposure of white and black students to minority

schoolmates throughout their educational careers. We compute exposure rates for high

schools in the MSA in 1998-2001 and for elementary schools in 1988-1991, and form an

average of these that puts two-thirds weight on the latter and one-third on the former. Our

school segregation measure is the black-white difference in this lifetime exposure measure.17

         We use data on the racial composition and population of Census tracts in 2000

(from the full population counts, Census 2000 Summary File 1) to construct measures of

neighborhood-level exposure to black and Hispanic neighbors, and thereby of city-level

residential segregation.18 We also use Summary Files computed from 2000 Census long-

form data to estimate the average family background characteristics of black and white

16 These regressions are fit by race, and include unrestricted high school dummies and 114 background
dummies, formed from the 14 income categories reported in the SAT and the full interaction of the 10
categories for each parent’s education. The income and education categories include “missing” as one
possibility.
17 When we analyze outcomes that are only available for public schools or for which we cannot readily

distinguish different grades (e.g. teacher-student ratios), we use point-in-time school segregation measures
computed over the relevant schools and grade levels.
18 Census tracts are initially defined to encompass demographically homogenous neighborhoods of about 4,000

residents, but once drawn generally have stable boundaries. Exposure measures based on Census Block
Groups (typically about 1000 residents) are nearly perfectly correlated across cities with the tract-based
measures and lead to virtually identical estimates.


                                                     15
students in each city, supplementing this with information from the public use samples

(PUMS) for characteristics (e.g. parental education and residual parental wages) that are not

tabulated elsewhere. We also use the PUMS data to construct a measure of the black-white

gap in degree attainment that that is free from any test participation biases. Further details

on our data sources and merging methods are presented in a Data Appendix, available on

request.

         Table 1 gives an overview of the patterns of segregation and test scores for a

selection of cities with different patterns of residential and school segregation. The first two

columns show the fraction black and Hispanic in the metropolitan area.19 Columns C-E

show the mean exposure of black and white students in each city to minority (black and

Hispanic) schoolmates, while the final columns show parallel measures of tract-level

exposure to minority neighbors.

         The first two panels of the table present data for cities with the lowest and highest

levels of school segregation, among the subset of all MSA’s in SAT states with at least 5%

black population shares. The five lowest segregation cities are all in the South: in these

cities, the typical black-white gap in exposure to minority schoolmates (ΔBc) is about 6%. In

three of the cities the gap in exposure to minority neighbors (ΔRc) is comparable, but in two

cities (Wilmington, North Carolina and Gainesville, Florida) neighborhoods are substantially

more segregated. Among the 5 most-segregated cities, 4 are in the mid-Atlantic region: all

have highly segregated neighborhoods as well as schools.20

         We can only identify separate effects of school and neighborhood segregation to the

extent that the two vary independently. The two bottom panels of Table 1 present data for
19 We treat Hispanics as a distinct racial category, excluding them from both the white and black groups. In

2000 Census data, where possible we include multi-race non-Hispanics as blacks if they report black as one of
their races; we never count multi-race individuals as white.
20 Some of the most highly segregated cities in the U.S., like Detroit and Chicago, are in states where a majority

of students write the ACT. These cities are excluded from Table 1 and from all of our SAT analyses.


                                                        16
the cities with the biggest divergence between the two measures, first for cities with relatively

integrated schools and then for cities with relatively segregated schools.21 The degree of

neighborhood segregation is similar in the two groups of cities but the extent of school

segregation is much smaller in the first group (mean exposure gap=13%) than in the second

(mean exposure gap=49%). Although residential and school segregation are highly

correlated, there is clearly substantial independent variation in the two factors.

         Table 2 presents some comparisons between the students in all 331 MSA’s in the

country (columns A-B), those in the 189 cities from SAT states that are included in our

analysis sample (columns C-D), and those in the 142 cities that are excluded from our test

score samples (columns E-F). On average 43 percent of white high school students and 31

percent of black high school students from cities in the SAT states write the SAT. Blacks

are slightly under-represented in the SAT state cities whereas Hispanics are over-

represented.22 Cities from SAT states also have slightly less segregated neighborhoods and

schools than cities in other states.

         The bottom two rows in Table 2 show average SAT scores for the different city

groups and the mean test gap between whites and blacks. Average SAT scores are lower in

high-participation states (Dynarski, 1987; Rothstein, forthcoming), but the black-white

difference is very similar for cities in SAT and non-SAT states, suggesting that use of within-

city differences reduces problems associated with selective test participation.

         As a final descriptive exercise, Figures 1-3 show the correlations across cities

between the black-white adjusted test score gap and the relative segregation of

neighborhoods (Figure 1), the relative segregation of schools (Figure 2), and the part of the
21 We define the degree of divergence as the residual from a regression of school segregation (ΔBc) on

neighborhood segregation (ΔRc).
22 California, Texas, and Florida are all SAT states. In Table 2 (and in the remainder of our analysis), cities are

weighted by (1/Nbc + 1/Nwc)-1 where Nbc and Nwc are the numbers of blacks and whites in the city population.
Cities with very few blacks thus receive very low weights.


                                                        17
relative segregation of schools that is orthogonal to the relative segregation of

neighborhoods (Figure 3). There is a strong negative relationship in the first two graphs

between each racial segregation measure and the relative test scores of black students. 23 The

relationship is weaker when we focus on the component of school segregation that is

orthogonal to neighborhood segregation, and seems to be driven more heavily by a few

outliers. As we document below, this relationship disappears entirely as we add control

variables, though the relationship between residential segregation and black relative test

scores remains strong.



IV. Regression Models for Black-White Gaps in Participation and Scores

a. Basic Models

         Table 3 presents an initial set of estimates of the model given by equation (6). The

upper panel summarizes models for the black-white gap in adjusted SAT scores, while the

lower panel shows a parallel set of models that have the gap in SAT participation as the

dependent variable. All the models include main effects for the overall fraction black and

Hispanic in the city’s schools, dummies for 5 census divisions, and (in the upper panel only)

the black-white gap in a Mill’s ratio formed from the race-specific SAT participation rates in

the city.24 We present three sets of specifications: models with only school segregation in

columns A-C; models with only neighborhood segregation in columns D-F; and models with

both segregation variables in columns G-I.

         The most parsimonious models, in columns A and D, show strong negative effects


23 The SAT-state MSA with the most segregated schools is Gary, Indiana. Newark, New Jersey is second.
Graphs using the black-white gaps in unadjusted scores look very similar to Figures 1-3.
24 Although there are nine Census divisions, only six are represented among SAT states. In Table 3 and the

remainder of the paper, we exclude cities (4 of 189 in SAT states) for which we cannot construct black-white
differences in family background characteristics, introduced in Column C, using the 2000 Census microdata
sample.


                                                      18
of racial segregation (measured across schools or neighborhoods) on average SAT scores

and on SAT participation. The -125 coefficient in the model for SAT scores in column A,

for example, implies that moving from complete segregation to complete integration would

raise black relative SAT scores by 125 points, or about 60 percent of the overall black-white

gap.25 The -0.13 coefficient in the corresponding model for SAT participation suggests that

a shift from complete segregation to full integration would raise the city-wide relative black

participation rate by 13 percentage points.

         The models in columns B and E add controls for a vector of MSA characteristics

(the log of population, the log of land area, the fractions of residents with 13-15 and 16+

years of education, log mean household income, and the Gini coefficient of household

income) and for black-white gaps in observed characteristics (parental education and family

income) among SAT-takers in the MSA.26 These additions reduce the size of the estimated

segregation effect on test scores, but raise the size of the effect on participation. Finally, the

most general specifications in columns C and F add controls for the black-white differences

in several additional family characteristics (parental education, family income, child poverty,

single-parenthood, and maternal employment), measured from 2000 Census data. These

models also include controls for the mean difference in residual wages between black and

white parents, computed separately for men and women. The motivation for including

these wage gap measures is discussed in Section IV. In these specifications the effects of

segregation on SAT scores are reduced somewhat, but remain statistically significant. The

effects on SAT participation are also reduced and are no longer significant.


25 The standard deviation of combined SAT scores is about 200, so the black-white gap is approximately one

standard deviation, similar (in effect size) to the gap measured in the NAEP at ages 9, 13, or 17 (Perie, Morand,
and Lutkus, 2005).
26 For the analysis of SAT participation we do not control for the relative characteristics of SAT takers, since

the population at risk includes all students in a city.


                                                       19
         The models in columns G-I of Table 3 include both segregation measures

simultaneously. In the sparsest specification (G), school segregation appears to have the

larger effect. When we add controls for metropolitan and SAT-taker characteristics,

however, the school segregation coefficient falls to near zero and the residential segregation

coefficient becomes large and negative. The sum of the two coefficients is quite close to the

residential segregation effect in the corresponding models in Columns D-F. We can reject

that the neighborhood segregation effect is zero, but not (in column I) that the two forms of

segregation have equal effects. Similar patterns are seen in the participation models:

Residential segregation appears to reduce relative black participation while school

segregation tends to increase it, and here we can reject equal effects. Overall, it seems that

residential segregation matters, but controlling for this, differences in relative exposure to

minority schoolmates have little effect on black relative achievement. Taking the coefficient

on residential segregation in column F of Table 3 as a benchmark, the implied effect of

moving from a highly segregated city (Gary Indiana, ΔRc=0.70) to a nearly unsegregated city

(Fort Walton Beach Florida, ΔRc=0.06) is a 45 point closing in the black-white SAT gap (or

roughly a 0.22 “effect size”).27

         We have estimated many alternative specifications to probe the robustness of this

conclusion. Some of these alternative models are presented in Appendix Table 1. In one

check, we include a dummy variable for cities from the three states with high fractions of

Hispanic immigrants – California, Florida, and Texas. This has no effect on the pattern of

results seen in Table 3. In a second check, we compared the effects of alternative school

segregation measures. When only elementary school segregation for our cohort of test

27 The -70 coefficient implies a 70/200 =0.35 standard deviation effect of a one-unit decrease in minority share

in the neighborhood. This implies that the -7 percentage point treatment effect on minority exposure in the
MTO experiment should have yielded a 0.025 standard deviation effect on test scores. The estimated
treatment effect on math scores (Sanbonmatsu et et., 2006, Table 4, row 1, column 5) was 0.018 (s.e. 0.03).


                                                       20
takers is included, it has a coefficient of -19 (standard error 20) – very similar to the

coefficient estimate for the “lifetime” segregation average in column I of Table 3. When we

try to include separate effects for elementary and school segregation their coefficients are of

opposite signs (elementary segregation negative, high school segregation positive,

individually and jointly significant) but the sum is small and positive, while the effect of

residential segregation remains large and negative.

         Finally, we estimated models that allow the effects of minority exposure to differ for

black and white students. Specifically, we allowed black students’ exposure to minority

neighbors to have separate effects on black and white test scores, and similarly allowed white

students’ exposure rates to affect both groups. Consistent with the “differenced” functional

form used in Table 3, these models (reported in columns E-G of Appendix Table 1) indicate

that black exposure to minority neighbors reduces black students’ test scores but has little

effect on whites, while the reverse is true for white exposure to minorities.28 We cannot

reject the assumption that exposure to minority neighbors has a similar negative effect on

both blacks and whites, and that neighborhood segregation therefore widens the black-white

test score gap.



d. Selection into SAT-taking

         A potential concern with the results so far is that we may not have fully controlled

for selective SAT participation. To probe the robustness of our results, Columns H and I of

Appendix Table 1 present estimates of our basic specifications that omit the Mill’s ratio

control function and ignore the re-weighting adjustment for differential high school level

participation within a given city. These simpler unadjusted models show a significant but

28These models dispense with the unrestricted MSA fixed effect that is implicit in our differenced models. The
absence of cross-race effects suggests that any MSA effects are uncorrelated with racial composition.


                                                     21
slightly smaller effect of residential segregation on relative test scores, but no effect of school

segregation once the residential measure is included.29 The fact that the unadjusted models

show smaller effects is consistent with the predicted pattern of selectivity biases, under the

assumption that higher scoring students are more likely to write the test in all cities.

Arguably, any remaining selection problems in our adjusted models have a similar effect,

implying that the results in Table 3 understate the true effects of segregation.

         A second and perhaps more persuasive way to evaluate the impact of selective test

participation is to examine models for black-white relative attainment based on outcomes for

a random sample of youths. We used the 2000 Census 5-percent micro samples to estimate

the fraction of 16-24 year olds in each city who either are currently enrolled in school or

have completed high school.30 We then constructed the black-white gap in this outcome

and related it to our city control variables and the segregation measures.

         The resulting estimates are presented in Table 4, using a sample of 234 MSA’s with

at least 50 students of each race in the 5 percent Census samples. The specifications in

columns A-E include only neighborhood segregation, while the models in columns F-J

include both segregation measures. The specifications are similar to those in Table 3, with a

few exceptions: the Mills ratio term is excluded; the SAT-taker background characteristics

(introduced in columns B, E, and H of Table 3) are omitted; and the Census-based measures

of black-white gaps in observable characteristics (introduced in columns C, F, and I of Table

3) are introduced in three stages, with just the parental education measures included in


29 We have also explored other types of selection corrections, including artificially trimming the data to retain

the same fraction of the high school population in each city. Our basic results of large negative effects of
residential segregation and essentially zero effects of non-residential segregation have held up in every
specification.
30 To insulate against bias from endogenous mobility of young people who have left their parents’ homes, we

assign individuals to the MSA where they lived in 1995, when they were aged 11-19. A limitation of the Census
data is that there is no family background information for children who are no longer living with their parents.
Consequently, we make no individual-level adjustments for family background.


                                                       22
Columns C and H of Table 4, the remaining measures except for wage differences added in

Columns D and I, and the parental wage measures added in E and J.

         The simplest models in columns A-C suggest that there is a significant negative

effect of neighborhood segregation on black youths’ relative education outcomes. These

findings are similar in spirit, though smaller in magnitude, to results reported by Cutler and

Glaeser (1997), whose models include fewer controls.31 The corresponding models in

columns F-H suggest that once neighborhood segregation is taken into account, there is little

or no additional effect of school segregation. Although imprecise, these estimates show the

same pattern as our findings for test scores, suggesting that selective SAT participation is not

the driving our main results.

         Nevertheless, examination of the richest specifications in Table 4 (columns D-E and

I-J suggests that inferences about the effects of segregation on educational attainment are

sensitive to the set of background control variables. In particular, once the full set of relative

background variables we use in Table 3 are added, the estimated impacts of school

segregation on its own, or of school and neighborhood segregation taken together, fall in

magnitude and become insignificant. By contrast, the models in Table 3 show robust

negative effects of relative exposure to minority neighbors on black-white relative test

scores. One potential explanation for the difference is that neighborhood segregation has

smaller effects on basic achievement outcomes (like completing high school) than on higher-

level achievement outcomes (like college entry test scores). Unfortunately, however, the

Census outcome models have limited power against reasonable effect sizes, so it is difficult


31 Cutler and Glaeser (1997) use a 1% sample of the 1990 Census, and relate black relative high school
graduation rates (and other outcomes) to a residential segregation measure. Their models only control for 4
city-wide variables: log population, the fraction of blacks in the city, log median income, and manufacturing
share of employment. Their estimates imply that moving from complete segregation to complete integration
would raise relative high school graduation rates of black 20-24 year olds by 30 percentage points. This is
enormous: Even in highly segregated cities in their sample the black graduation rate is 74%.


                                                      23
to reach definitive conclusions.



V. Confounding Influences

         Our reading of the results in Tables 3 and 4 is that there is a relatively strong

relationship between segregation and the black-white achievement gap, and that this

relationship cannot be attributed to selective test participation. More tentatively, the link

appears to run through neighborhoods rather than schools. In this section we address two

key questions: (1) Is the effect of neighborhood segregation on relative achievement

overstated because of omitted variables biases? (2) Is the effect of school segregation on

relative achievement understated?



a. Is the Effect of Neighborhood Segregation Overstated?

         The most obvious source of concern with the results in Table 3 is that there are

unobserved differences in the latent abilities of black and white students in different cities

that are correlated with the degree of segregation in the city. Although the test score gap is

computed from “residual” test scores that control very flexibly for the observed parental

education of SAT test takers, and our models control for black-white differences in parental

characteristics of the SAT takers in each city as well as differences in family characteristics

observed in the Census, it is still possible that unobserved ability gaps remain.

         Recent work (e.g., Heckman and Carneiro, 2003; Cunha et. al, 2005) has shown that

the academic achievement of children is strongly correlated with the cognitive ability of their

parents, and that cognitive ability is a key determinant of earnings. This research suggests

that a useful proxy for the unobserved ability of a child (conditional on parental education) is

the unexplained component of his or her parent’s earnings. Building on this idea, we fit a



                                                    24
standard wage determination model separately by race and gender, and constructed estimates

of the mean residual wage gaps between black and white mothers and fathers in each city.32

The models reported in the final columns of Tables 3 and 4 include these residual wage gaps

as additional controls. Their inclusion has essentially no impact on the estimated segregation

effects, suggesting that differences in the unobserved cognitive abilities of black and white

parents in different cities are not biasing our main results.

         Despite this, the potential for endogeneity bias merits further consideration. There

are two reasons why unobserved differences in the family backgrounds of black and white

children could be correlated with the degree of segregation in a city. One is that the degree

of residential segregation varies endogenously with the characteristics of the local

population. The other is that people selectively move to a city (or move out) in response to

the patterns of segregation, yielding an endogenously selected population. We suspect that

the first mechanism is less important than the second, as residential segregation patterns are

highly stable over time. Table 5A, for example, presents cross-city correlations between

various measures of residential segregation in 2000, 1990, 1980, 1970, and 1960. For 2000

we use two indexes of segregation: our own relative exposure index (ΔRc) and the so-called

isolation index constructed by Glaeser and Vigdor (2001). For earlier years we show the

correlations with isolation indexes constructed from Census tabulations by Cutler, Glaeser,

and Vigdor (1999). Over any 20 year interval the correlation of residential segregation

measures across cities is 0.8 or higher.33


32 Specifically, we used the 2000 Census 5% sample to identify adults with resident children age 18 or under.
For each person we constructed an hourly wage (based on earnings and hours last year), and then regressed
wages on MSA fixed effects, years of education, indicators for high school dropout and college graduation, and
a cubic in potential experience, separately by race and gender. The MSA fixed effect is the mean residual wage
for the race/gender group in that city.
33 It is possible, of course, that segregation depends on the unobserved ability gap in the city at some point far

in the past. We expect that any correlation between current segregation and historical ability gaps is absorbed
by our controls for observed characteristics of current students’ parents.


                                                        25
        A more serious concern is the selective mobility of higher and lower ability black and

white families across cities with differing levels of segregation. To quantify the potential

impact of selective mobility, we examined changes in the distribution of high- and low-skill

black and white families across cities over the 30 year period for which we could assemble

appropriate data. We divided black and white adults in each census year, 1970 through 2000,

into “high”, “medium” and “low” education groups, choosing the cutoffs to keep the shares

of each group approximately constant over time. We then calculated the mean segregation

index experienced by each race/education group in each year, using the 2000 value of

residential segregation for their city of residence as the measure of segregation. (The choice

of a fixed base year for the segregation measure means that changes over time are driven

solely by changes in the distribution of the group across cities).

        The left-hand panels in Figure 4 show the mean values of the segregation index for

each education group in 1980, 1990, and 2000, with blacks in the top row, whites in the

middle row, and the black-white difference in the bottom row. These figures show that both

blacks and whites shifted steadily toward less segregated cities between 1970 and 2000. The

shift was more prominent for high-education blacks, consistent with a pattern of

endogenous mobility that could lead to bias in our sparsest achievement models.

        The second and third columns in Figure 4 show similar graphs for residual residential

segregation, after controlling for census division and racial composition effects (second

column) and the full set of control variables used in our main specifications (third column).

Simply controlling for geographic region eliminates about half of the differential mobility of

low- and high-skill blacks, and it is almost entirely eliminated by the addition of the

remaining control variables. To the extent that mobility differences by observed education

are informative about the relationship with unobserved ability, these graphs suggest that



                                               26
endogenous mobility might introduce bias in extremely sparse models but should not be a

problem for our main estimates.

         In sum, based on the observed mobility patterns of different education groups of

whites versus blacks, the stability of residential segregation within cities over time, and the

results from our investigation of residual wage gaps, we believe it is unlikely that the

residential segregation effects in Table 3 are significantly biased by omitted ability factors.



b. Is the Effect of School Segregation Understated?

         We turn now to the second question raised by the results in Table 3: Are the effects

of school segregation understated? An obvious concern is measurement error. If school

segregation is poorly measured, or highly variable over time, then the measures we have

constructed may be unreliable, leading to attenuation biases. Attenuation would be

particularly severe in models that include residential segregation, as the two are so highly

correlated. To assess the reliability of school segregation, we constructed a number of

independent measures for U.S. cities over a ten year period, and correlated them with our

primary index. One limitation is that we have data on private schools only for 1997-98. The

segregation measures for earlier years thus include only public schools.

         The results are summarized in Table 5B. The first column and row pertain to our

primary index, which includes public and private school students and is constructed to

approximate the school career of our test cohorts. The second variable included is an

analogous index computed only over public school students, which is nearly perfectly

correlated across cities with our primary index. The remaining variables separate out public

elementary and secondary-level segregation, for both 1988-1991 and 1998-2001. The raw

correlations among variables are extremely high, never below 0.94.



                                                      27
         The lower panel of Table 5B reports correlations for residuals from regressions of

school segregation measures on our full vector of control variables (including residential

segregation). The correlations remain quite high even for these residuals, at least 0.64 and

mostly above 0.75. This compares favorably with the reliability of other commonly used

constructs, and leads us to conclude that measurement error attenuation is not a serious

concern with our school segregation measures.

         Nevertheless, as a final check, we present an instrumental variables analysis that

isolates the component of school segregation that is attributable to court-ordered school

desegregation programs implemented in the 1970s and early 1980s in many U.S. cities. The

instrument is based on Welch and Light’s (1987) estimate of the change in the “dissimilarity

index”—an alternative index of racial segregation—for the schools in the main school

district in an MSA, from the year prior to the city’s major desegregation plan to the last year

of implementation of the order.34 Welch and Light (1987) only collected data for larger

school districts, which typically serve the central city of the MSA. We multiply the change in

dissimilarity in this district by its share of metropolitan enrollment. Thus, the instrument

reflects both the “bite” of the main desegregation plan and the size of the desegregated

district relative to the overall MSA.

         Table 6 presents the IV analysis. Given the small sample size for which the

instrument is available, we adopt a parsimonious model similar to the one in column H of

Table 3 (though with slightly less flexible controls for SAT-takers’ background

characteristics). OLS estimates in Column A are quite similar to those from our full sample,

though less precise. Column B shows the first stage estimate: Even after two decades or


34 This variable is set to zero for MSAs containing districts in the Welch and Light sample without a major

desegregation plan. Our sample for the IV analyses thus consists of only 60 MSAs that are both in SAT states
and in the Welch and Light sample.


                                                     28
more the court orders continue to have sizable effects on observed measures of school

segregation. Finally, column C shows the IV estimate. This is relatively imprecise, but gives

no indication that the OLS estimate is biased in such a way as to mask an underlying

negative effect of school segregation.



V. Within School Segregation?

         One potential explanation for our finding that school segregation has little or no

effect on relative achievement is that in cities with highly segregated neighborhoods, school

integration efforts are offset by programs and behaviors that lead to within school segregation

(Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor, 2003; Clotfelter, 2004; Eyler, Cook, and Ward, 1983).35 As a

proxy for within-school exposure, we use data on course enrollment patterns from the SAT

data set. SAT-takers are asked whether they have taken honors courses and whether they

intend to claim advanced placement (AP) credit or course exemptions in college on the basis

of high school work. Column A of Table 7 presents models for the fraction of students in a

city who intend to claim college-level credit in any subject, while Columns B through D

present models for the fraction of students who indicated that they had taken honors

courses in math, English, or any subject, respectively.

         In Panels A and B we present estimates of the relationships between the school and

neighborhood segregation measures and the black and white means of the course-taking

variables. The estimates in Panel A show no significant relationship between either school


35 Anecdotal evidence suggests that districts often create special programs to attract white students to high-

minority schools or, alternatively, to avoid truly desegregating their school systems in the face of judicial
oversight. As an example of the latter, the federal district court judge’s opinion in People Who Care v. Rockford
Board of Education, 851 F. Supp. 905 (1993) states: “The court finds that the ability grouping and tracking
practices of the Rockford School District (hereinafter ‘RSD’) did not represent a trustworthy enactment of any
academically acceptable theory or practice. The RSD tracking practices skewed enrollment in favor of whites
and to the disadvantage of minority students. The court finds that it was the policy of the RSD to use tracking
to intentionally segregate white students from minority students….” (p. 940)


                                                       29
or neighborhood segregation and black course-taking. The estimates in Panel B, by

comparison, show relatively strong negative impacts of school segregation on honors and

AP participation by whites, many of which are at the margin of significance. To interpret

these impacts, note that a rise in our segregation index implies that whites are relatively less

exposed to minorities. Thus, a negative coefficient means that white students are more likely

to take honors and AP classes in cities with more integrated schools and neighborhoods.

Finally, Panel C reports estimates for the black-white difference in honors participation at

the city level. Increased school segregation is associated with large positive effects on the

black-white gap in honors course taking and in AP participation. Increases in neighborhood

segregation have negative effects, although the coefficients are mostly smaller and uniformly

insignificant.

         Though participation rates in honors and AP courses are limited measures of within-

school exposure, the results in Table 7 support the hypothesis that across-school integration

is associated with within-school segregation Holding constant neighborhood segregation,

white students are more likely to participate in “high track” courses when schools are more

integrated, presumably limiting the classroom-level exposure of blacks to whites.36 To the

extent that school peer effects operate through classroom-level exposure, then, our school

segregation measure may have relatively little signal for the relevant peer group.



VI. Indirect Effects of School Quality and Peer Characteristics

         All of our specifications so far have excluded any characteristics of the schools and

neighborhoods of black and white students other than their minority composition. As noted


36 We have also estimated models for the tracking measures that separate out the components of school

segregation attributable to court-ordered desegregation. Standard errors are large, but the results indicate that,
if anything, court-ordered desegregation has larger effects on tracking than does the residual component.


                                                        30
in the discussion of equation (5), our coefficient estimates capture direct minority exposure

effects as well as any indirect effects associated with relative resources, peer characteristics,

or macro segregation effects that can be predicted by the relative exposure of black and

white students to minority schoolmates and neighbors. As a final step in our analysis we

explore the potential contributions of two types of indirect effects: those arising from

differences in school quality, and those arising from the relative incomes of schoolmates and

neighbors.



a. Relative School Quality

         Unfortunately, there are few measures of school quality available at the national level

for broad samples of schools. We focus on a limited set of school resource measures (from

the Common Core of Data, or CCD) and teacher quality measures (from the Schools and

Staffing Survey, or SASS). Since the magnitude of any indirect effect of school resources

depends on the extent to which differences in the resources at schools attended by black and

white students in a city are correlated with ΔBc and ΔRc , we begin by presenting a series of

models for the city-wide “quality gaps” between black and white students’ schools, with the

same explanatory variables included in our models for the black-white test score gap in Table

3. These models are presented in Table 8.

         In Column A, we examine the number of full-time-equivalent teachers per student at

public schools attended by white and black students in each MSA. Column B reports

estimates for expenditures per pupil in districts enrolling white and black students.37 Black-

white gaps in these two measures are essentially unrelated to the degree of school or


37 District-level spending per capita data are available from the CCD Local Education Agency Finance Survey

(also known as the F-33 portion of the Census of Governments). Unfortunately, this is an imperfect measure
of the actual spending at black and white students’ schools if spending varies across schools in each district.


                                                       31
neighborhood segregation in a city.

         Columns C-F report similar models for the black-white gap in average teacher

characteristics, estimated from the SASS. Models for the gaps in average salaries and

experience between the teachers at black and white students’ schools (columns C and D) are

noisy but show no significant segregation effects. The model in column E shows that

neighborhood segregation is associated with fewer teachers who have undergraduate degrees

in education at black students’ schools relative to those attended by white students.

Assuming that the fraction of teachers with an education major is a negative quality

indicator, this could mean that part of our estimated segregation effects on test scores reflect

indirect effects of teacher credentials, though we suspect any such effect is small. Finally,

column F shows that black students have a substantially lower relative fraction of white

teachers in cities with greater school segregation. Interestingly, there is no corresponding

effect of neighborhood segregation.

         We have also estimated variants of the models in Table 3 that included the school

quality measures directly. As is well known from the omitted variables formula, there is a

direct connection between the coefficient estimates in Table 8 and the difference in the

estimated effects of segregation with and without controls for school quality gaps.38

Consistent with the findings in Table 8, the estimated segregation effects on test scores are

invariant to inclusion of any of the available measures, either alone or in combination.



b. Schoolmate and Neighborhood Income

         Differences in the average characteristics of schoolmates and neighbors of black and

38 Unfortunately, as the SASS samples relatively few teachers in each MSA, the teacher quality measures are

quite noisy. This attenuates their estimated effects on test scores and reduces the impact of their inclusion on
the segregation coefficients. By contrast, measurement error in the resource variables would not bias the
estimates in Table 8.


                                                       32
white students may also contribute to indirect exposure effects. To provide some evidence

on the potential magnitudes, we used data from the CCD to estimate the black-white gap in

average exposure to schoolmates receiving free school lunches (a common though imperfect

proxy for low income) and data from the Census to compute the black-white gap in average

neighborhood income.

        Columns A and B of Table 9 present models in which we regress these measures on

our racial segregation measures. As shown in column A, the black-white gap in exposure to

schoolmates receiving free lunches is positively related to the relative segregation of the

schools in a city, but negatively related to the degree of neighborhood segregation. Thus,

any negative effect of schoolmate poverty on test scores should contribute negatively to the

estimated effect of school segregation but positively to the estimated effect of residential

segregation. The model in column B shows that the black-white gap in mean neighborhood

income is negatively related to neighborhood segregation (but uncorrelated with school

segregation). Any positive effect of neighborhood income on student achievement should

therefore contribute negatively to the estimated residential segregation effect.

        Columns C, D, and E present models that assess these conjectures directly, by

adding the school lunch and neighborhood income measures to the specification shown in

column I of Table 3. Consistent with the pattern of results in Table 3, differential exposure

to low-income schoolmates—at least using an admittedly limited proxy based on school lunch

participation—has little effect on relative black test scores, while differential exposure to

low-income neighbors seems to reduce black performance. After controlling for the indirect

effect associated with neighborhood income, the estimated effect of exposure to minority

neighbors remains negative but is reduced by about one-half and is no longer statistically

insignificant. These estimates suggest that an important share of the neighborhood



                                               33
segregation effect measured in our main specifications can be explained as an indirect effect

of exposure to low income neighbors (Wilson, 1987), rather than as a direct minority

exposure effect.



VII. Summary and Conclusions

         In this paper we present new evidence on the effects of racial segregation on the

relative achievement of black students. Building from a model in which the racial

composition of school and neighborhood peer groups exerts both direct and indirect causal

effects on student achievement, we show that the black-white achievement gap in a city will

vary with the relative segregation of schools and neighborhoods in the city.

         Our main empirical evidence is based on SAT outcomes for one third of test takers

in the 1998-2001 test cohorts. We match test-takers to information on the racial

composition of their high schools and to an extensive set of family background

characteristics of black and white students in their cities. To address concerns about

potential selectivity biases in the SAT outcomes, we also use 2000 Census data to construct

measures of the relative achievement of black and white youth in different metropolitan

areas.

         When we focus on one type of segregation at a time, both school and neighborhood

segregation appear to have negative effects on black relative test scores and educational

attainment. In models that include both school and neighborhood segregation, however, the

effects of relative exposure to black and Hispanic schoolmates are uniformly small and

statistically insignificant, whereas the effects of relative exposure to black and Hispanic

neighbors are negative. Probes into possible explanations for the absence of school

segregation effects, including instrumental variables estimates based on court ordered



                                               34
desegregation programs, give no indication that our estimates are biased in a way that would

obscure negative effects of school segregation.

       Taken as a whole, our results indicate that segregation matters for black relative

achievement. The precise channels for these effects remains open, although our tentative

conclusion is that the neighborhood composition matters more than school composition.

Moreover, an important share of the neighborhood segregation effect may be an indirect

effect deriving from the strong correlation between a neighborhood’s minority composition

and its mean income.

                                                Appendix

A. Taking Advantage of Student-Level Covariates

         To fully exploit our rich microdata, we partial out the student-level covariates

observed in the SAT files (mother’s education, father’s education, and family income) before

aggregating to the city level. We estimate separate student-level models for white and black

test takers that each include unrestricted school effects and a highly flexible specification for

these covariates:

         Yijsc = ζjsc + fj(Xijsc) + εijsc.

We then form an adjusted test score for each student:

         rijsc = Yijsc - fˆ j(Xijsc),

and consider a city-level model for the difference in mean adjusted test scores:

(A1)     r1c - r2c = ΔX’c α’ + ΔBcγ’ + ΔRcδ’ + Fc ψ’ + vc + e1c - e2c ,

where ejc = fjc - fˆ jc , fjc represents the mean of fj(Xijsc) for students of race j in city c, fˆ jc

represents its estimated counterpart; and ΔX’c includes black-white differences in a limited

selection of background variables (including fˆ , several of its individual arguments, and

additional measures that are available from Census data). Although the first stage

adjustment may not fully eliminate the effect of observable student characteristics, we

anticipate that the inclusion of ΔX’c in the second stage model absorbs most of the

remaining variation in Δec.


B. Derivation of Selection-Corrected Estimation Model

         Assume that the probability that student i in race group j in school s in city c writes

the SAT is given by a latent index model of the form:

(B1)     P(i writes test| Xijsc; s,j,c) = pijsc = P( Xijsc πj + μijsc ≥ kjsc ) ,


                                                      i
where μijsc is an error component and kjsc is a school and group-specific threshold. Assuming

that μijsc and the error εijsc in the test score outcome model (equation 1) are jointly normally

distributed, with a distribution that is constant across schools (but may vary by race) the

expected test score for student i in group j in school s, conditional on writing the test, is

(B2)    E[ yijsc |i writes test, Xijsc; s,j,c ] = Xijscαj + Zsc βj + Wijsc νj

                                          + Bsc γj + Rijsc δj + ujsc + ζj λ(pijsc) ,

where λ(p) is the inverse Mills ratio function evaluated at Φ−1(p) and ζj is a race-specific

coefficient that depends on the correlation of μijsc and εijsc. The adjusted observed test score

for individual i is therefore:

(B3)    rijsc = X’ijsc αj + Zsc βj + Wijsc νj + Bsc γj + Rijsc δj + ujsc + ζj λ(pijsc) + eijsc,

where eijsc combines the estimation error in fˆ j and the deviation of yijsc from its conditional

expectation.

        A simple average of the observed test scores in a city will contain a participation-

weighted average of the school effects ujsc’s that differs from the unconditional mean ujc. The

first step in our adjustment procedure is therefore to reweight the data to obtain an

enrollment-weighted average of the observed residual test scores for black and white

students.

        rjc = 1/Njc Σs Nisc rjsc = 1/Njc Σs Njsc/Mjsc Σi rijsc = 1/Njc Σs Σi pjsc-1 rijsc ,

where Njc is the total number of 12th graders of group j in city c, Njsc is the number of 12th

graders in school s, Mjsc is the number of test-takers in group j in school s, and pjsc =Mjsc/Njsc

is the test participation rate of group j in school s. Equation (B3) implies that:

(B4)    rjc = X’jc αj + Zjc βj + Wjc νj + Bjc γj + Rjc δj +             ujc +

                 ζj (1/Njc) Σ s Σ i pjsc-1 λ(pijsc) + ejc ,



                                                       ii
where Zjc , Wjc , Rjc , Bjc and ujc are the same as in equation (2) of the main text.

        Next, consider a first order expansion of the selection-correction function for

individual i around pjsc, the test participation rate for students of group j in school s:

        λ(pijsc) = λ(pjsc) + (pijsc - pjsc) λ’(pjsc) + ξijsc .

For a range of probabilities between 0.2 and 0.8 the function λ(p) is approximately linear and

the error ξijsc is small. Using this expansion:

   (1/Njc) Σ s Σ i pjsc-1 λ(pijsc) = (1/Njc) Σ s Σ i pjsc-1 { λ(pjsc) + (pijsc - pjsc) λ’(pjsc) + ξijsc }

                                  = λjc + θjc + ξjc ,

where

        λjc = (1/Njc) Σ s Σ i pjsc-1 λ(pjsc) ,

        ξjc   = (1/Njc) Σ s Σ i pjsc-1 ξijsc ,

         θjc = (1/Njc) Σ s Njsc λ’(pjsc) (1/Njsc) Σ i (pijsc - pjsc)

              = (1/Njc) Σ s Njsc λ’(pjsc) {pTjsc - pjsc },

and pTjsc is the average test participation probability among the test writers of group j in school s.

Note that the first term, λjc, is just an enrollment-weighted average of the inverse Mills ratio

functions evaluated at the (race-specific) test participation rates at each school. The second

term, ξjc, is an average approximation error, which we expect to be small. The third term, θjc,

is more problematic. This term measures the degree of “within-school” selectivity of test-

takers. It disappears if test participation is random within a school, but is strictly positive

otherwise.

        Combining these results with equation (B4), an approximate expression for the

average adjusted test score for group j in city c is:

(B5)    rjc = X’jc αj + Zjc βj + Wjc νj + Bjc γj + Rjc δj + ujc + ζj λjc + ζj θjc + ejc .

Differencing between blacks and whites in the same city and substituting equation (3) from


                                                      iii
the main text for the difference in the unobserved ability components leads to:

(B6)    Δrc = r1c - r2c = X’1c α1 – X’2c α2 + Z1c β1 – Z2c β2 + W1c ν1 – W2c ν2

                       + B1cγ1 – B2cγ2 + R1c δ1 – R2c δ2 + Fc ψ + ζ1 λ1c – ζ2 λ2c

                       + ζ1 θ1c – ζ2 θ2c + ηc + e1c - e2c .

or, if the coefficients β, δ, γ, and ζ are the same for whites and blacks, equation (6) in the

text.

Notes: Segregation rankings in first two panels are by difference in fraction minority (black and Hispanic) in black and white
students' schools, as in column E. In second two panels, rankings are by the residual from a regression of this measure on an
analogous measure computed over census tracts (column H). In each case, the 5 most-segregated and least-segregated cities in
SAT states with at least 5% black population are shown. Average listed in bottom row is average over all cities meeting these
criteria, weighted by (Nw-1 + Nb-1)-1, where Nw and Nb are the number of white and black residents of the MSA, respectively.

Notes: All models are weighted by (Nw-1 + Nb-1)-1. City-level black-white differences in residual SATs (top panel) are computed
over SAT-taker data that are re-weighted using school-by-race participation rates; see text for details. All specifications include
controls for census division fixed effects and main effects for the fraction black and fraction Hispanic in the city's schools; those
in top panel also include a control for the black-white difference in an inverse Mills ratio computed from city-by-race-level SAT
participation rates . All standard errors are clustered on the CMSA.

Notes: All models are weighted by (Nw-1 + Nb-1)-1. Dependent variable is the difference between blacks and
whites in the percentage of youth who have finished HS or who are enrolled in school, measured over 16-24
year olds in the 2000 census who lived in the metropolitan area in 1995. Sample excludes MSAs with fewer
than 50 black or 50 white observations. The persistence gap ranges in principle from -100 to 100, and has
sample mean -6.9 and S.D. 3.8. All specifications include controls for census division fixed effects and main
effects for the fraction black and fraction Hispanic in the city's schools. Columns C-E (and H-J) introduce
control variables brought in in column F (and I) of Table 3 in three stages. All standard errors are clustered on
the CMSA.

Notes: 1988-91 school segregation measures are unavailable for MSAs in states that did not report the racial
composition of schools in those years. 1998-2001 lifetime segregation average places 2/3 weight on the 1988-91
elementary segregation measure and 1/3 on the 1998-2001 high school segregation measure; when the former is
unavailable, a segregation measure is computed using the relevant cohort in the first available data. For example,
for Maine the 1988-91 elementary segregation measure is replaced by a measure for grades 5-8 in 1993-4; 6-9 in
1994-5; 7-10 in 1995-6; and 8-11 in 1996-7.

Notes: All models are weighted by (Nw-1 + Nb-1)-1. Dependent variable in each column is the estimated difference between
the average of the indicated variable in black students' schools (districts in col. A) and that in white students' schools. School
segregation measures are computed over current (1998-2001) enrollment in all grades, and restricted to public schools in
Columns A and B. All columns include controls from column D of Table 4. All standard errors are clustered on the CMSA.

Notes: Model in Column A is that from Table 3, Column I. Remaining columns modify the specification slightly, with the
same set of control variables (except that in Columns H and I, the inverse Mill's ratio control is omitted and black-white gaps in
SAT-takers' background characteristics are computed from un-reweighted data). Dependent variable in Column F is the
adjusted mean score among blacks; in Column G among whites.
