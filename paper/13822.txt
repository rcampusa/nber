                                            ABSTRACT

Agents with more experience make better choices. We measure learning dynamics using a panel with
four million monthly credit card statements. We study add-on fees, specifically cash advance, late
payment, and overlimit fees. New credit card accounts generate fee payments of $15 per month. Through
negative feedback -- i.e. paying a fee -- consumers learn to avoid triggering future fees. Paying a fee
last month reduces the likelihood of paying a fee in the current month by about 40%. Controlling
for account fixed effects, monthly fee payments fall by 75% during the first three years of account
life. We find that learning is not monotonic. Knowledge effectively depreciates about 10% per month,
implying that learning displays a strong recency effect.

1     Introduction
    Economists believe that learning through experience underpins optimization and gener-
ates technological progress. Large literatures measure learning dynamics in the lab,1 and in
the field.2
    However, because of data limitations, relatively few papers measure learning in the field
with micro-level (household) panel data. Among such household studies, most show that
households learn to optimize over time. For example, Miravete (2003) and Agarwal, Chom-
sisengphet, Liu and Souleles (2007) respectively show that consumers switch telephone calling
plans and credit card contracts to minimize monthly bill payments.
    Moreover, a few papers are able to identify the specific information flows that elicit
learning. For instance, Fishman and Pope (2006) study video stores, and find that renters
are more likely to return their videos on time if they have recently been fined for returning
them late. Ho and Chong (2003) use grocery store scanner data to estimate a model in which
consumers learn about product attributes. They find that the model has greater predictive
power, with fewer parameters, than forecasting models used by retailers.3
    In this current paper, we study the process by which individual households learn to avoid
add-on fees in the credit card market.4          We analyze a panel dataset that contains three
years of credit card statements, representing 120,000 consumers and 4,000,000 credit card
statements. We focus our analysis on credit card fees – late payment, over limit, and cash
advance fees – since some observers argue that new customers do not optimally minimize
such fees.5 We want to know whether credit card holders pay fewer fees with experience.

Erev (1995), VanHuyck, Battalio and Rankin (2001), Anderson (2000), Camerer (2003), and Wixted (2004a,
2004b).

     For example, see Zimmerman (1982), Argote, Beckman and Epple (1990), Gruber (1992), Bahk and Gort
(1993), Marimon and Sunder (1994), McAfee and McMillan (1996), Nye (1996), Sargent (1999), Benkard
(2000), Thompson (2001), Thornton and Thompson (2001), Evans, Honkaphoja and Marimon (2001), Evans
and Honkaphoja (2001), Barrios and Strobl (2004), List (2003), Harrison and List (2004).

     Lemieux and MacLeod (2000) study the eﬀect of an increase in unemployment benefits in Canada. They
find that the propensity to collect unemployment benefits increased with a first-time exposure to this new
system via an unemployment spell. Barber, Odean and Strahlevitz (2004) find evidence that individual
investors tend to repurchase stocks that they previously sold for a gain.
   4
     There is a large literature on the magnitude of interest payments and fees in the credit card market:
Ausubel (1991), Calem and Mester (1995), Massoud, Saunders and Scholnick (2006), Ausubel (1999), Kerr
and Dunn (2002), Shui and Ausubel (2004), DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004), Kerr (2004), Calem, Gordy
and Mester (2005).
   5
     For example, Frontline reports that “The new billions in revenue reflect an age-old habit of human be-


                                                    2
    We find that fee payments are very large immediately after the opening of an account. We
find that new accounts generate direct monthly fee payments that average $15 per month.6
However, these payments fall by 75 percent during the first four years of account life. To
formally study these dynamics, we estimate a learning model with the Method of Simulated
Moments.      The data reveal that learning is driven by feedback.              Making a late payment
— and consequently paying a fee — reduces the probability of another late payment in the
subsequent month by 44 percent.
    These learning eﬀects may be driven by many diﬀerent channels. Consumers learn about
fees when they are forced to pay them. Alternatively, consumers may pay more attention to
their credit card account when they have recently paid fees. Through these many channels,
card holders learn to sharply cut their fee payments over time.
    We find that the learning dynamics are not monotonic.                  Card holders act as if their
knowledge depreciates — i.e., their learning patterns exhibit a recency eﬀect.7 A late pay-
ment charge from the previous month is more influential than an identical charge that was
paid a year ago. The monthly hazard rate of a fee payment increases as previous fee pay-
ments recede further into the past (holding all else equal). We estimate that this knowledge
eﬀectively at a rate of between 10 and 20 percent per month. At first glance, this finding
seems counter-intuitive. But there are actually several examples of papers that have found
such forgetting eﬀects. For instance, Benkard (2000) finds evidence for both learning and
forgetting — that is, depreciation of productivity over time — in the manufacturing of aircraft,
as do Argote, Beckman and Epple (1990), in shipbuilding.
    Our findings imply that learning is very powerful, but that knowledge depreciation par-
tially oﬀsets learning. Nevertheless, the net eﬀect of learning is clear. Learning generates a

havior: Most people never anticipate they will pay late, so they do not shop around for better late fees.”
(http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/more/rise.html) There is also a nascent academic
literature that studies how perfectly rational firms interact in equilibrium with imperfectly rational con-
sumers. See Shui and Ausubel (2004), DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004, 2006), Miao (2005), Mullainathan
and Shleifer (2005), Oster and Morton (2005), Gabaix and Laibson (2006), Heidhues and Koszegi (2006),
Jin and Leslie (2006), Koszegi and Rabin (2006), Spiegler (2006), and Ellison (forthcoming) for an overview.
    6
      Moreover, this understates the impact of fees, since some behavior – e.g. a pair of late payments –
not only triggers direct fees but also triggers an interest rate increase, which is not captured in our $15
calculation. Suppose that a consumer is carrying $2,000 of debt. Changing the consumer’s interest rate
from 10% to 20% is equivalent to charging the consumer an extra $200. Late payments also may prompt
a report to the credit bureau, adversely aﬀecting the card holder’s credit accessability and creditworthness.
The average consumer has 4.8 cards and 2.7 actively used cards.

substantial net reduction in fee payments.
    We organize our paper as follows, Section 2 summarizes our data and presents our basic
evidence for learning and backsliding. Section 3 presents a model for those patterns. This
model is estimated with the Method of Simulated Moments in section 4. Section 5 discusses
alternative explanations for our findings. In Section 6, we draw some conclusions.



2     Two Patterns in Fee Payment
    In this section, we describe the dataset and present two sets of reduced-form analyses.
This analysis provides a summary of key moments. Formal estimation of a structural model
follows in section 4.


2.1     Data
    We use a proprietary panel dataset from a large U.S. bank that issues credit cards na-
tionally. The dataset contains a representative random sample of about 128,000 credit card
accounts followed monthly over a 36 month period (from January 2002 through December
2004). The bulk of the data consists of the main billing information listed on each account’s
monthly statement, including total payment, spending, credit limit, balance, debt, purchase
and cash advance annual percentage rate (APR), and fees paid. At a quarterly frequency,
we observe each customer’s credit bureau rating (FICO score) and a proprietary (internal)
credit ‘behavior’ score. We have credit bureau data about the number of other credit cards
held by the account holder, total credit card balances, and mortgage balances. We have
data on the age, gender and income of the account holder, collected at the time of account
opening. Further details on the data, including summary statistics and variable definitions,
are available in the data appendix.
    We focus on three important types of fees, described below: late fees, over limit fees, and
cash advance fees.8

    8
      Other types of fees include annual, balance transfer, foreign transactions, and pay by phone. All of
these fees are relatively less important to both the bank and the borrower. Fewer issuers (the most notable
exception being American Express) continue to charge annual fees, largely as a result of increased competition
for new borrowers (Agarwal et al., 2005). The cards in our data do not have annual fees. A balance transfer
fee of 2-3% of the amount transferred is assessed on borrowers who shift debt from one card to another.
Since few consumers repeatedly transfer balances, borrower response to this fee will not allow us to study
learning about fee payment- though see Agarwal et al. (2006) for a discussion of other borrower uses of


                                                      4
   1. Late Fee: A direct late fee of $30 or $35 is assessed if the borrower makes a payment
        beyond the due date on the credit card statement.             If the borrower is late by more
        than 60 days once, or by more than 30 days twice within a year, the bank may also
        impose indirect late fees by raising the APR to over 24 percent.9 Such indirect fees are
        referred to as ‘penalty pricing.’ The bank may also choose to report late payments to
        credit bureaus, adversely aﬀecting consumers’ FICO scores. Our data analysis covers
        only direct late fees (and not penalty pricing).

   2. Over Limit Fee: A direct over limit fee, also of $30 or $35, is assessed the first time
        the borrower exceeds his or her credit limit in a given month. Penalty pricing also
        results from over limit transactions. Our data analysis covers only direct over limit
        fees (and not penalty pricing).

   3. Cash Advance Fee: A direct cash advance fee of 3 percent of the amount advanced
        or $5 (whichever is greater) is levied for each cash advance on the credit card. Unlike
        the first two types of fees, a cash advance fee can be assessed many times per month.
        Cash advances do not invoke penalty pricing. However, the APR on cash advances is
        typically greater than that on purchases, and is usually 16 percent or more. Our data
        analysis covers only direct cash advance fees (and not subsequent interest charges).


2.2      Reduced form analyses
2.2.1     Fee payment by account tenure

    Figure 1 reports the frequency of each fee type as a function of account tenure.                   The
regression – like all those that follow – controls for time eﬀects, account fixed eﬀects, and
time-varying attributes of the borrower (e.g. variables that capture card utilization each pay

balance transfer cards. The foreign transaction fees and pay by phone fees together comprise less than three
percent of the total fees collected by banks.
   9
     If the borrower does not make a late payment during the six months after the last late payment, the
APR will revert to its normal (though not its promotional) level.

                        j
The dependent variable fi,t is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a fee of type j is
                                                                               Late
paid by account i at tenure t. Fee categories, j, include late payment fees – fi,t  – over
              Over                            Advance
limit fees – fi,t  – and cash advance fees – fi,t     . Parameter α is a constant; φi is
an account fixed eﬀect; ψtime is a time fixed-eﬀect; Spline(T enurei,t ) is a spline10 that takes
account tenure (time since account was opened) as its argument; P urchasei,t is the total
quantity of purchases in the current month; Activei,t is a dummy variable that reflects the
existence of any account activity in the current month; BillExisti,t−1 is a dummy variable
that reflects the existence of a bill with a non-zero balance in the previous balance; Utili,t ,
for utilization, is debt divided by the credit limit;            i,t   is an error term. Table 1 provides
mnemonics, definitions and summary statistics for the independent variables used in our
analyses.
       Figure 1 plots the expected frequency of fees as a function of account tenure, holding the
other control variables fixed at their means.11              This analysis shows that fee payments are
fairly common when accounts are initially opened, but that the frequency of fee payments
declines rapidly as account tenure increases. In the first four years of account tenure, the
monthly frequency of cash advance fee payments drops from 57% of all accounts to 13%
of all accounts. The frequency of late fee payments drops from 36% to 8%. Finally, the
frequency of over limit fee payments drops from 17% to 5%.12
       Figures 2 reports the average value of each fee type as a function of account tenure. The

     The spline has knots every 12 months through month 72.
  11
     Tenure in all figures starts at month two since borrowers cannot, by definition, pay late or over limit
fees in the first month their accounts are open.
  12
     We repeat the analysis controlling for behavior and FICO scores, both lagged by three months to reflect
the fact that they are only computed quarterly. We find very similar patterns.

data plotted in Figure 2 is generated by estimating,

                    j
                  Vi,,t = α + φi + ψtime + Spline(T enurei,t )

                            γ 1 Utili,t−1 +   i,t .



The dependent variable Vi,tj is the value of fees of type j paid by account i at tenure t. All
other variables are as before.
   Figure 2 shows that, when an account is opened, the card holder pays $6.65 per month
in cash advance fees, $5.63 per month in late fees, and $2.46 per month in over limit fees.
These numbers understate the total cost incurred by fee payments, as these numbers do not
include interest payments on the cash advances, the eﬀects of penalty pricing (i.e. higher
interest rates), or the adverse eﬀects of higher credit scores on other credit card fee structures.
Like Figure 1, Figure 2 shows that the average value of fee payments declines rapidly with
account tenure.
   Figures 1 and 2 imply that fee payments substantially fall with experience. We next turn
to a second pattern in our data.


2.2.2   The impact of past fee payment on current fee payment

   There are four reasons to expect fee payments to have intertemporal linkages. First, the
(cross-sectional) type of the card holder (e.g. forgetful) may influence fee paying behavior,
causing fee payments to be positively autocorrelated; specifically, if person i pays a fee in
period t then person i is more likely to be of the type that pays fees in general, implying that
person i has a higher likelihood of paying a fee in period t + k relative to other subjects in
our sample. Second, transitory shocks that persist over more than one month (for instance,
an unemployment spell) may influence fee paying behavior, causing fees to be positively
autocorrelated. Third, transitory shocks that are negatively correlated across months (for
instance, an annual vacation) will cause fees to be negatively autocorrelated. Fourth, fee
payments may engender learning, causing fees to be negatively autocorrelated.




                                                      7
       These four eﬀects will jointly influence the following test statistic. We calculate:

                  E [ft | ft−k = 1]
          Lt,k ≡
                        E [ft ]
                  Probability of paying a fee given the agent paid a fee k periods ago
(2)             =
                                      Probability of paying a fee

To avoid Nickell bias, the expectations in Lt,k are calculated without conditioning on the
RHS variables from the previous subsection (most importantly, we do not use person fixed
eﬀects to calculate Lt,k ). Specifically, E [ft ] is just the average frequency of fee payments
in period t.13 Likewise, E [ft | ft−k = 1] is the average frequency of fee payments in period t
among the subjects who paid a fee at time t − k.
       Conditioning on this sparse information, a consumer who paid a fee k periods ago has a
probability of paying a fee equal to the baseline probability, E [ft ] , multiplied by Lt,k . A
value of 1 for Lt,k indicates that having paid a fee k periods does not change the expected
probability of paying a fee this period; a value less than one indicates lagged fee payment
is associated with a reduction in the expected probability, and a value greater than one
indicates lagged fee payment are associated with an increase in the expected probability.
For example, if Lt,1 = 0.6, a consumer who paid a fee last month has a probability of paying
a fee this month that is 40% below the baseline probability.
       We report averages of Lt,k :
                                                  1X
                                                     T
                                           Lk ≡         Lt,k .
                                                  T t=1

Hence, Lk is the average relative likelihood of paying a fee, if the account holder paid a fee
k periods ago. The Lk statistic illustrates the some important time series properties in our
data while avoiding econometric problems associated with estimating probit or logit models
with fixed eﬀects for a large N dataset. The statistic also avoids the fixed-eﬀect biases in
dynamic models (Nickell 1982).
       Figure 3 plots Lk for all three types of credit card fees for values of k ranging from 1 to
35. All three lines start below 1, indicating that a fee payment last month is associated with
a less than average likelihood of making a fee payment this month. For both cash advance
and late fees, having paid a fee one month ago is associated with a 40% reduction in the

  13
    Observations used for the calculation of Lk are from subjects who are in our sample at both date t and
date t − k.


                                                    8
likelihood of paying a fee in the current month. For over limit fees, having paid a fee last
month is associated with a 50% reduction in the likelihood of paying a fee in the current
month.
       The Lk plots rise with k, indicating that as a given fee payment recedes into the past,
the negative association between this fixed lagged fee payment and current fee payments
is diminished.      By the time one year has passed, the association between the lagged fee
payment and current fee payment has almost vanished.
       For large values of k, all three graphs rise above 1. This asymptotic property probably
reflects the variation in fee payments, which is driven by cross-sectional variation in the
(persistent) type of the borrower. Some individuals have a relatively high long-run likelihood
of paying fees. For instance, imagine that 20 percent of consumers never pay a fee (maybe
because they are very disciplined), while the others have a long-run monthly probability
b > 0 of paying a fee. Then, the long run Lk is 1/0.8 = 1.25.14
       In sum, the data show a robust time-series pattern. Paying a fee last month is associated
with a sharply reduced likelihood of paying a fee this month.                 Paying a fee a year ago
has little relationship to the likelihood of paying a fee now. Paying a fee two years ago is
associated with a 20% elevation in the likelihood of paying a fee now.
       Our findings imply that the there must be a mechanism that produces the short-run
negative association.      Moreover, this mechanism must be strong enough to temporarily
overwhelm the positive long-run association in fee payments driven by type variation. We
next present a model that captures these dynamic patterns.15



3        A simple model of learning and backsliding
       The previous section showed that fee payments decline over time, and paying a past fee
reduces the likelihood of paying a current fee, but with diminishing impact as the conditioned
fee payment recedes into the past. In this section we describe a simple learning model, which
can also be interpreted as a simple model of attention and inattention. This model includes
three components: a stock of feedback, a dynamic updating equation, and a mapping from

  14
     The numerator of (2) is b, while the denominator is 0.8b. So Lk = b/ (0.8b) = 1/0.8.
  15
     The short-run drop in Lk would be even bigger if it were not oﬀset by the positive autocorrelation in
fees produced by both variation in types and transitory (multi-month) variation in fee-paying propensities.

the stock of feedback to the next month’s fee payment.
      Let Ft represent the eﬀective stock of F eedback. Let ft ∈ {0, 1} represent the current
feedback. For simplicity, assume that experience is binary so that ft = 0 (if you are not
charged a fee at time t) and ft = 1 (if you are). The stock of feedback, Ft , is:

                                                           X
                                                           t
(3)                                   Ft = δ t F0 + ψt +         δ t−s fs .
                                                           s=1


In this dynamic updating equation, δ ∈ [0, 1] represents the depreciation rate of the stock
of feedback. If δ = 1, there is no depreciation, and if δ = 0, there is full depreciation after
one period. We refer to this as “depreciation” but δ captures many related eﬀects including
recency bias, salience, forgetting, or any other form of temporal backsliding.16 The term ψt
means that, even if the consumer receives no feedback, she still learns with the passage of
time, perhaps via word of mouth.
      A consumer with stock of knowledge Ft will pay attention to the fees with probability
A (Ft ), which we parametrize as:


(4)              Probability of paying attention to the fee: A (Ft ) = C + De−κFt


with κ, C, D ≥ 0, and C +D ≤ 1. We view Equation (4) as a representation of the psychology
of attention, or memory. This equation implies that events that have happened relatively
frequently are easier to remember. Also, after an extensive amount of learning, attention
saturates to C + D. If C + D = 1, learning is perfect in the long run, but if C + D < 1,
attention is imperfect, even in the long run.
      A consumer faces two mutually exclusive types of opportunities. With probability p00 ,
he can experience a need to pay a fee, for instance through financial stress. If that does
not happen, he can just face an “avoidable opportunity” to pay a fee. If that opportunity
happens, he pays of a fee if and only if he was not paying attention to fees. Symbolically:


         {ft+1 = 1} = {{Avoidable opportunity} and {Don’t pay attention}} or {Need}


Call p00 the probability of a need, p0 the probability of an avoidable opportunity, and Pt+1 =

Pt (ft+1 = 1), the probability of paying a fee at t + 1, given the history up to time t. We
have:
                                    Pt+1 = p0 (1 − A (Ft )) + p00

and using the functional form (4), we get:


(5)                                    Pt+1 = ae−βFt /a + b.


with a = p0 D, β = aκ, b = p0 C + p00 . It is useful to define φ = κψ, so the probability of
paying a fee at t + 1 is:
                                      Ã                             !

                                                t

      Controlling for person fixed eﬀects, the more fees you have paid in the past, the more
likely you are to avoid paying fees in the future: the first-order eﬀect of a change in Ft on
Pt+1 is −β (when the Taylor expansion is taken around Ft = 0).           Parameter β captures
the strength of short-term learning. When β is large, past feedback reduces the expected
current rate of fee payment. Past fee payments drive down future fee payments through
a learning mechanism, like reinforcement (see for example Camerer 2003 and Sutton and
Barto 1998).
      Under the above formulation, if the initial stock of knowledge F0 = 0, the initial propen-
sity to pay fees is a + b, while the long-run probability of a consumer who can pay perfect
attention is b.



4       Results

4.1      Estimating the learning model
      We estimate the model described in the previous section by the method of simulated
moments (MSM). Define the vector of empirical moments–the Lk and tenure distribution
discussed above–as m̄. Given a parameter set θ, there is a theoretical moment set that we
denote m(θ). Since we cannot directly calculate m(θ), we approximate it with a simulator,
denoted ms (θ, Js ), where Js is the number of observations used in the simulation for ms .


                                                 11
Pakes and Pollard (1989) show that


                         θ̂ = arg min [(ms (θ, Js ) − m̄)W (ms (θ, Js ) − m̄)0 ] ,
                                   θ


and this is a consistent estimator for θ0 , where W is an arbitrary positive definite weighting
matrix. Intuitively, θ̂ is simply the parameter vector that minimizes the distance between
the empirical moments m̄ and the outputs of the structural model ms (θ, Js ). In order to
calculate the variance of θ̂, we need to define a few more terms. Let Mθ ≡ ∂ms (θ, Js )/∂θ be
the numerically calculated derivative of the simulated moments with respect to the parameter
vector θ. We calculate the variance of m̄ as


(7)                                     ΩM ≡ V ar(ms (θ, Jm )),


where Jm is the number of observations from which m̄ is calculated. Equation (7) defines
the variance of m̄ under the assumption that the model is correct. With these definitions in
hand, following Pakes and Pollard (1989) and Laibson, Repetto and Tobacman (2007), we
can calculate the variance of θ̂ as

                                        −1           £¡          ¢     ¤                −1
                 V ar(θ̂) = (Mθ0 W Mθ )      Mθ0 W     1+   Jm

                                                                     ΩG W Mθ (Mθ0 W Mθ ) .


       We describe the simulation and optimization procedure in Appendix B.17


4.2       Estimation Results
       Table 2 presents the MSM estimates for equation 6 for all three kinds of fees. The first
row shows that rates of depreciation 1−δ are quite substantial for all three fee types, ranging
from nearly 20 percent for the late fee to 8 percent for the cash advance fee.               Thus, the
impact of paying a late fee a year ago has only about .811 ≈ .085 as much impact on the
probability of paying a fee this month as having paid the same fee a month ago.
       The second row provides estimates of β, which measures the rate of short-term learning.
Higher values of β imply that the stock of feedback has a larger impact on the probability

  17
    Using the method of simulated moments also allows us to avoid the downward bias in dynamic panel
data models with fixed eﬀects. We have also tried estimating such models, and found, within the limits of
the bias, qualitatively similar results.


                                                      12
of paying a fee. Paying a fee this month reduces the probability of paying a fee next month
by approximately a fraction β.18
      The third row provides estimates of φ, which parameterizes the eﬀect of the passage of
time on fee payment.          The eﬀect on fee payment is small but present. For example, for
the late fee, an additional month’s time reduces fee probability by about 4%. The estimates
also imply that in the first period, paying a fee once reduces the probability of learning by
β/ (aφ) = 21 months.
      The fourth through seventh rows give estimates for parameters a, b and F0 , which govern
the long- and short-run properties of fee probability and provide an estimate of the initial
stock of feedback.         To allow for some of the heterogeneity in fee payment that may be
responsible for Lk asymptoting to values above 1 for large values of k, we let b take two
values, bL and bH , for the population. The initial stock of feedback F0 is about equal to one
fee payment, on average, for all borrowers. For t = 0, the initial probability of paying a fee
        ¡          ¢
is a exp − βa δt F0 + b. The model estimates this to be about 34 to 37 percent for the late
fee, about 10 to 12 percent for the over limit fee, and about 66 percent for the cash advance
fee. The long-run propensity to pay a fee b is generally low for all types and all fees, ranging
from 0 to 3 percent for the late fee, 0 to 2 percent for the over limit fee, and about 2 percent
for the cash advance fee
      The six panels of Figure 4 plot the actual moments against the estimated moments, thus
giving some indication of goodness of fit. The model fits the tenure moments fairly closely
for the late fee, although it predicts a somewhat more rapid initial decline in fee payments
than seen in the data. The fit of the Lk is again good, although the model again predicts a
more rapid decline in the impact of past fee payments and has a smaller asymptotic value.
For the over limit fee, the estimated and actual moments nearly match for almost every value
of k for the Lk graph. The tenure moments match somewhat more closely than in the late
fees case, although the model still shows a more rapid reduction in fee payment than is seen
in the data. The cash advance model fits less well. Although the tenure moments match
to nearly the same degree as with the late fees, the Lk moments fail to match, with the
model showing a relatively flat profile of moments. This last result may indicate that the
determinants of cash advance fee payment are somewhat diﬀerent from the other fees. This
may not be surprising. Paying cash advance fees is less clearly a mistake than paying other

 18
      As equation 6 shows, this is true when b is small, which is empirically the case.

kinds of fees, and may also be motivated by diﬀerent kinds of liquidity needs than other
kinds of fees (e.g. needing cash while traveling).



5        Discussion of alternative explanations not based on
         learning
       We next discuss to what extent the patterns that we have observed are driven by other
factors.


       Potential correlation between financial distress and credit card tenure. The
tendency to observe declining fees may reflect a tendency for new account holders to expe-
rience more financial/personal distress than account holders with high tenure. To test this
hypothesis, we determined if FICO scores and Behavior scores (two inverse19 measures of
financial distress) correlate with account tenure.
       Figure 5 plots FICO scores and behavior scores by account tenure, demeaned and nor-
malized. To calculate the FICO variable, a single FICO mean is calculated for all accounts
over all periods in our sample. This mean is used for the demeaning. A single FICO stan-
dard deviation is calculated for all accounts over all periods in our sample. This standard
deviation is used for the normalization. An analogous method is used for the behavior score.
       No time trend is apparent in the normalized data.           To more formally test that the
hypothesis, we predict FICO with an account-tenure spline using annual knots (controlling
for account and time fixed eﬀects). The estimated tenure spline exhibits slopes that bounce
around in sign and are all very small in magnitude. For example, at a horizon of 5 years, the
spline predicts a total (accumulated) change in the FICO score of 18 units since the account
was opened. At a horizon of 10 years the spline predicts a total (accumulated) change in
the FICO score of -0.04 units since the account was opened. Recall that the mean FICO
score is 732 and the standard deviation of the FICO score is 81. Hence, financial distress
does not show significant economic variation with account tenure.

  19
   A high FICO or behavior score implies that the individual is a reliable creditor. Behavior scores are
measures of credit risk internal to the financial institution designed to measure credit risk.




                                                  14
      Potential correlation between purchasing patterns and credit card tenure.
The tendency to observe declining fees may reflect a tendency for new account holders to
spend more than account holders with high tenure. To test this hypothesis, we determined if
purchases correlate with account tenure. Figure 5, which plots the demeaned and normalized
level of purchases, again shows no economically significant time trend.


      Non-utilization of the card. The fee dynamics that we observe could be driven by
consumers who temporarily or permanently stop using the card after paying a fee on that
card. We look for these eﬀects by estimating a regression model in which the outcome of “no
purchase in the current month” is predicted by dummies for past fee payments and control
variables, including account and time fixed eﬀects as well FICO, Behavior, and Utilization.
We find very small eﬀects of past fee payments on subsequent card use.                For example,
(controlling for account fixed eﬀects) somebody who paid a fee every month for the past six
months is predicted to be only 2% less likely to use their card in the next month relative
to somebody with no fee payments in the last six months. Such very small eﬀects cannot
explain our learning dynamics, which are over an order of magnitude larger. Figure 5 also
plots the absolute level of utilization (demeaned and normalized), exhibiting no time-series
pattern).


      Time-varying financial service needs. Time-varying financial service needs may
also play an important role in driving service charge dynamics. To illustrate this idea, let
ν t represent a time-varying cost of time, so that


(8)                                       Pr (ft = 1) = ν t ,


where ν t is an exogenous process, that causes fee use, but is not caused by it. To explain
our recency eﬀect, one needs ν t to be negatively autocorrelated at a monthly frequency. To
see this, consider the regression,


(9)                                    ft = θft−1 + controls.


If (8) holds, then the regression coeﬃcient is θ = cov (ν t , ν t−1 ) /var (ft−1 ).
      We run this regression, including all of our usual control variables, that is, time- and


                                                  15
account-fixed eﬀects, a tenure spline, P urchase, Active, BillExist, and Util. We also
include Behavior and F ICO.20

Results for the three types of fees are given in Table 3. We find that θ is -0.75 for the late
fee, -0.52 for the over limit fee, and -0.28 for the cash advance fee. We call this the “recency
eﬀect,” since the payment of a fee last month greatly reduces the probability that a fee will
be paid this month.21
       The empirical finding of θ < 0 implies corr (ν t , ν t−1 ) < 0. Hence, to explain the “recency
eﬀect” with time-varying financial needs, it would need to be the case that ν t is negatively
autocorrelated. The autocorrelation of ν t would need to be not only negative, but also greater
than 0.75 (in the case of the late fee) in absolute value: corr (ν t , vt−1 ) ≤ θ = −0.75.22
       We think that such a very strong negative autocorrelation of monthly needs is very
unlikely.23 First, since the regression results include time fixed eﬀects, such autocorrelations
could not occur from events that happen at regular intervals during the year – e.g., from
summer vacations. Second, the presence of highly negative autocorrelations at a monthly
level would rule out events that last more than one month. For example, a personal crisis that
raised the opportunity cost of time for two months would create a positive autocorrelation
in time needs and fee payments over the two months, not a negative one.                                          Third, the
time-varying needs would have to produce a higher than average fee payment in one month

  20
      The results do not diﬀer if we instead begin the regressions in month 2 and exclude the Behavior and
FICO scores.
   21
      There is a potential small sample bias (Nickell 1981), to which we thank Peter Fishman and Devin
Pope for drawing our attention. To see how large it is, we note that if ft is i.i.d., then in the regression
ft = θft−1 +constant, done over a T periods, the expected value of θ is −1/T . With T = 24, the bias is
−0.05. We conclude that, in our study, the small sample bias is very small compared to the large negative
θ that we find.                                                                                                           £ ¤
   22
      It is easy to see that under (8), cov (ft , ft−1 ) = cov (ν t , ν t−1 ), and var (ft ) = E [ν t ] (1 − E [ν t ]) ≥ E ν 2t −
E [ν t ]2 = var (ν t ), as ν t ∈ [0, 1]. So, θ = cov (ft , ft−1 ) /var (ft−1 ) satisfies |θ| ≤ |cov (ν t , ν t−1 )| /var (ν t ) =
|corr (ν t , ν t−1 )|, and θ and corr (ν t , ν t−1 ) have the same sign.
   23
      The least implausible type of negatively autocorrelated process in economics is a “periodic spike” process,
which take a value of a every K periods, and b 6= a otherwise. It has an autocorrelation of −1/ (K − 1). We
fail to find evidence for such a pattern in credit card use other than fees. For instance, expenses across time
are positively autocorrelated.


                                                              16
followed by a lower than average fee payment in the following month. This would rule out
episodes of high opportunity cost of time for one month followed by a return to the status
quo.
      For most plausible processes, needs are likely to be positively autocorrelated. For ex-
ample, the available evidence implies that income processes are positively autocorrelated.24
While we cannot rule out the “negatively autocorrelated needs” story, existing microeco-
nomic evidence suggests it is highly unlikely to be the right explanation for the empirical
patterns that we observe. We conclude that the finding of θ < 0 in (9) is most plausibly
explained by a recency eﬀect — consumers become temporarily vigilant about fee avoidance
immediately after paying a fee.



6       Conclusion
      Credit card users learn about add-on fees by paying them. With years of experience,
credit card customers substantially reduce these fee payments. We document this process
using a three-year panel dataset representing 120,000 accounts.
      In our data, new accounts generate direct fee payments of $15 per month. The data
implies that negative feedback – i.e., paying fees – teaches consumers to avoid triggering
fees in the future. Controlling for account fixed eﬀects, monthly fee payments fall by 75%
during the first four years of account life.
      We also find that learning is not monotonic. In our basic specification, we estimate
that knowledge depreciates 10% per month. As previous fee-paying lessons recede into the
past, consumers tend to backslide. However, on net, knowledge accumulation dominates
knowledge depreciation. Over time, fee payments drastically fall.

Appendix A: Data Description
   The total sample consists of 125,384 accounts open as of January 2002 and 22,392 opened
between January and December of 2002 observed through December 2004. These accounts
were randomly sampled from several million accounts held by the bank. From this sample
of 147,776, we drop accounts that were stolen, lost, or frozen (due to fraud). We also exclude
accounts that do not have any activity (purchases and payments) over the entire period. This
leaves 128,142 accounts. Finally, we also remove account observations subsequent to default
or bankruptcy, as borrowers do not have the opportunity to pay fees in such instances. This
leaves us with an unbalanced panel with 3.9 million account observations.
   Table A1 provides summary statistics for variables related to the accounts, including
account characteristics, card usage, fee payment, and account holder characteristics. The
second column notes whether the variable is observed monthly (‘M’), quarterly (‘Q’), or at
account origination (‘O’), the third column reports variable means, and the fourth column
variable standard deviations. Note that the monthly averages for the ‘Fee Payment’ variables
imply annual average total fees paid of $141 (=$11.75×12), with about 7.52 fee payments
per year. Higher interest payments induced by paying fees (which raise the interest rate on
purchases and cash advances) average about $226 per year.
   The accounts also diﬀer by how long they have been open.           Over 31 percent of the
accounts are less than 12 months old, 20 percent are between 12 and 24 months old, 18
percent are between 24 and 36 months old, 13 percent are between 36 and 48 months old,
10 percent are between 48 and 60 months old, and 8 percent are more than 60 months old.

       Notes:   The “Credit Bureau Risk Score” is provided by Fair, Isaac and Company (hence
‘FICO’). The greater the score, the less risky the consumer is. The “Payment Behavior Score” is
a proprietary score based on the consumer’s past payment history and debt burden, among other
variables. It is created by the bank to capture determinants of consumer payment behavior not
accounted for by the FICO score. “Q” indicates the variable is observed quarterly, “M” monthly,
and “O” only at account origination.



Appendix B: Simulation and Optimization Procedure
       The simulation procedure was created to match the data sample as closely as possible.
The data consist of approximately 120,000 accounts observed over 35 periods. Accounts have
tenure ranging from 1-72 months. In order to calculate the tenure moments, we simulate a
group of 120,000× 36
                  72
                     agents over 59 periods.25
       The Lk are estimated with a simulation of a separate sample of agents. Because the
estimated Lk vary depending on the distribution of tenure in the sample, we need to take
into account entry and exit from the sample population.26 In each period, N/36 agents
enter the simulation with tenure of 0 months, where N = JS × 36 is the total number of
observations.
       Given a set of agents each with their own stock of knowledge, the simulation proceeds as
follows. First, we calculate the probability of each agent paying a fee. Random numbers are
then drawn for each agent from a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1]. If an agent’s
draw is less than her probability of a fee payment, then she is recorded as paying a fee in this
period. Next, a random 1 percent of the agents are removed from the sample, corresponding
to the rate of attrition observed in the data. Any agent with tenure of 72 months is also
removed from the sample. In the final step, we update each agent’s knowledge stock according
to whether or not she paid a fee, and we add a new set of N/36 agents with zero tenure.
The Lk simulation is run for 108 periods. The first 72 generate a full distribution of agents

  25
     120,000*35 is the total number, N, of person*month observations. N* 59  72 is approximately the number
of these observations that are used in the regression sample to calculate the tenure moments from the data.
The group of people that is simulated over the 59 periods therefore numbers N/72.
  26
     Since the change in an agent’s probability of paying a fee next period given this period is dependent on
her knowledge stock, and the magnitude of her knowledge stock is correlated with her tenure, her response
to a fee event will be correlated with her tenure.



                                                     26
with tenure between 1 and 72 months. Periods 73-108 are the sample from which the Lk are
calculated. This calculation proceeds identically to that used on the empirical data set.
       The optimization procedure uses a combination of a grid search and a hill-climbing al-
gorithm. The first stage employs a coarse grid that searches over a broad set of possible
parameter values using a relatively low value of Js , for example, 40,000. The grid search is
split into a number of separate samples. Consider a grid consisting of A × B points. The
grid search calculates the value of the objective function at each point. In practice, this
is performed with multiple programs; for example, there could be A programs that each
calculate one 1 × B column of grid points. The best point from each group is then saved. If
any of the top 5 points is on or near the edge of the grid, we expand the grid around that
point to ensure we find the global maximum. In practice, more than 40 search programs
were used, generating 40+ candidate points from which to run the hill-climber.
       The second stage of the optimization employs MATLAB’s fminsearch command, which
carries out the Nelder-Mead simplex method–the hill-climber. The optimization is run
until it converges to a point such that the estimated parameters do not change for at least
20 iterations. This generally requires at least 120 total iterations. Js was set to 180,000 to
insure that the point to which the algorithm converged was not an abnormally low value due
to measurement error.27
       In order to calculate ΩM , we run the simulation 1000 times using JM agents at the optimal
θ̂ and then calculate the variance-covariance matrix of the 1000 sets of simulated moments.
To calculate Mθ we perturb each parameter individually by ±1 percent. We then calculate
numerical derivatives for the moments with respect to the parameter vector, creating, in the
end, two 94 × 7 matrices of derivatives; one from the positive perturbations, one from the
negative perturbations. We choose the smaller of the two estimates of the derivative for each
component of the moment vector to ensure that we have an upper bound for V ar(θ̂).

  27
    Intuitively, near the optimum, the objective function gets flat. As the slope of the objective function
decreases, diﬀerences in its measured value are more likely to be due to simulation error than true variation.

δ estimated below in Table 3. F ICO denotes the credit bureau risk score provided by Fair, Isaac
and Company, lagged one quarter.       The greater the score, the less risky the consumer is.      The
Behavior score is a propriety number created by the bank to capture determinants of consumer
payment behavior not accounted for by the FICO score. Utilization is the ratio of current debt on
the account to the current credit limit. Purchases is the dollar amount of purchases on the account,
while the dummy variable for account activity is one if there were any purchases on the account.
The bill existence dummy is one if the consumer received a bill at tenure t − 1.

Notes: This figure plots the fitted values of regressions of fee frequency (times per month fees are paid) on a continuous piecewise linear function of account tenure (the function is a spline, with knots
every twelve months, on the time since the account was opened), a constant, account- and time-fixed effects, and control variables (utilization (debit/limit), purchase amount, and dummy variables for
any account activity this month and the existence of a bill last month). The intercept is computed by summing the constant with the product of the estimated coefficients on the control variables and
their average values (the account and time-fixed effects sum to zero by construction). Tenure starts at the second month because account holders are, by definition, unable to pay late or over limit fees
in their first month of account tenure.

Notes: This figure plots Lk=E(ft|ft-k=1)/E(ft), the ratio of the conditional mean of fees ft paid now given a fee was paid k months ago to the mean of fees paid now. If this value is 1, having paid a fee k
months ago has no effect on current fee payment; if it is less than one, having paid a fee k months ago reduces current fee payment; if it is greater than one, it increases fee payment.
