              Balance of Payments and the Foreign Exchange Market:
                      A Dynamic Partial Equilibrium Model



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper develops a dynamic partial equilibrium model of the

foreign exchange market extending the standard textbook model in two

respects. First, capital account transactions are explicitly incorporated

into the model, and secondly, 'rational' speculative behaviour is also

introduced. At a point in time, or in a given day, exchange rate

fluctuations are dominated by 'new information' that leads to revision

of speculative expectations, as well as by other disturbances on the

capital account. In the long run, fundamental factors, such as divergences

of inflation rates and real changes influencing the trade balance, become

relevant in determining the 'trend' of the exchange rate.

     A variety of exercises, and numerical simulations, illustrate the

usefulness of the dynamic supply—demand model in understanding the

behaviour of floating exchange rates in a world of high capital mobility.

Introduction

     All economic transactions between countries or regions that belong

to a different currency area must go through the foreign exchange market.

Domestic residents wishing to purchase goods and services or assets abroad

must first acquire foreign currency in the amount of their planned pur-

chases. Similarly, foreign residents wishing to purchase goods and ser-

vices or assets in the domestic economy must first acquire domestic currencyr

in the amount of their planned purchases. Going through the foreign

exchange market would not be necessary if domestic money was acceptable

as a means of payment abroad and foreign money as a means of payment at

home, Since this is not the case, planned domestic payments abroad trans-

late to a demand for, and planned foreign payments at home to a supply of,

foreign currency in the foreign exchange market. In the absence of

intervention, the exchange rate is determined so as to equilibrate the

demand for foreign exchange with the supply of foreign exchange, or --

what comes to the same -- so as to equilibrate the balance of (planned)

payments.

       This description of the nature of the foreign exchange market is

still valid——yet, the modern theory of flexible exchange rates appears

to have no connection with these market processes. There is no explicit

treatment of the sources of supply and demand. in the foreign exchange

market and no explicit analysis of how supply and demand interact in that

market to determine the exchange rate. In part this is because such de-

tails are hidden in the background of general equilibrium models; but in

part it is because analysis has been reduced to terms that bear no connec-

tion to supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. An example of

the latter is the monetarist theory of exchange rate determination accord-

ing to which 'the exchange rate is a relative price of two monies and as

such is determined by the relative supplies of these monies on the one

hand and the relative demands for these monies on the other' (cf. Frankel

(1976), Mussa (1976) and Bilson (1978)). This cannot be a statement about

supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, because, as is described

above, they derive from demands for and supplies of all kinds of assets

and goods and services. In fact holdings of fo ei money are so small

that the direct effect of changes in money demand or supply on the exchange

rate must be insignificant. Rather, such shifts affect the exchange rate

through their effect,ex ante, on capital movements and other components

of the balance of payments.

       In   many of the recent models, including Dornbusch (1976), it is
assumed thaL all other assets hut monies are perfect substitutes. In such
models halance of payments pressures have no effect on the exchange rate,
which can deviate from its purchasing power parity, or long run equilib—
                                                                             3




rium, value only to the extent that monetary conditions permit differences

in interest rates, as is shown in    Kouri and de Macedo (1978). These models
cannot, however, explain observed movements in exchange rates in recent

years because these movements have been far in excess of differences in

inflation rates even if allowance is made for anticipated differences in

future inflation rates as reflected in interest rate differentials. The

models of perfect substitutability simply assume away market pressures

that could account for the observed behavior. As one example, they cannot

explain the tendency of the currencies of surplus countries to appreciate

and those of deficit countries to depreciate continuously in real terms.

This stylized fact of recent years cannot be explained either by the

'textbook' partial equilibrium model, based on Bickerdike (1920), Robinson

(1937) and Machlup (1939, 1940). In that model the capital flow account

is independent of the exchange rate-—in fact, it is treated as a transfer

payment. This implies that ex ante shifts in the current account or in

the capital flow account give rise to orce—andforall adjustments in the

exchange rate. Furthermore, shifts in the trade balance ex ante have no

effect on the current account ox past because the ex post current account

is determined independently of the exchange rate.

         The purpose of this paper is to develop a dynamic supply—demand

model of the foreign exchange market, consistent with the description of

the   market in the opening paragraphs and also consistent with the modern

general equIlibrium approach——given the assumption that prices or quantities

in   other   markets are exogenous. The burden of balance of payments adjust-

ment is thus assumed to fall on the exchange rate alone.
                                                                          4



      It   is assumed that the foreign exchange market clears continuously,

as indeed it almost does. Therefore, at a point in time only stock de-

mands for and supplies of foreign exchange derived from stock transactions

on the capital account matter in determining the short run equilibrium

value of the exchange rate. This is similar to the liquidity preference

theory of interest rate determination, or the theory of the determination

of the demand price of capital assets in terms of stocks rather than flows.

It is also consistent with the general equilibrium 'asset market approach'

to international monetary economics that determines all of these prices

simultaneously by conditions of stock equilibrium.

      Given the short run equilibrium value, the exchange rate must change

   unit of time in such a way as to equilibrate flow demands for and sup-

plies of foreign exchange derived from capital flows on the one hand and

current account transactions on the other. Capital flows are functions

of the rate of change of the exchange rate because the stock demand for

foreign assets is a function of the level of the exchange rate. Therefore

in order for the foreign exchange market to stay in equilibrium, domestic

currency must depreciate whenever the current account is in deficit (in

excess of 'normal deficit') and appreciate whenever the current account

is in surplus (in excess of 'normal surplus'). This acceleration hypothesis

accords well with the behavior of the major currencies in recent years.

       In long run equilibrium the real exchange rate is constant and is

determined by the condition that the   current   accountis at its normal level,

which is taken to be zero in the analysis of this paper.

 mination   of the exchange and Section II develops the complete dynamic model

 along the lines indicated above. Section III brings in rational specula-

 tive behavior, and thus brings the analysis one step closer to the reality

 of the foreign exchange market which is undoubtedly one of the most sensi-

 tive and best organized speculative markets in existence.




 I.   CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND THE EXCHANGE RATE: SHORT RUN EQUILIBRIUM IN THE

      FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

        The foreign exchange market is but one of many interconnected f 1—

nancial markets. Its special nature is that intermediation and arbitrage

between financial markets in different currency areas must go through it:

to invest abroad in excess of their current holdings of foreign assets

domestic residents must first acquire foreign currency in the amount of

their planned investment; to add to their asset holdings in the domestic

economy foreign residents must similarly first acquire domestic currency

in the foreign exchange market. Demand for and supply of foreign currency,

or what comes to the same, demand for and supply of domestic currency at

a point in time can thus be derived from domestic demand for foreign assets

in excess of already existing holdings on the one hand, and foreign demand

for domestic assets in excess of existing holdings on the other. This

description must be qualified when domestic residents lend to foreign

residents in domestic currency or when foreign residents lend to domestic

residents   In foreign currency: this case Is analyzed separately in
Appendix III.
                                                                            6



       Consider now how domestic demand for foreign assets and foreign de-

mand for domestic assets depend on the exchange rate. For this purpose

assume that prices and rates of return of all assets in the domestic economy

are exogenously given in domestic currency, and that prices and rates of

return of foreign assets are exogenously given in foreign currency. Thus

all domestic assets can be aggregated into a single 'domestic asset' whose

price for a foreign investor is the foreign currency price of domestic

currency; and similarly all foreign assets can be aggregated into a single

foreign asset whose price for a domestic investor is the domestic currency

price of foreign currency, ceteris paribus.

       Portfolio theory suggests that, given total domestic marketable

wealth, domestic residents want to hold some fraction of it in foreign

assets, this fraction depending on expected returns and risk characteris—

tics of domestic and foreign assets.1 Therefore, taking prices of foreign

assets as exogenous in foreign currency and the stock of domestic market-

able wealth as exogenous in domestic currency, it follows that domestic

demand for foreign assets is a declining function of the price of foreign

currency with elasticity of minus one.2 By the same reasoning demand for

(foils even In partial ('qul I ibrium analysis because of capital gains
and losses resul ting from exchange rate changes. This is not a real
problem, however, because we could equally take the domestic component

domestic assets by foreign resIdents is a declining function of the price

of domestic currency in ternis of foreign currency with elasticity of minus

one. This simple result linking stock transactions on the capital account

to the level of the exchange rate has not, surprisingly, been noted in

the literature. Thus in a recent paper on foreign exchange market inter-

vention John Williamson (1976) states that "in striking contrast... {to

the current account].. .there are rather few reasons for expecting the capi-

tal account to depend on the level of the exchange rate, but compelling

reasons for expecting it to depend on the expected change in the rate."1

Similarly in his well—known paper on flexible rates Dornbusch (1976) assumes

away the dependence of capital account transactions on the level of the

exchange rate with the assumption of perfect substitutability between

domestic and foreign assets, except for money. Therefore the exchange

rateis indeterminate in his model in a system of dual exchange rates,

when the capital account is isolated from the trade account.2



The Formal Model of Short Run Equilibrium

          To develop the model formally let F0     be the stock of foreign assets

held by domestic residents at time 0 valued in foreign currency, and

let          be the stock of domestic assets held by foreign residents at time

0 valued in domestic currency. F0 and C0 are both given at the initial

moment. In contrast, the desired holdings of foreign assets by domestic

residents (Fd) and of domestic assets by foreign residents (Cd) are

subject to choice. Let s be the domestic currency price of foreign ex-

change. Then (Fd — F0)           is the stock demand for foreign exchange derived

from domestic excess demand for foreign assets (in excess of initial hold-

ings) and (Gd —G0)Is            the stock supply of foreign exchange derived from

foreign excess demand for domestic assets. Momentary equilibrium in the

foreign exchange market is then defined by:



(1)             (Fd_F0) + (1d1) = (Gd_C0)/s


where          10 =   initial   stock of central bank's foreign exchange reserves

                  =   desired   stock of foreign exchange reserves

                  =   central   bank's purchase of foreign exchange at time 0


With fixed exchange rates change in reserves (1d.. 'o is the residual

that equilibrates the foreign exchange market; with clean floating

(1d —
        'o    is zero and the exchange rate adjusts to equilibrate private

demand and supply. Between these two extremes there are other types of

regimes which can be specified by appropriate characterization of inter-

vention behavior. In the present paper we restrict the analysis to float-

ing with no systematic intervention.

         Next we need to specify the asset demand functions. Let V be

the value of domestic marketable wealth in domestic currency and V*

the   value   of foreign marketable wealth in foreign currency. Then, with

reference to earlier discussion:



(2)            Fd.s     f(R, R*±, z)V; Cd/s g(R—, R*, z)V*
                                                                                         9




where         R =   nominal rate of return on domestic assets in domestic currency
            R* =    nominal rate of return on foreign assets in foreign currency

                    expected rate of change in the domestic currency price of

                    foreign currency

              z =   vector   of other determinants of international investment.


Substituting these demand functions in equation (1) above and setting
   —
       10     equal to zero, we get the condition of short run equilibrium in

the foreign exchange market with no intervention:

                                          F0                       G0/s

The    left   hand side gives the stock demand for foreign exchange at time 0

derived from desired domestic purchases of foreign assets at time 0

It is illustrated by the downward sloping DD schedule in Figure 1. The

right hand side gives the stock supply of foreign exchange derived from

desired foreign purchases of domestic assets at time 0               .    It   is illustrated

by the upward sloping SS schedule in Figure I.                 Short run equilibrium

in the foreign exchange market, which clearly is unique, obtains at the

intersection of these demand and supply schedules at               A0 .   As the schedules

are drawn no transactions take place at the equilibrium exchange rate
                                                                                       s0

This   does    not mean, however, that the exchange rate is indeterminate, for

excess suppi) of foreign exchange and a small decrease, an excess demand

for foreign exchange. Thus, although no transactions take place, potential

transactions keep th           exchange rate at s0 .     It   is clear then that short

run equilibrium is not only unique but also stable. It will be assumed

from now on that the foreign exchange market is always in short run equi—

lib r ium.


         Suppose now that domestic residents want to increase their holdings

of foreign assets for some reason; for example, because of an increase

in foreign interest rates. In Figure I the demand schedule shifts to the

right, to D'D' ,     by 0B2 at the initial exchange rate s0 .       If   the

central bank pegged the exchange rate at      s0 ,   it would, of course, lose
reserves in that amount. With no intervention, domestic currency instead

depreciates to s1 .     This   enables domestic residents to increase their

foreign asset holdings by 0B1 ——which is equal in value to the additional

purchases of the now cheaper domestic assets by foreign residents (measured

in foreign currency). Once the new equilibrium position has been reached,

and by assumption it is reached instantaneously, the exchange rate stays

at s1 and again no transactions take place in the market (ignoring for

now 'marginal' supplies and demands coming from flow transactions). Tech-

nically, the origin shifts to B1 in Figure I: the initial stock of

foreign assets is now
                       C1R1 (F1) rather than C10 (F0)
       It Is not necessary [or transact ions to actually take place in order
for the exchange rate to change, as is the case above. For example, suppose
that foreign residents do not hold domestic assets, a case typically assumed
in recent literature. Then an attempt by domestic residents as a group
to increase their holdings of foreign assets would only succeed, in the

short run, in raising the   price   of foreign assets, or the exchange rate, to
a   level at which the existing stock ou1d he willingly held and thus to
a I ev*'J at whiich no transact ions would actually take place in the market.

          To develop the above analysis formally, let f and g be the mi—

tial portfolio proportions, and                F0 and           the initial asset holdings.

From equatIon (3), equilibrium exchange rate,                   s0 inFigurel, is given by:


                        fV+G0
(     )        s        gv*+F0


Let f1 and g1 be the new portfolio properties at time 0 (unlike in

the figure, the supply schedule is allowed to shift at well). The new

equilibrium value of the exchange rate,                 s1 in Figure I, is then:


                        f1V
                              +
                    -
                         1        0


At this new exchange rate, asset holdings are:


(6)            F1 =     f1V/s1    ,
                                          G   g1V*s1


F1 and C. become the new Initial condItIons. If nothIng changes after

the shift from •(f,g) to (f1, g1) at the initial moment, the exchange

rate will stay at s1 with no transactions taking place thereafter. To

check this apply formula (4) again to the new situation:


                              + G1        f1V + g1V*s1
(7)                                   =                =
               Sj                                          S1
                        g1v*+11           g1V*+f1V/s1

which confirms that the exchange rate will indeed stay at

foreign holdings of domestic assets. The exchange rate will not return

to s0 ixmnediately as the central bank leaves the market: instead it

stays at s1 because the initial conditions change thus shifting the

demand and supply schedules so that they intersect at s1 .                From equation

This formulals useful because it shows the limited possibilities that
central banks have to Influence the exchange rate when official reserves

are only a small fraction of private asset holdings.



Comparison with the Bickerdike—Robinson—Machiup Model

           The supply—demand model developed above resembles the 'textbookt

model of the foreign exchange market based on the work of Bickerdike (1920),

Robinson (1937) and Machlup (1939, 1940) in that the supply and demand

schedu]es In the foreign exchange market are derived from economic trans-

actions between           the two countries or   currency areas. The difference is

that     the   textbook model derives these schedules from flow transactions on
the      trade account, while the     present model derives them from stock trans-
actions on the capital          account. In the     textbook   model depreciation of
                                                                                15




domestic currency increases net supply of foreign exchange p unit of time

by inducing a reduction in domestic purchases of foreign goods and services,

and an increase in foreign purchases of domestic goods and services, pro-

vided that the 'elasticities condition' holds; while capital movements

are treated as 'transfer payments' that do not depend on the level of the

exchange rate.    In contrast, in the present model depreciation of domes-

tic currency brings forward an excess supply of foreign currency at a ppint

in time by inducing a reduction in domestic holdings of foreign assets

and an increase in foreign holdings of domestic assets. Furthermore, net

supply of foreign exchange is everywhere an increasing function of the

price of foreign currency; thus equilibrium is both unique and globally

stable. The elasticities condition is met because the elasticities of

domestic demand for foreign assets, and of foreign demand for domestic

assets with respect to the exchange rate are both equal to one in absolute

value (see, however, the discussion in Appendix I).

         If there was a dual exchange rate system with capital account trans-

actions going through one market, market A, and current account transactions,

including interest payments going through another market——market B——the

model developed above would be a complete partial equilibrium model of

market A, while the Bickerdike—Robinson—Machlup model would be a complete

partial equilibrium model of market B. Market B would be linked to mar—

ket A because the   net inflow   or outflow of interest income would have to

be   effected through exchange rate   adjustments in   market B. In a unified
floating rate system   there J.   as it   were,   also a feedback from market

R to market. A because the Initial conditions on which equilibrium in mar-

ket A depends change whenever the current account is different from zero.

 We now turn to study this dynamic process.




 IL. INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT AND THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT:

      THE DYNAMICS OF THE EXCHANGE RATE

          To study the dynamics of the foreign exchange market we make two

 simplifying assumptions initially: first, that there is no inflation or

 real growth in either country; and second, that all interest earnings on

 foreign assets are spent on imports. The first assumption implies that

 current account must be zero in long run equilibrium while the second as—

 sumption implies that the long run equilibrium value of the exchange rate,

associated with zero current account, does not depend on the level or di—

rection of international investment. The reason for these assumptions is

to abstract from the complex problems of intertemporal transfer whose sa-

tisfactory treatment requires general equilibrium analysis.



A Special Case

       We begin the analysis with the special case, typically assumed in

recent literature, when foreign residents do not hold domestic assets.

Short run equilibrium condition (3) becomes then:


(9)           F.s =   f(R,   R*+IT, z)V


where r Is still set equal to zero. This equilibrium condition is illus-

trated by the FF schedule in Figure 111(h).           With initial stock of foreign
assets equal to F0 ,         initial   equilibrium obtains at A0 with exchange

rate s0

          The stock of foreign assets changes whenever the current account

  is different from zero, or


                 =
  (10)               B(s;y)

 where B is current account surplus in
                                                foreign currency and y is a vec-
 tor of determinants of the current
                                           account, including domestic and foreign

 prices and activity levels. Equations (9) and (10) together with the ini-

 tial condition F =
                        F0    define the complete dynamic   partial   equilibrium
 model of the foreign exchange market.

          Assume first that the current account is everywhere an increasing

 function of the price of foreign currency, as illustrated by the BB

 schedule in Figure 111(a). At the initial exchange rate s0 the current

 account Is in surplus by              Thus, thereafter the stock of foreign assets
                               B0 .

 Increases and domestic currency appreciates as the market converges to

long run equilibrium at A* with exchange rate s and stock of foreign

assets F* .     If   instead the stock of foreign assets was initially above

its long run level, the price of foreign currency would be below its long

run equilibrium value, and the market would converge to equilibrium at

A* along FF from the right hand side with domestic currency depreciat-

ing and the current account In deficit. It is thus
                                                           evident that, given
the monotonicity of the BB        schedule, long run equilibrium is both unique
and globally stable.

         The dynamics of the foreign exchange market, illustrated in Figure

111, is consistent with observed exchange rate behavior in recent years

with the currencies of surplus
                                      countries appreciating and those of deficit

countries depreciating in excess of differences in inflation rates. It
                                                                                19




is useful to restate this implication of the model as the acceleration

hypothesis: domestic currency appreciates whenever the current account

is in surplus and depreciates whenever it is deficit.




Multiple Equilibria and Dynamic Instability

       Consider next the possibility that long run equilibrium is not unique

because the current account is not a monotonic function of the exchange

rate. Figure IV gives an example where there are three long run equilibria,

namely A ,     A   ,   and   A .   Of these, only A and A are stable.

Which one of these the market will converge to depends on where it starts.

As is indicated in Figure IV(a) it converges to A if it is initially

on the right hand side of A ,       and to     if it is initially on the

left hand side of A ;        and stays at A if it happens to be there.

With multiple equilibria foreign exchange market is thus dynamically un-

stable in that perturbations may move it from one equilibrium to another,

unlike aboye where it always ended in the same long run equilibrium.

       Before considering the general case it is illuminating to derive

the results of the above analysis in a slightly different way. In order

for the foreign exchange market to stay in equilibrium after the initial

moment the exchange rate has to change per unit of time in such a way as

to equilibrate the net flow supply of foreign exchange from current account

transactions with the net flow demand for foreign exchange from marginal

additions to domestic holdings of foreign assets, or capital outflow for

short. Rut   capital outflow is a function of the rate   of   change   of the

exchange rate, namely:
                                                                                   20

                  =
                      —f
where expectations and other determinants of f are held constant. Along

the adjustment path the exchange rate must then satisfy a 'dynamical bal-

ance of payments equilibrium condItion':



(12)        .d =             = B(s;x)


This can be rewritten as



l3'/
'
            s

                        fV

                                    F'

which is an algebraic statement of the acceleration hypothesis: domestic

currency appreciates ihenever the current account is in surplus, and de-

preciates when It is in deficit. Furthermore, the rate of appreciation

(depreciation) is equal to the ratio of the current account surplus (de—

ficit) to the stock of foreign assets.1



The General Case

       To build on the previous section it is useful to rearrange short

run equilibrium condition (3) in the form:



(14)       f(R, R*+ii, z)V/s —          g(R—,   R*; z)V*   NFAd = NFA5 E
                                                                           F0
                                                                                —
                                                                                    G0/s


     dimensions of s/s and B/F are the same because both                   and B
are flow variables while s and F are stock variables.
                                                                              22




The right hand side can be interpreted as net supply of foreign assets

and the left hand side as net demand f or foreign assets.1 These two

schedules are illustrated by the FF and SS schedules in Figure V.

The FF schedule corresponds to the FF schedule in Figures III and IV

above; they are the same when foreign residents do not hold domestic assets.

Unlike in the special case, however, net stock of foreign assets is not

predetermined at a point in time——its value in foreign currency increases

as domestic currency depreciates. For any exchange rate excess demand

for foreign exchange at a point in time can be read as the horizontal dis-

tance between the FF and DD schedules (cf. Figure I). Excess demand

is zero at AQ ,   which is the same short run equilibrium position as

A0 in Figure I.

       Given its initial value s0 ,   the exchange rate must change in

such a way as to equilibrate the current account with 'marginal' net out-

flow of capital. Net outflow of capital is a function of the rate of chan8e

of the exchange rate, namely:



(15)
              CF=-—V= [gv*+4)= [F+-.
where /s gV*(/s) = inflow       of capital and    =   —f-(/s)   =   outflow
of capital.


11t is not necessary that the net stock of foreign assets is positive.
The analysis applies equally if domestic residents are net debtors abroad.
Problems arise only if domestic residents are net debtors in foreign cur-
rency, that is either fV/s , or F0 or both are negative (see Appendix I).

initial moment, Fd = F   and Gd C

For the foreign exchange market to stay in flow equilibrium, it is then

necessary that the exchange rate satisfies the dynamical balance of pay-

ments equilibrium condition:



(16)              CF =           + f-} = B(s;x)
                          {gv*

where B is the current account surplus in foreign currency as before.

This can be written as:



(17)
                 - = _B(s;x)/[f
                                +       gv*J



which is simply the 'acceleration equation.' Thus the rate of apprecia—

tion (depreciation) of domestic currency is equal to the ratio of the

current account to the level of international investment as measured by

the sum of domestic holdings of foreign assets on the one hand and foreign

holdings of domestic assets on the other.

           Change in the net stock of foreign assets, valued on foreign cur-

rency, is governed by the dynamical equation:



                                       fYi
                                 S      S
(ld)              NFA =     fV           —B(s;x)
                            SS
                                     fY+gV*

which     Is   similar to   eq(Iatlon(Ii) above.        In particular, net stock of foreign

issets Is constant whenever the              current   account is in zero, increases when

it   is   in   surplus   and decreases when it is in deficit.

           The complete dynamic partial equilibrium model of the foreign e—

change market consists of equations (14) and (18). It is illustrated in
                                                                       25




Figure V where the horizontal BB line is the schedule of long run

equilibrium in the balance of payments (zero current account). It is

assumed to be unique.' Short run equilibrium obtains at the intersec-

tion of the FF and SS schedules at A0        long run equilibrium

obtains at the intersection of the FF and BB schedules at A* ; and

adjustment from short run to long run equilibrium takes place along

the FF schedule as indicated by the arrows, Given that long run

equilibrium is unique it is clearly also globally stable: whenever

the market starts it always ends there.


Comparative Dynamics

    We now apply the model to study the dynamic response of the foreign

exchange market to (i) a decline in foreign demand for domestic assets;

(ii) a once-and-for-all purchase of foreign exchange by the central

bank; and (iii) an increase in domestic demand for imported foreign goods

and services. Except for the analysis in Figure VII it is assumed that

        Figure   VI illustrates the dynamic        response   of the foreign exchange

market to a decline in foreign demand for domestic assets from an initial

 situation of long run equilibrium at         A0 .   The    FF schedule shifts to

 the right to F'F' :      at the initial exchange rate there is excess supply

of domestic currency and thus excess demand for foreign currency in the

amount A0A* .     Short run equilibrium is restored as domestic currency
depreciates to s .        Foreign residents are able to reduce their holdings
of domestic assets immediately to the extent that domestic residents re-

duce their holdings of the now more expensive foreign assets. They are

able to do so over time by importing more from and exporting less to the

domestic economy; in effect by gradually exchanging their assets for goods

and services. As is shown in Figure VI the exchange rate eventually re-

turns back to its 'normal' level s

        The cumulative current account surplus in the course of the adjust-

ment process Is approximately equal to A0A* :              the initial excess demand

for foreign exchange In the amount A0A* translates over time into an

equal cumulative current account surplus)

1From equation (7) in Appendix I the cumulative current account surplus, S, is:

(i)                  v*              S0_S*
            S [f* + g*v*
where f* and g* are the desired portfolio proportions corresponding
to the F'F' schedule. From equation (5) in Appendix I
                                                       s0 is given by:
                   f*v   + 10       f*V* + gV*s*
                                =
                   V*+F0            g*V*+f(V/s*)
where f and g correspond            to the FF schedule. Substituting this in
equation (1) above we get:

(iii)       S =   f*v.fv — (g*V*_gV)
                  _______                      NFM NPA =         A0A*
When foreign residents do not hold domestic assets (g*V* = gV = 0)              this
approximation Is exact: the cumulative surplus equals
                                                                   F*_F0

        One can interpret the capital account disturbance as a once—and--

for—all financial transfer payment that is effected over a period of time

through surpluses In the current account brought about by transitory de—

predation of the domestic currency. The time it takes the foreign exchange

market to effect such capital transfers depends on the level of trade in

relation to the level of asset holdings on the one hand, and the exchange

rate elasticity of the current account on the other (see Appendix I and

in particular Table I).

        When long run equilibrium is unique, as above, the exchange rate

effect of a capital account disturbance is only transitory. With multiple

equilibria, however, the effect may be permanent because the market may

move from one equilibrium to another in response to a disturbance. Figure

VII illustrates such a possibility. There are three possible long run

equilibrium values of the exchange rate, namely s ,      s   ,   and
                                                                        s
of which only s and s         are stable. The market is initially at A1

with exchange rate s and net stock of foreign assets NFA1 .            Reduction
in foreign demand for domestic assets shifts the FF schedule to the right

to F'F' .     To restore equilibrium domestic currency depreciates to s0

which is above the exchange rate associated with the unstable equilibrium,

namely s .      Therefore the exchange rate will not come back to s but
instead increases to s -      Thus there is a permanent decline in the value

of domestic currency and a period of deficits in the current account which

may in fact cause the net stock of foreign assets to decline in the long

run. Thus with multiple equilibria, it is difficult to infer whether ob-

served currency depreciation is caused, cx ante, by 'capital outflow' or

an   adversc. shift in the trade balance, because, as the example shows, cx

ante 'capital outflow' may turn into ex post 'capital inflow.'

         Consider next the response of the market to a once—and—for—all pur-

chase of foreign exchange by the central bank. This is shown in Figure

VIII as a leftward shift of the SS schedule by A1A* at the initial

exchange rate s ,      assumed to be the long run equilibrium exchange rate.

The ex ante excess demand of A1A* is eliminated by depreciation of the

domestic currency to s0 .    At this exchange rate, A2A* of the increase
in the central bank's foreign exchange reserves comes from domestic resi-

dents who reduce their holdings of foreign assets by this amount, and the

rest from foreign residents who supply foreign exchange in the amount

A1A2 in order to increase their holdings of domestic assets. Over time,

however, the purchase of foreign exchange translates to an exactly equal

cUmulative surplus in the current account, and after the initial deprecia-

tion domestic currency appreciates back to the same long run equilibrium

level. The initial impact of intervention on the exchange rate depends

on the size of the central bank's purchase of foreign exchange In relation

to total international investment while the duration of the impact depends

on the strength of the induced current account response, as is clear from

earlier analysis.

        To conclude this section we show in Figure IX the response of the

foreign exchange market to a permanent increase in domestic demand for

imported goods and services. 1n    the textbook   model such shift would cause

an   immediate depreciation of domestic currency with no change in the cur-
rent account balance which is determined ex post by the capital flow
account independently of the exchange rate. In contrast, in Figure IX

 Balance of Payments Equilibrium with Inflation

        We have assumed so far that there is no inflation in either country.

 Suppose now that prices in the domestic economy are increasing at a con-

stant rate     it
                          and prices in the foreign country at constant rate

The rate of change of the price of foreign currency in long run equilibrium

Is then it —        71*    .   Even in the absence o real growth the current account
           p         p
is not zero in long run           equilibrium:       In order to maintain a Constant real

stock of foreign assets domestic residents must purchase new assets at

the rate of ir*(F/p*) in real terms, where (F/p*) is the real value of

domestic holdings of foreign assets in long run equilibrium. Similarly,

foreign residents must purchase new domestic assets at the rate of

        in order to keep the real value of their holdings of domestic

assets constant, where (Gip) is the real value of foreign holdings

of domestic assets in long run equilibrium. The current account surplus

is thus equal to            1T(F/p*) -                If the balance of payments accounts
                                         Tr(G/P*).
were properly measured this notional surplus of the current account would

instead be counted as outflow of interest income:
                                                                     for clearly net inflow
of interest, income in          real terms is     (R*_ir;) (F/p) -   (R-r) (G/p*)    If
                                                                           34




we continue to assume that real interest earnings are spent on imports,

the above analysis still applies to the real exchange rate s(p*/p) and

the real, or inflation adjusted, balance of payments. A satisfactory treat-

ment of inflation as well as of real growth requires, however, an analysis

of its own. For this reason we continue to assume in the following that

there is no inflation or real growth.




III. IMPLICATIONS OF 'RATIONAL' SPECULATION IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGES

         In this section we study the implications of 'rational' specula-

tive behavior for the dynamics of the foreign exchange market. Such be-

havior is technically interpreted as perfect foresight, that is 11     s/s      ,



in   contrast to the assumption of stationary expectations maintained so

far. The analysis is limited to the special case when foreigners do not

hold domestic assets because space does not permit satisfactory treatment

of the general case. For the same reason long run equilibrium is assumed

to be unique.

         The dynamic partial equilibrium model of the foreign exchange mar—

ket is now defined by the following two differential equations:



(19)          f[R R*+,          F (cf. equation (9))



(20)            =   B(s;x)

The dynamics of this system can be studied with the aid of Figure X. The

FF schedule, defined by setting /s equal to zero in equation (18),

 gives for each stock of foreign assets the exchange rate that is consistent

 with no expected appreciation or depreciation. It is the same as the FF

 schedule in Figure III. As the arrows indicate, domestic currency must

 be expected to appreciate at any point above the FF schedule, and depre-

 ciate at any point below it for such a point to be an equilibrium point.

The dynamics of the stock of foreign assets can be determined with the

aid of the BB schedule, defined by setting        equal to zero in equation

 (20) (cf. equation(23) in Appendix I). As indicated by the arrows, the

stock of foreign assets increases above the BB schedule and decreases

below it. Inspection of the direction of movement in each of the four

regions separated by the FF and BB schedules reveals that there is

only one path along which expectations are continuously realized such that

it takes the market to long run equilibrium at A*    .   This   is the

'rational expectations' path and it is illustrated by the TT schedule

in the figure. With initial stock of foreign assets equal to F0 the

equilibrium value of the exchange rate consistent with 'iational expectation'

of subsequent appreciation is   s in comparison with s that would
obtain with stationary expectations (cf. Figure III). How the market
could reach   s and stay on TT , which is the only path that takes it

to long run equilibrium, is an open question and an answer will not be

attempted here.
                                                                       37




Comparative Dynamics

     The response of the foreign exchange market to unanticipated per-

inanent disturbances with rational expectations differs from the response

pattern with stationary expectations only in that the short run effect

of capital account disturbances on the exchange rate is weakened while

the short run effect of trade account disturbances on the exchange rate

is strengthened.

     Figure XI illustrates response to an increase in domestic demand

for foreign assets on an initial situation of long run equilibrium with

exchange rate s0 and stock of foreign assets F0 .     The exchange rate

jumps to s from s which is consistent with equilibrium under

stationary expectations. Thereafter, the market converges back to

equilibrium at A* along the TT schedule. The analysis of Appendix I

and Appendix II permits a quantitative illustration. The numbers reported

in the figure give an example with a = 0.50   and    = 1   .   The initial

impact of the trade account disturbance on the exchange rate is to increase

it from 1 to 1.03. The average exchange rate for the first year is 1.04

compared to 1.02 under stationary expectations. However, the market

reaches long run equilibrium faster under stationary expectations than

it does under rational expectati.ons: from Table IV the market reaches

1.09 in 4.6 years under stationary expectations and only in 6 years under

rational expectations. The cumulative current account deficit along the

adjustment path from A0 to A* is 10 units. From Table VI the deficit

is 3.1 in the first year, compared to 3.9 under stationary expectations.

This example shows that when the level of international investment is

high in relation to trade flows, permanent shifts in the trade account

give rise to long periods of deficits or surpluses in the current

initially at          and thereafter the market converges to long run equilib—

rium at A along the TT schedule. Using the same parameter values

as in the above example (a = 0.5                 ,
                                                       =   1)    ,

age exchange rate in the first year is, from Table VII, 1.06 compared to

1.08 under stationary expectations. However, the exchange rate reaches

1.09 only in 6 years under rational expectations compared to 4.6 years

under stationary expectations (Table IV). This is also the time it takes

the niarket to effect 90 percent of the total transfer of (F1 — F0)



Market Response to Anticipated Disturbances

         As an efficient speculative market, the foreign exchange market

responds to disturbances when they are anticipated rather than when they

occur: disturbances that have been correctly discounted in advance have

no effect when they actually occur. Using another terminology, the market

responds only to new information. In this section we show the effects

of permanent capital account and trade account disturbances when they are

ant   icipated in   advance.

purchase of foreign exchange at some future date T .                         The market is

CONCLUSION


     This paper has synthesized the modern theory of exchange rate

determination with the older balance of payments approach in the

framework of a dynamic partial equilibrium model that is consistent

with the nature of the foreign exchange market as an intermediary

between the markets for goods and services and assets in two separate

currency areas. Explicit analysis of the sources of supply and demand --

stocks as well as flows -- makes the model a useful tool in empirical

analysis of exchange rate behavior. As one example, the model explains

the observed tendency of the currencies of countries in current account

surplus to appreciate, and those of countries in current account deficit

to depreciate. This phenomena cannot be explained by the monetarist

theory of exchange rate determination nor can it be explained by the

'textbook' supply-demand model.

     The partial equilibrium nature of the model is an obvious qualifi-

cation to the analysis of this paper, although simple general equilibrium

models (Kouri(l976, 1980), Kouri and de Macedo(l978), Branson(l978),

Calvo and Rodriguez(1977), Dornbusch and   Fischer(1980),   Niehans(1978)

and Rodgriquez(1980)) yield similar response patterns for the exchange

rate. Staying in the partial equilibrium framework there are, however,

a number of problems that still need to be analyzed. One problem

is the observed slow, and initially perverse, response of the trade

balance to changes in the exchange rate, known as the J-curve problem.
                                                                         45




Another is the distinction between the currency denomination of an asset

and its country of origin. This brings in the forward currency market

that enables investors to decide separately about currency composition

of assets on the one hand and the 'nàtionalit' of assets on the other.

A third problem, connected with the J—curve problem is the problem of

leads and lags in trade payments. In the present paper trade credit is

treated as any other asset. Finally, models of the foreign exchanges should

clearly recognize the existence of more than two currencies, and of more

than one exchange rate.

Linear Approximation of the Model


       The diagram developed in section II enables us to study

qualitatively the dynamic response of the foreign exchange market

to capital account as well as current account disturbances. To get

some idea of the quantitative effects of such disturbances, or

rather to identify the crucial parameters, we need to consider

the approximate solution of the nonlinear model. For this

purpose we write the current account equation more explicitly as


(21)          B(s;x) =   E(s;x)/s   —
                                        M(s;x)

where E is the value of exports in domestic currency and M is

the value of imports in foreign currency.2 Substituting this in

equation (17) in section II and linearizing around s we obtain:




1The case of multiple long run equilibria is discussed in the next section.


2Because of the assumption that interest earnings are spent on imports
in both countries, the interest service account and the implied net
imports cancel out.
                                                                                            47




and linearizing around s* we obtain:


                     =   —I
(22)                                           (nE+_1)(s*) _a(s_s*)
                            f— +      gV*I
                           (s*           J


where     nlE =    elasticity     of export earnings in domestic currency with respect

                   to the exchange rate

               =
                   elasticity of       imports in foreign currency with respect to the

                   exchange rate

          s = long        run equilibrium value of the exchange rate.


Long run equilibrium value of the exchange rate is determined by


(23)               B(s*; x) =     0

A necessary and sufficient condition for long run equilibrium s to he

locally stable is that                 >   0   ,   or   that the 'elasticities condition'

   +       —   1   > 0    holds. The solution of the linear differential equation

defined by equation (22) is:



(24)               s =    s+      (s0_s*)e_t


where             is the initial equilibrium value of the exchange rate as deter-

mined by equation (4) (or (14)), repeated below for convenience:


                          fV + C0
(25)               s =


          Equal ion!;     (23),   (24)     and (25) enable us to study the effects of
cpi tal    account       as w'1 1 as t radc' account disturbances in the short run
                                                                             48



as well as in the long run, starting from an liii tial situation of equilib-
rium. Equations (23) and (24) seem to suggest that 'only capital account
disturbances   matter   in the short run'   while 'only trade account disturbances

matter in the long run.' This asymmetry disappears, however, when allowance

is made for speculative expectations, as is shown in the next section;

and when the analysis applies to any period of time. To show this consider

the approximate discrete solution of the above model in terms of annual

averages. For this purpose we adopt the convention of measuring all flow

variables and flow parameters 'at annual rates.' By integration of equa-

tion (24) we can write the average annual exchange rate for the th year as:


(26)           Sj   = (l_e1)s*   + e1s0



where             1 —a(i—i)
             8. = —e            —a
                            (1— e ) ,       i   = 1,   2




The average exchange rate for any year after time 0 is thus a weighted

average of the long run equilibrium exchange rate (s*) on the one hand,

and the short run equilibrium value of the exchange rate (s0) at time

0 on the other. The weight of the long run equilibrium exchange rate

increases with tIme.      It also increases with an increase in the exchange

rate elasticity of the     current   account (nE+nM_l) and with an increase

In the level of trade in relation to the level of asset holdings

(1*/Ef(V/g*) +gV*J) ,      for   a    (M*/[f(V/s*) +gV*])(n+r_l)
        The cumulative current account surplus associated with the adjust-

ment path is approximately:
                                                                                             49




                             =                       S0
(27)          S =
                      fBdt       [f*Y_       g*v*}


If   foreign residents do not hold domestic assets, the cumulative current

account surplus is exactly equal to (F*_F0) .                      Current account surplus
in the 1th year after the initial moment is a fraction of the cumulative

surplus, this fraction decreasing over time:


(28)          B1 =


where         lpi =   e(l—e)
         Finally,     there are two possible measures of the speed of adjustment.

One is the time it takes the market to eliminate x percent of theinitial

exchange rate discrepancy (s0.-s*) ,                 or       x percent of the cumulative

current account surplus S ; namely:


              r I .\ —— --               '

where    5T — s0 =    x(s*_s0)       and ST = xS          .   This measure is independent
of the size of the disturbance. An alternative measure is the time it

takes the exchange rate to get to within x percent of its long run equi—

ilbrhim value, namely:


                                 x
(30)          T2(x)              x


where x0 =                           is the initial deviation of the exchange rate
              I(s0_s*)/s*j
from its long run equilibrium value. T2(x) is also the time it takes

Linear Approximation of the Model


        To get an idea of the quantitative effects of disturbances we again

consider a linear approximation of the dynamic model defined by equations

(19) and (20) in section III. The linear differential equation corres-




                     i
ponding to equation (22) in Appendix lis:

               s =   lIs_s*)         l(F_F*)

                                        F* J



where
                     affa     = the elasticity of demand for foreign assets with

                                respect to the expected rate of depreciation of

                                domestic currency, evaluated at long run equilibrium.


The linear approximation of differential equation (30) around long run

equilibrium is:


                      s__s*
(32)          W=c s*

The characteristic roots of this system of two linear differential equa-

tions    are 4(l/) /(1/)2 + 4c/ . If                the 'elasticities condition'

holds a is positive and therefore the characteristic roots are real and

of opposite sign, which means that the rest point of the system is a

saddlepoint) There is therefore only one initial value of the free var-

iable, in this case the exchange rate, such that, starting from that value

the system converges to equilibrium. To determine the stable solution



11f the elasticities condition is not met            and thus a is negative, there
arc two possibilities. First, if 41a              , < O.25(1/)
                                                     where   al     the       is
absolute value of a , both characteristic roots are real and positive;
second, if 4a >          0.25(1f3) the      roots are complex conj  .tes with a

 characteristic roots respectively; (p1, 1)                              and (p2. 1) are the asso-

 ciated characteristic vectors; and                          A1 and A2 are constants to be de-

 termined by initial and terminal conditions. The terminal condition is

 that the system converges to equilibrium, and it restricts A2 to equal.

zero. The initial condition on the stock of foreign assets restricts A1

to equal (F0—F*)/F* .                       From equation (33) the rationa1 expectations'

equilibrium value of the exchange rate at the inItial moment, denoted by

S,must thenequal Jj1(F0_F)*)/F* .                                  From this we get the linear approxi-

        Table III shows different values of                            corresponding to the same

values of      and         as above. The speed of adjustment of the stock of

foreign assets decreases as the interest rate elasticity of the capital

account ()      increases.          This is illustrated in Table IV that reports

different values of T1(O.10) corresponding to different values of

and     ,   where    T1(x) is defined by


(42)         T1(x) =    — --ln(l—x)
                            1



The column with            equal to zero is the same as the last row of Table I.

        T1(x) does not, however, correctly measure the speed of adjustment

of the exchange rate because the exchange rate jumps discretely at the

initial moment. An appropriate measure is instead the time it takes to

eliminate x percent of deviation (s0_s*) of which (s0—s) is eli-

minated immediately. This time is given by:



(43)          T3(x) =   — -ln
                             1 l
which   Is 1ss than T1(x) .            Table   V reports different values of T3(x)
for the same range of values of c and                         as used in Table II.
        Finally, the discrete solution of the model is given by:

               Implications of Borrowing in Foreign Currency



        Residents of most small countries cannot borrow in their own cur-

rency in the international capital market, but instead have to borrow in

one of the major currencies. Many of the small countries are furthermore

net debtors. This introduces problems in the foreign exchange market.

To analyze these problems, consider first the case when domestic residents

currently are net debtors in foreign currency (F0 < 0)              but would like

to hold a positive stock of foreign assets (fV > 0)            .    If   foreign demand

for other types of domestic assets but bonds is larger (measured in foreign

currency) than the foreign debt of domestic residents (gV* >
                                                                           F)   ,    equi-
librium still exists, and is unique and stable as is shown in Figure I,

where the market reaches equilibrium at A0 with exchange rate

Suppose, however, that in this situation foreign demand for domestic assets

declines so much as to shift the supply schedule to SS' (g'V* <
                                                                                    F)
Then clearly there does not exist any equilibriun with stationary expec-

tations: domestic currency would tend to depreciate without limit.

        Consider next the case when the desired stock of foreign assets is

negative (fV < 0)   .   The equilibrium condition is now


(46)         —f(R, R*+ii, z)V/s — F0 =    g(R—,     R*, z)V* — G0/s


where   f is replaced by —f     to   indicate    that domestic residents want

to borrow foreign currency. f(R, R*+n,          z)V/s   is   the   supply schedule

of   foreign currency denominated domestic loans. It is assumed that foreign

demand for these loans is infinitely elastic at interest rate R*                   The

equilibrium value of the exchange rate implied by equation (1) is


                           - fV

There are four possible constellations in terms of initial asset holdings

(F0, C0) and desired asset holdings (fV, gV*) as illustrated in Figures

11(a) to 11(d).

         Given stationary expectations short run equilibrium exists if and

only if G0 > fV and —F0 c gV* or G0 < fV and —F0 > gV* ((a) and

(c) in Figure II). However, equilibrium is stable if and only if

C0 > fV and —F0 < gV* ; losely speaking it is stable only if actual

and desired foreign holdings of domestic currency denominated assets are

large enough.



Rational Expectations Equilibrium

          Figure III shows that   when expectations      are rational the problem

of nouex.tstencc of     short run equilibrium   does not arise provided that long

run    equilibrium   is unique.   It is as.suincd   in   the   figure that   foreign resi-

dents do not hold domestic currency denominated assets. Domestic residents

have initially a positive stock of foreign assets, equal to F0 in the

figure while they would like to be net debtors——in other words they would

like to borrow in foreign currency to invest in domestic assets. Clearly,

there is no equilibrium under stationary expectations——the FF and the

F0F0 schedules do not intersect. However, there is a rational expecta-

tions equilibrium at A0 where the TT schedule intersects the vertical

F0F0 schedule.
