                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we investigate the issue of partner selection in the health of individuals who are at least
fifty years old in England and the United States. We find a strong and positive association in family
background variables including education of partners and their parents. Adult health behaviors such
as smoking, drinking, and exercise are more positively associated in England compared to the United
States. Childhood health indicators are also positively associated across partners.

We also investigated pre and post partnership smoking behavior of couples. There exists strong positive
assortative mating in smoking in that smokers are much more likely to partner with smokers and non-smokers
with non-smokers. This relationship is far stronger in England compared to the United States. In the
United States, we find evidence of asymmetric partner influence in smoking in that men’s pre marriage
smoking behavior influences his female partner’s post marriage smoking behavior but there does not
appear to be a parallel influence of women’s pre-marriage smoking on their male partner’s post-marital
smoking. These relationships are much more parallel across genders in England.

Partner selection is a potentially important and under-researched aspect of levels and inequality

of health in all countries. If the healthy marry the healthy and the unhealthy the unhealthy and

health of partners matters as seems likely, then partner selection will exacerbate health

inequalities in a population. Health histories of partners may matter for at least three reasons

(Moden, 2007; Oreffice and Quitana-Domeque, 2010; Silvertoinen et al, 2003). First, individuals

may select their partners in part based on observable and unobservable aspects of their potential

partner’s prior health. Second, partner selection may depend on factors such as education and

health behaviors (smoking, drinking and exercise), which are correlated with current and future

health. Third, couples typically share a common life-style and the same household environment.

Health outcomes may therefore become more correlated over time are partners are exposed to

similar environmental risks, whether through choice or unexpected shocks.


       Partner selection may matter as well for international differences in health outcomes. In

some countries, partner selection is at the discretion of parents and may be heavily influenced by

customs and only take place within narrowly defined and highly stratified groups. Even in

industrialized countries with similar levels of average incomes, heterogeneity and geographic

mobility may vary a good deal producing quite different degrees of partner selection. The case

we analyze in this paper- England and the United States- is a good example since the United

States is a more heterogeneous country (if only due to their immigration history and size) and

there is much more geographical mobility in the U.S. than in England (Banks et al, 2012).


       There are two aspects of the existing scientific infrastructure that has limited research on

this question. Until recently, our major surveys have been focused on individuals, or when there

was information on couples there would be only a single household reporter for both individuals

in the partner/spousal unit. That is a major limitation especially when we need to know pre-

                                                  2
partnership data about both people (Smith, 2009). The partner/spouse data in our analysis were

reported by each partner about themselves. Secondly, comparable cross-national data did not

exist. These two limitations do not restrict our research here since our two data sets for England

and the United States (the English Longitudinal Survey for England (ELSA) and the Health and

Retirement Study for the U.S. (HRS)) made international data comparability an essential part of

their design. Both surveys also included in their later waves detailed childhood health and

background histories which allow us to investigate pre-partnership information on health and

other relevant traits.


        This paper is divided into four sections. The next section highlights the main attributes of

the English and American data we use in this research. Section 2 summarizes our results on the

nature of the association between spouses and partners in terms of their pre- partnership health

and SES backgrounds as well as their contemporary health status and health behaviors at the

time of the two surveys. The third section examines models of marital dissolution as affected by

prior to relationship childhood health and the pre- and post- marital patterns of partnership

smoking behavior. The final section highlights our main conclusions.


    1. Data


        This research primarily uses data from two surveys — the English Longitudinal Survey

of Aging (ELSA) and the American Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). Both collect

longitudinal data on health, economic status, work, and well-being from a representative sample

of the English and American populations aged 50 and older. ELSA and HRS are strong in the

measurement of socioeconomic variables and health (self-reported subjective general health

status, prevalence and incidence of physical and mental disease during the post age 50 adult


                                                 3
years) and salient health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). An

important advantage of both data sets for our research in this paper is that each spouse/partner

reports separately about their own health status and health behaviors as well as many aspects of

their pre-partnership lives including their family SES and their childhood health.

        One limitation of ELSA and HRS is that data collection only begins at age 50 (and even

later for older cohorts at the time of the initial baseline interview). Fortunately, this limitation

was recognized, and both HRS and ELSA included very similar retrospectively reported

childhood health histories.1 In addition to a subjective question rating their childhood health

before age 16 on the standard five-point scale from excellent to poor, respondents in both

surveys were asked about the occurrence of a set of common childhood illnesses. If the condition

did exist, they were asked the age of first onset. The age 50 restriction is also recognized later in

the paper when we use two data sets that represent the entire age adult age distribution in the two

countries- Understanding Society in England and the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics in the

United States.

        The list of childhood illnesses that were asked was very similar in the two surveys but not

identical- some diseases were asked in one survey but not the other.2 Even within these set of

childhood conditions, there are differences in wording or inclusion that must be taken into

account. The following childhood diseases have basically the same wording in both surveys—

asthma, diabetes, heart trouble, chronic ear problems, severe headaches or migraines, and

1
  ELSA fielded their childhood health history between its wave 3 and wave 4 core interviews between February and
August 2007. The HRS childhood health history was initially placed into an internet survey in 2007 for those
respondents who had internet access and who agreed to be interviewed in that mode. The remainder of HRS
respondents received the same childhood health history as part of the 2008 core interview. See details about the
nature of these histories see Smith, 2009a and Banks, Oldfield, and Smith (2012).
2
  For example, the following childhood conditions and diseases were asked in ELSA but not in HRS- broken bones
and fractures; appendicitis; leukemia or lymphoma; cancer or malignant tumor. The following conditions were asked
in HRS but not in ELSA- difficulty seeing even with glasses or prescription lenses; a speech impairment; stomach
problems; high blood pressure; a blow to the head, head injury or trauma severe enough to cause loss of
consciousness or memory loss for a period of time.

                                                       4
epilepsy or seizures. For the common childhood infectious diseases, HRS respondents were

asked about mumps, measles, and chicken pox separately while ELSA respondents were asked a

single question about all infectious disease with the question wording mentioning these three

diseases but also including polio and TB.3

         Both HRS and ELSA have measures of the family background of respondents although

the measures are more similar in concept than in execution between the surveys. In the HRS, we

know the occupation of the father when the respondent was 16 years old, the education of both

mothers and fathers, whether each parent is alive and if not the age of death, and the economic

status of the family during the respondents’ childhood years.4


         In ELSA, we have information on the occupation of the father when the respondent was

14 years old, the education of both parents, whether each parent is alive and if not the age of

death, and some more limited information on the economic status of respondent’s family in

childhood. Finally, in both surveys when there was only a single lifetime relationship we know

pre- and post-relationship patterns of smoking behavior of both partners.




3
  The biggest difference between the two surveys involves allergies and respiratory problems. In HRS, respondents
were asked about respiratory disorders which included bronchitis, wheezing, hay fever, shortness of breath, and
sinus infections and were separately asked about any allergic conditions. ELSA respondents were asked about
allergies including hay fever and then separately about respiratory problems. Thus, hay fever shows up in a different
category in the two surveys. The other difference of possible significance concerns the category of emotional and
psychological problems which included two questions about depression and other emotional problems in HRS and
one question about emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problems in ELSA. In addition to any impact of these wording
differences, the form in which the questions were asked also differed between the two surveys. HRS respondents
were asked separate questions about each condition while ELSA respondents were shown a ‘show card’ which
contained a list of conditions and then asked to identify any that they may have had before age 16. The show card
format could lead to lower reported prevalence if respondents that had multiple conditions only identify a subset
from show cards, whilst they would have answered in the affirmative to each of the questions individually had they
been asked.
4
  HRS respondents were asked the following question “Now think about your family when you were growing up,
from birth to age 16. “Would you say your family during that time was pretty well off financially, about average, or
poor?” The categories of response were pretty well off financially, about average, poor.

2.     Selection Effects of Partners


2.1 Relationships between Spousal Attributes


Table 1 documents estimated relationships between early and later life attributes of spouses in

terms of health outcomes, health behaviors, and SES background in both England (using ELSA)

and the United States (using HRS). Health outcomes are provided separately for the childhood

years and for contemporary health outcomes at the time of the HRS and ELSA surveys. In this

research, we are using the 2006 (for the health information) and 2008 (to retrieve the childhood

health information) waves of HRS and the 2006 ELSA wave when their life history module was

administered.

       Much of the literature on inter-couple correlations in health has focused on height and

weight, where studies consistently find strong positive associations (Taubs et al, 1992; Taubs et

al 1991; Oreffice and Quitana-Domeque, 2010; Silvertoinen et al, 2003). A smaller literature

focuses on health conditions, and finds positive correlations for the majority of conditions

considered (Di Castelnuovo et al, 2008; Wilson, 2002; Moden, 2007).

       Table 1 lists age adjusted associations between spouses/partners in anthropometric

measurements, their health conditions and self-reported health in both adulthood and childhood,

the standard list of health behaviors (exercise, drinking, smoking, and BMI type outcomes), as

well as their SES background during childhood and parental attributes both now and in

childhood. The estimated coefficients in Table 1 are all derived from a series of regressions of

the female attribute on that of her male partner’s attribute in the same domain in a model that

also includes age quadratics in both partners’ ages. We also estimated a parallel set of models

where the male partner trait was the outcome variable and the female partner trait was the



                                                 6
regressor (still including the two age quadratics). The coefficient estimates were as expected

given the male and female differences in the range of the specific outcomes. None of the

substantive conclusions of this paper is affected by which spouse is used as the RHS trait.

        Our adult health indicators consist at this point of adult self-reports of specific diseases

and general health status on the standard five point scale from excellent to poor. In keeping with

existing work on the spousal correlations in health conditions (Moden, 2007; Casetlnuovo et al,

2008), both partners age adjusted specific disease prevalences are positively associated across

spouses. These associations appear generally to be somewhat higher in the United States

compared to England. In our view, we would characterize these associations as positive but not

particularly large.

        We tend to find the reverse country level relationship when we examine reports of

childhood disease in that in this case the spousal association in childhood disease appears to be

definitely higher in England. This seems particularly true for emotional issues as a child and

contagious diseases such as mumps, chicken pox, and measles, which are far more positively

associated in England compared to the United States. While we can only measure this in the

USA data, learning disabilities as children exhibit one of the stronger associations across

partners. Even the more objective height measure, often used as an indicator of childhood

nutrition, is somewhat more positively associated across partners in England.

        There are much higher partner relationships between health measures that rely on

subjective reports on health than on reports of disease and these correlations now tend to be

distinctly higher in England than in the United States. For example, the association across

spouse/partners in reporting age adjusted adult health as excellent or very good is 0.32 in

England compared to 0.20 in the U.S. Similarly, being in excellent or poor health as a child has



                                                   7
an association that is twice as large in England compared to the United States. If fair or poor

childhood health is used instead, the association is three times larger in England. Since the

existence of adult disease appears on average to be slightly more positively correlated in the US

compared to England, the higher association in subjective reports of health suggests that health

reporting thresholds of spouse/partners are more similar in the more culturally homogenous

England than in the more heterogeneous America.

       When we examine adult health behaviors (exercise, smoking, drinking, and indicators of

obesity), the results are strikingly uniform in that these health behaviors are strongly positively

associated across partners and much more so in England compared to the United States. Couples

in England are much more likely to both smoke, drink, and engage in vigorous exercise if not

together at least as a parallel common part of their lives. The only exception to that cross national

comparison is that BMI type of measures such as obesity and being overweight are slightly more

closely related in the United States. That may indicate that types and quantities of food are more

commonly consumed among partners in the United States. This greater similarity in health

behaviors in England is interesting in that health outcomes across partners/spouses appear

somewhat more positively correlated in the United States.

       One particularly interesting relationship in the adult behaviors sub-segment of Table 1

concerns quitting smoking. When one of the partners quits smoking, the odds are more than fifty

percent larger in England compared to the United States that the other partner will also be a

smoke quitter. Part of the much higher similarity among partners in currently smoking compared

to ever smoking most likely reflects the fact that ‘ever’ includes a long period of time that the

partners were not together and their behaviors could not influence each other. We will model

these patterns of smoking behavior in the next section.



                                                  8
        Turning to the family background variables on which the most research has been done

(Mare, 1991; Pencavel, 1998), the association in education of partners is slightly higher in

England compared to the United States (0.55 compared to 0.48). In the United States in HRS we

also know education of parents of both of the partners. The education of parents is even more

positively associated than that of the partners (about 0.6). In fact, the education of both partners’

mothers and both partners’ fathers are also highly positively associated (0.46 and 0.40

respectively) indicating that much more so than in health social background is highly socially

stratified.

        Not surprisingly, other aspects of partners SES backgrounds appear also to be positively

associated. One difficulty in making these cross-national comparisons in the domain of family

background is that there are only a few background variables that are strictly comparably defined

in HRS and ELSA. One such variable that is reasonably comparably defined is whether the

father of the respondent had an occupational code labeled professional. In ELSA, a respondent’s

father is defined as professional if the respondent defines their main job as “manager or senior

official in someone else’s business”, “running their own business”, or “profession or technical”..

This association across partners is twice as high in England compared to the United States.

        Table 1 presents measures of association of partners only adjusting for their ages. There

may be other characteristics that matter in influencing the strength of this association. For

example, spousal attributes (at least for first marriages) may be more positively associated the

older one is when one gets married. This may partially reflect a more mature judgment in

choosing a partner, an ability to obtain more information on the potential partner, or a greater

realization of the consequences of early life influences on adult life outcomes. Similarly, these

early life associations may vary with whether this is a first marriage or not since a previous



                                                  9
marriage failure may lead to choosing a different set of traits in a partner. To investigate these

conjectures, we reran these models that underlie Table 1 controlling for age at marriage of both

partners and whether this is a first marriage. Age of partner was not statistically significant so we

concentrate on the changing association of these spousal attributes with the number of lifetime

relationships

       Table 2 displays changes in partner relationships by the number of relationships for the

United States while Table 3 does the same for England. Because sample sizes in HRS are higher

than in ELSA, we present a three way partnership classification in HRS (1, 2, 3+) and a two way

partnership classification in ELSA (1, 2+). These models are estimated separately by these

relationship categories and once again also include an age quadratic for both partners.

       The most distinct pattern we find, and it is present in both countries, is that associations

in SES background clearly fall in multiple marriages. In the United States, even the association

of education of partners is half as large in 3 plus relationships compared to single relationships

that endure. The same is true, if to a lesser degree, in the size of this association in education of

parents and in education of mothers and fathers of partners. If not as sharp, a similar pattern is

found in England. While there is a slight decline in the association between partners in race and

much more so in Latino ethnicity with multiple partnerships in the United States, the association

remains highly positive in all marriage groups in the US sample in these age cohorts. Most of

the recent increase in intermarriage across race and ethnicity post-dated the age groups in the age

50 plus HRS sample.

       In terms of adult health behaviors, we find a quite uneven pattern with more similarity in

some behaviors (smoking) but less of an association in others (drinking a lot). In the United




                                                  10
States and England, childhood health is generally more positively associated in first relationships

while the opposite is true for adult health.

3.1 Marriage Models

       The theoretical impact of health on the probability marriage or cohabitation is

ambiguous. Healthier individuals will attract a higher “price” on the marriage market, but

marriage provides a form of insurance that is of greater benefit to the less healthy. Lillard and

Panis (1996) used the PSID to show that amongst men better health (on a composite measure) is

associated with greater hazard of marriage and a lower hazard of divorce. However, once they

condition on socio-economic characteristics, healthier men are less likely to marry, supporting

the insurance hypothesis. The results therefore point towards strong positive selection into

marriage on the basis of factors correlated with health (such as income and education), which

dominate the negative selection generated by the insurance motivation. Fu and Goldman (1994)

also find evidence of selection with risky behavior such as smoking and drug taking, and

physical characteristics such as obesity and short stature delaying entry into marriage.


       Data limitations mean that there is far less work on the impact on marriage of childhood

health. That is principally because there are few panels that go from childhood to the latter life

years collecting prospectively health outcomes and fewer still that collect information on both

partners. These constraints are relaxed with the data we use in this study.


       Tables 4 (for women) and 5 (for men) summarize results from our models estimating

effects of childhood health and background variables on a set of marriage related outcomes in the

two countries. The English models are in the A panels of these tables and the American models

are in the B panel. The marriage outcomes we investigate include whether you ever cohabited

(including marriage), experienced multiple marriages/cohabs, were ever divorced, and the age of

                                                 11
first cohabiting or marriage. Separate models are estimated for women and men in both England

and the United States.

        In addition to an age quadratic and constant term (not displayed in the Tables), these

models include controls for having a major illness and a minor illness as a child, whether one’s

mother or father died before age 70, whether one’s father was in a professional job when one was

a child, and education of respondent. In England the education variable is labeled Ed normed

which is equal to the number of years of education minus the compulsory school leaving age.

Hence normed is equal to 0 if the cohort member left school at the compulsory school leaving

age, -1 if they left the year before, and 1 if they left the year after. This is to take into account the

change in the compulsory schooling age implemented in 1947. The estimated effects of the other

variables in these models are not sensitive to the inclusion of own years of schooling as a control

variable.

        Among English and American men and women, illness during childhood has little effect

on whether one ever cohabited in large part since most people in our age group have had at least

one relationship.5 The only exception to this generalization is that having experienced a major

illness during childhood reduced the probability of cohabiting/marriage among American men.

        In contrast, we find statistically significant effects of both major and minor illnesses

during childhood on whether one has had multiple partnerships or has even been divorced for

both English and American women (see Table 4). We also find that these childhood illnesses

reduced the age of first relationship for women in both countries. Table 5 shows that these

effects of childhood illness on our measures of relationship stability are much weaker for men




5
 The fraction who had been in a relationship are .962 (American men), .991 (American women) , .968 (English
men), and .971 (English women).

                                                      12
particularly in England. The only exception is that major childhood illness increase the

probability of divorce among American men.

         Why would childhood illness effects on relationship stability be there for women but not

for men? The fact that this gender difference exists in both countries suggests that the

explanation is not specific to unique aspects of the culture of each country but lies instead in

gender roles. One gender role that may well come into play is that within relationships,

especially in these age groups women are the care givers and are a force in improving the health

of their spouses. Poor health in childhood for women which eventually will be transmitted to

poorer health in adulthood may make the relationship less stable since not only might women

find it more difficult to help their partners but their male partners may not be willing to provide

help needed with the adult health problems of the woman.6

3.2 Smoking Models

         In this section, we analyze patterns of smoking behavior pre and post marriage to assess

the influence of partners on smoking behavior. Table 6 summarizes basic patterns of pre and post

marriage smoking behavior as revealed in the HRS for the United States and in ELSA for

England, and shows that on almost all dimension the countries are very similar.

         The birth cohorts in HRS and ELSA, and especially the men, were clearly heavy smokers

in the past who also exhibit significant quitting behavior, a part of which at least in the United

States no doubt was induced by the Surgeon’s General report. In both countries, about two-

thirds of men and two-fifths of women were ever smokers. Current smoking behavior is much

lower than ever smoking with about 10% of men and women still smoking in both samples.

6
 Differences in the effects of individual characteristics on marriage by gender are not limited to childhood health.
Oreffice and Quitana-Domeque (2010) find strong inter-spousal correlations in height and weight, but additional
penalties from poor health characteristics vary by gender. Shorter men are more likely to marry shorter women,
heavier women with a lower level of education. The husbands of heavier women tend to be shorter, poorer, and less
educated. The marriage market does not additionally penalize short women or heavier men.

                                                         13
        Most smoking behavior is initiated before marriage. Among men who ever smoked, 87%

in the United States and 96% in England started before marriage. For women ever smokers, there

is a more sizable difference with 68% starting before marriage in the United States, compared to

88% in England. This is the most sizable cross country difference in Table 6, and is also

reflected in the proportion of women who start smoking before marriage (27% in the United

States compared to 38% in England). In England, among those who started smoking before

marriage, the average time before (first) marriage was 5.0 years for women and 8.6 years for

men. A significant fraction of those who smoked before marriage continued that behavior after

the start of their marriage.

        The final two rows show the smoking behavior of this sample before their marriage so

that it reflects smoking selection associated with marriage. In the United States, among male

smokers before marriage, 34% of them married a smoker while among male non-smokers before

marriage 21% married a smoker. The corresponding numbers for American women are as

follows- among female smokers at marriage 69% married a smoker while for female non-

smokers 52% married a smoker. Thus, while there is a distinct positive association at marriage

between smoking behaviors of partners it remains the case that many non-smokers also marry

smokers. This is especially true for American women which may not be surprising since so many

men smoked during that time period in the HRS birth cohorts.

        The corresponding numbers for England in Table 6 show similar assortative mating in

pre-marital smoking behavior for English women, with 70% of English female smokers at the

time of their marriage also married smokers compared to only 54% for female non-smokers

marrying smokers. Assortative mating for English men is of a similar magnitude, with 45% of

male smokers marrying smokers compared to only 29% for male non-smokers.



                                                14
       Table 7 presents results of models estimating the relationship between post marriage and

current smoking behavior to smoking before marriage of both partners in the United States. In

addition to our standard age quadratics, our American models also include, controls for

education (three dummy variables for years of education-0-11 years, 12-15 years, and 16 or more

years with the middle group serving as the reference group), African-American race, and

Hispanic ethnicity. Our corresponding English models are presented in Table 8 with the only

difference being the absence of the two American ethnicity variables and the use of the education

normed variable instead of the American education dummies.

       Consider the American models first. Among men, African-Americans smoke more but at

the time of the administration of our HRS sample and post marriage while there are no

statistically significant between group differences for African-American women. These

differences are much smaller for Hispanics with the only statistically significant difference

existing for Latinas who smoked somewhat less after marriage. Education differences in

smoking are well established in the United States (Goldman and Smith, 2010) and these patterns

are replicated in Table 7. Smoking is highest among the least educated and lowest among the

most educated for both genders. We find a similar negative effect of education in the English

models in Table 8.

       Our main interest in the models in Table 7 concerns estimated effects of own and spousal

pre marriage smoking. In terms of ever smoking after marriage, not surprisingly, smoking before

marriage is a very strong predictor for both men and women. When we examine current

smoking, the estimated effects of pre-marriage smoking are considerably smaller illustrating

once again the significant degree to which these generations quit smoking.




                                                15
       Perhaps, the most interesting result in Table 7 is the asymmetric gender effects of pre-

marriage partner smoking in the United States. Controlling for male partner pre marriage

smoking, female partner pre-marriage smoking has no statistically significant effect on post

marriage male smoking. In sharp contrast, the estimated effects of male partner pre-marriage

smoking remain statistically significant and non-trivial even after we control for female pre-

marriage smoking. To put it simply, at least in the domain of smoking, men influence women

while women do not influence men on average to the same degree. By marrying a male smoker,

women’s health could be influenced in two ways- first the widely cited negative effects of

exposure to second hand smoke and in addition the enhanced probability of becoming a smoker.

       The parallel results for England are presented in Table 8. The own sex pre marriage

estimates on current smoking are evidence of significant quitting behavior in England as well.

The other lagged pre marriage coefficients are similar to what they were in the United States. In

England, if both partners smoked it was apparently more difficult for both women and men to

cease their smoking after marriage. As for the US, the estimated effects of male pre-marital

smoking on female smoking are larger than the estimates for the effects of female smoking on

male smoking. However, the magnitudes are smaller, and only the association between male pre-

marital smoking and female smoking after marriage is statistically different from zero.

       Table 9 contains our models for quitting smoking behavior for residents of both

countries. We restrict the sample in these models for each gender to those whom ever smoked

and add categorical variables for your partner's smoking behavior (never smoked, still smokes,

quit smoking) with never smoked the reference group in the models. In both countries relative to

partners who never smoked, individuals are less likely to quit if their partners are currently

smoking with the magnitudes of these effects quite similar in both countries. We find a stronger



                                                 16
influence of partner behavior in England compared to the United States in that having a partner

who quits smoking is positively associated with you also quitting smoking in England for both

men and women. We find no such relationship in our American models.



3.3 Smoking models for younger cohorts

Attitudes towards smoking have changed dramatically since the ELSA and HRS cohorts started

smoking and formed partnerships. In this section, we use alternative sources of data to consider

whether our results hold for younger cohorts and the extent to which partnership sorting by

smoking behavior has changed. Data for England comes from Understanding Society, a UK-

wide longitudinal survey covering 40,000 households. We use data on smoking behavior from

the second wave, conducted in 2010. Information on marriage and cohabitation is available. The

American data come from the 2007 wave of the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID), the

premiere all age group income panel in the United States.


       Table 10 shows patterns of smoking behavior pre and post marriage, for cohorts aged 50+

and 30-49 in both countries. The A panel of Table 10 has data for England while the B panel

contains the American results. Comparing the first two columns of Table 10.A and 10.B to the

ESLA and HRS figures in Table 6 for essentially the same age group (ages 50+) shows that

levels of previous and current smoking amongst the over 50s are somewhat higher in

Understanding Society than in ELSA. In contrast, they are generally somewhat lower in PSID

than in HRS, but the general patterns remain remarkably the same. The American result is not

surprising in that the PSID sample of 50+ is younger than the HRS sample.


       The comparison between the two age defined birth cohorts in Understanding Society and

PSID gives the combined effect of differences by age and cohort. As expected, the proportion

                                               17
who ever smoked is lower for those ages 30-49 than for those 50+, with a difference of 6.3

percentage points for men and 0.8 percentage points for women in England and even larger in

the PSID where it is a difference of 19.5 percentage points for men and 7.0 percentage points

form women, most likely reflecting the large secular decline in male smoking in the United

States. The proportions that smoke now are higher for the younger cohort, in part because the

probability of quitting rises with age.


       The final two rows show the relationship between smoking and partner selection. Even

though the shares that smoked before marriage are very similar across the two cohorts, the

difference in proportion of smokers and non-smokers who married a smoker is much higher for

those aged 30-49 than for those 50+, indicating greater pre-marital smoking selection in partners

in the younger cohorts. While this is true in both countries, it is especially the case in England.

       Table 11 decomposes the last two rows in Table 10 into those with compulsory education

or less and more than compulsory education in England and for those with less than a high

school degree and a college degree or more in the United States. For both birth cohort groups,

the proportions of smokers who married smokers and non-smokers who married smokers are

lower for those with more than compulsory education. This in part reflects lower overall

smoking rates among the more educated. Within cohort differences by education level show no

large changes.


       For both education groups in England, smoking selection is greater for the younger

cohort, with higher proportions of smokers marrying smokers and lower proportions of non-

smokers marrying smokers. The largest cross-cohort differences are in the (increased)

proportions of male smokers that marry smokers and the (reduced) proportions of female non-

smokers that marry non-smokers. The change in the former does not differ by education level;

                                                 18
the change in the latter is much larger for more educated women. The remaining two groups,

female smokers and male non-smokers, are most likely to marry someone with the same

smoking behavior, and this increases only slightly over time. One explanation is that female

smoking has always been undesirable to men who do not smoke. Over time and cohorts, this has

strengthened slightly. The bigger change is in women’s attitudes to men who smoke.


       Table 12 provides models of smoking behavior in Understanding Society and the PSID

that correspond to the models in Tables 7 and 8. The own effects in ELSA and 50+

Understanding Society cohorts are roughly similar, although own pre-marriage smoking has a

larger effect on current smoking in Understanding Society, particularly for women. The partner

effects are more consistently significant in the female smoking models.


       As would be expected, the association between smoking and own pre-marriage smoking

are stronger for the younger Understanding Society cohort, as the quit rate increases over time.

However, the associations with partner’s smoking behavior are also stronger and similar across

men and women in the younger age group. For current smoking, this may be explained by

increasing quit rates as cohorts age. However, the result for smoking after marriage suggests an

increased responsiveness to partner behavior. This still largely remains not the case in the United

States for the younger cohort in that they largely remain uninfluenced by partner’s smoking. The

main exception is that when both partners smoked before marriage married women are much

more likely to be current smokers.


       Table 13 provides models of quitting behavior that mirror those for the HRS and ELSA

in Table 9. As in Table 9, there is a strong negative association between quitting smoking and

having a partner that currently smokes. The association is stronger for the Understanding Society


                                                19
over 50 cohort than in ELSA. By contrast, the association between quitting and a partner

quitting is only statistically significant for the age 30-49 sample in Understanding Society and

the 50+ sample in the PSID.



Conclusion

       In this paper, we investigated the issue of partner selection in the health of individuals

who are at least fifty years old in England and the United States. Such an investigation is now

possible since data sets such as ELSA and HRS interview both partners in the relationship and

also ask questions about central pre-partnership variables that include family background and

childhood health.

       We find a strong and positive association in family background variables including

education of partners and their parents. Adult health behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and

exercise are more positively associated in England compared to the United States. Childhood

health indicators are also positively associated across partners. In general, these correlations are

more positive for first than for subsequent partnerships. Especially for women, poor childhood

health is associated future marital disruptions in both countries.

       Because of the better availability of the necessary data, we investigated more closely the

pre and post partnership smoking behavior of couples. There exists strong positive assortative

mating in smoking in that smokers are much more likely to partner with smokers and non-

smokers with non-smokers. This relationship is far stronger in England compared to the United

States. In the United States, we find evidence of asymmetric partner influence in smoking in that

men’s pre marriage smoking behavior influences his female partner’s post marriage smoking

behavior but there does not appear to be a parallel influence of women’s pre-marriage smoking



                                                 20
on their male partner’s post-marital smoking. These relationships are much more parallel across

genders in England.

       In the age cohorts in our samples, there was historically strong quitting behavior in

smoking. Once again, we find stronger evidence of spousal influence in England as being

partnered with a smoker makes who quit smoking makes it more likely for you to quite as well.

This relationship does not exist in the United States.
