                                         ABSTRACT

Gender differences in the propensity to negotiate are often used to explain the gender wage gap,
popularizing the push for women to “lean-in.” We use a laboratory experiment to examine the
effect of leaning-in. Despite men and women achieving similar and positive returns when they
must negotiate, we find that women avoid negotiations more often than men. While this suggests
that women would benefit from leaning-in, a direct test of the counterfactual proves otherwise.
Women appear to positively select into negotiations and to know when to ask. By contrast, we
find no significant evidence of a positive selection for men.

1       Introduction
    Should women negotiate their salaries more often? According to 70% of adults recently
surveyed in the United States, the answer is simply yes.1 This wide-held belief that women
should negotiate more is perhaps most easily seen in the popular push for women to “lean-in”
(Sandberg, 2013). Motivated by the well-cited statistics that women earn less than men, the
United States Department of Labor encourages women to “aim higher and negotiate better.”2
Out of the four Grand Prize winners in their Equal Pay App Challenge, three of the apps explicitly
seek to help close the gender wage gap by offering negotiation tools.3 While compelling, there
is some evidence that the recommendation to lean-in may backfire. A cautionary story about a
woman, whose job offer as an assistant professor was retracted after trying to negotiate details
of her contract, went viral.4 In this paper, we examine whether women financially benefit from
leaning-in and negotiating more.
    Decades of research examines the extent to which a gender gap exists both in terms of
entrance into negotiations and achieved outcomes from negotiations. The general consensus
— including recent observational evidence (Card, Cardoso and Kline, 2016), laboratory studies
(Dittrich, Knabe and Leipold, 2014) and field experiments (Leibbrandt and List, 2015) — is
that women enter negotiations less often and/or fare worse when they do negotiate.5 However,
many factors have been documented to influence if and to what extent the gender gap exists,
including the sex of negotiating partners (Eckel and Grossman, 2001; Solnick, 2001; Bowles,
Babcock and Lai, 2007; Sutter et al., 2009; Hernandez-Arenaz and Iriberri, 2016), the activation
of stereotypes (Kray, Thompson and Galinsky, 2001), the availability of information on what
others do or what is recommended (Bowles, Babcock and McGinn, 2005; Rigdon, 2012), the
beneficiaries of the negotiation (Bowles, Babcock and McGinn, 2005), the extent to which the
possibility for a negotiation is known (Small et al., 2007; Leibbrandt and List, 2015), the fear of
backlash (Bowles, Babcock and Lai, 2007), the framing of the situation as a negotiation or ask
(Small et al., 2007), the cultural context of the negotiations (Andersen et al., 2013), the relative
positional power in a negotiation (Andersen et al., 2013; Dittrich, Knabe and Leipold, 2014;
Greenberg and Petrie, 2015), the communication strategies or mode (Bowles and Babcock, 2013;

on the wage gap, see Blau and Kahn (2016). While they document a recent decline in the wage gap due to
observable factors such as higher education achievement among women, they also find that the “unexplained”
wage gap has largely not decreased — leaving room for additional explanations, such as differences in risk aversion
or negotiations.

Bowles, 2013; Greenberg and Petrie, 2015), and the ability to signal valuations or experience
(Castillo et al., 2013; Busse, Israeli and Zettelmeyer, 2016). Gender differences in implicit or
explicit preferences, such as risk aversion or fairness concerns, may also contribute to differences
in negotiation outcomes for men and women.6
    While vast, this literature does not provide direct comparisons of the financial returns that
women achieve when they choose whether to negotiate versus when they always negotiate. An
open question therefore follows: what are the financial consequences or benefits from leaning-in?
Determining which factors typically lead to better or worse outcomes for women in negotiations
is not sufficient to answer this question. Even in settings where most women benefit from
negotiations, leaning-in may be harmful if the women avoiding those negotiations are the ones
who would lose from instead negotiating. Similarly, environments where losses from negotiations
are not possible, or where it is weakly dominant to always enter negotiations, are not suitable for
considering the necessary counterfactual. That is, to determine whether women would financially
benefit from negotiating more, we must understand the selection of women into negotiations in a
setting where outside options are observed and losses from negotiations are possible. This paper
presents the first comparison of outcomes when women can and cannot select into negotiations
in otherwise similar environments.
    To narrow in on negotiation decisions themselves, we examine an environment that abstracts
away from many factors in more complex negotiations. Participants are anonymous to mitigate
any fear of discrimination or backlash. Participants encounter explicit negotiation opportunities
and decisions to avoid any ambiguity. Participants are informed of what they bring to the table
to limit concerns related to lacking confidence and are informed of their outside options to make
the potential loss of a negotiation clear.
    In particular, we conduct a laboratory experiment where parties in a negotiation include
one participant randomly assigned to the role of the worker and another participant randomly
assigned to the role of the firm. A negotiation between the two parties centers on determining
how to split a joint worker-firm revenue, which equals the sum of their individual contributions.
Their individual contributions depend on their performance in a prior task. There are 10 rounds
of negotiation opportunities, where each round randomly rematches participants into worker-
firm pairs. All negotiation opportunities begin with a computer-generated suggested wage for the
worker, equal to the worker’s contribution plus a random amount that is negative in expectation.
    In our Choice treatment, workers can choose to avoid a negotiation opportunity by accepting
the suggested wage for themselves and leaving the remainder of the joint revenue for the firm.
Workers can alternatively reject their suggested wage and enter a negotiation. By contrast,
workers must always enter negotiations in our Forced treatment.7
   6
     For survey papers on gender differences in such preferences, see Croson and Gneezy (2009), Bertrand (2011)
and Niederle (forthcoming).
   7
     In considering the counterfactual state where women must always enter negotiations, we can capture the full


                                                       2
    Negotiations are anonymous and last at most three-minutes, during which participants can
engage in free-form communication and post official wage offers. If an agreement is reached within
three-minutes, the worker receives the agreed upon wage and the firm receives the remainder of
the joint revenue. Negotiations that fail to reach an agreement result in the worker receiving
the suggested wage minus a five-dollar penalty and the firm receiving the joint revenue minus
the suggested wage and minus a five-dollar penalty. The symmetric Nash Bargaining Solution
of equally splitting the ten-dollar surplus relative to a failed negotiation thus secures the payoffs
identical to that of implementing the suggested wage - i.e., the outcome that occurs when workers
avoid negotiations in the Choice treatment.
    In the Forced treatment, we find small and insignificant gender differences in achieved out-
comes from negotiations. Despite this lack of a difference, results from the Choice treatment
show that women are significantly less likely — on average 12 percentage points less likely — to
enter negotiations than men. Moreover, when women do enter negotiations, they almost always
achieve financial gains.
    A lean-in intervention may therefore seem promising in this environment. An accurate recom-
mendation, however, requires the observation of the full counterfactual. Forcing women to always
negotiate leads to an increase in losses and no additional gains. Leaning-in appears irrelevant
with respect to financially favorable negotiations — women already choose to enter those — and
harmful with respect to financially unfavorable negotiations that women would have avoided if
given the choice. Additional evidence suggests that this positive selection is driven by higher en-
try rates among higher-negotiation-ability women. Measures of risk aversion or fairness concerns
do not play a significant role.
    By contrast, while men avoid some negotiations, their returns from negotiations do not sig-
nificantly differ across the Forced and Choice treatments. Their selection is instead consistent
with fairness concerns; men avoid negotiations more often when their suggested wage exceeds or
equals their contribution and they believe receiving one’s contribution is fair.8
    Our paper proceeds as follows. We begin with the design in Section 2, describe the data in
Section 3, and then briefly compare outcomes between men and women in Section 4. Sections 5
and 6 separately consider the selection by women and men into negotiations in more detail, and
finally Section 7 concludes.
set of potential returns to leaning-in. A related and interesting question would involve the impact of a less binding
“recommendation” to lean-in more often. Such a recommendation could avoid the possibility of our results being
driven by individuals disliking forced negotiations per se. Counter to this possibility, however, we do not observe
differences between our Forced and Choice treatments when negotiations opportunities are relatively favorable.
    8
      As women’s entrance decisions are not similarly correlated with this fairness measure, this result is reminiscent
of the finding in Andreoni and Vesterlund (2001) that women’s fairness motivated behavior are less responsive to
the price of giving.

2       Design
    We create a negotiation environment, using Ztree (Fischbacher, 2007), where participants
can compose free-form arguments for their point of view and can separately generate official
proposals which the opposing side can respond to. Within this environment, we consider two
treatments: our “Choice” treatment allows participants to decide whether they would like to
negotiate, and our “Forced” treatment instead forces participants to always negotiate.
    In both treatments, participants are evenly split between firms and workers at the beginning
of the study. Participants then face two blocks of five negotiation opportunities, where each
block is preceded by one performance round. The performance round determines the individual
contribution that a participant brings to each of the subsequent five negotiation opportunities.
For each negotiation opportunity, participants are randomly matched into worker-firm pairs with
joint revenues equal to the sum of the worker’s contribution and the firm’s contribution. In the
Choice treatment, workers can decide to enter into negotiations with the firm or forgo negotiations
by accepting a computer-generated suggested wage. In the Forced treatment, workers must
enter negotiations while still observing a computer-generated suggested wage. All negotiations
concern the share of joint revenue the worker receives as a wage. Negotiations the fail to reach
an agreement result in the suggested wage being implemented along with a five-dollar penalty
for both the worker and the firm.
    Appendix B displays the instructions given to participants before beginning the study. These
instructions include screenshots of how negotiations take place. We now describe each design
element in more detail.
Individual Contributions
    To encourage workers and firms to feel entitled to their individual contributions, we have
participants perform a five-minute real-effort task at the beginning of each negotiation block.
Their performance determines their contribution for the subsequent five rounds of negotiation
opportunities in that block. A worker’s contribution is $20, $15 or $10, depending on whether the
worker’s performance is the highest, second highest or third highest when compared to two other
randomly selected workers. A firm’s contribution is $25 or $20, depending on whether the firm’s
performance is the highest or second highest performance when compared to one other randomly
selected firm.9 Any performance ties are broken randomly, and all participants are informed that
this process determines contributions. In the first block, their task is to calculate the sum of five
two-digit numbers. In the second block, their task is to count the number of zeros in a table
with ten rows and five columns of zeros and ones (i.e., one row may appear like ”00101”). Since
participants’ relative performance may vary across the two tasks, their individual contributions
may vary across the two blocks.
    9
    To make room for negotiation demands, note that the highest contribution level of the worker equals the
lowest contribution level of the firm.

                                                    4
Joint Revenue
    After learning their individual contributions for a block, participants subsequently face five
rounds of negotiation opportunities. In each round, a firm and a worker are randomly matched,
and the joint revenue is the sum of the worker and firm contributions. The firm is always
informed of the worker contribution. Whether the worker is informed of the firm contribution
depends on the study version. In a common knowledge version, the worker is informed of the
firm contribution. In a private information version, the worker is not informed of the firm’s
contribution. This design feature was motivated by the finding that women often fare worse
in negotiations that involve more ambiguity (see Bowles and McGinn (2008) and Mazei et al.
(2015) for reviews, or Leibbrandt and List (2015) for recent evidence). However, perhaps given
the anonymity and explicit choice to negotiate in our setting, this variation in knowledge does
not produce different results.10 Our analysis will therefore not focus on this variation and instead
includes it as a control where relevant.
Suggested Wage
    When the worker and firm are matched, they learn a suggested wage for the worker. The
suggested wage for the worker equals the worker’s contribution plus a bonus that is randomly
chosen among -4, -2, 0, 2. The random bonus is negative in expectation so that workers often
have a financial incentive to negotiate. For example, negotiations would be desirable if a bonus
is negative and the norm is to divide the joint revenue according to individual contributions.
By varying the bonus level, we can assess whether the outside option influences the decisions to
enter negotiations and the returns from doing so.
Potential Payoffs
    In the Choice treatment, a worker can choose to avoid negotiations by accepting the suggested
wage for themselves and hence the joint revenue minus the suggested wage for the firm. If a worker
enters a negotiation in the Choice treatment, or when a worker must always enter negotiations
in the Forced treatment, the same two payoff scenarios are possible. When an agreement is
reached, the worker receives the agreed upon wage and the firm receives the remainder of the
joint revenue. When an agreement is not reached, the suggested wage is implemented along with
a five-dollar penalty for both the worker and firm. That is, the worker receives the suggested
wage minus five dollars, and the firm receives the joint revenue minus the suggested wage minus
five dollars. Assuming risk neutrality, the suggested wage therefore corresponds to the symmetric
Nash Bargaining Solution. Table 1 summarizes the potential payoffs for the workers and firms
in both the Choice and Forced treatments. One randomly selected round from each block is
  10
    For instance, workers enter negotiations 72% of the time when there is private knowledge and 69% of the time
when there is common knowledge. We fail to reject the equality of the entrance rates (p = 0.36) and the average
return from negotiations of $1.31 vs $1.23 conditional on negotiations (p = 0.74). More thorough investigation
via regression analyses further confirm the lack of significant differences.

       W indicates the payoff for the worker, and F indicates the payoff for the firm. In the Choice treatment, a
       worker may decide to accept the suggested wage and thus not enter a negotiation. The resulting payoffs are
       shown in the No Negotiation row. Alternatively, a worker may choose to reject the suggested wage and then
       enter a negotiation. Payoffs when an agreement is reached are shown in the Successful Negotiation row, while
       payoffs when an agreement in not reached are shown in the Failed Negotiation row. In the Forced treatment,
       workers must always enter negotiations so only these latter two payoffs are relevant.


Negotiations
    Negotiations occur as follows. Workers and firms have three minutes in which they can send
each other instant chat messages. They are not allowed to send a message that would identify
them in any way, such as their name, age or gender. While they can use the chat to discuss
different wages, no agreements can be implemented through the chat itself. Instead, official
wage proposals must be entered into a separate table. They can update their wage proposal at
any time by submitting a new wage proposal to the table. An agreement is reached only if a
participant explicitly accepts an opponent’s most recent wage proposal by clicking the “I accept
this offer” button.
Follow-up activities
    After participants complete both blocks of five rounds of negotiations, we elicit risk and fair-
ness measures over payoffs similar to those faced when workers may decide whether to negotiate.
First, to measure how participants respond to risk, they make a series of five binary choices be-
tween (1) $13 for certain and (2) a lottery of $18 with P % chance and $8 with (1 − P )% chance.
From the first to fifth choice, P increases in increments of 10 percentage points from 50% to 90%.
In each session, we randomly select one decision maker and implement one of their choices. Note
that the gambles mirror the potential risk a participant faces when choosing between accepting a
suggested wage of $13 or entering a negotiation. When entering such a negotiation, a participant
would receive $8 as a result of the $5 penalty if an agreement is not reached or $18 by instead
fully capturing $5 from the likely bargaining range of the suggested wage plus or minus $5.11
  11
     We chose $13 as it reflects a “middle” suggested wage that arises from a worker contribution of $15 and bonus
of -2. Also, while workers can reach agreements outside the range of their suggested wage plus or minus $5, doing
so requires the worker or firm to forgo a strictly dominant (financial) outcome of failing to reach an agreement


                                                          6
    Second, to elicit which allocations participants view as fair, they are asked to indicate what
they perceive as a fair wage in six scenarios that vary according to the worker’s contributions, the
firm’s contributions and the suggested wage.12 In each session, we randomly select one decision
maker and select one scenario. The decision maker’s fair wage for the selected scenario is then
implemented for an unrelated worker-firm pair. To encourage participants’ allocations to reflect
their own views on fairness and their expectations of others’ views on fairness, the worker-firm
pair award the decision-maker a bonus, from $0 to $10, according to how fair they view the
decision maker’s implemented fair wage.
    Finally, participants complete a short follow-up survey that collects demographic information
on their age, sex, graduation year, degree program, and stated GPA.

3     Data
    From May - October 2013, 292 undergraduate students participated in sixteen sessions at the
Stanford Economics Research Laboratory. The modal session achieved gender-balance. Across
sessions, the percentage of female participants ranged from 42% to 63%.13 From the two randomly
selected negotiation rounds (one from each block), any additional payments from the follow-up
activities and a $5 show-up fee, participants’ cash earnings ranged from $22 - $99 with an average
of $56. In the Forced treatment, there were 33 female workers, 31 male workers, 34 female firms
and 30 male firms. In the Choice treatment, there were 41 female workers, 41 male workers, 38
female firms, and 44 male firms. For each participant, we observe 10 rounds of negotiation data.
    These data allow us to determine if and when male and female workers choose to enter
negotiations and their returns from doing so. We compute returns as the wage the worker
receives minus their suggested wage. When workers choose not to enter negotiations in the
Choice treatment, their returns are thus zero. Conditional on negotiations, their returns depend
on whether they reach an agreement. In the event of a successful negotiation, the return is
negative, zero, or positive whenever the agreed upon wage falls below, equals, or exceeds the
suggested wage. In the event of a failed negotiation, the return is negative five dollars by design.
    Our data also allow us to examine how participants engage in free-form chat when they enter
negotiations. To assess the corresponding (anonymized) chat data, we hired three undergrad-
uate research assistants at an hourly rate to indicate for each round of negotiations whether
the firm and/or worker sent chat messages that could be classified as using aggression, compro-
mise, deference, entitlement, even-split arguments, fairness concepts, need-based appeals, and/or
and hence having the suggested wage with the $5 penalty implemented as the worker’s wage. Indeed, only 1% of
negotiations result in workers receiving an amount outside of this range.
  12
     The scenarios (worker contribution, firm contribution, suggested wage) are as follows: (10, 25, 10), (15, 25,
15), (20, 25, 20), (20, 25, 14), (20, 25, 16), and (20, 25, 22).
  13
     To achieve gender-balance as much as possible, we recruited two sets of participants for each session — one
set for males and another set for females — via Stanford’s online recruiting system Sona. Participants cannot
view studies that they are not eligible on Sona, which allows us to do this separate recruiting discretely.


                                                        7
norms.14 We consider an individual’s chat message to fall into one of the above categories for a
given round if two or more research assistants indicated the relevance of that category. We also
hired one research assistant to indicate how likely (from 0 to 100%) that a particular round of
(anonymized) chat messages was sent by a female. In addition to being paid an hourly rate, this
research assistant was paid a bonus according to the accuracy of 10 randomly selected guesses.15

4      Do Men and Women Differ in Negotiations?
    In our Forced treatment, when workers must always negotiate, they reach agreements 92%
of the time. This agreement rate holds constant across male and female workers and thus 8% of
resulting wages reflect the five-dollar penalty from failed negotiations. The other resulting wages
reflect significant heterogeneity: 30% of negotiations settle on wages equal to contributions, 20%
equal suggested wages, 7% involve an equal 50-50 split of the joint revenue, and nearly half of
negotiations settle on some other wage (note that the categories can overlap). A slight majority
of 51% of negotiations result in gains for the workers while only 29% result in losses. The
average return from negotiations for workers is $0.66, and as shown in the first two columns of
Table 2, this average does not significantly differ across male and female workers when clustering
standard errors at the participant-level and controlling for other factors, including the bonus
level involved in the suggested wage, the contribution levels of the worker and firm, and the
round of the negotiation.16
    Male and female workers appear to achieve these returns from negotiations in similar manners.
Both male and female workers make the first wage proposal about 50% of the time, and their
returns are positively correlated with doing so (see Appendix Table A.1).17 Male and female
workers also exhibit similar chat tendencies and experience similar returns from these tendencies
  14
      An overview of the provided definitions for these chat categories are as follows: aggressive - a participant
threatens to not reach an agreement or strongly questions their partner’s proposal; compromise - a participant
explicitly suggests they take into account their own preference and their partner’s preference; deferential - a
participant talks poorly of themselves or favorably of their partner, is apologetic, is uncertain, uses caveats, or
looks for assurance (particularly via the use of question marks); entitled - a participant advocates for higher
payment by saying they deserve it for some reason; even-split - a participant explicitly says they should split the
joint revenue equally; fair - a participant uses the word fair or a close synonym for fair; need-based - a participant
discusses their financial need for the money; norm - a participant discusses what they have received or how
payments have been determined in past rounds.
   15
      Specifically, the research assistant knew that for each of the selected guesses, we would randomly draw an
integer X from 1 to 100. If X is less than or equal to his percentage guess that the message was sent by a
female, he would receive $10 if the message was indeed sent by a female and $0 otherwise. If X is greater than
his percentage guess that the message was sent by a female, he would receive $10 with a X% chance and $0
otherwise.
   16
      It is also worth noting that neither the performance in the task nor the resulting contribution levels, in the
first or second block, differ across male and female workers.
   17
      In contrast to prior literature, women if anything ask for more. In looking at the Forced treatment and
including for the same set of controls as in Table 2, female workers are 5 percentage points more likely to send the
first wage proposal, and conditional on doing so, ask for $0.98 cents more than male workers. These differences
are not significant, however.

    Despite the gender similarities in the Forced treatment, gender differences emerge when work-
ers are presented with the opportunity to circumvent negotiations in the Choice treatment. As
shown in the third and fourth columns of Table 2, women enter negotiations significantly less
often than men — by an average of twelve percentage points when clustering standard errors at
the participant-level and controlling for other relevant factors of each negotiation.

        female workers and 41 male workers during the 10 rounds in the Choice treatment.


   While the gender difference in entry-rates aligns with the common refrain that women do not
negotiate enough, we directly test whether leaning-in is financially helpful for women in Section
5 and for men in Section 6. Mirroring our results in the Forced treatment, it is worth noting that
there are no significant gender differences in negotiation outcomes achieved by firms in either the
  18
    While there are no significant differences in chat tendencies, the research assistant nonetheless correctly
guessed, on average, a higher chance that a message is sent by a female worker if that indeed is the case (51%
versus 41% for female versus male workers). Additionally, one interesting difference emerges in returns from chat
tendencies: deferential or gender stereotypical female messages are predictive of higher returns for female but
not male workers (for a discussion of the effectiveness of negotiation communication strategies, see Bowles and
Babcock (2013)). Note that types of chat messages that occur less than 10% of the time are not included in
Appendix Table A.3, although doing so does not change the results.

Forced or Choice treatment (see Appendix Table A.4).19 Moreover, firms never face the decision
about whether to negotiate, so our investigation focuses on workers.

5     Women’s Negotiation Decisions and Outcomes
    In Section 5.1, we first restrict the analysis to the Choice treatment to assess when women
decide to enter negotiations and the returns from doing so. In Section 5.2, we examine how
the returns from negotiations change when women must instead always negotiate in the Forced
treatment. This comparison allows us to determine whether women would financially benefit
from leaning-in and negotiating more often. In the final Section 5.3, we consider additional
evidence on what may influence the negotiation-entry decisions, such as individual preferences
to negotiate, fairness concerns over outcomes, or individual risk attitudes.

5.1     When do women enter negotiations?
    Most women enter negotiations sometimes and opt-out of negotiations other times: out of the
41 female workers in the Choice treatment, only one woman never enters a negotiation and four
women enter all negotiations. Figure 1 shows that the decision to negotiate is strongly correlated
with the bonus. When the bonus is -4, so the suggested wage is four dollars less than the worker’s
contribution, women choose to negotiate 91% of the time. This high entry rate shows that, if it
is costly for women to negotiate, these costs are bounded. As the bonus increases to -2, 0, or 2,
entry into negotiation falls to 84%, 50%, and 36%, respectively.
    Table 3 reports descriptive statistics on the returns from negotiations. Although the average
return is always positive, it decreases as the bonus level increases and becomes statistically
indistinguishable from zero when the bonus is 2. Similar patterns emerge when looking at the
distribution of returns (whether they are positive, zero, or negative) and to a lesser extent the
rate of agreements reached.
    These two patterns together — that higher bonus levels correlate with lower returns to ne-
gotiations among negotiators and lower entry-rates of women into negotiations — suggest that
women are more likely to avoid negotiations when the financial gains from negotiating are more
limited. Given that women’s returns from negotiations are never significantly negative and are
significantly positive for all bonuses except at 2, a naive conclusion would be that leaning-in is fi-
nancially helpful. Leaning-in may be less financially helpful or even harmful if women’s decisions
to negotiate are positively correlated with their returns from doing so. In the next section, we
   19
      In addition, prior literature — see for instance Andersen et al. (2013) and Dittrich, Knabe and Leipold (2014)
— suggests that this lack of gender differences among firms may be more expected than the lack of differences
among workers; gender differences are often more likely among parties with lower (appearing) bargaining power.
The gender of the firm, even when conditioning on the gender of the worker, also does not influence the returns
from negotiations for the workers. Although sex-pairings often influence negotiations (Eckel and Grossman, 2001;
Solnick, 2001; Bowles, Babcock and Lai, 2007; Hernandez-Arenaz and Iriberri, 2016), our lack of an observed
difference may result from the more limited information on gender, as the workers and firms are not allowed to
share identifiable information.

5.2    Do women gain from leaning-in?
   Recall the naive prediction: since women never significantly lose and often significantly gain
from entering negotiations at the various bonus levels, leaning-in may be seen as financially
helpful. In displaying the distribution of returns from negotiations in both the Choice and
Forced treatments, Figure 2 shows this is not the case (as does a comparison of Tables 3 and 4).
   Looking first at the Choice treatment in Figure 2, note that the 42% of cases with zero
returns are largely driven by women opting-out of negotiations as women accept their suggested

                                                                       11
wage 34% of the time. In moving from the Choice to Forced treatment, the frequency of zero
returns falls from 42% to 18%. This change, however, does not produce any new positive returns.
Instead, forcing women to negotiate causes the frequency of negative returns, or losses relative to
their suggested wage, to more than triple from 9% to 33%. While one-third of these additional
losses is attributed to the 8 percentage point increase in small losses of -$1, two-thirds of these
additional losses are accounted for by the 16 percentage point increase in large losses that fall
below -$1.20

    Although participants could have achieved non-integer returns, this never occurred. Losses and gains are
thus broken down into small amounts (equal to +/- $1) and large amounts (less than -$1 or greater then +$1).

    While Figure 2 pools across all bonus levels, Figure 3 replicates Figure 2 for each bonus
level separately. Evidence of women positively selecting into negotiations is strongest precisely
in situations where women are most likely to select out of negotiations — when the bonus is
non-negative (at bonuses of 0 and 2).

   This graph shows how often participants’ returns (defined as their final wage - suggested wage) are less than
   -1, equal to -1, equal to 0, equal to 1, or greater than 1 according to the bonus level. Data include the 41
   female workers during the 10 rounds in the Choice treatment, and the 33 female workers during the 10 rounds
   in the Forced treatment.



    Table 5 confirms these findings, both when controlling for bonus levels as well as additional
factors related to the negotiation environment. The first two columns present the results pooling
across bonus levels: forcing women to always negotiate leads to a significant reduction in average
returns of about $0.64. The middle two columns show that this is not driven by negotiations with
negative bonuses, as the reduction in average returns is only $0.37 and insignificant. The final
two columns confirm that evidence for positive selection is indeed the strongest at non-negative
bonuses: forcing women to negotiate in these instances causes returns to significantly decrease
by more than $1.
    In other words, the financial impact of leaning-in depends on the bonus level. When condi-
tions appear generally favorable towards negotiation returns (i.e., at negative bonuses), leaning-
in would be neither financially helpful nor harmful. There is only weak evidence for positive

                                                                  13
selection. When conditions appear generally unfavorably towards negotiation returns (i.e., at
non-negative bonuses), leaning-in would be financially harmful. There is significant evidence for
positive selection into negotiations: by opting out of negotiations, women are avoiding substantial
financial losses. That is, women know when to ask.
    Before turning to additional correlates with this observed selection in the next section, we
make two observations. First, since the observed positive selection is sensitive to the bonus
level, our findings are unlikely to reflect a “Forced” treatment effect per se, in which case losses
would also be expected at non-negative bonuses.21 Second, the increased losses in the Forced
treatment relative to the Choice treatment are not driven by failed agreements. Instead, they
arise from women agreeing to final wages that are lower than their suggested wages. Of the 89%
of negotiations that lead to agreements in the Choice treatment, only 3% lead to losses. Of the
92% of negotiations that lead to agreements in the Forced treatment, 26% lead to losses.

       “Forced” is an indicator for the Forced treatment. “b = i” is an indicator for a bonus of i. Controls
       include the negotiation round (from 1 to 10), the worker’s contribution, the difference between the worker’s
       and firm’s contributions, an indicator for whether the firm’s contribution is known, and the interaction
       between these last two variables. Data include the 66% of observations that involve negotiations from the
       41 women during the 10 rounds of the Choice treatment (n=271) and the 100% of observations that involve
       negotiations from the 33 women during the 10 rounds of the Forced treatment (n=330).


  21
     An example of one such concern that is not supported is the possibility that different returns to negotiations
arise from firms viewing workers who choose to enter negotiations differently than those who are forced to
negotiate. Another piece of evidence that counters the possibility of a “Forced” effect per se is the lack of
observed treatment effects among men, as shown in Section 6.


                                                         14
5.3     Are there correlates with the selection of women into negotia-
        tions?
    The previous section documents that the overall selection of women into negotiations is
positively correlated with higher returns from negotiations. This section examines whether there
are any traits that correlate with the positive selection.
    As an initial trait, we consider a measure of negotiation ability. Let “negotiation ability” be
the average returns from negotiations when the suggested wage has a bonus of -4.22 Consistent
with selection, negotiation ability predicts negotiation entry in the Choice treatment: the first
two columns of Table 6 confirm that women with higher negotiation ability are more likely to
enter negotiations at non-negative bonuses. As a validation of our ability measure, we find that
it also predicts returns to negotiation in the Forced treatment: Appendix Table A.6 confirms
that a one-dollar increase in the negotiation-ability measure corresponds to a significant increase
in average returns of $0.20 with non-negative bonuses.23
    Second, we consider a measure of individual risk aversion. Our risk measure equals how often
a participant chooses the certain amount of $13 over five lotteries between $8 and $18.24 Our
risk measure does not significantly correlate with negotiation entry at non-negative bonuses (see
Table 6).25
    Third, we consider a measure of individuals’ fairness preferences. Our fairness measure equals
how often a participant sets the “fair” wage in six scenarios equal to the worker’s contribution.26
Our fairness measure does not significantly correlate with negotiation entry at non-negative
bonuses (see Table 6).27
  22
      In constructing an ability measure, a key constraint arises from women not always facing nor choosing to enter
negotiations at the various bonus levels. This constraint is least binding when entrance rates into negotiations
are the highest. Thus, by constructing our ability measure as the average returns from negotiations with a bonus
of -4, we can consider 94% of entrance decisions involving non-negative bonuses.
   23
      An OLS regression of returns from negotiations with non-negative bonuses on the average return from nego-
tiations with a bonus of -4 on the 162 negotiations yields a coefficient of $0.20 with a p-value less than 0.05 and
standard error of 0.09. Because of selection, we cannot do a similar analysis in the Choice treatment.
   24
      Recall that at the end of the experiment, participants make five binary decision between (1) $13 for certain
and (2) a lottery of $18 with P % chance and $8 with (1 − P )% chance, where P is 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or
90%. Workers in the Choice and Forced treatments choose $13 for certain an average of 2 times, which translates
to choosing the lottery of $18 with P % chance once P is approximately 70%. There are no significant gender
differences in the risk task, and only 3 workers have multiple switch points.
   25
      This holds even when we control for negotiation ability (see Appendix Table A.5). Also, in the Forced
treatment, the risk measure does not significantly correlate with negotiation outcomes at non-negative bonuses
(see Appendix Table A.6).
   26
      Recall that at the end of the experiment, participants are asked to indicate a fair wage in six scenarios
that involve different worker contributions, firm contributions, and suggested wages. One selected decision is
implemented for a worker-firm pair, who in return award the selected decision-maker bonuses from $0 to $10
according to how fair they view the decision maker’s allocation. Workers in the Choice and Forced treatments
select fair wages equal to the worker’s contribution on average 2-3 times, and there are no significant gender
differences.
   27
      The negative coefficient, while not significant, does align with the possibility that individuals with stronger
fairness concerns are less likely to enter negotiations when their suggested wage is equal to or greater than


                                                         15
    Finally, we consider the recorded chat messages. Recall that participants’ chat messages are
coded according to eight different categories. Three chat categories — appealing to a compromise,
need-based argument, or norm — occur less than 5% of the time and hence will not be discussed.
For the remaining five chat categories, we construct our measure of chat tendencies as the fraction
of times each woman’s chat messages are coded as aggressive, deferential, entitled, requesting an
equal-split, or appealing to fairness considerations, again when only considering negotiations that
women enter when faced with a bonus of -4. While women are less likely to enter negotiations if
they exhibit a tendency towards aggressive chat messages or entitled chat messages, the remaining
chat tendencies are not predictive (see Table 6).28




their “fair share.” Indeed, when controlling for negotiation ability, this relationship is marginally significant in
one specification (see Appendix Table A.5). Evidence from the Forced treatment — in particular, that the
fairness measure has a negative and significant correlation with negotiation outcomes at non-negative bonuses
(see Appendix Table A.6) — is further consistent with individuals with stronger fairness concerns achieving lower
returns from negotiations when their suggested wage is already equal to or greater than their “fair share.”
   28
      This result holds even when we control for negotiation ability (see Appendix Table A.5). Also, in the Forced
treatment, no chat tendencies, not even being entitled, are significantly correlated with negotiation outcomes at
non-negative bonuses (see Appendix Table A.6).

   how many times an individual chooses the certain amount over the lotteries in the five scenarios in the risk
   task of the follow-up survey. “X chat” is the fraction of an individual’s negotiations involving a bonus of -4
   that are coded as the chat-type X. “b = 2” is an indicator for a bonus of 2. Controls include the negotiation
   round (from 1 to 10), the worker’s contribution, an indicator for whether the firm’s contribution is known, and
   the difference between the worker’s and firm’s contributions if the firm’s contribution is known. Data in the

   that involve female workers who entered at least one negotiation with a bonus of -4, as this is a requirement for
   the ability measure and chat tendency measures considered in these columns.

6     Men’s Negotiation Decisions and Outcomes
   The analysis for men mirrors that of women. In Section 6.1, we observe when men decide to
enter negotiations in the Choice treatment and corresponding returns. In Section 6.2, we examine
how the returns from negotiations change when men must negotiate in the Forced treatment. In
Section 6.3, we explore additional factors that may correlate with negotiation entry decisions.

6.1     When do men enter negotiations?
    While men enter negotiations 12 percentage points more often than women (see Table 2),
their overall pattern of entry decisions appear similar. Out of the 41 male workers in the Choice
treatment, all men enter at least one negotiation and only 7 of them never opt-out of any
negotiation. As shown in Figure 4, these decisions are strongly correlated with the bonus. While
men almost always enter negotiations with negative bonuses, this entry rate falls to 67% and
42% when the bonus is 0 or 2.
    Table 7 shows that men’s returns from negotiations also decrease as the bonus level increases.
The average return is nonetheless significantly positive at the bonuses of -4, -2 and 0, and not
statistically different from zero at a bonus of 2. With returns from negotiations generally being
positive, the naive conclusion would be that leaning-in would be financially helpful. However,
note that for two out of the three bonuses where the gains are significantly positive, men are al-
ready entering negotiations nearly all of the time. Additional gains from leaning-in may therefore
be limited. In the next section, we directly address whether men benefit from leaning-in.

         Data include the 74% of observations that involve negotiations from the 41 male workers during
         the 10 rounds of the Choice treatment.


6.2    Do men gain from leaning-in?
    Figure 5 displays the distribution of returns for men in the Choice and Forced treatment.
Looking first at the Choice treatment, note that the 33% of cases with zero returns is largely
driven by men opting-out of negotiations and hence accepting their suggested wage 26% of the
time. In moving from the Choice to the Forced treatment, the frequency of zero returns falls
from 33% to 21%. Overall, forcing men to negotiate does not substantially shift the distribution
with the exception of small losses increasing from 0% to 9%.
    The potential noise from pooling across bonus levels could obscure evidence for selection.
Comparing the distribution of returns separately by each bonus level provides some support for
this possibility (see Appendix Figure A.1). While there are no noticeable shifts in the distri-
butions of returns at negative bonuses, there is some evidence of men positively selecting into
negotiations at non-negative bonuses (although the data are noisy at the bonus of 0 in partic-
ular). In line with this limited evidence, Table 9 shows that forcing men to negotiate does not
lead to significantly higher returns overall, at negative bonuses, or at non-negative bonuses.
    In other words, despite men selecting out more often when conditions appear less favorable, we
do not observe significant evidence of men positively selecting into negotiations at any bonus level.
The next section, which considers correlates of men’s negotiation-entry decisions, is suggestive
of an alternative explanation.

       “Forced” is an indicator for the Forced treatment. “b = i” is an indicator for a bonus of i. Controls
       include the negotiation round (from 1 to 10), the worker’s contribution, the difference between the worker’s
       and firm’s contributions, an indicator for whether the firm’s contribution is known, and the interaction
       between these last two variables. Data include the 74% of observations that involve negotiations from the
       41 men during the 10 rounds of the Choice treatment (n=305) and the 100% of observations that involve
       negotiations from the 31 men during the 10 rounds of the Forced treatment (n=310).


6.3        Are there correlates with the selection of men into negotiations?
    As an initial trait, we again consider our measure of negotiation ability (i.e., the average
returns from negotiations with a bonus of -4). Consistent with the lack of significant evidence for
men positively selecting into negotiations at any bonus, our measure of negotiation ability does
not predict their choice to negotiate. The first two columns of Table 10 show that men with higher
negotiation ability are not more likely to enter negotiations at non-negative bonuses. It is worth
noting, however, that our negotiation-ability measure among men is in general less informative.
Appendix Table A.8 shows that in the Forced treatment our negotiation ability measure is not
significantly correlated with returns from negotiations with non-negative bonuses. This suggests
that men’s relative ability to achieve higher returns from negotiations may be bonus-dependent.
    Second, our risk measure (i.e., count of how often a participant chooses the certain amount
of $13 over five lotteries between $8 and $18) does not significantly correlate with negotiation
entry at non-negative bonuses (see Table 10).29
  29
    This result holds when we control for negotiation ability (see Appendix Table A.7). Also, in the Forced
treatment, the risk measure does not significantly correlate with negotiation outcomes at non-negative bonuses


                                                         21
    Third, and notably, our fairness measure significantly correlates with the selection of men into
negotiations. Table 10 shows that men with a stronger tendency to set the fair wage equal to a
worker’s contribution are less likely to enter negotiations when they can instead accept suggested
wages that are equal to or exceed their contributions, i.e., at non-negative bonuses.30 Consistent
with the lack of significant positive selection among men at any bonus, the fairness measure does
not significantly correlate in the Forced treatment with negotiation outcomes at non-negative
bonuses (see Appendix Table A.8). In the spirit of Andreoni and Vesterlund (2001), it appears
that men shade their perception of fairness when it becomes sufficiently costly to carry through
on that perception. Men who see it as fair to receive one’s contribution will avoid negotiations
when allocated more than their fair share.
    Finally, the five most common chat messages are largely uncorrelated with negotiation entry
at non-negative bonuses (see Table 10). The only robust exception: men are more likely to enter
negotiations if they exhibit a tendency towards deferential chat messages.31




(see Appendix Table A.8).
  30
     This result largely holds even when we control for negotiation ability (see Appendix Table A.7).
  31
     This result holds even when we control for negotiation ability (see Appendix Table A.7). Also, in the Forced
treatment, no chat tendencies are significantly correlated with negotiation outcomes at non-negative bonuses (see
Appendix Table A.8).

7       Conclusion
    Results related to gender differences in the negotiation literature fall into one of two strands.
The first strand investigates what characteristics of the environment influence negotiation out-
comes by abstracting away from the decision to enter negotiations and instead forcing everyone
into negotiations. The second strand investigates whether there are gender differences in the
negotiation-entry decisions, and often, the outcomes conditional on entering negotiations.


                                                        23
    This paper distinguishes itself by answering whether women would financially benefit from
leaning-in. To answer this question, it is crucial to observe how outcomes differ when women
can and cannot select into negotiations in otherwise similar environments. A comparison of the
counterfactual across our Choice (of negotiation) treatment and a Forced (negotiation) treatment
allows for exactly this.
    When men and women must always negotiate in the Forced treatment, they achieve similar
returns to negotiations. While both men and women choose to avoid some negotiations in the
Choice treatment, women are significantly more likely to opt-out of negotiations. This seems to
support the possibility that encouraging women to lean-in would be helpful. We find the opposite
to be true.
    When women can choose whether to negotiate, they largely realize positive returns from
doing so. When women are forced to always negotiate, they realize significantly lower returns.
Put starkly, women enter negotiations that result in financial gains and often avoid negotiations
that would result in financial losses. Regardless of whether the avoidance is driven by proper
expectations, a distaste for negotiations, or contextual features, leaning-in is financially harmful
for women in our setting.
    By contrast, forcing men to lean-in is neither harmful nor helpful in terms of their overall
returns. An alternative driver of their selection may involve fairness concerns; men are less likely
to enter negotiations when they believe receiving their contributions is fair and their outside
options equal to or exceed this believed fair level.
    Leaning-in may not always be harmful for women. Our design purposefully eliminates several
factors that may drive gender differences in outcomes. For instance, participants always know
their individual contributions and whether their outside options would shortchange them. Such a
benchmark may not be available in many negotiation settings; women may shy away from finan-
cially beneficial negotiations if they undervalue what they bring to the table. While encouraging
women to lean-in may be helpful in this case, our results leave room for an alternative policy
intervention: teach women what they bring to the table.32 We leave the consideration of such
policy interventions and more nuanced negotiation situations to further research. As we examine
the returns to changes in individual behavior, it may also be beneficial to collectively consider
different ways in which one can “lean-in.”33




  32
     If a similar selection of women occurs in such cases as that observed in our study, women would then be
expected to enter negotiations that result in financial gains while avoiding those that result in financial losses.
  33
     For instance, women may financially benefit from leaning-in by entering competitions more (Niederle and
Vesterlund, 2007, 2011), guessing more (Baldiga, 2014), or contributing their ideas more (Coffman, 2014).

    “Proposed the first wage” is an indicator for proposing the first page. “Amount of first proposed wage”
    equals the amount that is proposed as a first wage. Bonus FE includes indicators for the bonus level.
    Controls include the negotiation round (from 1 to 10), the worker’s contribution, the difference between
    the worker’s and firm’s contributions, an indicator for whether the firm’s contribution is known, and the
    interaction between these last two variables. Data include the observations from the 33 female workers and
    31 male workers during the 10 rounds in the Forced treatment. In the second or fourth column, the data
    are restricted to observations where the female worker sends the first wage proposal (in 53% of the 330
    negotiations) or the male worker sends the first wage proposal (in 48% of the 310 negotiations), respectively.

   measure” is an individual’s average return from negotiations involving a bonus of -4. “fairness measure” is a count
   of how many times an individual chooses the fair wage to be equal to their contribution out of the six scenarios
   in the fairness task of the follow-up survey. “risk aversion measure” is a count of how many times an individual
   chooses the certain amount over the lotteries in the five scenarios in the risk task of the follow-up survey. “X chat
   tendency” is the fraction of an individual’s negotiations involving a bonus of -4 that are coded as the chat-type
   X. “b = 2” is an indicator for a bonus of 2. Controls include the negotiation round (from 1 to 10), the worker’s
   contribution, the difference between the worker’s and firm’s contributions, an indicator for whether the firm’s
   contribution is known, and the interaction between these last two variables. Data include the 152 observations
   that involve non-negative bonuses for male workers in the Forced treatment.

      This is an experiment on decision-making. The earnings you receive today will depend on the decisions
      and performance made by you and by other participants in this room. Please turn off your cell phones.
      If you have a question, please raise your hand and an experimenter will come to answer you in private.

      Worker-Firm Pairs
      Half of you will be assigned the role of a Worker and the other half will be assigned the role of a Firm.
      You will maintain your role throughout the experiment.

      The experiment consists of two blocks: Block A and B. Each block lasts for 5 rounds (for a total of 10
      rounds). At the beginning of each round, each worker and each firm is randomly paired with someone
      of the opposite role to form worker-firm pairs. You will not know the identity of the person you are
      paired with nor will he/she know your identity. Worker-firm pairs are randomly generated at the
      beginning of each round. Thus you are unlikely to be paired with the same person two rounds in a row.

      Revenue
      The worker-firm pair will have a revenue, which they must split between a wage for the worker and a
      profit for the firm. The revenue is the sum of a worker-contribution and a firm-contribution. The
      worker-contribution and firm-contribution result from initial performances by the worker and firm. The
      firm and the worker perform the same task. Performance is measured at the start of each block where
      you each have 5-minutes to complete a task. Your performance at the start of a block determines your
      contribution for the duration of the block. Since you may be in different worker-firm pairs across
      rounds, the contribution by the person you are paired with may change between rounds. The worker
      will know the firm-contribution, and the firm will know the worker-contribution.

      Contributions
      Individual contributions are held constant for the duration of a block and are determined by comparing
      the individual’s performance to those of others in the same role. Individuals with a higher relative
      performance secure a greater contribution. For each firm the firm-contribution is determined by
      comparing the firm’s performance to that of one other randomly selected firm. For each worker the
      worker-contribution is determined by comparing the worker’s performance to those of two other
      randomly selected workers. The comparison group is randomly determined at the beginning of each
      new block.

             The firm-contribution depends on how the firm’s performance in the task compares to that of a
             randomly selected other firm in that block. The firm-contribution is:
                           $25 if the firm’s performance is ranked first
                           $20 if the firm’s performance is ranked second

             The worker contribution depends on how the worker’s performance compares to those of two
             randomly selected workers in that block. The worker-contribution is
                           $20 if the worker’s performance is ranked first
                           $15 if the worker’s performance is ranked second
                           $10 if the worker’s performance is ranked third

Wage determination
In each round, the revenue is the sum of the worker-contribution and the firm-contribution. Together,
the worker and firm have to determine what portion of the revenue will be spent on the worker’s wage
and what remaining revenue will be paid to the firm as profit.

The wage is determined as follows. The computer first generates a suggested wage S. Then, the worker
and the firm will have 3 minutes to reach an agreement on a wage. If the worker and firm reach an
agreement, the worker receives the agreed upon wage. We refer to the agreed upon wage as W. If the
worker and the firm do not reach an agreement within 3 minutes, the suggested wage is implemented
and the firm and worker each pay a $5 penalty for not reaching an agreement in time. In other words:

        Negotiate and don't agree                                   Negotiate and agree
         Worker's wage = S – 5                                       Worker's wage = W
      Firm's profit = revenue – S – 5                             Firm's profit = revenue – W

Negotiating
Negotiations take place using a negotiation screen. Samples of the negotiation screens for the worker
and firm are shown on the next page. The top of the screen provides you with relevant information
regarding the negotiation. The middle of the screen allows you to propose a wage. The bottom right of
the screen keeps a history of wage offers, and allows you to accept offers made by the person you are
paired with. The bottom left side of the screen allows you to chat with one another.

Negotiation Information
The top right corner of the screen reports how many seconds of the negotiation remains. If no
agreement is reached at the end of the 3 minutes, the suggested wage is implemented with a $5 penalty
for the worker and a $5 penalty for the firm.

The top line reminds you of your role (worker or firm), your contribution, and the block and round you
are in. The box below that reviews how contributions are determined. The bold section reports the total
revenue and the suggested wage. The revenue is the sum of the worker-contribution and firm-
contribution. Finally, there is a reminder of the payoffs that result in the event that no agreement or an
agreement is reached.

Wage proposal and acceptance
The middle of the screen contains a field where you can propose a wage. To propose a wage you type
a number in the text box under “I propose the following worker's wage” and click OK. A history of
proposed wages is listed on the bottom right of the screen. Once you propose a wage, it appears on
your screen and on the screen of the person you are paired with. While past wage offers are still visible,
only the most recently proposed wages are valid. The person you are paired with may accept your most
recently proposed wage by clicking on the line with that wage to highlight it and then click the “I
Accept this W” button. Likewise you may accept their most recently proposed wage offer by clicking
on the line with that wage to highlight it and then click the “I Accept this W” button. Wage proposals
accepted by the other person become the agreed upon wage and are implemented. The round ends
when a wage offer is accepted. In the sample screens we blackened out all the proposed wages.

Wage proposals can be revised and accepted at any moment before the end of the three minutes. If no
wage offers are accepted within three minutes, the suggested wage, S, is implemented with an
individual $5 penalty

Chat
Workers and firms may chat via the chat box in the bottom left side of the screen. In the sample
screen, the chat box displays the sent messages from the worker who said “I am a worker”, and the firm
who said “I am a firm.” To enter messages like these type in the chat text box below the chat box. Note
that the worker and firm have currently typed “this is my second message as a worker/firm that I have
not yet sent.” To send a chat message, push ENTER on your keyboard.

When chatting, you should not share any information that identifies (or helps to identify) who you are.
That is, you should not share your name, age, gender, location in the lab, etc. If we discover that you
have shared any such information, then you will not receive any earnings from the experiment.

Payments
The experiment consists of two blocks of five rounds of negotiation. At the end of the experiment we
will randomly select one negotiation round of each block to count for payment. Your payment for
participating in the experiment will be the sum of your earnings from these two randomly selected
rounds, payments from a few subsequent decisions, and $5 for showing up for today’s experiment.

Final Notes
Throughout the experiment, please push OK on the computer screen to continue or to submit answers.
When you are waiting for the experiment to continue, please quietly wait at your seat and refrain from
using any electronic devices or partaking in any other activity. If you ever have a question, please raise
your hand. Thank you for your participation and cooperation!

This is an experiment on decision-making. The earnings you receive today will depend on the decisions
and performance made by you and by other participants in this room. Please turn off your cell phones.
If you have a question, please raise your hand and an experimenter will come to answer you in private.

Worker-Firm Pairs
Half of you will be assigned the role of a Worker and the other half will be assigned the role of a Firm.
You will maintain your role throughout the experiment.

The experiment consists of two blocks: Block A and B. Each block lasts for 5 rounds (for a total of 10
rounds). At the beginning of each round, each worker and each firm is randomly paired with someone
of the opposite role to form worker-firm pairs. You will not know the identity of the person you are
paired with nor will he/she know your identity. Worker-firm pairs are randomly generated at the
beginning of each round. Thus you are unlikely to be paired with the same person two rounds in a row.

Revenue
The worker-firm pair will have a revenue, which they must split between a wage for the worker and a
profit for the firm. The revenue is the sum of a worker-contribution and a firm-contribution. The
worker-contribution and firm-contribution result from initial performances by the worker and firm. The
firm and the worker perform the same task. Performance is measured at the start of each block where
you each have 5-minutes to complete a task. Your performance at the start of a block determines your
contribution for the duration of the block. Since you may be in different worker-firm pairs across
rounds, the contribution by the person you are paired with may change between rounds. The worker
will know the firm-contribution, and the firm will know the worker-contribution.

Contributions
Individual contributions are held constant for the duration of a block and are determined by comparing
the individual’s performance to those of others in the same role. Individuals with a higher relative
performance secure a greater contribution. For each firm the firm-contribution is determined by
comparing the firm’s performance to that of one other randomly selected firm. For each worker the
worker-contribution is determined by comparing the worker’s performance to those of two other
randomly selected workers. The comparison group is randomly determined at the beginning of each
new block.

       The firm-contribution depends on how the firm’s performance in the task compares to that of a
       randomly selected other firm in that block. The firm-contribution is:
                     $25 if the firm’s performance is ranked first
                     $20 if the firm’s performance is ranked second

       The worker contribution depends on how the worker’s performance compares to those of two
       randomly selected workers in that block. The worker-contribution is
                     $20 if the worker’s performance is ranked first
                     $15 if the worker’s performance is ranked second
                     $10 if the worker’s performance is ranked third

Wage determination
In each round, the revenue is the sum of the worker-contribution and the firm-contribution. Together,
the worker and firm have to determine what portion of the revenue will be spent on the worker’s wage
and what remaining revenue will be paid to the firm as profit.

The wage is determined as follows. The computer first generates a suggested wage S. The worker may
accept or reject the suggested wage S. If the worker rejects the suggested wage S, then the worker and
the firm will have 3 minutes to reach an agreement on a wage. If the worker and firm reach an
agreement, the worker receives the agreed upon wage. We refer to the agreed upon wage as W. If the
worker and the firm do not reach an agreement within 3 minutes, the suggested wage is implemented
and the firm and worker each pay a $5 penalty for not reaching an agreement in time. In other words:

        Negotiate and don't agree                                   Negotiate and agree
         Worker's wage = S – 5                                       Worker's wage = W
      Firm's profit = revenue – S – 5                             Firm's profit = revenue – W


                                     Don't Negotiate and accept S
                                          Worker's wage = S
                                      Firm's profit = revenue - S



Negotiating
Negotiations take place using a negotiation screen. Samples of the negotiation screens for the worker
and firm are shown on the next page. The top of the screen provides you with relevant information
regarding the negotiation. The middle of the screen allows you to propose a wage. The bottom right of
the screen keeps a history of wage offers, and allows you to accept offers made by the person you are
paired with. The bottom left side of the screen allows you to chat with one another.

Negotiation Information
The top right corner of the screen reports how many seconds of the negotiation remains. If no
agreement is reached at the end of the 3 minutes, the suggested wage is implemented with a $5 penalty
for the worker and a $5 penalty for the firm.

The top line reminds you of your role (worker or firm), your contribution, and the block and round you
are in. The box below that reviews how contributions are determined. The bold section reports the total
revenue and the suggested wage. The revenue is the sum of the worker-contribution and firm-
contribution. Finally, there is a reminder of the payoffs that result in the event that no agreement or an
agreement is reached.

Wage proposal and acceptance
The middle of the screen contains a field where you can propose a wage. To propose a wage you type
a number in the text box under “I propose the following worker's wage” and click OK. A history of
proposed wages is listed on the bottom right of the screen. Once you propose a wage, it appears on
your screen and on the screen of the person you are paired with. While past wage offers are still visible,
only the most recently proposed wages are valid. The person you are paired with may accept your most
recently proposed wage by clicking on the line with that wage to highlight it and then click the “I
                                                    2

Accept this W” button. Likewise you may accept their most recently proposed wage offer by clicking
on the line with that wage to highlight it and then click the “I Accept this W” button. Wage proposals
accepted by the other person become the agreed upon wage and are implemented. The round ends
when a wage offer is accepted. In the sample screens we blackened out all the proposed wages.

Wage proposals can be revised and accepted at any moment before the end of the three minutes. If no
wage offers are accepted within three minutes, the suggested wage, S, is implemented with an
individual $5 penalty

Chat
Workers and firms may chat via the chat box in the bottom left side of the screen. In the sample
screen, the chat box displays the sent messages from the worker who said “I am a worker”, and the firm
who said “I am a firm.” To enter messages like these type in the chat text box below the chat box. Note
that the worker and firm have currently typed “this is my second message as a worker/firm that I have
not yet sent.” To send a chat message, push ENTER on your keyboard.

When chatting, you should not share any information that identifies (or helps to identify) who you are.
That is, you should not share your name, age, gender, location in the lab, etc. If we discover that you
have shared any such information, then you will not receive any earnings from the experiment.


Payments
The experiment consists of two blocks of five rounds of negotiation. At the end of the experiment we
will randomly select one negotiation round of each block to count for payment. Your payment for
participating in the experiment will be the sum of your earnings from these two randomly selected
rounds, payments from a few subsequent decisions, and $5 for showing up for today’s experiment.


Final Notes
Throughout the experiment, please push OK on the computer screen to continue or to submit answers.
When you are waiting for the experiment to continue, please quietly wait at your seat and refrain from
using any electronic devices or partaking in any other activity. If you ever have a question, please raise
your hand. Thank you for your participation and cooperation!
