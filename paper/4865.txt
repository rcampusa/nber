       We survey the empirical literature on floating nominal exchange rates over the past

decade. Exchange rates are difficult to forecast at short- to medium-term horizons. There is a

bit of explanatory power to monetary models such as the Dornbusch "overshooting" theory, in

the form of reaction to "news" and in forecasts at long-mn horizons. Nevertheless, at short

horizons, a driftless random walk characterizes exchange rates better than standard models based

on observable macroeconomic fundamentals. Unexplained large shocks to floating rates must

then, logically, be due either to innovations in unobservable fundamentals, or to non-fundamental

factors such as speculative bubbles.        The observed difference in exchange rate and
macroeconomic volatility under different nominal exchange rate regimes makes us skeptical of

the first view. The theory and evidence on speculative bubbles, however, is not conclusive. We

conclude with the hope that promising new studies of the microstructure of the foreign exchange

market might eventually rise to insights into these phenomena.

      This paper is intended to be a selective critical survey and interpretation of
recent exchange rate research. We focus on empirical results for exchange rates
among major industrialized countries.
      In the decade since the publication of the first two volumes of The Handbook of
International Economics, there have been three main strands of empirical research in
international finance. The first and largest has been concerned with the determination
of floating exchange rates; the second has addressed the issue of the efficiency of
foreign exchange market efficiency and uncovered interest parity; the most recent has
dealt with the characteristics of explicitly managed exchanged rates. In this chapter, we
review the first topic. (The second and third chapters are covered in this Handbook in
the chapters by Lewis, and Garber and Svensson, respectively.) We begin by surveying
the work on exchange rate determination in floating rate regimes, and then consider
evidence across exchange rate regimes. After a brief examination of the issue of
speculative bubbles, our chapter finishes with a discussion of some relatively new
directions in exchange rate research that focus on the micro-structure of foreign
exchange markets.


I, Floating Exchange Rates


      l.A. OveMew


      Most of the large industrialized economies floated their exchange rate in early
1973, after the demise of the post-war Bretton Woods system of fled exchange rates.
While there had been extensive academic disputes on the relative merits of fixed and
floating exchange rates, this discussion had been carried on at a largely hypothetical
                                            2

level (and is analyzed in the chapter by Garber and Svensson). The generalized
floating regime provided economists with the empirical data set required to resolve
such academic disputes, as well as raising more immediate policy issues. Much of the
international finance literature produced in the decade after the move to generalized
floating focused on the development and estimation of empirical models of floating
exchange rates.
     By the early 1980s however, some early apparent empirical successes in the
literature had been overturned and key empirical findings began to turn negative, a
state of affairs that continues through the present day. The most profound negative
result was produced by Meese and Rogoff (1983a, b), who compared the predictive
abilities of a variety of exchange rate models. Their key result was that no existing
structural exchange rate model could reliably out-predict the naive alternative of a
random walk at short- and medium-run horizons, even when aided by actual future
values of the regressors. This extremely negative finding has never been entirely
convincingly over-turned despite many attempts. The simple random walk model of
the exchange rate has become the standard benchmark for empirical exchange rate
performance, no matter how uninteresting it is per Se. (Indeed a number of researchers
have professed to view the random walk "model" as being intrinsically interesting.)
      Many of the most important empirical regularities remain what they were 15
years ago. Mussa (1979) made the following points, among others: 1) the log of the
spot rate is approximately a random walk; 2) most changes in exchange rates are
unexpected; 3) countries with high inflation rates tend to depreciate, and at
approximately the inflation differential in the long run; and (4) actual exchange rate
movements appear to overshoot movements in smoothly adjusting equilibrium exchange
rates. The recent literature on floating rates is quite consistent with these propositions.
                                             3

        Nevertheless, some progress has been made. Above and beyond the issue of the
 determination and prediction of floating exchange rates, there have been a number of
 smaller streams of research in the area. One looks across exchange rate regimes;
 another focuses on survey evidence of exchange rate expectations; a third promising
 new area is the microeconomic modelling of foreign exchange markets. One of our
objectives in this chapter is to provide a road map to these areas; we survey each in
turn.
        There are already a number of existing surveys. MacDonald (1990) and
MacDonald and Taylor (1989, 1992, l993b) offer particularly comprehensive reviews of
the literature, focussing primarily on exchange rate determination and prediction.
More selective perspectives are offered by Dornbusch (1987), Boughton (1988), Kenen
(1988), Mussa (1989), Meese (1990), and Krugman (1993).


        l,B. Models with Fundamentals


             I.B.1, Empirical Equations of Exchange Rate Determination
        The standard workhorse of international finance is the monetary model of the
exchange rate. The model starts with the reasonable statement that, as the exchange
rate is the relative price of foreign and domestic money, it should be determined by the
relative supply and demand for these moneys. The typical model stems from three
equations. The first is money-market equilibrium:


                 p1 = y1 - ai1 +                                            (1)


where: m1 denotes the stock of money at time t; p denotes the price level; y denotes
real income (all three in natural logarithm form); i denotes the nominal interest rate; €
                                             4

denotes a shock to money demand; and a and        are positive structural parameters. It
is traditional to assume that there is a comparable equation for the foreign country,
and that domestic and foreign elasticities are equal.1/ Subtracting the foreign
analog (where an asterisk denotes a foreign value) yields:


           (p-p) (m-m)1 - p(yy*)         +   a(i-i) - (€-€).           (2)


                 LB,1.a. The Monetary Model with flexible Prices
     The other two conditions enter as different substitutions for two of the terms in
this equation. One can model (and replace) the relative price term by assuming that
prices are either flexible or sticky. Similarly, one can model the interest rate
differential as either simply satis'ing uncovered interest parity, or as incorporating
some adjustment for risk. The simplest monetary model assumes flexible prices: thus,
in the absence of transportation costs and other distortions, purchasing power parity
(PPP) holds, at least up to a disturbance:


           (p.p*)1 =   e   +                                                 (3)



where e denotes the (log) spot domestic price of a unit of foreign exchange, and v is a
stationary disturbance. The solution for the exchange rate is then immediate:


           e1 = (mm*)t - (y_y*)1 + a(i-i)1 -              v.                 (4)




 1/ Though Haynes and Stone (1981) object to this practice.
                                             5
Finally, it is typically assumed that domestic and foreign assets are perfect substitutes.
except possibly for an exogenously-varying time premium, so that the interest rate
differential equals the expected depreciation rate plus a possible risk premium, .
Thus a modified form of uncovered interest parity [UIP] holds:



           (i-i') - Pt = E1(dej/dt                                             (5)


where E1 denotes the expectations operator conditional on information available at
time t. The simple flexible-price monetary 'fundamental" can be defined as:


                (rn-rn')! - 3(y-y')1 - (€-E')1 - v +   p1.                     (6)


Substituting in the modified UIP condition, the exchange rate equation then becomes:


           e=      + aE1(dej/dt.                                       (7)


This expression was first drived by Mussa (1976). A very similar equation can be
derived from the currency substitution model (e.g., Calvo and Rodriguez, 1979).
Stocknian (1980) and Lucas (1982) gave the simple monetary model more
respectability by replacing the ad hoc money demand equations with money-in-the-
utility-function and cash-in-advance assumptions, respectively. Early and influential
empirical studies included Frenkel (1976, 1978), Bilson (1978), and Hodrick (1978) and
other papers gathered in Frenkel and Johnson (1978).
     After initial claims of success, the empirical failures of the simple monetary
model became swiftly apparent. The coefficient estimates (of a and )         and empirical

fit of such models were never particularly good, except perhaps under hyperinflation
                                               6

conditions. Also, high volatility of real exchange rates, and the highly positive
correlation of nominal and real exchange rates, became obvious enough to warrant
explicit treatment. Finally, the models turned out to forecast poorly out-of-sample.
      Some of these problems can be easily illustrated using actual data. Figure 1
contains time-series plots of bilateral Japanese/American data from 1960 though 1992;
Figure 2 has the analogs for the UK vis-a-vis Germany. Each figure portrays three
variables: the nominal exchange rate (graphed with a thin solid line); the real exchange
rate (graphed with plus marks); and "monetary fundamentals" (graphed with small
circles). The real exchange rate is the nominal exchange rate adjusted using Consumer
Price Indices; monetary fundamentals are a (scaled) standard measure of flexible-price
monetary fundamentals, namely the ratios of domestic and foreign money supplies over
the ratio of domestic and foreign levels of real output (that is, [(MUjMo)/(YuyJYG)]
for the British-German case, and analogously for the Japanese-U.S. case, where capital
letters denote the levels of the variables).
      The graphs show a number of features which are pervasive in bilateral data.
First, both the nominal exchange rate and fundamentals appear to be non-stationary,
though the real exchange rate does not (except perhaps for a trend in the real
yen/dollar rate). Second is the important comparison across regimes. Nominal
exchange rates were fixed explicitly at the beginning of the sample under the Bretton
Woods regime, and the pound-mark rate was also stabilized during the period 1990-92,
when Britain was in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System.
In each case (1960-72 for the yen/dollar rate in Figure 1, and 1960-69 and 1990-92 for
the pound/mark rate in Figure 2), nominal exchange rate stabilization is reflected in a
corresponding stabilization of the real exchange rate, but surprisingly did not require a
corresponding stabilization in macroeconomic fundamentals.

      A third stylized fact is that the relationship between the monetary fundamentals
and the nominal exchange rate does not appear to be close in the short-run, though
they may share longer-run trends. Given that both sets of data are typical for
industrialized countries, the finding of poor coefficient estimates and goodness-of-fit in
flexible-price monetary models is unsurprising. Finally, the correlation between
nominal and real exchange rates is considerable at high frequencies, though it appears
to fall at lower frequencies. This apparent contradiction to the assumption of flexible
prices leads naturally to the subject of price stickiness.


                  I..1.b. Price Stickiness and Overshooting
      An alternative to making the PPP assumption is explicitly to model goods-market
prices as being sticky, at least in the short run. The classic theoretical paper was
Dornbuschs (1976b) contribution which demonstrated that in the short run, nominal
exchange rates may "overshoot" their long-run levels.1/ This was followed by
Frankel (1979), Mussa (1979), and Buiter and Miller (1982).2/ Price-stickiness can
be easily, incorporated into the empirical structural models of exchange rates.
      A simple, yet strong, statement that captures the essence of the Dornbusch model
is a statement of proportionality between the real exchange rate and the
contemporaneous real interest differential. Start by subtracting expectations of the
inflation differential from the statement of uncovered interest parity:




 1/ Forerunners included Mundell (1964), Niehans (1975) and Dornbusch (1976a).
 2/ Extensions, such as full system estimation with an allowance for cross-equation
constraints, included Driskill (1981), Driskill, Mark and Sheffrin (1992) and Papell
(1988, 1989, 1993).
                                              9

            (i-1)1 - E(dp-dp1) = E1(de3/dt - E1(dp1-dp1) + p1
or                 r1 - r =   E1(dq1)/dt +   p,                   (8)
where: r1 and r1 are the   cx ante expected real interest rates, defined by r1    i1-E1(p,,1-

ps), and q1 is the real exchange rate, defined as e1 - p1 + p' Equation (8) states that
for both countries' assets to be willingly held, a difference in real interest rates across
countries must be matched by an expectation of real depreciation.

      A second assumption used is that the real exchange rate is expected to revert

toward a long run equilibrium value, .


            E1(dq,)/dt = -e(q1 - ).                                     (9)


Combining equations and solving, we obtain a proportionality between the level of the

real exchange rate and the real interest differential:1/



q - , = -(1/8)[(i-i)1 - E1(dp1-dp'j] + p1 = -(1/s )[r1 - r'J + Pt       (10)



Recent tests have focused on this equation per se.




  .1/ Initially, attention focused on short-term real interest rates (e.g., Frankel, 1979).
Short-term rates are implicit in equation (10) here, as is appropriate if the expected
regression of the real exchange rate in equation (9) is assumed to follow a first-order
autoregressive process, which in turn is the rational expectation if price adjustment follows
a first-order autoregressive process. An alternative approach using long-term differentials
was inaugurated by Isard (1983). Assume a version of equation (9) in which some long
span of time, say 1/ years, is considered sufficiently long for q to return to equilibrium
(with no position tal&n on the specific time path). If such an equation is combméd with
a version of equation (8) expressed with correspondingly long-term interest rates, the result
is a version of equation (10) suitable for use with real interest rates of term 1/
                                                                                   6
                                               10

      Early tests of the overshooting model tended to focus on models more like
Dornbusch (1976), that is, fleshed out in a form more complete than the simple
proportionality between the real exchange rate and the real interest differential. The
more complete model allows for price stickiness in a standard way. Substitute a
Phillips-curve equation where the flexible-price model assumed continuous purchasing

power:


                         j(yyLR)1 +   g + E(1+1-1)
           y - LR.   =      +   6'(q) + 4'r1
      => P1+iP1 = O(q) + 4r1 + g1 + E(,1-1)                      (11)


where: y is the long-run level of output; g is a well-behaved shock to goods market
equilibrium; and     is defined as the price level that would prevail at time 1 if prices
were flexible and goods markets cleared:1/


                           + 4ir1 + g1 = 0.


      Equation (11) gives the system its long-run equilibrium (i), and its dynamics
(which are correctly incorporated in 0, if investors are rational). Substituting equation
(10) and conventional money demand functions like equation (1) yields a complete
equation of exchange rate determination. This is essentially the flexible-price monetary
model with the addition of extra terms representing the real interest differential, the
risk premium p1 [if any] and variation in the long-run equilibrium exchange rate        [if




  /  Obstfeld an Rogoff (1984) and Engel and Frankel (1984b) provide a detailed
discussion of the p term.
                                             11

any). These extra terms can be measured in a variety of ways, allowing for estimation
of the exchange rate equation.
      At first, empirical tests of exchange rate models with price stickiness met with
success, particularly for the mark/dollar rate.1/ Subsequently, however, results
began to fall apart, even in-sample: e.g., Frankel (1983a, b) and Backus (1984). More
importantly, the models caved in to the same Meese and Rogoff onslaught that
effectively did in the flexible-price models (i.e., unsuccessful tests of out-of-sample

predictive performance).
      Recent research has focused on equation (10) -- the simple testable implication
of the model relating the real exchange rate to the contemporaneous real interest
differential -- using increasingly sophisticated time-series econometrics. The third in
the series of papers by Meese and Rogoff (1988) used the Engle-Granger test for co-
integration, and failed to find evidence of such a relationship. Similarly, Campbell and
Clarida (1987) found that very little of the variation in the real exchange rate could be
explained by variation in the real interest differential. Many authors have noted that a
possible reason for such results is the existence of a missing variable, which would
enter as a determinant of either a time-varying long-run real exchange rate or a risk
premium. Another possibility is weak power in the tests, since failure to find
statistically significant evidence of co-integration never entitles one to claim that such a
relationship does not exist.
      A number of subsequent studies have used increasingly powerful econometric
firepower (e.g., the Johansen procedure), and have also included other variables.
Blundell-Wignall and Browne (1991) find evidence of co-integration between the real
exchange rate and real interest differential when a measure of the cumulated current

account is included; Edison and Pauls (1992) find less evidence. Throop (1992) claims
strong results, including out-of-sample predictive ability, when allowing for several
other variables: a lagged effect of the real interest differential, the budget deficit, the
real price of oil, and a measure of the relative price of non-traded goods. Baxter
(1994) finds evidence of a relationship between real exchange rates and real interest
rates by looking at lower-frequency data than earlier studies.


                  I.B.1.c. Portfolio Balance Models and Sterilized Intervention
      The portfolio-balance model is a third approach to modelling exchange rates,
beyond the flexible-price and sticky-price monetary models. Tobins portfolio-balance
model was internationalized by Kouri (1976), Branson (1977), Girion and Henderson
(1977) and Allen and Kenen (1980), among others. The literature was ably surveyed
by Branson and Henderson (1985).
      Relative to the monetary models of exchange rate determination, the key
modification made by the portfolio-balance theorists is the assumption that domestic
and foreign securities are not perfect substitutes. The result is that a risk premium
intrudes on the uncovered interest parity condition, and supplies of bonds and other
non-monetary assets intrude on the equation of exchange rate determination. The
exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand for all foreign and domestic
assets, not just the supply and demand for money as in the monetary approach. The
resulting models are of particular use when one wants to consider the possible effects
of sterilized intervention by the monetary authorities or of current account imbalances.
Intervention represents a change in the supplies of assets, and thus in the protfolio
balance model works to change the exchange rate accordingly: a purchase of foreign
assets drives up the price of foreign exchange. In the "small-country portfolio-balance
model where international capital flows are assumed to be denominated solely in
                                            13

foreign currency, current account balances represent a change in asset supplies. A
surplus raises the supply of foreign assets and thus reduces their price, which is an
appreciation of the domestic currency. In more realistic models where the portfolio
behavior of both domestic and foreign residents is relevant for market equilibrium,
current account balances represent a change in asset demands, if the foreigners have a
preference for their own assets. A surplus raises the net wealth-weighted worldwide
demand for domestic assets, and thus again leads to an appreciation of the domestic
currency.
      Early empirical tests of the portfolio-balance model, such as Branson, Halttunen
and Masson (1977, 1979), were not particularly successful, even in-sample. The
outlook did not much improve when researchers did a more careful job of measuring
asset supplies (e.g., Frankel (1983b), Backus (1984), and Golub (1989) ).
      This line of research took a new direction in the l980s. Early work had modelled

international asset demands as arbitrary functions of expected returns. Subsequently,
portfolio-balance modelers made the assumption that investors diversified their
portfolios optimally, in the manner dictated by expected utility maximization. A typical
implication in these models was that the degree of substitutability between domestic
and foreign assets depended inversely on the degree of risk-aversion and the exchange
rate variance (or variance-covariance matrix, when there are more than two currencies
in the portfolio). The relevant empirical tests are surveyed in the chapter by Lewis in
this volume.!!
     Ai noted, one of the major motivations for considering the portfolio-balance
approach is that it enables one to consider the possible effects of sterilized
intervention, that is, intervention that is not allowed to affect money supplies, and thus


 1/ E.g.: Frankel (1982), Black and Salemi (1988), Lewis (1988), and Engel and
Rodriguez (1989).
                                            14

has no effect on the fundamentals dictated by monetary exchange rate models. Several
studies published in the aftermath of the 1983 Jurgensen Report by research
departments of G-7 central banks on intervention surveyed the empirical literature that
existed at that time (Tryon (1983), Henderson (1984), Henderson and Simpson (1983),
and Henderson, Danker, Haas, Symansky, Tryon (1987).) The early studies mostly
consisted of various tests of the portfolio-balance model, using quarterly data on asset
supplies. Estimated effects were generally small and statistically insignificant, if even of
the correct sign. This was especially true when the quantity of intervention was
calculated in the theoretically correct fashion (i.e., cumulative, combined with
government deficits and any other components of the net supplies of assets
denominated in the currencies in question).1/
      Several developments reinvigorated this subject of research toward the end of the
1980s: the advent of the "signaling" hypothesis, the increased availability of daily data,
and the widely perceived success of concerted intervention by the G-7 in the period
beginning with the 1985 Plaza Agreement to bring down the value of the dollar.
Studies such as Dominguez (1990, 1992) seemed to show an effect when actual daily
intervention data were used. The more recent literature has been comprehensively and

ably surveyed by Edison (1993).
      The current conventional wisdom (e.g., Obstfeld 1990) is that -- precisely because
international financial markets are well-developed, highly integrated, and subject to
diversification -. central bank purchases or sales of foreign exchange are un]ikely to be
large enough to have much of an effect on the exchange rate. The possible exception
is non-sterilized intervention that affects money supplies. If the effect is

contemporaneous, it is simply a variety of monetary policy. However, the effects on
future money also matter. Some years ago Mussa (1981), among others, suggested the
"signaling" hypothesis: sterilized intervention may be effective if it signals future

changes in monetary policy.       This channel requires, first, that intervention is
reported to market participants, and second that they interpret it as conveying
information on future monetary policy that is actually validated on average by the
monetary authorities. Klein (1993) offers evidence relevant to the first proposition;
Kaminsky and Lewis (1993), Klein and Rosengren (1991) and Lewis (1990, 1993) offer
much more ambiguous evidence relevant to the second. Dominguez and Frankel
(1993a, b) have found evidence of intervention effects through both the signaling
channel and the traditional portfolio channeLl/ Catte, Galli, and Rebecchini (1994)
and Eijffinger and Gruijters (1991) claim even stronger evidence of effects of daily
intervention.
      A persuasive, but less-noticed, train of thought within the portfolio-balance model
has been pursued by Dooley and Isard (1982b, 1987, 1991), as well as Krugnian (1985)
and Bovenberg (1989), who view the cumulated current account deficit as an important
determinant of the exchange rate because political risk puts a limit on the extent to
which international investors wish to lend to a particular country, rather than because
exchange risk puts a limit on the extent to which investors wish to hold assets
denominated in a particular currency. Dootey, Isard and Taylor (1993) claim some
supporting empirical findings.

      Volatility of foreign exchange rates is considered to be sufficiently high to be
worthy of study by applied researchers. Standard asset-pricing models rationalize
volatility in terms of revisions regarding expectations of future developments arising Out
of new information, that is, in terms of news. In this sub-section, we review recent
developments in this literature.
      From the time when expectations were first introduced into the asset-market
approach to exchange rate determination,1/ it has been recognized that unexpected
events have a qualitatively different effect on the exchange rate from anticipated
developments. Specifically, the exchange rate should change discontinuously in
response to new pieces of unanticipated relevant information, and not otherwise.
Anticipated discrete changes are ruled out, since they would represent an unexploited
profit opportunity. Only gradual changes are possible in the absence of news. Such
gradual changes can occur, for example, in step with the price level or the stock of
foreign assets, which typically move gradually over tirne.2/ (For the time being, we
are ruling Out speculative bubbles and the bursting thereof, which would constitute a
sudden change without an exogenous cause. They are considered in further below.)
                  I.B.2.a. Statistical Innovations
      Dornbusch (1978; 1980, pp.157-163) and Frenkel (1981, pp.686-693) suggested the
term "news to call attention to the sort of unanticipated developments that should
affect the exchange rate discretely. Their empirical work used statistical innovations
(from ARIMA processes) in interest differentials and other macroeconomic variables




 /j/ Black (1973) was an early introduction of rational expectations.
      Obstfeld and Stockman (1985) provide a survey. For the efficient markets hypothesis
to hold, gradual appreciation or depreciation must be offset by sufficient differences in
interest rates, so that domestic and foreign assets are equally attractive at the margrn.
                                             17

to model expectations and thereby derive measures of news.j/ This approach tends
to produce more significant effects on the exchange rate than using similar
macroeconomic variables that have not been converted to statistical innovations.
Dornbusch found that unexpected current account improvements result in dollar
appreciations, as did Branson (1983) in a VAR study motivated by the portfolio-
balance model. Dornbusch found that business cycle effects were also of the right sign,
but insignificant. The money supply effects were mixed. Edwards (982, 1983) found
positive effects of innovations in the domestic/foreign money supply ratio on the price
of foreign exchange, as would be predicted by most monetary models. MacDonald
(1983), however, found that an unanticipated increase in the German money supply led
to an appreciation of the Deutschemark, suggesting anticipations of future tightening.
     To distinguish between the flexible-price and sticky-price versions of monetary
models, one can look at interest rate innovations. On the one hand, Frenkel found
positive effects of innovations in interest rates on the price of foreign exchange,
suggesting that they capture inflation expectations, as called for in his flexible-price
monetarist model. Copeland (1989, p.225), on the other hand, found that an
unanticipated increase in the German interest rate led to an appreciation of the
Deutschemark.
      More recently, Eichenbaum and Evans (1993) have sought to isolate changes in
the U.S. money policy that can be specifically identified as unanticipated, exogenous, or
deliberate, using three alternative methods: statistical innovations in a measure of non-
borrowed reserves; innovations in the federal funds rate; and deliberate policy shifts
recorded from history using the minutes of the Federal Reserves Open Market
Comj-nittee, They find similar results with all three measures: monetary contractions

lead to dollar appreciations. At the same time, there are also positive effects on
interest rates, suggesting to Eichenbaum and Evans a rejection of the popular real
business cycle model (the modern successor to the flexible-price monetary model), and
support for a "liquidity effect as in the overshooting model. The surprising aspect of
their findings is that, in violation of rational expectations, there is a two-year lag before
the peak effect is felt in the market. Grilli and Roubini (1993) have recently extended
the Eichenbaum-Evans approach to include monetary policy in other major
industrialized countries. Clarida and Galli (1994) undertake a VAR decomposition of
exchange rate variation into nominal shocks and real shocks. They interpret the results
as consistent with the Eichenbaum-Evans finding, and therefore with the sticky-price
textbook model [albeit with lags]. However, it should be stressed that the Eichenbaum-
Evans results have not yet been subjected to a thorough sensitivity analysis (e.g., out-of-

sample forecasting tests).
     Even though the Dornbusch-Frenkel approach of using fundamentals that have
been converted to statistical innovations tends to produce more satisfactory results than
the earlier studies, the improvement is distinctly limited. In the first place, market
anticipations are not measured accurately. To use an ARIMA or VAR process as a
measure of what agents expect, is to ascribe to them simultaneously not enough
 information, and too much. It does not ascribe to them enough information, because it
 leaves out all the thousands of bits of information that market investors use, beyond a
 few simple macroeconomic times series. It ascribes to them too much information
 (even under the assumption that agents are rational and thus use all available
 information), because it assumes that they know the parameters of the statistical
 process from the beginning of the sample period. A second problem with early
 implementations of the methodology is that they typically measure the news with final

 money supply numbers after revisions by government agencies, ignoring that these are not
                                                19

 generally the same as numbers first announced, and that even first announcements
 generally take place days, weeks, or months after the period to which they pertain.
                    LB.2.b. Announcement Effects
       Both of the measurement problems inherent in the statistical approach can be
 solved, albeit not without work. By compiling actual announcements of official statistics
 from press releases, wire service stories, or newspapers, one can measure information
 as it actually becomes available to the market.jJ One major advantage of such
 announcement data is that one can pinpoint the day, and often the time ofday, when
 the announcement was made. One can then observe the exchange rate immediately
 before and after the announcement, to see the effect. The advantage of such precise
timing is that one can hope to isolate the impact of one particular bit of information.
Empirical results show that effects typically diffuse rapidly in a stream of other
information that the researcher is not able to observe, so that statistical significance
disappears when exchange rate changes are measured a day or two late, let alone over
months (as in standard tests of exchange rate determination). By seeking to isolate the
impact of the announcement, one might hope to explain a large fraction of the
variation in the exchange rate over short intervals. However, in practice, even when
the effects are highly significant statistically, the goodness-of-fit statistics are usually
disappointing.
       The use of data from surveys on the forecasts of market participants is a way of
addressing the problem that agents form their expectations based on a far wider set of
data than anything the econometrician can ever hope to measure. The survey data
have become a standard basis from which to measure the unanticipated component of

announcements; Money Market Services, International ("MMS) provides the most



 1/   The analogous stock-market tests are called event studies.
                                             20
 popular survey. The timing of the MMS surveys is almost perfect for research
 purposes, since MMS and other financial services collect their surveys in order to see
 what market participants expect the datum in question to be, typically a couple of days
 before the scheduled announcement date. The use of survey data is discussed at
 greater length in Part IV below.
      Engel and Frankel (1984a) examined the reaction of the mark/dollar rate to
 announcements regarding the preceding week's MI in the early 1980s. Positive U.S.
 money surprises were associated with appreciations of the dollar at the same time that
 they were associated with increases in interest rates, leading the authors to conclude
 that: 1) during this period the Federal Reserve was expected to correct any deviations
 of the money supply from its target path; and 2) expectations of monetary contraction
tend to raise real interest rates and cause the currency to appreciate, as in the
Dornbusch overshooting model. Cornell (1982), Frankel and Hardouveljs (1985), and
Tandon and Urich (1987) found the same patterns in other exchange rates: U.S. money
surprises are followed by significant changes in the U.S. interest rate that are negative]v
correlated with the price of foreign exchange.
      Ito and Roley (1987) looked at the reactions in the yen/dollar rate both to
macroeconomic announcements in the United States and to those in Japan. They
found that U.S. money announcements had the greatest effect.
      The money announcements lost much of their impact later in the 1980s, after the
Fed began to put less emphasis on its Ml targets. A number of authors have found
strong announcement effects for other variables, however. Hardouvelis (1988) finds
significant dollar appreciations associated with news of increases in the trade balance,
decreases in inflation, and improvements in the business cycle.1/ A general pattern



 1/ Hogan, Melvin, and Roberts (1991) find the same trade balance effect.

 throughout is that the reaction in the price of foreign exchange is in the opposite
 direction as the reaction in interest rates, which tends to support the view that these
 are changes in real interest rates, and that they work on the exchange rate in the
manner of the Dornbusch overshooting model. Beck (1993) finds that government
announcements of unexpectedly large budget deficits cause the dollar to appreciate
against foreign currencies, and argues that this is evidence against debt neutrality, and
in favor of the Dornbusch overshooting model.


      LC, Forecast Ana1ysis



      Fitting exchange rates to contemporary observable variables, in-sample, is one
thing. Forecasting out of sample is quite another, as many applied researchers have
found.



            I.C.1. Forecasting with Fundamentals
      In a now-classic study, Meese and Rogoff (1983a) compared the out-of-sample
forecast precision of a variety of different exchange rate models. Using monthly data
for three bilateral dollar exchange rates (as well as an effective dollar exchange rate),
Meese and Rogoff compared forecasting performance by both structural and non-
structural exchange rate models, as well as by contemporaneous spot and forward rates.
The non-structural models included both univariate models and vector-autoregressions.
The structural models included variants of both flexible- and sticky-price monetary
models. It had been widely recognized (e.g., Meese and Singleton (1982)) that
exchange rates could in some sense be modelled well by an autoregression with one
unit root. But Meese and Rogoff (1983a,b) showed the important result that a simple
martingale process forecasts as well as more complex structural models -- up to a year
                                                22
in advance -.   even   providing to the structural models ex post information on future
fundamentals such as money and output. Meese and Rogoff (1983a) found these results
using a variety of different estimation techniques. They corroborated their results in
Meese and Rogoff (1983b) using grid-search techniques in place of actual estimation, a
procedure that is immune to the usual endemic estimation problems such as
simultaneity bias. Their work permanently shifted the focus of empirical exchange rate
work from in-sample fitting to prediction analysis.
      Some authors have pursued more sophisticated econometric estimation
techniques in attempts to overturn such results. For instance, Meese and Rose (1991)
used a variety of non-linear and non-parametric techniques in the context of structural
exchange rate models. They found little evidence of either 'time-deformation" or
significant non-linearities in the functional forms linking exchange rates to
fundamentals which could explain the poor performance of linear exchange rate
models.
      Not all performance tests on structural exchange rate models have come Out
completely negative. Woo (1985) estimated a flexible-price version of the monetary
model for the dollar-deutschemark and found that the model worked well in the sense
that maximum likelihood estimation lead to plausible and stable parameter estimates
which did not reject tests of cross-equation restrictions and which out-forecast a
random walk model a year ahead. The use of a lagged endogenous variable was
crucial; Woo justifies it by appealing to slow adjustment of money demand. Similarly,
Somanath (1986) also found that a monetary model with a lagged endogenous variable
forecasts better than either a monetary model by itself or the lagged endogenous
variable by itself (i.e., better than the random walk). Finn (1986), and MacDonald and
Taylor (1993a, 1994) also claimed some predictive power for the monetary model.
Schinasi and Swamy (1989) found that the sticky-price monetary model outperforms the
                                             23

 random walk when allowance is made for both a lagged endogenous variable and time-
 varying coefficients. (Related results are reported in Wolff, 1987.)
      A number of authors have found that structural models appear to dominate the
 random walk's forecasting ability at relatively long prediction horizons, a result
 consistent with the visual impression of common trends in exchange rates and
fundamentals given by figures 1 and 2. They include Meese and Rogoff (1983b); Mark
(1992); Chinn (1992); and Chinn and Meese (1992). However, the Meese and Rogoff
analysis at short horizons has never been convincingly overturned or explained. It
continues to exert a pessimistic effect on the field of empirical exchange rate modelling
in particular and international finance in general.


            I.C.2. Forecasting without Fundamentals
      The triumph at short and medium horizons of the naive random-walk "model" of
exchange rates (if only by default) over fundamental-based models, first discovered by
Meese and Rogoff, lead to a burst of research on the univariate characteristics of
nominal exchange rates, It still remains distressing that a model as simplistic as a
martingale appears to perform empirically as well as extremely sophisticated
alternatives, which sometimes involve complicated estimation strategies.
      Engel and Hamilton (1990) use a two-state Markov switching univariate model,
and find that the movements of three bilateral American dollar rates are characterized
by long swings (although the exchange markets seem not to realize this in the sense
that the model does not help to explain deviations from uncovered interest parity).
They also find that the forecasts of this model are somewhat better than those of the

pure random walk. However, Engel (1992) analyzes eighteen exchange rates, including
eleven non-dollar rates, and finds that the Markov-switching models does not have
superior forecast precision to that of a simple random walk, even though it performs
                                             24
better inside the sample. This has become a standard finding; a number of authors
have found models which perform well in-sample (e.g., compared with a simple
martingale) but which break down in out-of-sample prediction analysis. For instance,
Diebold and Nason (1990) use a general non-parametric estimator on a number of
different exchange rates. They find that univariate models fit the data much better in-
sample with their estimator than, e.g., a simple random walk, but that the non-
parametric estimator does not produce forecasts superior to those of a random
walk.1/
      Baillie and Bollerslev (1989) find co-integration in a set of American dollar
exchange rates; that is, the dollar-yen exchange appears to be co-integrated with e.g.,
the dollar-DM rate. This finding is quite plausible (and not especially striking) in the
context of standard structural exchange rate models, since all bilateral dollar exchange
rates can be expected to react similarly to American-specific shocks, for example.
However, Diebold, Gardeazabal and Yilmaz (1994) point out that co-integration of
bilateral rates implies that, univariate dollar-yen exchange rate forecasts, for example,
should be out-performed by incorporating information from the dollar-pound rate
(since co-integration implies predictability from the co-integrating relationship). It is
therefore all the more striking that Diebold et. a!. find no evidence of predictability
and co-integration, using the data set of Baillie and Bollerslev. They claim that there
is little evidence of common shocks to the movements in dollar exchange rates.




 1/ Small-sample problems -- learning and the "peso problem" -- are relevant here; e.g.,
one might explain Engel and Hamilton in this vein. Other references include Lewis
(1989).

      I.D. Sumniarv


      Studies such as Baclcus (1984), Meese arid Rogoff (1983a, 1983b, 1988) and
Campbell and Clarida (1987) are typical of the empirical literature that seeks to
explain or forecast the monthly or quarterly exchange rate with traditional observable
macroeconomic fundamentals, whether based on the monetary or portfolio-balance
models. The dispiriting conclusion is that relatively little explanatory power is found,
and the models contain little forecasting ability compared to very simple alternatives.
Existing structural models have little in their favor beyond theoretical coherence.
Positive results, when they are found, are often either fragile, or unconvincing in that
they rely on implausible theoretical or empirical models. For these reasons, we, like
much of the profession, are doubtful of the value of further time-series modelling of
exchange rates at high or medium frequencies using macroeconomic models.


II. Evidence from across Fixed and Floating Regimes


      It is widely known that real and nominal exchange rates are highly correlated,
and that the shocks common to both are highly persistent (e.g., Mark (1990)). These
correlations are visible in Figures 1 and 2. To many, the fact that real exchange rate
variability went up when nominal variability did after 1973 (also visible in the Figures).
suggests that nominal prices are sticky and that monetary disturbances therefore cause
both nominal and real exchange rate changes, as in the Dornbusch model. Others,
such as Stockman (1987,1988), argue that real exchange rate variability is caused by
shifts to tastes and technology, and would have gone up after 1973 regardless of the
exchange rate regime, which is endogenously chosen in any case. (Real exchange rate
variability is surveyed in the chapter of this volume by From and Rogoff; regime choice
                                             26
is surveyed by Garber and Svensson.) A small recent literature has considered
evidence across exchange rate regimes. We now survey this work.
      The evidence discussed in Section 1 above shows that it is difficult to model
exchange rate movements in many respects. Nevertheless, exchange rates have one
striking empirical feature with which any plausible theory must be consistent:

systematically differing volatility. In particular, exchange rates that are officially
stabilized show not only low nominal variability, which one would expect virtually by
definition, but low real variability as well, compared to those that are allowed to float
more or less freely. In the past decade, a number of empirical papers have
characterized or exploited these and other regime-specific differences in volatility.
      Mussa (1986, 1990) convincingly demonstrated that nominal and real exchange
rate volatility moved closely together, both being substantially lower during regimes of
fixed rates. Persuasive examples include the Canadian experiment with floating in the
l950s, and changes in Ireland's exchange rate regime from a pound to a Deutschemark
peg. Eichengreen (1988) provides similar evidence from the interwar period. Mussa
reasoned that nominal exchange rate regime-specific differences in real exchange rate
volatility could be caused for a variety of reasons, including bubbles, sticky prices,
systematically varying macroeconomic shocks, or regime-specific differences in policy
behavior.
      The subsequent literature has corroborated Mussa's findings regarding real
exchange rate volatility, and examined differences in macroeconomic behavior to
discover the source of the finding. For instance, Baxter and Stockman (1989) looked at
the behavior of a variety of macroeconomic variables across different types of exchange
rate regimes, arguing, as had Mussa, that most theories of the open economy imply
economic behavior which varies systematically with the nominal exchange rate regime.
Baxter and Stockman examined a number of real macroeconomic variables (including
                                             27
consumption, output, and trade flows, de-trended in two ways) over forty industrialized
and developing countries. While non-theoretical in nature, their results are striking
and intuitive. The only systematic regime-specific pattern in the data is higher
volatility of the real exchange rate in regimes of floating rates. By way of contrast, the
volatility of, for example, output and consumption does not appear to vary
systematically with the exchange rate regime.
     A similar tactic has been used by Flood and Rose (1993) to study monetary
models of exchange rate determination (with both flexible and sticky prices). They
rewrite the structural form of the simple monetary model with flexible prices as


                 e1 -   a(i-i)1 =(m-m)1 -   (y-y) - (e-c),                   (4)


and note that both the left- and the right-hand side variables can be measured or

estimated. Their analysis hinges on the fact that the volatility of the left-hand side
variable during a regime of floating is between three and nine times as volatile as
during a fixed exchange rate regime. However, the right-hand side has approximately
comparable volatility in fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes. (Both facts are
consistent with Figures 1 through 2.) The more general point is that the volatility of
macroeconomic variables such as money, output, and prices (appropriately
parameterized) does not vary much across exchange rate regimes, certainly not enough
to rationalize the large cross-regime differences in exchange rate volatility. Since few
macroeconomic variables have regime-specific volatility, they interpret this to mean
that macroeconomic variables cannot be very important determinants of exchange rate
volatility. This point transcends the narrow confines of the flexible-price monetary.
model, since different macroeconomic theories of exchange rate determination (e.g.,
models with sticky prices) merely change the right-hand side of equation (4') from one

consensus for this conclusion, since it is the rule rather than the exception that large
movements in exchange rates occur in the absence of plausible or detectable
macroeconomic events. In the two minutes that the average reader has taken to read
this page, the dollar/yen exchange rate may well have fluctuated 5 basis points!
      The strength of this work is that it characterizes a wide range of currencies and
exchange arrangements, and does not rely on sensitive statistical techniques. The
evidence convincingly shows that the nominal exchange rate regime is systematically
and substantially associated with differences in real exchange rate volatility. This
evidence is inconsistent with a large class of models which predict nominal exchange
rate neutrality. This insight is deceptively simple, yet empirically potent. It is quite
general, since many theories of the open economy imply that the behavior of such
variables as, e.g., money, inflation, and output vary with the exchange rate regime.
Differences in economic behavior are especially plausible since the exchange rate
regime is chosen by the monetary authorities deliberately.
      Instead of looking across regimes of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes, one
can also look across regimes of tranquility and turbulence. Hyperinflations represent
one of the most interesting types of economic turbulence from the viewpoint of an
exchange rate analyst. Monetary theories of exchange rates work substantially better in
hyperinflatioris than in periods of low inflation inflation, in that they can explain the
trend in the nominal exchange rate. The classic work is by Frenkel (1976, 1980). The
impression that variation in the real exchange rate is lower in hyperinflations than in
normal times is not correct, however.1/

     To sum up, there are substantial differences in nominal and real exchange rate
behavior across exchange rate regimes which do not appear in observable
macroeconomic variables. There are two possible reasons for this. The first is that
unobservable macroeconomic shocks affect the exchange rate. The second is that
bubbles, defined as exchange rate movements that are unrelated to fundamentals, are
the cause of regime-varying exchange rate volatility.


III. Speculative Bubbles


      Sections 1 and 11 suggest that the case for macroeconomic determinants of
exchange rates is in a sorry state. With the exception of some significance in tests of
statistical innovations and announcements at very short horizons, and some hazy
predictive power at long horizons, there is little support for the standard
macroeconomic models. Negative findings such as Meese and Rogoff (1983a, 1983b),
Campbell and Clarida (1987), and Flood and Rose (1993) suggest more than a failure
of specific models of exchange rate determination or typical econometric difficulties.
Instead, such results indicate that no model based on such standard fundamentals like
money supplies, real income, interest rates, inflation rates and current account balances
will ever succeed in explaining or predicting a high percentage of the variation in the
exchange rate, at least at short- or medium-term frequencies.
      As noted, two broad possibilities remain. The "equilibrium theory" of exchange
rates asserts that real exchange rate movements have their roots in real fundamental
determinants such as productivity shocks and changes in tastes, even if these factors are
unobservable to the econometrician. The alternative theory is that speculative bubbles
exist which affect nominal and real exchange rates. A number of pieces of evidence

point us away from the equilibrium theory.
                                            30
     First, the observed pattern of co-movement of exchange rates and interest rates,
documented in Section 1, contradicts the equilibrium view.1/ Second, direct
evidence on goods prices such as Engel (1993), covered in the chapter by From and
Rogoff, suggests price stickiness. Third, and most convincingly, the cross-regime
evidence reviewed in Section II shows little support for the conclusion that exchange
rate variability is caused by shocks to tastes and technology. No macroeconomic
variable other than the exchange rate demonstrates regime-varying volatility; there is
little indirect confirmation of regime-varying unobservable shocks from other parts of
the economy.
     The alternative is the possibility of speculative bubbles, i.e., exchange rate
movements that are not based in fundamentals, but rather are based in self-confirming
expectations. We now turn to this possibility.
      In the theoretical literature, a rational speculative bubble is simply the additional
indeterminate term that appears in the solution to a differential or difference equation
representing a rational-expectations equilibrium to equation (7). These bubbles arise
both in monetary models (e.g., Mussa (1976) or Dornbusch (1976b)) and portfolio-
balance models (e.g., Rodriguez (1980)), although Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983) have
sought to rule out bubbles on a priori grounds.
      If we could be confident of the fundamentals part of the equation, we could test
for the presence of the additional bubble term in (7). Flood and Garber (1980)
introduced a test for a deterministic speculative bubble, that is, one that never bursts
once it gets started. Rational speculative bubbles were made stochastic by Blanchard
(1979) and Dornbusch (1982). Several researchers have sought to introduce tests for
stochastic bubbles in the foreign exchange market, to see if variability is higher than


  1/ E.g., Engel and Frankel (1984a), Hardouvelis (1988), and Eichenbaum and Evans
(1993), Baxter (1984), and Clarida and Galli (1994).
                                           31

can be explained by macroeconomic fundamentals. These tests are closely related to
so-called volatility tests, and are surveyed in Frankel and Meese (1987). They have in
common that their usefulness is sharply limited by the prerequisite that one already
knows how to model fundamentals.
     Meese (1986) uses a conventional monetary approach to define fundamentals and
a Hausrnan-style specification test to test for bubbles; he finds some evidence of
exchange rate bubbles.1/ Evans (1986) has produced evidence of bubbles in the
pound/dollar exchange rate in the early 1980s, based upon a non-parametric test for
systematic deviations from uncovered interest parity. Evans' work is distinguished by
its careful treatment of the issue of potential data mining, which is accounted for by
simulation analysis of different aspects of his test procedure. However, Flood and
Hodrick (1990) argue that there is an observational equivalence between expectations
of process-switching and bubbles. This problem, in addition to the fact that any test for
bubbles is based upon a posited model of fundamentals (an especially important
problem in the exchange rate context, given the serious specification difficulties which
plague structural exchange rate models) lead Flood and Hodrick to contend that there
is little convincing evidence of bubbles in exchange rates.
      It is unfortunate but true that these tests cannot help us choose between the
bubble hypothesis and the hypothesis of unknown or unobservable fundamentals as
maintained by the equilibrium theorists. Nevertheless, the fact that exchange rate
variation cannot be explained with any existing model of fundamentals is certainly
intuitively consistent with the existence of bubbles, especially when coupled with the
cross-regime evidence.




  1/ A related test, in the context of the German hyperinflation, is Casella (1989).
                                            32
     However, if one is to conclude that speculative bubbles are important in
exchange rate determination, this still leaves us with a rather unsatisfying conclusion.
Rational speculative bubbles are completely indeterminate. It would be nice if
economists could say something more specific about what gets bubbles started or what
causes them to burst, and perhaps also why large bubbles appear to exist in floating
rather than fixed exchange rate regimes. This leads us to the subject of the
microstructure of the foreign exchange market, and the possibility of endogenous
speculative bubbles.


IV. The Micro Evidence on the Foreign Exchange Market


      To repeat a central fact of life, there is remarkably little evidence that
macroeconomic variables have consistent strong effects on floating exchange rates,
except during extraordinary circumstances such as hyperinflations. Such negative
findings have lead the profession to a certain degree of pessimism vis-a-vis exchange
rate research.
      We are somewhat more optimistic about the course of future research in
international finance, in part because of the prospect of new developments that analyze
the market for foreign exchange primarily from a microeconomic perspective. This
 market microstructure" approach represents a radical departure from the traditional
modelling strategy of treating foreign exchange rates as a macroeconomic relative
price. The microeconornic approach to the foreign exchanges is at least potentially
consistent with well-known regularities in the data. For example, the volume of
transactions in foreign exchange markets is very large. The April 1992 surveys
conducted by the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan found that
daily trading totaled $623 billion in New York, London and Tokyo combined, up from
                                            33

$430 billion a day in April 1989. (The global total, including other locations as well, is
considerably higher.) It is difficult to rationalize the well-known high gross (but low
net) volume of trading on foreign exchange markets without some microeconomic
modelling, particularly attention to heterogeneity in the forecasts of market
participants. It is far too early to say whether this research agenda will be successful;
but the beginnings look promising.


      IV.A. The Formation of Expectations


      Expectations of future exchange rate changes are a key determinant of asset
demands, and therefore of the current exchange rate. The expectations variable is
relatively straightforward in the conventional monetary models: in theoretical terms it
is determined by the rational expectations assumption, while in empirical terms it is
typically measured by the forward discount or interest differential. The standard
empirical implementation of rational expectations methodology infers ex ante
expectations of investors from ex post changes in the exchange rate. (This is a
particularly attractive way to measure investors' forecasts in the portfolio-balance
model, where expectations cannot be measured from the forward market because of a
possible exchange risk premium.) However, we may wish to consider a possible failure
of the rational expectations methodology, for example due to learning, or peso
problems arising from infrequent sudden changes in the exchange rate, as are likely in
models like those with speculative bubbles. In this case, we need direct measures of

expectations.


            IV.A.1. Are Expectations Stabilizing or Destabilizing? Survey Data
                                           34

     One of the things we would like to know about expectations is whether they are
stabilizing or destabilizing. Expectations can be described as stabilizing when the effect

of an appreciation today -- relative to some long-run path or mean -- is to induce
market participants to forecast depreciation in the future. If investors act on such
expectations, they will seek to sell the currency, thereby dampening the original
appreciation. This is the stabilizing speculation that Friedman (1953) argued would
thrive under floating rates. Expectations can be described as destabilizing, on the other
hand, when the effect of an appreciation is to induce market participants to forecast
more appreciation in the future. If investors act on such expectations, they will seek to
buy the currency, thereby exaggerating the original appreciation. This 'bandwagon
behavior" can create speculative bubbles. The question then becomes whether
expectations are in fact formed in a stabilizing or destabilizing manner. (This question
is independent of the perennial question of whether expectations are rational, covered
in Lewis's chapter.)
      The forward rate cannot be used to measure expectations if one does not feel
able a priori to rule out the importance of risk. A new data source has been used to
shed light on such questions: the results of surveys of market participants conducted by
financial services firms.1/ Much of the new literature on survey data has been

 surveyed by Takagi (1991).




  1/ These data have also been used for other purposes. One purpose is testing rational
 expectations: Dorninguez (1986); McDonald (1990); Liu and Maddala (1992); Chinn   and
 Frankel (1994). Another purpose is studying the behavior of the risk premium: Froot
 and Frankel (1989); MacDonald and Torrance (1988b, 1990); Cavaglia, Nieuwland,
 Verschoor, and Wolff (1993); Cavaglia, Verschoor, and Wolff (1993a); Frankel and Chinn
 (1993). The earlier part of this literature has been surveyed by Front and Thaler (1990)
 and Hodrick (1988). The survey data have also been used in studies of announcement
 effects and foreign exchange intervention, discussed in Sections I.B.2.b and l.B.1.c of this
 paper, respectively.
                                            35

     Frankel and Froot (1987a) found that investors tended to react to current
appreciations by expecting future depreciations, consistent with either regressive
expectations, adaptive expectations, or distributed-lag expectations, at horizons of one
year, si.x months, or three months. In other words, expectations appeared to be
stabilizing..1/ Subsequent studies, however, indicated that investors at shorter
horizons of one week to one month tend to extrapolate recent trends: Frankel and
Froot (198Th, 1990a), Froot and Ito (1989) and Ito (1994). Expectations at these short
Iorizons appear destabilizing. Since most trading in the foreign exchange market is
known to consist of taking and unwinding positions at horizons measured in hours
rather than months or years, these findings have potentially serious implications.
      Most of the survey services that furnish data for these tests are conducted at
either the short horizons or the long horizons, but not both. This raises the possibility
that different types of market participants form expectations in different ways, and that
some are more heavily represented at the short horizons (call them speculators) and
others at the long horizons (call them investors). The distinction between speculators
and investors is one of several motivations for departing from the assumption that all
participants share the same expectations, which until recently was universally made in
the field, and to focus on heterogeneity.


            EV.A.2. Heterogeneous Expectations
      Some of these articles acknowledge that survey respondents exhibit diverse
opinions, even though a measure of central tendency (usually the median) is typically
used to measure "the" expectation. More recent papers have explicitly pursued the
heterogeneity of expectations, in two ways. One approach is to look for different



 1/ Also Cavaglia, Verschoor and Wolff (1993b).
                                           36

patterns of expectation formation among different classes of actors. The other
approach looks for a relationship between the dispersion of opinion and other
microstructure variables of interest, such as the volume of trade in the market.
     Ito (1990) and MacDonald (1992) have access to dis-aggregated data on survey
responses. Ito examines systematic differences in the behavior of Japanese
respondents, distinguished by function such as banker, trader, corporate economist, etc..
He finds evidence of wishful thinking: Japanese exporters forecast a depreciation of
the yen, and importers an appreciation. MacDonald looks at differences in the
behavior of corporate respondents residing in seven major countries. He finds more
evidence of extrapolative behavior among German respondents than in other countries.
      The brute fact of expectations heterogeneity, regardless of the cause, has
implications for the foreign exchange market. A high dispersion of expectations should
lead to a high volume of trade. Indeed, in the absence of some sort of heterogeneity,
it is hard to see why investors trade at all. Frankel and Froot (1990b) look at
dispersion in the survey data, and find that it is related to a measure of the volume of
trade as well as to market volatility.


            IV.A.3. Technical Analysis
      Frankel and Froot (1986, 1990a,b) reported that "technical analysis' became
increasingly prevalent in the exchange rate forecasting business during the first half of
 the 1980s. Similarly, Taylor and Allen (1992) conducted a questionnaire survey on the
 use of technical analysis in the London foreign exchange in 1988. At least 90 per cent
 of respondents reported placing some weight on technical analysis, with the proportion
 rising steadily with the shortness of the horizon. These short-horizon technical analysts
 bear a striking resemblance to the infamous destabilizing speculators of classical

 financial mythology.
                                          37
     Schulmeister (1987) offered a description of the various rules of technical analysis
that are in widest use, and calculated that all of the rules would have made money over
the period 1973-86. Goodman (1979) also found that the forecasts of technical analysis
performed relatively well as did Levich and Thomas (1993), although Blake, Beenstock,
and Brasse (1986) found the reverse.
     Most of the rules of technical analysis seem to fit into the category of
destabilizing behavior, such as the "momentum" models that call for buying when the
current price exceeds the price that held, for example, five days ago. The rules are
clearly more complicated than simple extrapolation, however, and in some cases may
not be destabilizing at all.1/ Garber and Spencer (1994) argue that the use of
dynamic hedging programs by portfolio managers have been destabilizing in recent
episodes. Of related interest is the paper by De Grauwe and Decupere (1992), which
finds significant evidence of psychological barriers at round numbers in the yen/dollar
market: exchange rates tend to resist movements towards numbers such as 130 or 140
yen to the dollar, but to accelerate away from them once the barriers have been
crossed. Krugman and Miller (1993) have considered the implications of stop-loss
orders for exchange rate determination. Work like this may allow for much more
progress in the future.


           IV.A.4, Models of Chartists. Fundamentalists and Noise Traders
      A number of researchers have deviated from the rational expectations paradigm
to sketch what might be called theories of endogenous speculative bubbles. They
typically start from the proposition that market participants' forecasts are drawn from
competing views, including for example both technical analysis and economic



 1/ Allen and Taylor (1989).
                                           38

fundamentals. From there they attempt to build models of exchange rate
determination.
      Relevant studies include Goodhart (1988), Frankel and Froot (1986, 1990a),
Cutler, Poterba and Summers (1990), De Long, Shleifer, Summers and Waldmann
(1990) nd Goldberg and Frydman (1993a, b).1/ In such models, changes in the
weights assigned by the market to the competing models can themselves alter asset
demands and give rise to changes in the exchange rate. DeGrauwe and Dewachier
(1990) show that the interaction of chartists and fundamentalists can give rise to an
exchange rate process characterized by chaos: a process that is essentially
unpredictable, despite the fact that the underlying model is deterministic.
      This area of research is quite small. However, it is potentially important, since it
is the part of the market microstructure work that is concerned with some of the most
central issues of international finance, such as excess volatility and exchange rate
determination. We hope for further developments.


      IV,B. Trading


      The tremendous level and growth in the volume of trading, particularly in the
New York, London, and Tokyo foreign exchange markets, has been documented in
statistics collected by central banks every three years. An important question is: Who
does all this trading? Typically, a very high fraction of these transactions are reported
to take place among banks; less than five per cent involve importers, exporters or other
non-financial compan.ies.2/ Traders at most banks take large positions for a few


 1/ The implications of a mixture of noise traders and regressive expectations for the
question of systematic differences in rates of return on currencies are considered in Evans

  /
and Lewis (1992).
      E.g., Frankel and Froot (1990b).

hours, but limit their overnight positions sharply, or close them out altogether.1/
Recently, new players such as hedge funds and other institutional investors have
become more important.V Much of the work on market microstructure has
analyzed the process and characteristics of trading on foreign exchange markets; we
now survey that literature.


            IV.B.1. The Nature of Trading and Volatility
      The market micro-structure literature has been successful in uncovering a number
of trading regularities in the data. For instance there is evidence of "time
deformation."


                  IV.B,1,a. Time-Varying Volatility. Trading Volume. and Location
      Goodhart and Giugale (1993) and Wasserfallen and Zimmerman (1985) have
observed systematic patterns to intra-day volatility. They find that volatility is smaller
during intervals when trading volume is known to be smaller, such as over the weekend
and over the lunch hour, and is especially large during the first hour of Monday trading
for each currency in its own market (i.e., in the domestic countly), even when markets
 in other time zones have opened earlier. Such findings suggest either that residents
 have a comparative advantage at processing news regarding their own currencies, or
else that trading is in some sense largely unrelated to news, perhaps even that trading
 activity per se generates volatility. Of related interest is Batten and Bhar (1993), who
 explore the observed statistical relationship between trading volume and price changes,




  /
  1/ Fieleke (1981).
       Hedge funds manage portfolios for a small number of relatively large individual
 investors. They deal heavily in derivatives, but the implication of the name is the reverse
 of the truth: they speculate rather than hedge. On the topic of the new institutional
 investors, see International Monetary Fund (1993).
                                             40

in yen futures markets in three locations. They find, contrary to their expectations, that
the relationship does not depend on the size of the market, and they suspect an
asymmetry in the role of information flows emanating from the U.S. and Japan.
      Many econometricians have observed that exchange rate volatilities change over
time. The ARCH model (AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) has become
a very popular way of addressing time-varying variances. Bollerslev, Chou and Kroner
(1992) offer a general survey. The pattern of time-varying variances matters for the
statistical properties of econometric tests of all sorts of propositions, such as those
covered in this survey. The pattern matters particularly when investor behavior is
thought to depend on perceived uncertainty, as in the literature on time-varying risk
premiums surveyed by Frankel (1988) and the chapter by Lewis. Here we consider
only the evidence relevant to microstructure.
      Engle, Ito and Lin (1990, 1992) examine intra-day yen/dollar volatility in four
markets: Europe, New York, Pacific, and Tokyo. They find that upswings in volatility
in one market are passed on as higher volatility to the next market, an ARCH pattern
that they describe by analogy with a global meteor shower and interpret as evidence of
information processing. Baillie and Bollerslev (1991) also find evidence of the meteor
shower in hourly data on four exchange rates. In each case they also find evidence of
increased volatility occurring around the opening and closing of each of the three
major world markets, London, New York, and Tokyo. There also appears to be a
correlation of intra-day patterns in volatility and volume (e.g., high at the opening and
closings of markets). The question becomes whether high volume and volatility reflect
the efficient processing of information regarding fundamentals, or something else (such
as noise trading).
      Jorion (1994) seeks to test one important microstructure theory. The theory says
that the correlation between trading volume and volatility should be positive when the
                                           41

source of trading volume is disagreement (heterogeneity of beliefs), but the correlation
should be negative when volume is determined by the number of traders, due to
averaging over larger numbers (liquidity) should reduce variability. He finds support
for the theory, in that the variance is observed to depend negatively on a time trend
intended to reflect the growing number of traders, and otherwise to depend positively
on volume. He uses options prices to obtain an implicit measure of the anticipated
component of the variance, rather than the usual ARCH approach.
                 IV.B.1.b. The Bid-Ask Spread. Volatility and Volume
      Jorion also looks at the bid-ask spread, the standard measure of transactions
costs. He confirms earlier findings (Glassman, 1987, and Bessembinder, 1993) that the
spread widens before weekends and holidays, supporting the liquidity effect. He also
confirms earlier findings that the bid-ask spread depends positively on the variance, but
negatively on volume. He and Wei (1994) use the option-implied volatility for this
purpose. Glassman, (1987), Boothe (1988), Bollerslev and Domowitz (1993), Bollerslev
and Melvin (1994), and Lee (1994), use GARCH models of the variance in their tests
of the effect on the bid-ask spread.
      The presumption here is that information is processed efficiently. At a time
when beliefs are particularly heterogenous and therefore trading volume is particularly
high, the presumption is that the market is responding to a rapid generation of
information.
      Hsieh and Kleidon (1994) cast some doubt on the proposition that information is
processed efficiently. Their point of departure is a model by Admati and Pileiderer. It
features a crucial distinction between well-informed traders and liquidity traders. Some
of the iquidity traders have some discretion as to when they trade, and so seek to trade
 at a time when high volume drives down the cost of transaction. (This is the liquidity
 effect on the bid-ask spread.) Hsieh and Kleidon confirm the correlation of volume
                                           42

and volatility that the Admati-Pfleiderer model is designed to explain: there is a
bunching of volume and volatility at both the open and the close in the foreign
exchange market.
      A deeper look uncovers serious problems, however. First, the bid-ask spread is
observed to go     not down, at the open and close, contradicting the notion that
liquidity traders are deliberately bunching at these times to save on transactions costs.
Second, at the close in London, when volume and volatility are high in that market,
there is no detectible simultaneous effect in the open New York market. This seems to
contradict existing models of asymmetric information, which presuppose a common
knowledge of economic structure despite the existence of idiosyncratic information. If
volatility is high in London because information relevant to the pound/dollar rate is
coming out, then why shouldn't the same effect show up in the pound/dollar rate in the
New York market?
      Hsieh and Kieldon think that the answer lies in models where information is
aggregated imperfectly and inventories are important. They take at their word traders
who explain that at morning open, they need to get a feel" for the market by trading,
thus explaining the combination of high trading volume, high volatility and high spreads
in the morning. Towards evening close, traders are anxious to unload excess
inventories, explaining the reappearance of the heightened volume, volatility and

spreads.




            IV.B.2. The Behavior of Market-Makers


      In equity markets, research into microstructure has explored such questions as
whether the existence and behavior of "market-makers" responsible for market clearing
                                           43
makes a difference. Several researchers have begun to extend this exploration of
microstructure to the foreign exchange market.
     The foreign exchange market is a decentralized, quote-driven dealership market"
(Lyons, 1993). In other words, it is a phone-and-computer network over which dealers
(both traders at banks, who can take open positions, and brokers who do not) quote
bid and offer prices, and then consummate transactions. These communications are
purely bilateral, so that the prices and quantities traded are not transparent as they are
in other financial markets.
      Lyons (1991) is a first cut at a microstructural perspective. It models customer
order flow as the source of information asymmetry among dealers. The configuration
of the market can lead to an externality in the processing of information. To the
extent that dealers have market power and are risk averse, their trading behavior will
not result in prices that reveal all information fully. The main result is that the greater
the market power and risk-aversion of dealers, the less revealing are prices.
      Lyons (1993) investigates these issues using a data set on five days in the life of a
single market-maker, containing the time-stamped transaction prices and quantities in
the New York mark-dollar market.I/ Earlier high-frequency data, e.g., Goodhart's 13
weeks of "indicative quotes" obtained from the Reuters screen, did not include actual




  1/ More specifically, the data set consists of time-stamped inter-dealer quotes and
trades, the market-maker's indirect (brokered) trades, and the time-stamped prices and
quantities for transactions mediated by a broker.
                                           44

order flow or transaction prices.1/ Lyons finds evidence of two different channels
whereby trading volume generates movements in the bid and offer rates quoted by
individual dealers: the inventory-control channel; and the information channel.
Inventory costs create incentives for market-makers to change prices so as to control
their positions. However, if some traders have better information than others, it is also
rational for market-makers to adjust their own beliefs, and price quotes, in response to
order flow.
      Lyons (1994) uses the same data set to test an additional effect on the
transactions price: the effect of the quantity traded. He seeks to shed light on two
competing theories of why trading volume is sometimes very high. What he calls the
"event uncertainty" view is that high trading volume indicates that information is being
processed rapidly. What he calls the "Hot Potato" theory is that high trading volume
 indicates that little information is being processed. Rather, "liquidity-trader" customers
 are placing orders with their traders, who then unload their over-extended positions on
 other traders, who continue to pass the exposure like a hot potato (consistent with the
 Admati-Pfleiderer model of discretionary liquidity traders tested by Hsieh and
 Kleidon). The evidence supports the Hot-Potato view: the quantity traded has a


   1/ Goodhart and Figliuoli (1991). Goodhart, Ito and Payne (1994) suggest that a good
 deal of skepticism is warranted regarding such "indicative quotes," i.e., the bid and ask
 quotes that are posted to all potential customers. Traders usually set better prices when
 they transact with each other. Goodhart, Ito and Payne use data from a new trading
 system, the Reuters 2000-2, to compare actual transactions prices [via this new electronic
 broker] with the indicative quotes ("FXFX"). They find that movements in the two are
 very close, so that for some purposes either series can be used. But the behavior of the
 margin between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price, known in the UK as the
 "touch," in the Reuters 2000-2 data is quite different from the behavior of the spread
 between the FXFX bid and ask quotes. In the first case the two prices are both firm and
 they are normally input by different banks; in the second the quotes are both indicative
 and they are always from the same bank. In other words, one should not mistake the
 publicly posted bid and ask prices for the prices at which foreign exchange traders trade
 with each other. Fortunately, Lyons' (1993, 1994) data set constitutes direct   observation
                                                                             smaller still, as

significant effect only when the time between transactions is long. When the time
between transactions is short, the quantity traded has no significant effect on the
trader's prices, suggesting that the trader views these orders as coming from liquidity
traders rather than informed traders.


      IV.C, An Early Assessment of the Market Micro-Structure Literature


      The foreign exchange research on market microstructure is newborn. It has a
long way to go before it can claim to produce a model of exchange rate determination.
After realistic models of dealer behavior are constructed, the desirable next step is to
let such dealers interact in the market place, in order to derive a central tendency to
the torrent of bid and offer quotes and transaction prices in which each individual
deals. That central tendency would be what in macroeconomic models we call "the"
market-clearing exchange rate. Then the interaction among dealers needs to be
imbedded in the larger universe of borrowers, lenders, importers and exporters, who
play a role in the foreign exchange market, so that economic fundamentals can
ultimately be brought back in. Such a strategy might lead to models of endogenous
speculative bubbles that could account for some of the problematic empirical findings
reviewed in this survey, especially if such bubbles could be more easily formed in
regimes of flexible exchange rates.
     This said, the market microstructure literature is a long way from achieving these
goals. Much has been learned about volatility, volume, and bid-ask spreads, from the
studies described in section IV.B; little as yet about central issues like the sources and
persistence of heterogeneous beliefs, excess volatility, and exchange rate determination.
The macroeconomic literature on exchange rates has not provided the right answers.
                                            46
But we believe it does have the right questions. Research like that described in section
IV.A might turn out to point the right direction.


V. Conclusion: Endogenous Speculative Bubbles?


      Although the evidence of Meese and Rogoff and others on the failure of the
standard models based on monetary fundamentals to predict at short horizons still
holds, there is more reason at longer horizons to pay attention to some of the models,
such as the Dornbusch overshooting theory. Three independent strands of research are
consistent with the hypothesis that the exchange rate may move in the direction
suggested by the Dornbusch model, but in an inertia-laden manner that is inconsistent
with the standard rational expectations approach. The hypothesis can be described as
"overshooting the overshooting equilibrium."
      The three strands are as follows. (1) Tests of bias in the forward market show a
persistent pattern whereby the exchange rate not only (on average) fails to move in line
with the predictions of the forward discount or interest differential, but actually moves
in the opposite direction. Neither those who interpret the forward discount bias as a
risk premium nor those who interpret it as a systematic prediction error have been able
to explain convincingly why the correlation with the forward discount should be

negative.
      (2) Some researchers claim an ability for fundamentals models to pick the
direction of movement, relative to the current spot rate, especially at longer horizons.
As noted in section LC.1 above, Woo (1986), Somanath (1986), Mark (1992) and a
number of others claim, essentially, that a convex combination of the monetary model
and the lagged spot rate can outperform the lagged spot rate. The robustness of such
results can never be taken for granted. Long data sets are needed for a definitive
                                             47

evaluation. Nevertheless, there is some reason to think that, notwithstanding puzzling
short-run dynamics that are observed in the foreign exchange markets, the models win
out in the end.1/
      (3) As explained in section I.B.2, unexpected changes in monetary policy do in
fact frequently cause movements in the exchange rate in the direction hypothesized by
the sticky-price monetary model. For example, news of contractionary American
monetary policy that raises interest rates is associated with dollar appreciation. There
is some reason, however, to believe that the instantaneous reaction is less than the
medium-term reaction, i.e., that the exchange rate tends subsequently to continue to
move in the same direction, notwithstanding that this finding is inconsistent with
rational expectations. For instance, Eichenbaum and Evans (1993) find that it takes an
estimated two years for the exchange rate to undergo the full reaction to an unexpected
change in monetary policy. Clarida and Gali, 1994, also find a lag before the peak
effect.
      The Eichenbaum-Evans pattern, if it is confirmed in subsequent research, would
explain the longstanding puzzle regarding the forward discount bias, the first item listed
above: the dollar appreciates gradually in the aftermath of an increase in the interest
differential, rather than contemporaneously as the rational-expectations form of the
overshooting model (or of any other model) says it should. An interval during which
the interest differential is high is thus an interval during which the currency is likely to
be appreciating, rather than depreciating. This would explain why the interest




  1/ There is an analogy with the tests of the proposition whether the real exchange rate
follows a random walk, against the alternative of a slow return toward a long-run
equilibrium. It is by now widely accepted that the slow return to equilibrium is there, but
the power of unit root tests in twenty years of data is very low and so one needs a century
of data to find it (or a cross-section).
                                             48
differential or forward discount on average points in the wrong direction. The question
then becomes: Why does the currency appreciate gradually, rather than suddenly?
     The rudiments of a theory of endogenous speculative bubbles, and therefore an
answer to the question, may lie in the microstructure of the foreign exchange markets.
Such a theory must contain three elements: (i) a role for fundamentals that puts an
eventual limit on the extent to which a speculative bubble can carry the market away
from equilibrium, so that fundamentals win out in the long run, (ii) something like a
combination of risk-aversion and model uncertainty (as suggested by the existing
heterogeneity of forecasting techniques) that in the short-run is capable of breaking the
usual rational-expectations arbitrage linking the exchange rate to its long-run
equilibrium, and (iii) some short-run dynamics that arise from the trading process itself
(e.g., noise trading that generates volatility which swamps macro fundamentals on a
short-term basis). These three elements could be described, respectively, as (i) the
eventual bursting of speculative bubbles, (ii) the potential for speculative bubbles, (iii)
the endogenous genesis and prolongation of speculative bubbles. We are hopeful that
more will be accomplished on these research frontiers soon.
