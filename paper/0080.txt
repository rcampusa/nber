     Inequality    in economic well—being is an important contemporary issue.

Historically most studies have dealt with inequality in annual earnings or

wages1 based on cross section data or on changes in these cross sections

over time and space. See, for example, the works of Mincer (1974) and

Chiswick (1974).

     Recent developments in human capital theory stress the need to consider

a broader definition of economic well being encompassing life cycle behavior.

Major contributions by Becker (1964), Ben—Porath (1967), and Mincer (1974)

emphasize individual decisions which affect lifetime earning patterns such as

years and quality of schooling and the level and pattern of on—the—job post—

schooling investment as in Mincer and Polachek (1974).

     The basic model presented in Ben—Porath (1967) has become a popular

vehicle for detailed refinement of models of optimal life cycle investment

in human capital. The basic model, considered by Haley (1973), Johnson (1970),

Lillard (1973), Rosen (1973), and Wallace and Ihnen (1974), assumes individual



     'Some studies have dealt with non—human earnings and wealth but these
will not be elaborated here. For an example see some of the papers in
James D. Smith (1975).

maximization of discounted earnings net of investments. Individuals choose

"optimal" schooling periods and lifetime patterns of investment levels

depending on their own endowments, constraints, and abilities. These

endogenous decisions then determine a lifetime pattern of earnings1 which

has greatest present value.

     This maximum present value is termed human wealth. The individual then

maximizes his intertemporal utility subject to this wealth constraint.

     This formulation begs several questions but so far provides the broadest

range of clear predictions. Some of the more important omissions include the

choice between labor, investment, and leisure over the lifetime, patterns of

consumption, non—market returns to schooling, and risk and uncertainty as

well as obvious extensions to entire families. These and other aspects have

been studied by Heckman (1975), Smith (1974), Stafford and Stephan (1973),

Michael (1972), Levhari and Weiss (1972), Razin (1973), Blinder and Weiss

(1975) and Ghez and Becker (1974).

     All of the foregoing studies unquestionably point to the use of longitudinal

data which observes the same individuals over long periods of time, preferably

an entire lifetime.

     The objective of this paper is to draw some inferences concerning the

relative magnitudes of inequality in annual earnings, the traditional measure,

and in human wealth, the measure suggested by recent literature2. A second



     'Details of individual solutions and further constraints are available
in the reference cited and will not be elaborated here.

        similar approach is taken in Lillard (1975) where the emphasis was
demonstrating the usefulness of empirical earnings functions for generating
earnings and human wealth distributions and a more detailed account of when
human wealth may be considered an index of lifetime economic well—being.

objective is to assess the relative-importance of schooling, measured ability

and to a limited extent family background in earnings and human wealth

inequality as well as the overall contribution of these variables combined.

A unique feature of this study is the estimation of earnings and human wealth

and their distribution for a group of men for which several age—earnings

data points are available over almost an entire lifetIme (ages eighteen to

fifty—four).

     This study concludes first that human wealth is substantially more equally

distributed than is earnings, either over all or by age group, for this

NBER—Th population as measured by the coefficient of variation. These

inequalities are remarkably insensitive to either discounting or length of

working life. A second conclusion is that the contribution of schooling,

measured cognitive ability, and a limited set of background variables to

variation in human wealth is roughly the same as its contribution to variation

in earnings within age groups. Both are roughly ten to twelve percent.

Thirdly, while schooling has a much larger effect on annual earnings than

ability, at any age, it is much more sensitive to discounting in human wealth

calculations due to the period of foregone earnings. As noted by Griliches

and Mason (1972) and several studies cited in Jencks (1972), cognitive

ability has a negligible effect on the earnings of young men. However,

in the NBER—TH population the effect becomes more substantial and positive

as the men become older. The result is a substantial effect of cognitive

ability on human wealth which persists even at high discount rates where the

return to schooling has turned negative.

       In the following sections we will present the model, the data, predicted

earnings and human wealth, earnings distributions, human wealth distributions

and more detailed results.

                              ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

       For our    present purposes we will simply assert that human wealth may

index lifetime economic well—being or at least that it is a less myopic

Indicator than annual earnings. We will assume that the individuals in the

population behave in such a way as to maximize the present value of net

earnings and that the resulting optimal age—earnings patterns can be

approximated by a polynomial earnings function.1



       The earnings function to be estimated is of the form

  where

         Age is    chronological age in years
         Sch is years of schooling
         Abil is an index of cognitive ability

  and Soc Is a vector of family background variables

             including parent's education, number of siblings, religion and

            number of pre—high school moves.

The   polynomial   order   is determined by the data by selecting a, b, and g such
that higher orders will not significantly reduce variance. The assumed error

     1The optimization assumption is meant to impute theoretical content to the
calculated values but is in no way necessary for their estimation. The present
value of lifetime earnings may be interesting for other reasons.

structure plays a crucial role in estimating human wealth and its

distribution. Earnings are composed of a component systematically related

to observed variables, Y, a component due to unobserved but individual

specific variables S, and a purely random or transitory component, I.e.

for individual      n



(2)     Y(Age) = Y(Age                          + 6n ÷
                                                         'nAge


The error components     tS   and   i are assumed independent of each other and

over individuals, are uncorrelated with Age, Sch, Abil, and Soc and n        is
homoschedastic with respect to individuals and Age; therefore, ''(O,c) and

r "    (O,cT2).   For empirical purposes we will later define       such that the

present value of deviations from it, A' is zero for any one individual.

      Human wealth is defined as the present value of post schooling earnings

net of investments in training. We correspondingly caluculate estimated human

wealth as the present value of observed earnings discounted to age sixteen1

for common reference, i.e.

an Individual is no longer legally constrained to school attendance and may
begin to make his own investment decisions.

                              THE POPULATION

     The population under study is the NBER—TH survey group. Inferences

are made only for this population since it may not be representative of any

broader group. The NBER—TH sample is based on a group of males volunteering

for Air Force pilot, navigator, and bombardier programs in the last

half of 1943. These volunteers were given initial screening tests and a set

of twenty tests to measure various cognitive abilities. Thorudike and Hagen

(1959) sent a questionnaire to a sample of 17,000 of these men in 1955 which

included a question on 1955 earnings. The NBER sent to a subset of these

a subsequent questionnaire in 1969 which included additional questions on

earnings in later years and questions on schooling and initial job earnings.

     The data include five separate approximately equally spaced points on

the age—income profile as well as the year of initial job, year of last full—

time schooling, years of choo1ing, and the twenty separate measures of

ability. The age—income points are approximately initial job, 1955, 1960,

1964, and 1968. The observed age range is nineteen to fifty—seven years but

with less than 1 percent outside the range nineteen to fifty—five.

     Specifically, Table I presents the distribution of age—earnings data points

by year interval and by number of points for all 5089 individuals in the sample.

     The results reported in this paper are based on the 4699 individuals for

which two to five age—earnings points (a total of 15387) are observed.

     The individuals in the sample differ from the U.S. male population as a

whole in several ways.      First the sample includes a high ability group. All

of the men completed high school or high school equivalency examinations, and

passed the initial screening for the Air Force flight program. Their general

health was better than the general population in 1969. They were more

homogenous in height and weight due to military qualifications. They seem

to have a high degree of self confidence and self reliance. Some of these

factors may however be related to the high ability. In addition, all of the men

had the G.I. Bill available to help finance their schooling.

     The ability index used here is one aggregated by the first principal

component of a larger set of ability test scores corresponding approximately

to IQ like attributes including mathematics, reading comprehension, and

mechanical principles. These test scores were measured approximately just post

high school upon entrance into the military and application for pilot and navi-

gator school. These individuals clearly had an incentive to perform well on

tests, which overcomes some of the problems suggested by Jencks (1972).

                       EARNINGS AND HUMAN WEALTH

    Earnings and   human   wealth are estimated in stages.   First the basic

earnings   function Y(Age, Sch, Abil, Soc) is estimated as that polynomial
surface which "best" fits the data in the   sense of minimum   error variance
without   excessive order. That is, additional order polynomials are introduced

until they fail to significantly1 reduce error variance. The best equation is

found to be cubic in age, quadratic in years of schooling, and quadratic in

cognitive ability with full (fifth order) interaction. The social variables



    1Significance at the five percent level.
                                      10




contribute additively shifting the surface up or down. While this earnings

function is more complex than the usual additive linear versions It fully reveals

the interactive nature of the relationships. The R2 for this regression

is .3012.

       Representative age—earnings profiles based on this earnings function are

presented in Figure 1 for a Protestant with average levels of all other

social variables. Mean values of background variables and their contribution

to annual earnings are presented in Table 2.

       The life cycle earnings patterns and differences in those patterns due to

schooling and ability levels are clearly represented. Earnings rise over the

lifetime and rise more rapidly for the more educated and the more able.

For example, between the ages forty and forty—five earnings rise at a rate of

556 dollars per year for the college graduate of mean ability while at a rate

of 366 dollars for a high school graduate and 880 dollars for a professional or

Ph.D. of mean ability. For a college graduate, earnings rise at a rate of

494 dollars per year for an individual one standard deviation below mean

ability and 627 dollars for an individual one standard deviation above mean

ability. It is'clear that within this population a standard deviation change

from mean schooling has a greater impact at every postschooling age

than the same change from mean ability.

     Both the more educated and the more able initially, prior to age thirty,1

have lower earnings due to higher levels of job training investment which

in turn causes future earnings to rise more rapidly. This empirical

relationship illustrates the finding in previous studies, e.g., Griliches

and Mason and many works cited in Jencks, that measured cognitive ability has

little effect on earnings "at early ages." It is important to note that

almost all studies of the effect of ability on earnings have been based on

young, under thirty—five years, men. Since ability has its greatest effect

late in the life cycle, either using young samples or ignoring interaction

with age substantially understates the effect of ability.

     Another important finding not illustrated in Figure 1 is the strong

positive interaction between ability and schooling operating primarily through

the age earnings relationship, i.e., when a lifetime is considered. That is,

schooling has a greater impact on the age—earnings relationship for more able

persons and vice versa. These same positive interactions are also quite evident

in their effect on human wealth.

     Estimates of mean human wealth are calculated by summing discounted

earnings predicted by the earnings function,2 i.e.


                               N-l6
       HW (Sch, Abil, Soc) =       Y(t,Sch, Abil,Soc)/(l+r)t
                               tSch+l—lO



     1Age thirty is also approximately the age at which the individual begins
to surpass his own mean lifetime earnings.
     2Estimates of human wealth exclude consideration of earnings while in school,
for which no data are available, and lower earnings incurred while in military
service. Age—earnings profiles are assumed to be flat beyond the upper end of the
sample age range, about age fifty—two, since the profiles in Figure 1 appear to
peak there.

               NOTE:   Human wealth is defined as the present value of lifetime earnings at age sixteen and
                       is calculated from predicted annual earnings. The Ability index is distributed with
                       mean one and standard deviation .25.

The contribution of the variables in this relationship to mean human wealth

are summarized briefly in Table 2. Predicted values of human wealth for

several combinations of schooling and ability for a Protestant with mean

values for other background variables are presented in Table 3. Predicted

values of human wealth may be obtained for other background combinations by

using Tables 2 and 3 together.1


     Perhaps the most striking result is that while schooling has a larger

effect on annual earnings than ability, at any age, It is much more sensitive

to discounting due to the period of foregone earnings. When undiscounted,

schooling clearly has the dominant effect on lifetime earnings. However,

cognitive ability continues to have a positive effect on human wealth at

discount rates beyond seven percent while the effect of schooling turns negative

at approximately five percent depending upon the individual's ability. This

clearly illustrates the strong positive interaction between ability and

schooling in their effect on human wealth. More able persons gain more

human wealth from additional schooling than do less able persons and the returns

to greater ability are greatest at higher levels of schooling. A less obvious

result is that for this population, contrary to other studies, the returns to

schooling increase rather than decrease with more schooling. Similarly,

the return to additional ability is an increasing function of ability. This

result may be partially due to the population composition of only highly able

and well—educated men.

     Many studies recently, Leibowitz (1974), and Stafford and Hill (1974) for

example, have been concerned with parents' investments in their children.

While the set of background data used here is quite limited we may get some



     'Estimates of the internal rate of return to consecutive years of schooling
by ability level are reported in a separate paper by the author.
                                  16



idea of their relative importance to earnings and human wealth. As is

often found in other studies, mother's education has a slightly larger

effect on son's earnings, and human wealth, than does the father's education,

by roughly twenty percent. Consider, for example, that these estimates imply

that the mother's attainment of a college degree versus a high school degree

is associated with an increase of 17,776 dollars in undiscounted lifetime

earnings, compared to 14,784 dollara for the same change in father's education.

This is roughly thirty percentas large as the effect of the son's own college

attainment over high school for an average ability son.   The effect of parents'

education is enhanced by their strong positive correlation.

     The number of siblings has the expected negative effect on earnings and

human wealth while the number of pre—high school family moves, geographic,

has an insignificant positive effect. By far the largest background effect

is due to religion, particularly if the son is Jewish'.

     The direct effect of these background variables on earnings and human

wealth appear to be rather small compared to schooling and ability. These

variables also indirectly affect earnings and human wealth through their effect

on schooling and ability which is not accounted for here2. Secondly, the



     1Part of the effect of this variable may be due to the city size of the
respondents' residence since much of the Jewish population resides in the New
York metropolitan area which has substantially hLgher wages than most other
parts of the United States.

        detailed study of these indirect effects is underway by the author in
the context of a full recursive system relating background, ability, achooling,
and lifetime patterns of earnings and occupational choice.

Note:    Skewness is measured by the square root of E(X—)3/S3.   Coefficient of variation is SIX.      The ability
         index is distributed with mean one and standard deviation .25.

large individual variance component, S         ,   may be due partly to yet

unmeasured background characteristics. Parents' education is only a crude

proxy for the quality of the child's home environment and resources allocated

to the child's early education.


               DISPERSION IN EARNINGS AND HUMAN WEALTH


     Dispersion   in   earnings and human wealth arises from the underlying

dispersion of their determining characteristics. In this section we will

assess the magnitudes of dispersion or inequality, measured by the coefficient

of variation, in earnings relative to human wealth. A second objective is

to assess the relative importance of schooling, ability, and background as

determinants of inequality in human wealth.

     Table 4 presents selected statistics for the distribution of annual

earnings observed in the NBER—TH population for an aggregate of all age—earnings

points observed for the whole population, as well as for schooling, ability,

and age sub—groups. The same statistics are given for the distribution of

annual earnings values predicted from the estimated earnings function

Y(Age, Sch, Abil, Soc). Roughly thirty percent of the variation in annual

earnings is "explained" by schooling, ability, and background variables.

     An estimate of human wealth, 11W      ,   is made   for each individual in the

population based first on his schooling, ability, and background by summing

discounted predicted earnings as in equation (4). This distribution is

labeled as the distribution of human wealth "due to schooling, ability, and

background" and selected statistics for it are presented in Table 5 for several

rates of discount.

     A second estimate of each individual's human wealth is obtained by

utilizing the individual's full observed earnings history. An estimate is

made of each individual's own weighted mean deviation, 6   ,   from the aggregate
age—earnings profile based simply on schooling, ability, and background via

equation (5). Since by construction the present value of observed deviations

from 6 is zero, HW given by equation (3) estimates the individual's "total"

human wealth due to all sources, observed and unobserved. Selected statistics

for 11W are presented in Table 5. 6 is distributed over the population with

weighted standard deviation $6054, $5283, $4871, and $4555 for discount rates

of zero, 3 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent respectively. A range of two to

five and a mean of 3.2 age—earnings points are observed for each individual.

Each observation is weighted in proportion to the number of age—earnings points

observed for that individual.


              Inequality in Earnings versus Human Wealth


     The primary conclusion is that human wealth is substantially more equally

distributed than are annual earnings. This result holds whether considering

overall earnings or earnings within narrowly defined age groups. The result

holds whether comparing predictions based on schooling, ability, and background

or the total and actual values. An interesting side point is that inequality

measured by the coefficient of variation is scarcely affected by either the discount

rate or the assumed retirement age1. The following will accordingly omit



     1Several retirement ages were considered including a retirement age differing
by years of schooling estimated as the mean retirement age for that schooling
group based on labor force participation rates. It made virtually no difference
in the inequality conclusions reached here.

detail reference to them unless necessary. The overall coefficient of

variation in total human wealth is approximately 43 percent while the

corresponding value for actual earnings is 75 percent. Even with the

narrowly defined age groups earnings inequality is above 60 percent for

mature men, over thirty. Inequality is 50 to 80 percent greater in earnings

than in human wealth. It is interesting to note that the long noted skewness

in earnings perseveres in the human wealth distributions and is largely due

to positive skew in 6       .   Skewness is roughly of the same order of magnitude

for both earnings and human wealth although slightly larger for earnings.

     Differences in inequality persist in the distributions due only to schooling,

ability, and background. The coefficient of variation is 15 percent for HW

41 percent for Y , and above 18 percent for all age groups. Since the age—

earnings patterns are a primary source of differences in Y, inequality is at a

minimum   within   age groups, having only half the inequality of the overall

distribution. Within age groups inequality is still 20 percent greater in

earnings, Y , than human wealth, 11W



     klnless otherwise stated the following will be values for the overall
aggregate distribution. All conclusions are valid within subgroups.

    Contribution of Schooling, Ability, and Background to Inequality


     A second conclusion is that the contribution1of schooling, measured

cognitive ability, and a limited set of background variables to variation in

human wealth is roughly the same as its contribution to variation in earnings

within age groups. Both are roughly 10 to 12 percent. Age (or experience)

is a primary determinant of earnings; it and the other variables explain just

over 30 percent of overall variation in earnings2. Adding 5 undiscounted

to the earnings function3 boosts explanatory power to nearly 70 percent. Un-

observed individual differences4 account for a large portion of variation in

both earnings and human wealth.


                        Summary and Conclusion


     One of the primary predictions of life cycle models of human capital

theory has been a life cycle pattern of investments which decline over time and

which yield compensating returns later. Both tend to produce individual

earnings profiles which rise more rapidly for those with larger early

investments and profiles which are concave. The attributes are roughly

confirmed for the NBER—TH population. Both more able and more schooled




    1Contribution is used loosely here as, for example, Var(HW)/Var(HW ) and
Var(YIA)/Var(YIA).

     2The explanatory power is much greater for the natural log of earnings,
around 45 percent, but in both cases the simple correlation between predicted
and observed earnings are the same to the third decimal. See Lillard (1973).

     3A more detailed study of this breakdown is under study by the author.

     4Many of these unobserved differences may occur during the life cycle in
the form of differences in job mobility and work history as illustrated in the
current work of Mincer and Bartel.

 individuals who are presumably investing more are compensated by more

rapidly rising earnings and higher earnings late in the life cycle.

    To what extent are these differences in earnings patterns "compensated"

in present value? Since each individual is assumed to maximize his lifetime

position given his endowments and constraints there is no presumption that

each individual's maximum should be the same, i.e., no inequality in human

wealth. In this population where a lifetime of data are available we observe

less inequality in human wealth than earnings, even within narrow age groups,

but not a complete absence of inequality. The coefficient of variation in

human wealth is approximately 43 percent compared to 75 percent in earning,

and 60 percent within age groups.

     A second set of issues relatto the importance of schooling and measured

cognitive ability both relative to each other and relative to other effects

in human wealth inequality. While both explain a substantial portion of the

variation in earnings, much of the variation is in the form of life cycle pattern

differences and is thus compensated. Within age groups and over a lifetime,

as for human wealth, schooling, ability, and background "explain" roughly

10 to 12 percent of total variation. Whether this is large or small depends

on one's point of view given that these are only a few attributes relative

to the many which must influence an individual's lifetime.
