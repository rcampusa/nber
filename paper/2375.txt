                   Household Formation and Home Ownership:

                    The Impacts of Demographics and Taxes




                                  ABSTRACT




      This paper summarizes the impact of economic, social and demographic

variables on household formations and home ownership in the 1960—85 period and

uses this knowledge to forecast household formations, and their split between

owners and renters, through the year 2000. High and low growth forecasts are

reported, both with and without enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The

forecasts are compared with those of others.

     Net household formations are expected to be robust through 1990 (above 1½

million per year), but to tail off sharply in the l990s (down to 1 million by

2000). Home ownership should rise slightly in the 1990s.

          The projected change in households and its mix between owners and renters

is of considerable importance to homebuilders, realtors, and residential

mortgage lenders. An increase in households will increase new construction,

residential sales, and the demand for mortgage credit. Moreover, the own/rent

mix   i    a major determinant of the distribution between single and multifamily

construction, sales, and mortgage demand.

          Between 1962 and 1982, the baby boomers came of age. The share of the

U.S. population in their twenties increased by over 50 percent, and household

formations soared. This share is now decreasing dramatically. As a result,

some have concluded that the bloom is off the housing rose and retrenchment is

at hand (Apgar and Brown, 1982 and Sternlieb and Hughes, 1986). This view is

premature. The second half of the l980s will likely establish a new high for

household growth. This growth will recede sharply in the 1990s, however,

especially if the basic provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 remain in

place.

         The maturation of the baby boomers also altered the aggregate

distribution of households between owners and renters. Because households in

their twenties are far more likely to rent than are older households, the

aggregate ownership rate was lowered. Because the baby-boomer generation is

marrying later and staying married less, and because nonmarried couple

households are far more likely to rent than are married couples, the aggregate

ownership rate was further lowered. Only an enormous general increase in age—

specific ownership rates in response to sharply rising real income in the 1960s

and early 1970s and plummeting real after-tax interest rates in the late l960s

and throughout the 1970s prevented a substantial decline in the aggregate

homeowner ship rate.

      The further aging of the baby-boomers will sharply increase aggregate

home ownership in the next decade, although a continued shift from married

couples to single and other households will act to offset this. In the absence

of changes in age—specific ownership rates, the "normal" two—thirds/one—third

split between owners and renters would be roughly maintained. However, the

decline in owner costs and rise in rental costs expected to follow from the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 should lead to a rise in the ownership rate.
  -
      This   paper is divided into five sections. Section I contains a

discussion of the 1960-85 data on the U.S. population and its proclivities both

to form married, single and "other" households and to own and rent residences.

The role of economic factors in the decisions to form households and to own or

rent are examined in Sections II and III. Alternative forecasts for the

numbers of owning and renting households through the year 2000 are presented in

Section IV. A summary concludes the paper.


                               I. The 1960-85 Data

      Table 1 lists the population shares for the nine age cohorts in 1960,

1970, 1980 and five—year intervals through 2000 (the data after 1985 being

Census projections). The major changes in these shares reflect the shifting of

the post-World War II baby boomers through the population. Between 1960 and

1970 the 10—24 age group expanded; between 1970 and 1980 it was the 20-34

group. The big gainer between 1980 and 1990 will be the 30-44 group, and the

40-54 cohort will be expanding in the 1990s. The population age distribution
                                       —3—




 affects the numbers of owning and renting households importantly because both

 the headship rate (the proportion of the population that constitutes household

 heads) and the ownership rate (the proportion of households that own) increase

 sharply between the late teens and early forties (see Tables 2 and 3).

      The data in Table 2 reveal that age—specific headship rates have varied

 significantly over time. Between 1962 and 1978, all age-specific rates rose;

the larger increases were for the population aged 20-44 (0.05) and, especially,

over age 75 (0.10). Since 1978, headship rates have generally declined,

sharply for the population in their twenties, although rates increased slightly

for the 35-54 cohort. The causes of these changes will be discussed in detail

later in the paper, but one fact stands out in Table 2: the generally higher

headship rates of those born after 1937 (who were age 24 and younger in 1961).

N6te how the movement of those born between 1938 and 1942 into the 25-29 age

group in the 1962-67 period sharply raised that headship rate, while in 1967-72

they raised the 30—34 headship rate. Later, in 1972-82, they continually

pushed the 35-44 headship rate upward and since then have been raising the 45-

54 headship rate (this phenomenon explains why the headship rate for only the

35—54 cohort rose between 1978 and 1985). People born after 1942 maintained

the greater demand for headship established by those born between 1938 and 1942

(note that the 20—24 rate did not fall in 1962—67, the 25-29 rate did not fall

in 1967—72, and the 30-34 rate did not fall in 1972-77).

      The data in Tables 3 and 4 also indicate significant variation in home

ownership rates over time. The Census Bureau data (Table 3) show a sharp

increase in ownership rates for married couples and primary individual

households (ones where no relatives reside with the household head) of all ages

between 1960 and 1980. For marrieds under 65, the increases are 12 to 14

percentage points; for primary individuals under 45, the increases are 9 to 13

percentage points. In contrast, "other" female families (families where no
                                           —4—



spouse of the female head is present) had roughly constant ownership rates

while other male households decreased their ownership. The Annual Housing and

Housing Vacancy Survey data in (Table 4) show that this trend was reversed in

the first half of the l980s for married households under age 45, but continued

for married couples over age 64. For singles and others under 35, a slight

decrease occurred; for those over 34, ownership continued to rise.

      In what follows, I calculate the impact of changes in population age

shares on the aggregate headship and ownership rates of the U.S. during the

l960-5 period and then use the same methodology to compute the impact of

"known" changes in age shares during the 1986-2000 period on the aggregate

headship and ownership rates through 2000. I also calculate the impact of

changes in household-composition shares (fewer marrieds, more singles and

others) on the aggregate ownership rate in the 1960-85 period. The impact of

changes in age-specific headship and ownership rates, the endogenous

determinants of headship and ownership, are discussed in subsequent sections.


                   A. Demographic Changes and Aggregate Headship

      Identifying the impact of pure demographic shifts on the aggregate

headship rate is fairly straightforward. The aggregate headship rate (total

households, HH, divided by total population, POP) is simply the sum of the

products of the age-specific headship rates (h.) and population shares (p.).

At time t, then,



            HH     =         =
                       hht       h.tp.t.                           (1)




To isolate the impact of changing population age-shares, this headship rate can

be recomputed holding the age—specific headship rates constant at, say, h.:
                                               —5—




                                                                           (2)




The difference between hh and hh*t is this impact.

         The aggregate headship rate (hht) and the rate based on changing age-

shares only (hh*t) are listed in Table 5 for 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1985. The

aggregate rate rose from 0.295 in 1960 to 0.371 in 1985, a 25 percent increase.

About half of the increase was due to the maturing of the baby boomers

 (changing age shares) and half to increases in age-specific headship rates.

The lower part of the Table indicates the changes in the headship rate due to

these two factors. (The age-share contributions through the year 2000 are

obtained by using the population shares in Table 1 and the 1985 age-specific

headship rates.) As can be seen, demographic forces have been particularly

strong since 1970 and will continue to raise headship through 2000. Higher

age-specific headship rates substantially raised aggregate headship throughout

the 1960s and 1970s, while lower rates decreased headship somewhat in the

1980s. How these rates will change in future years is, of course, problematic.


    B. Demographic Changes, Household Composition and Aggregate Ownership

         The proportion of total households that are homeowners of household type

x is the sum across age cohorts of the products of the age and household-type

specific ownership rate (0C),     the     fraction of households of this type (x.), the

headship rate (h.), and the population share (p.):


     h x x
     IOH I          1o.itititit
                       x

                                      —6—



where x represents, in turn, married couples, singles, other male households

and other female households. The aggregate ownership rate is simply the sum of

the household-type ownership rates

      To isolate the impact of changing population age-shares, one would

recalculate the o holding the age-specific ownership and headship rates and

the household-composition shares constant

           —                                                      (4)
                  hh
                    *t




and recompute the aggregate rate as




               °'                                                 (4')



the difference between       and   being the impact. On the other hand, the

joint impact of changing age and household-composition shares can be isolated

by holding only the age-specific ownership and headship rates constant

             =°'
the   diffcrence between        and     being the impact.

       The household—composition shares for 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1985 are listed

in Table 6. A sharp shift has occurred, especially since 1970, in the

composition of households under age 45. The share of married couples in total

households has fallen by 14 percentage points for the 35—44 age cohort, 20

percentage points for the 30—34 age cohort, 24 percentage points for the 25—29

group, and 30 percentage points for households under age 25. For the youngest

cohort, the shift has been to "other" male and female households; for the 25-

44 cohorts, both primary individuals and other have gained at the expense of

married couples. Obvious causes of these shifts include higher divorce rates

and postponement of marriage. Changes in owner and renter costs also affect

shares because the different type households have different ownership rates.

These shifts and the likelihood of their continuance will be discussed below.

       The aggregate ownership rate rose from 0.623 in 1960 to 0.656 in 1980, an

increase of only 5 percent. Table 7 illustrates how this small rise disguised

the major shift toward ownership by married-couple and primary-individual

households. Both the movement of the baby-boomers from nonhouseholds to young

rental households and the shift from married households to primary individual

and other households (that are more likely to rent) tended to lower the

ownership rate throughout the l960s and 1970s. In fact, the aging of the baby

boomers and the relative decline in married households would have lowered the

aggregate ownership rate by 4½ percentage points between 1960 and 1980 in the

absence of an increase in age-specific ownership rates.1 The surge to

ownership --   the   increase in the age-specific ownership rates --   alone acted to
raise the aggregate ownership rate by 7½ percentage points.
                                      —8-




      These events have been partially reversed in the early 1980s. The aging

of the baby boomers has started to increase the aggregate ownership rate, and

age—specific ownership rates have declined for households under about age 40.

Still, the observed 1.7 percentage point decline in the aggregate ownership

rate is largely a result of the continuing shift from married-couple households

to primary individuals and others. The recent decline in age—specific

ownership rates has lowered the aggregate ownership rate by less than a

percentage point.

      The data in Table 7 also reveal a significant demographic—driven increase

in ownership through at least the year 2000. Of course, continuation of the

shift in household composition away from married couples would act to offset

this. How age-specific ownership rates will change is, like the changes in

age-specific headship rates, problematic. To make intelligent assumptions

about these rates requires an understanding of the household formation and

tenure decisions.


                     II. The Household Formation Decision

      The determination of age—specific headship rates has not been an area of

intense research. The most promising work views household formations as the

reflection of a demand for privacy; the greater the demand, the higher will be

age-specific headship rates. Like any demand, it will depend positively on

real income and negatively on the price or cost of obtaining the good

(privacy).

      Between 1960 and 1980, real income per capita in the United States

increased by two—thirds. Moreover, the sharp increase in real transfer

payments (food stamps, AFDC payments and social security benefits) meant that

the incomes of those least able to afford privacy rose even more sharply
                                         —9—




percentage wise. Not surprisingly, headship rates of those most dependent on

transfer payments -—   those under 30 and over 75 —— also increased most

dramatically.

      Two price-of—privacy measures seem relevant. The first is the price of

obtaining housing services, both owner-occupied and rental. According to many

 (e.g., Diamond, 1980 and Hendershott and Hu, 1981), the annual rental cost of

owner-occupied housing was roughly halved between 1960 and 1979 (the cost of

rental housing varied little). In contrast, the cost of owner housing nearly

tripled, in the early 1980s, while the cost of rental housing rose by only 10

percent.

      A second price variable, relevant to only a subset of potential

households, is the level of AFDC payments. By establishing a separate

household, a qualified adult can receive benefits; the higher are the

benefits, the lower is the cost of obtaining privacy (Ellwood and Bane, 1984).

Real AFDC payments per recipient increased by a third (and qualification

standards were relaxed) between the early l960s and late 1970s, lowering the

cost of privacy for some potential households. The reverse occurred in the

first half of the l980s: real AFDC payments fell by over 10 percent (and

eligibility standards were tightened).

      Hendershott and Smith (1985, 1987) have related household formations in

the 1960—84 period to both the changing age structure of the population and

changes in the real—income and cost—of—privacy variables just discussed.2

Table 8 attributes both the 27 million increase in households in the 1961—79

period and the 9½ million increase in the 1980-85 span to various causes. As

can be seen, much of the increases —— two—thirds for the first period and over

one hundred percent for the second ——    is purely   demographic -— more people

alive in older age—cohorts. Demographics are far from the entire story,
                                     —10—



however. Rising age-specific headship rates produced 8 million extra

households in the first period, and declining rates have tended to reduce

household formations by 1½ million since 1979.

      Forecasting age—specific headship rates requires forecasting real income

growth, changes in the transfer programs, and the real cost of housing

services. Major changes in the transfer programs seem unlikely, but real

income should rise gradually, as it has in the past, raising headship rates

slightly. How the real cost of housing services will vary is probably the most

uncertain factor. If real after-tax interest rates remain high, then a slight

decline in headship rates for households above age 30 is likely as they

increasingly face the full cost of the high real interest rates of 1981—85. On

the other hand, if after-tax real rates decline, the potential younger

households not formed due to high rates --   children   living with parents and

unrelated individuals living together —-   will   likely be formed. The Tax Reform

Act of 1986 is especially relevant here because it is likely to change relative

housing costs. More will be said on this when forecasts are presented.


                         III. The Ownership Decision

      A number of studies (e.g., Rosen and Rosen, 1980 and Hendershott and

shilling, 1982) have successfully related the aggregate ownership rate to both

demographic factors and the cost of owning relative to the cost of renting.

Because these studies covered only the l960s and l970s, a near monotonic

increase in the adjusted (for demographic shifts) home ownership rate was

correlated with a distributed lag on a nearly monotonically declining cost of

owning relative to renting. (The rationalizations for the lag structures were

not particularly compelling.) One could argue that the distributed lag may

have reflected little more than a continual shift in tastes toward ownership.
                                      —11-



      Haurin, Hendershott and Ling (1987) have recently studied Annual Housing

Survey data for younger married households during the 1973-83 period.

Households under-age-25, 25-29, 30—34 and 35—44 were analyzed separately. For

each of the ten years, households in 5 to 7 of the income ranges published in

the AHS were considered, and the tax rate employed in calculating the cost of

owner housing was carefully computed (Hendershott and Slemrod, 1983). In

total, roughly 66 observations (10 years and various income levels) were

explained for each of the 25-29, 30—34 and 35-44 age classes; for the under—

age—25 class, 60 observations were explained.

      Their results suggest substantial sensitivity to income and price

changes. To illustrate, a fifty percent increase in real income and a one—

quarter decrease in the owner—renter price ratio, roughly the changes from the

middle 1960s to the late 1970s, would have increased the ownership rates for

the four age classes by 12 to 16 percentage points, just over half of which is

due to the income variable. In contrast, increasing the price ratio by fifty

percent (the early 1980s) would lower the ownership rates by 3 or 4 percentage

points. These simulated changes are quite consistent with the observed changes

(see Tables 3 and 4).

      Tables 9 and 10 are analogous to Table 8 in that they attribute the

increases in households (in this case owners and renters, respectively) during

the 1961—79 and 1980-85 periods to various factors. A major factor is, of

course, the increase in households itself; the results of Table 8 are

incorporated in Tables 9 and 10 (whatever gave rise to an increase in

households must have increased owners, renters or both). The changes due to

population shifts, growth in income, and social security benefits are

distributed two-thirds to owners and one-third to renters, reflecting the near

two-thirds aggregate ownership rate throughout the period. The changes due to
                                        —12--




the cost of housing are distributed to owners and renters according to the

impacts of changes in owner and rental costs. The changes due to the

AFDC/food—stamp variable are assumed to affect renters only.

      Tables 9 and 10 also reflect the impact of changes in the composition of

households and in the ratio of owner to renter costs. For a given household

total, these factors simply shift households between tenure modes. Thus the

ownership/rental mix entries in the two tables are always equal in absolute

magnitude and opposite in sign. These entries are based on the calculations in

Table 7.

     -The tables highlight how the "exogenous" structural factors and the

"endogenous" housing costs and other variables have reversed themselves in the

l980s. Population growth and changing age structure and household composition

have increased owner households by a million more than rental households so far

in the l980s; the reverse was true in the previous two decades. Moreover,

changes in housing costs and the growth in income and transfer payments in the

1960s and 1970s increased owner households by 10 million and decreased renter

households by 2 million. So far in the l980s, such changes have reduced both

owner and renter households slightly.

      The major determinant of age—specific ownership rates during the rest of

the century is likely to be the cost of owning relative to the cost of renting.

As noted below, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is expected to have a significant

impact on these costs.


                                IV. Forecasts

      The top section of Table 11 contains the actual average annual changes in

homeowners, renters and the total number of households during the 1960s, the

1970s and the first half of the l980s. Below the actual changes is a simple

extrapolation, for five-year intervals through 2000, in which age-specific
                                      —13—




headship and ownership rates and the composition of households are held

constant at their 1985 values, i.e., the forecast is driven solely by

population growth and the age-specific population shares.    (The second number

for the owner/renter split will be discussed momentarily.)

      Household growth has exceeded 1½ million per year on average over the

past 15 years owing to positive demographic forces (baby boomers forming

households) and economic factors (expansion of transfer programs). The

demographics remain very positive for the rest of the 1980s. By the 1990s

through, a weakening of the demographic forces will reduce household growth to

abouta million a year, near the pace of the 1960s.

      The continued movement of the baby-boomers into higher ownership age—

cohorts and the appearance of the "baby-bust" in the prime renting years (in

the 1990s the 20-29 age cohort will decrease by 7 million) will act to tilt the

distribution of household growth in favor of owners and against renters. In

fact, the 900 thousand annual increase in owning households extrapolated for

the l990s is about as large as the average annual increase during the first

half of the 1980s. The increase in renters, though, is extrapolated to be

lower than any time since the 1950s. The extrapolated renter's share of

increased households is only 13 percent, far below any share on record.

      A major factor operating against ownership, however, is the almost

certain shift from married couples to single and other households. As was

noted earlier, enormous shifts have already occurred for households under 45

and the shifts have been greater the younger the households. It seems clear

that younger people generally have far different tastes for the married-couple

state than their parents did and thus will be significantly less likely to be

choosing the married state 15 years from now than their parents did at a

comparable age.

     Table 12 contains projections of household composition shares. No

further decline in the married-couple share of the under-25 cohort is

projected, but a "catch-up" of older cohorts is. When a continued shift of

this nature is built into the extrapolation (the second numbers listed under

owners and renters in Table 11), the results are not much different from the

1960s and 1970s: roughly 70 percent of household growth is in owner form and

30 percent is in renter.


       -
           A.   Assumptions for Age-Specific Headship and Ownership Rates

     ,Four alternative scenarios are analyzed below. The first two incorporate

a continuation of the high real interest rate world of 1985. They differ in

that one assumes faster real economic growth than the other. Table 13 contains

both the known age-specific headship rates for 1985 and the values employed in

the "continuation" 1990-2000 forecasts. With slow economic growth and a

continuation of the 1985 environment, age-specific headship rates generally

should not rise as they have in earlier decades because the lagged impact of

high real interest rates offsets the effect of growing real income. The

exception is in the 20-34 age brackets, where high real rates have already

taken their full toll, and thus future income growth will raise headship rates

from the current depressed levels. With more rapid growth, headship rates will

rise. Headship rates are raised by 0.005 for each half decade for all except

the youngest and oldest age cohorts.3 Only 0.001 increases are incorporated

for those cohorts.

      The other two forecast scenarios reflect the impact of the Tax Reform Act

of 1986. In our estimation (Follain, Hendershott and Ling, 1987), the Act will

raise real rents by roughly 10 percent in a long—run equilibrium, but lower the

price of owner housing for most households (by about 4 percent for those with

under $50,000 in adjusted gross income). Because the elasticity of headship
                                       —15—




 with respect to renter costs is eight times as great as with respect to owner

 costs (Hendershott and Smith, 1987), 0.056 versus 0.007, household formations

 will be lower than otherwise. To account for this, the headship rates of those

 age 20—44 are reduced relative to the continuation forecasts by 0.002 in 1990,

 0.004 in 1995 and 0.006 in 2000.

       The age-specific ownership rate assumptions for married and single

 households are listed in Table 14. With continuation of the 1985 environment,

ownership rates for married couples under age 35 remain at their already

depressed 1985 levels. For older couples, the impact of high real interest

rates-has probably not yet been fully observed. Their ownership rates are

assumed to decline by 1.5 additional percentage points by the year 2000. For

single households under 35, the current low rates are presumed to continue;

fGr singles above age 34, a 0.9 percentage point decline from current levels is

projected.

      The Tax Reform Act of 1986 would increase ownership rates because the

cost of owning falls and the cost of renting rises. Our calculations suggest

about a two percentage point increase from the old equilibrium to the new for

married couples under 35. For older married couples, the ownership rate is

raised by 1.5 percentage points, exactly offsetting the lagged responses to the

sharp rise in real rates in the early l980s. For singles under 35, the rates

are r&ised by a percentage point and a half. The forecasted changes occur

gradually. For older singles and all others, their ownership rates are held at

their 1985 values because these rates do not show any clear relationship to

housing costs.

                             B. Behavioral Forecasts

     The behavioral forecasts are reported in Table 15. The upper half of the

table contains household formations, including the extrapolation from Table 11,

and the lower half lists the proportion of the net increase in households that

constitutes owners. The high economic growth scenario has 200,000 more net

formations per year than the low growth scenario; the Tax Reform Act lowers

net formations by about 40,000 per year in either growth scenario. With Tax

Reform, the two growth forecasts for the second half of the 1980s bracket

actual net formations in the first half of the l980s. By the 1990s, the Tax—

Reform forecasts are near actual formations in the 1960s (higher in the first

half of the 1990s with rapid growth and lower in the second half with slow

growth).

 -    With a continuation of the 1985 environment, only 57 percent of the
household increase in the rest of the 1980s would be an increase in owners.

This is less than the first half which itself was the lowest percentage since

at least 1950. While the percentage of the total increase going to owner

housing would rise into the low 60s in the l990s, the increase in owning

households would be below that of the l960s. In contrast, the increase in

renting households would be above that of the l960s, although below that of the

1970s.

         Enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 alters the pattern of the

forecast. About two-thirds of the increase in households in the rest of the

l980s would be owners, and the combination of this percentage and the large

increase in total households would generate a greater increase in owners in the

second half of the eighties than in the first half. For the 1990s, over 70

percent of the increase in households would be owners, and by the second half
                                        —17—




of the 1990s, the aggregate ownership rate be within a percentage point of the

1980 peak of 65½   percent.   The increase in renters in the l990s would be under

300,000 per year or less than the 1960s.


                       C. Comparisons with Other Forecasts

      Table 16 compares the above forecasts with those of Abraham, Brown and

Gillmore (1986) and Sternlieb and Hughes (1986). We emphasize our continuation

forecasts in the comparison because the other forecastors did not incorporate

an impact of the Tax Reform Act. The Sternhieb-Hughes forecasts for both the

second half of the 1980s and the first half of the l990s are 10 to 30 percent

below our forecasts. The AB&G forecasts are even further below ours for the

rest of the l980s, but are at or above our high forecast for the entire decade

of the l990s. Only Sternlieb and Hughes present a breakdown between owners and

renters. The percent of the increase in households that is an increase in

owners is 15 to 20 percentage points above our continuation forecasts.

      The differences in the forecasts can, of course, be traced to the

differences in assumptions. Sternlieb and Hughes present a pure extrapolation;

age—specific headship and ownership rates and household composition shares are

all assumed to be constant between 1983 and 1995. As a result, their

owner/renter split and net increase in households is virtually identical to our

pure-extrapolation case. AB&G have endogenous age—specific headship rates, and

differences in these and our assumed rates account for the differences in

forecasts. During the second half of the eighties, AB&G have falling headship

rates for the under-35 cohorts and flat rates for the 35—54 cohort. Thus their

net-formations forecast is below ours. In the l990s, though, they envision

rapidly increasing age-specific headship rates; thus their forecast is at or

above our higher forecast.

                                   V. Summary

       During the l960s and 1970s, household demands for privacy (headship) and

ownership increased significantly. The headship increase was especially

dramatic for the young (under 30) and old (over 75); much of the increase

should probably be attributed to the sharp increases in transfer programs aimed

at these groups (AFDC, food stamps, and social security), although some was due

to rising income and declining housing costs. Increased headship raised total

households by 8 million.

       ,The ownership rates for married couples under 65 and primary individual

households under 45 increased by ten percentage points during the l960s and

1970s. These increases, alone, acted to raise the aggregate ownership rate by

7½   percentage points. These increases stemmed from a substantial increase in
real income per household and a notable decline in in the cost of owning

relative to the cost of renting.

        Increases in real interest rates in the early 1980s reduced both headship

and ownership rates of those under age 40; for married couples, the decline in

ownership rates was 5 percentage points.

        The postponement of marriage and the increase in divorce rates during

this period sharply reduced the share of married couples in total households,

by a full 30 percentage points for households under 35 and by 20 percentage

point for those age 35 to 44. Because ownership rates are much greater for

married couples than for single or "other" households, the aggregate ownership

rate tended to decline by 2 3/4 percentage points.

        Changes in the age distribution of the population, particularly the

maturing of the baby boomers, also had an enormous impact on household

formation and ownership in the last quarter century. Changing age shares

increased household formations by 10 million between 1970 and 1985 and acted to
                                      —19—



 lower the aggregate ownership rate by nearly 2 percentage points during the

 1960s and 1970s. The latter resulted from the gradual shift over time of

 baby—boomers from teenagers to adults in their prime renting years.

      The impact of the changing age distribution on headship and ownership

through the year 2000 is known (in the absence of unforeseen changes in death

rates and immigration). Because age-specific headship and ownership rates both

rise sharply between ages 20 and 40, the aging of the baby-boomers will raise

both headship and ownership, although the impact on headship will weaken in the

l990s. A further shift from married couples to singles and others will tend to

offset the demographic impact on aggregate ownership.

      Future net household formations will depend on the rate of economic

growth and passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. High growth will generate

200,000 more formations per year than low growth, while the Tax Act should

lower formations by about 40,000 a year (owing to the anticipated increase in

rents). Formations in the second half of the l980s will be roughly equal to

those in the first half. For the l990s, the negative demographics (a 7 million

population decline in the 20—29 age cohort) should reduce formations to 1.0 to

1.2 million per year, roughly the formation rate for the 1960s.

      The Tax Reform Act will lower the cost of owning for most households and

increase the cost of renting for everyone. Because households are sensitive to

the ratio of owner to renter costs, the Tax Act will have an impact on the

split between owning and renting. In the absence of the Tax Act, the increase

in owners in the second half of the l980s would be only 57 percent of the total

increase in households; in the l990s, this ratio would rise to 64 percent.

With the Tax Reform Act, these percentages rise to 65 and 75 percent,

respectively.

    It is possible that the shift in household composition caused the increase in

ownership rates for married couples. This would be the case if the shifting

households were predominantly lower—income renting households. Examination of

the Annual Housing Survey Data for owners and renters, stratified by age and

income, for 1973 and 1979 suggests that this was not the case. Ownership rates

jumped at all income levels.


2
    DivorCe variables tested in a change—in-household equation in the earlier

paperincluded: the total number of divorces each year, the change in the

total number (stock) of divorced persons, the latter but restricted to

population over age 34, and the change in the number of households head by

divorced women with children under 18. None of the variables had a noticeable,

much less statistically significant, impact on household formations. This is

not all that surprising because a divorce could lead to the loss of a

household, no change in households, or the gain of a household depending on

whether the divorced parties joined existing households or established their

own.


    With more rapid growth being 1¼% more per year, income is 20 percent higher

by the year 2000. With an income elasticity of 0.09, households increase by

1.8 percent. Spreading this increase over the 65% of the population between 20

and 65, which has a headship rate of 0.55, gives a total increase of

0.0l8(.55)/.65 =    0.015.

    With a 10 percent increase in renter costs over the 15 year period, total

households should decline by 0.56 percent (10 times 0.056) or about half a

million. With 97 million people in the 20—44 age class, their headship must

decline by 0.006.
