                                                ABSTRACT


        I synthesize and summarize a set of recent papers on changes in the employment relationship. The
authors of these papers present the most up-to-date and accurate assessment of their evidence on changes
in job stability and job security, and attempt to reconcile their evidence with the findings of other research,
including the other papers discussed herein. Some of papers also begin to explore explanations of changes
in the employment relationship.
        The evidence suggests that the 1990's witnessed some changes in the employment relationship
consistent with weakened bonds between workers and firms. But the magnitudes of these changes indicate
that while these bonds may have weakened, they have not been broken. Furthermore, the changes that
occurred in the 1990's have not persisted very long. It is therefore premature to infer long-term trends
towards declines in long-term employment relationships, and even more so to infer anything like the
disappearance of long-term, secure jobs.
        The papers examining sources of changes in job stability and job security in the 1990's point to
some potential explanations, including relative wage movements, growth in alternative employment
relationships, and downsizing. However, with the possible exception of the first of these, this list does not
encompass “fundamental” or exogenous changes impacting the employment relationship, but rather to some
extent suggests how various changes in the employment relationship may reinforce each other.
Understanding the structural changes underlying empirical observations on changes in job stability and job
security is likely to be a fruitful frontier for future research on the employment relationship.

I. Introduction

        At a symposium at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the fall of 1996, various

researchers presented their findings on changes in long-term employment relationships in U.S.

labor markets. The researchers focused on two dimensions of these relationships: “job stability,”

meaning the duration of jobs or the probability of retaining or leaving a job; and “job security,”

referring to the likelihood of experiencing involuntary job loss. The disparity of the conclusions

was striking. Some, including me, reported “nothing new under the sun.” Despite intense media

attention, culminating in the 1996 New York Times series “The Downsizing of America,” overall

changes in the stability of jobs over the 1970's and 1980's were trivial or non-existent. Others, in

contrast, reported substantial declines in job stability. Similar, if slightly less sharp

disagreements emerged over job security, with some research indicating sharp declines, and

others reporting only modest declines, or speculating that the increased job loss reflected changes

in survey methods rather than real changes in the economy.

        Towards the end of the day, Eric Wanner, President of the Russell Sage Foundation,

which helped fund the symposium, wondered what research foundations could do to help resolve

these contradictions and provide a clear picture of labor market developments in the United

States. Somewhat facetiously, I suggested that the Foundation ought to lock the various

researchers in a room and not let us out until we figured out exactly what the data really said

about these issues.

        Some time later, substituting comfortable surroundings, nice meals, and nominal financial

inducements for a lock on the door, many of the researchers active in this debate convened and

embarked on just this task. The process began with a conference at which researchers presented

papers that pursued two goals: first, to present the most up-to-date and accurate assessment of


                                                   1
their evidence on changes in job stability and job security; and second, to attempt to reconcile

their evidence with the findings of other research, including both earlier papers and those

presented at the conference. In addition, papers were invited that began to explore possible

explanations of any changes in the employment relationship that emerged from the ongoing

research, adding a vital component to what had to that point been largely a debate about

empirical facts–a necessary first step, but an incomplete research agenda. Following the

conference, in addition to the usual process of review and revision of the papers, a deliberate

effort was made to push the contributors in the direction of reconciling, whenever possible,

contradictory findings among the papers, or with respect to other research on job stability and job

security. The final product of this process is represented in this volume.

       As the title of this chapter suggests, this process was unique in its collective effort to

establish a consensus on the empirical evidence across numerous papers using a variety of data

sets. Besides assembling a set of new papers that would generally advance our knowledge about

changes in job stability and job security, we also set out to push a research “model” that focuses a

number of papers simultaneously on the same topic, with a strong emphasis on delineating points

of reconciliation, points of continued disagreement, and wherever possible the reasons for each.

This emphasis gives this conference volume a unique flavor. It is hard to read this book and not

come away believing that the set of papers as a whole–but in some sense only as a

whole–substantially pushes forward our knowledge regarding changes in the employment

relationship.

       In this introductory chapter I briefly summarize the original findings presented in each

paper, and then move on to what each paper has to say about findings in the previous literature

and in the other conference papers. This provides a synthesis that is somewhat difficult to obtain


                                                  2
from reading the individual papers, unless the reader were to engage in his or her own detailed

process of comparing and contrasting these papers, which are filled with a rather bewildering

array of discussions about data issues, measurement problems, alternative estimates, and

references to other research findings. I therefore hope that this synthesis helps the reader absorb

the contributions of this research more easily.1

        In addition to their contribution to the debate over the changing employment relationship,

I believe readers will also find in these papers a wealth of useful suggestions and insights

regarding the measurement of worker-employer attachments (tenure, job separations, job loss,

etc.) in many of the main data sets that labor economists use in a variety of applications. This

results from what is probably the most serious attention such issues have received. My guess is

that this product of the research contained in this volume will prove indispensable not only in

future research on changes in the employment relationship, but also in a much wider body of

research on job mobility, job attachment, and job loss.

II. Job Stability

Untangling the Evidence

        The first five papers in the volume address the issue that has figured most prominently

thus far in the ongoing research and debate over changes in the employment relationship–whether

the distribution of the duration of jobs has changed appreciably in the U.S. economy in recent

years, and in particular whether jobs have become less stable. Four of these five papers (by

Jaeger and Stevens, Neumark, et al., Bernhardt, et al., and Gottschalk and Moffitt) use the main

secondary data sources available to labor economists to study this question, and are distinguished

from previous research by two main features: updating evidence through the mid- to late-1990's;

and serious attempts at verifying and more importantly reconciling the evidence from earlier


                                                   3
studies and alternative data sources. The fifth (by Allen, et al.) casts another look at this question

using a proprietary data set on a small sample of large employers, providing a narrower look at

the question, but one that addresses the important issue of changes in the employment

relationship at the largest corporations. Table 1 summarizes the findings of these papers in a

form that enables easy comparison of data sets, samples, sample periods, the “definition” of

stability, and results. Because this table is provided, my summary of each paper is brief, and

restricted to findings on job stability.

        The paper by Jaeger and Stevens studies the evolution of job stability over the 1970's,

1980's, and 1990's using the two primary data sources exploited in the earlier research: the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); and the various tenure supplements of the Current Population

Survey (CPS). Whereas past research has used primarily one data set or the other, this is the first

research to attempt to use these two sources of data while doing everything possible to ensure

that at the end of the day we are looking at comparable measures from the two sources. Jaeger

and Stevens look at job duration at both the “short” and “long” end of the distribution, by

measuring changes over time in the shares of workers with less than 18 months of tenure, and

with less than 10 years of tenure. The former measure is closely related to turnover, since an

increase in the fraction of workers with low tenure would occur if workers were leaving or losing

their jobs (and becoming reemployed) at higher rates. The 10-year measure captures the extent to

which workers are accumulating high amounts of tenure on the job. It is not as closely related to

turnover per se, as average tenure could be rising while the proportion with 10 or more years of

tenure is shrinking.2 Jaeger and Steven find consistent results in the PSID and in the CPS tenure

supplements, indicating that the share of workers with less than 18 months of tenure rose over

the early part of the sample period, but not since about 1983. In contrast, for men the share with


                                                  4
less than 10 years of tenure began to increase in the late 1980's.

       Neumark, et al., update the evidence on job stability based on CPS tenure supplements by

extending into the 1990's the type of estimates presented in their earlier work. Rather than

looking at point-in-time distributions of tenure or some transformation thereof (like the share

with tenure below some cutoff), they string together tenure supplements to estimate retention

rates, which are free of the influence of factors such as changes in participation.3 Overall,

though, the findings are quite consistent with those of Jaeger and Stevens. Shorter-term (four-

year) retention rates were largely unchanged for the sample as a whole over the sample period

(1983-1995). In contrast, longer-term (eight-year) retention rates fell in the early 1990's, and

both rates fell for higher-tenure and older workers, and more so for higher-tenure managerial and

professional workers. These results point to a weakened tendency, in the short-run at least, for

managerial and professional workers to remain in long-term jobs.

       Bernhardt, et al., look at job stability by comparing two-year job separation rates across

cohorts of young white men in the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS). This is an alternative

data source to the PSID or CPS that offers some advantages the authors describe (most

importantly, a unique employer code), but also presents potential problems of changes over time

stemming from differences in survey methods used for the two NLS cohorts. The authors are

careful to consider fully issues that arise because of differences between the surveys, and they

present a relatively compelling case that their findings of substantially higher separation rates in

the later NLS cohort reflect a real behavioral change. Their results compare one cohort followed

over the period 1966-1981 with another cohort followed over the period 1979-1994. Thus, their

findings of higher separation rates in the more recent cohort to a large extent compare the 1970's

with the 1980's, and hence are not inconsistent with evidence reported in other papers in this


                                                  5
volume finding some declines in job stability over the 1970's and early 1980's (e.g., Jaeger and

Stevens), but not during the 1980's. In addition, their data are restricted to relatively young men,

in contrast to most of the other analyses discussed in this chapter.

       Bernhardt, et al., also broach the interesting question of whether the consequences of job

changing have shifted over time, reporting that the wage returns to job changing have declined

and become more unequal. While there is not enough material in the papers in this volume to

reach definitive conclusions regarding this issue, I would argue that research along these lines has

a valuable role to play. Much of the recent debate has been about empirical measurement of

changes in the employment relationship. But little if any research has asked “So what?” To

know what to make of the evidence on changes in the employment relationship, we need a better

idea of what the consequences of such changes are.

       The study by Gottschalk and Moffitt is the first to look at job stability using data from the

Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP data offer two advantages. First,

monthly data allow the study of short-term dynamics, thus adding a dimension to the study of job

stability that is quite important, given that a high fraction of workers (about 20 percent) are in

jobs with less than one year of tenure. Second, the SIPP includes 32 months of job history data

with unique identifiers throughout each panel. Looking first at one-year separation rates, the

authors reach conclusions similar to those of Jaeger and Stevens–namely, that one-year

separation rates did not increase over the 1983-1995 period. Looking at monthly separation

rates, Gottschalk and Moffitt find no trend increase, and if anything a decline from the mid-

1980's through the early 1990's.4 Like Bernhardt, et al., these authors also devote some attention

to the consequences of job changes, finding, in contrast to that paper, no downward drift in wage

gains associated with job changes.


                                                  6
       Finally, Allen, et al., study a data base of consulting clients of Watson Wyatt Worldwide.

These data cover the 1990's only, and principally permit comparisons of tenure distributions over

this period. The firms in these data display a fairly high degree of downsizing, which may of

course be related to their selection into a sample of consulting clients. The key finding that Allen

emphasizes is that–putting aside the impact on “downsized” workers–the average tenure of the

workforces in this sample of firms rose over the 1990's, as did the percentages of workers with

10+ or 20+ years of tenure. Moreover, while retention rates were naturally lower in downsizing

firms (with downsizing defined simply as reducing employment), the differential appears for

lower-tenure, rather than higher-tenure workers. In other words, whether or not firms are

downsizing, in these data we do not observe declining representation of high-tenure workers.

However, because these data are not representative and cover a relatively short period, it is not

clear that we want to characterize this evidence as undermining the conclusion from

representative samples that it was high-tenure, not low-tenure, workers who experienced the

decline in stability in the 1990's. One possible reconciliation is that the types of very large

corporations represented in these data may have experienced different patterns of job separations.

Reconciling the Conflicting Findings

       Having described the basic findings in each paper, I next summarize the evidence that

explicitly attempts to reconcile or in some cases verify the findings in these papers and other

research regarding changes in job stability. This evidence is presented in a condensed form in

Table 2, permitting a brief summary here.

       Jaeger and Stevens address the vexing issue of why past research based on the PSID

(Marcotte, 1996; Rose, 1995) reported declines in job stability over the 1980's, while evidence

based on CPS tenure supplements indicated little decrease in job stability from the 1970's to the


                                                  7
1980's or in the 1980's. As already noted, Jaeger and Stevens conclude, based on their analysis of

PSID and CPS data, that there was no increase in the share of workers with low tenure over the

1980's or through the mid-1990's, but that stability fell from the 1970's to the 1980's. They

attribute the contrast to earlier PSID studies to changes in questions in the 1980's that inflated

measures of turnover in that period, and to sensitivity to the sample period, with studies ending in

the late 1980's coincidentally using as their end date the peak in the share of workers with low

tenure (less than 18 months). On the other hand, they argue that in contrast to CPS studies of the

1970's versus the 1980's, there appear to have been some relatively small but real decreases in job

stability over this period, which are masked by changes in the CPS tenure question in 1983. An

important conclusion from this paper is that, in contrast to the impression one might have gotten

from the contradictory findings in the earlier research, the PSID and CPS yield similar findings

when used in a comparable manner. Aside from helping to settle issues regarding trends in job

stability, this ought to reassure researchers requiring information on turnover, who might

sometimes find the CPS and other times the PSID better suited to answering particular questions.

Jaeger and Stevens also present some evidence suggesting that the findings of Bernhardt, et al.

and the earlier findings of Monks and Pizer (1998) of an increased separation rate from roughly

the 1970's to the 1980's, based on the NLS surveys, are reflected in the PSID data, which indicate

what they characterize as a “strong” increase in the fraction of young men with low tenure (in

their data, from 1976 through 1988).

       Neumark, et al., do not focus quite as much on the reconciliation of conflicting evidence

from different data sources. However, the extension of their earlier research through the mid-

1990's provides a significant “check” on the consistency between anecdotal and media reports of

declines in long-term jobs and evidence from representative samples. As suggested in Neumark


                                                  8
and Polsky (1998), part of the earlier disagreement between “evidence” from these two types of

sources may have been that the latter, research-based evidence lagged the media and anecdotal

reporting, and may therefore have failed to pick up the changes that were occurring most

recently. They conclude that their evidence of declines in job stability for more-tenured workers

overall in the 1990's, especially for managerial and professional workers, is in part consistent

with anecdotal evidence reported in the media, though they caution against drawing conclusions

regarding long-term trends, since these changes show up mainly in the first part of the 1990's.

        The part of the Bernhardt, et al., paper analyzing changes in separation rates largely

revisits an earlier paper using the NLS cohorts, by Monks and Pizer (1998), which reported

rather sharp declines in two-year retention rates between the NLS cohorts. After considering the

potential role of measurement issues, differences in attrition (which is plausibly associated with

measured job retention), and some other empirical issues, they largely confirm the Monks and

Pizer results, finding if anything a larger decline in job stability.

        Finally, the Gottschalk and Moffitt paper is not devoted to reconciling conflicting

evidence, but rather to presentation of evidence on short-term dynamics from the SIPP.

However, to ensure that any differences they find are not due simply to differences between data

sets, they first endeavor to verify that the SIPP and the PSID, when used longitudinally and in a

comparable fashion to study yearly turnover, yield similar results. In addition, because past

research with the PSID did not really treat it as a longitudinal data set, but instead as a series of

cross-sections, an important by-product of their “benchmarking” of the data is showing that when

the PSID data are used longitudinally, they give very similar results to those obtained when using

the PSID as a series of cross-sections; although estimated separation rates shift, the time-series

pattern of no upward trend remains the same. Again, this is of interest to researchers who may be


                                                    9
measuring job stability or turnover with other questions in mind that require longitudinal data.

III. Job Security

       While the research on job stability focuses on the duration of jobs, another critical

dimension is what has come to be labeled job security. The distinction between job stability and

job security was introduced as a means of sharpening the interpretation of different types of

changes in the employment relationship.5 A decline in job durations might be construed as

positive or negative, depending on whether workers’ jobs were ending involuntarily, or instead

because workers were quitting more frequently to take better jobs (such as occurs to some extent

in an economic expansion). A decline in job security, in contrast, refers specifically to a decline

in job durations attributable to increased involuntary job loss, an unambiguous “bad” from the

perspective of workers. Tracking changes in both job stability and job security is important for

understanding how the employment relationship is changing. As in the previous section, Table 3

presents the evidence on changes in job security in a condensed form, while Table 4 summarizes

the attempts at reconciling the conflicting evidence.

Untangling the Evidence

       The paper by Valletta reports evidence on changes in the probability of dismissal over the

1976-1992 period using the PSID. Valletta estimates how this probability has changed

differentially for high- and low-tenure workers, how this probability varies (overall, and with

tenure) in declining versus expanding sectors, and how the latter relationships have changed over

time. These particular empirical analyses are motivated by what is one of the first attempts in

this growing literature to offer a theoretical framework for interpreting the empirical analysis. In

particular, Valletta attempts to estimate parameters that might reflect behavior in the context of

implicit employment contracts that are designed to overcome incentive problems and imperfect


                                                 10
monitoring, and changes in the terms of such contracts, although he acknowledges that the

theoretical framework does not impose enough structure on the empirical analysis to test sharp

hypotheses. Nonetheless, there is evidence consistent with the general implicit contracts

approach, in particular the diminution of the effect of tenure in reducing dismissal probabilities

in declining sectors, which Valletta interprets as employer default on delayed payment contracts

in the face of adverse shocks. In light of this framework, the upward trend in dismissals for high-

tenure workers, and a similar upward trend in quits, suggest some change in the incentives or

behavior underlying long-term implicit contracts. Valletta’s paper clearly establishes a case for

trying to incorporate more theoretical analysis into what has until now been a purely empirical

research agenda.

       Stewart’s contribution to the job security literature is to develop a time-series on job loss

that can be used as an alternative to those based on the PSID and Displaced Worker Surveys

(DWS), which have been used to date. As Stewart points out, neither of these latter two data

sources provides consistent measures of job loss over time. The changes in questions over time

in the PSID were already discussed and have received careful attention in previous research (e.g.,

Polsky, 1999). The changes in the DWS are more recent, but their impact on estimates of

changes in job loss in the 1990's is potentially serious. (See Polivka and Miller, 1998; Farber,

1998b; Polivka, 1998). Stewart, instead, looks at the rate of employment-to-unemployment

transitions in the CPS over a thirty-year period. While such transitions are not synonymous with

job loss–since some job losers go directly to other jobs–they offer an alternative perspective.

Stewart then reports findings that draw some potentially interesting contrasts with the existing

literature. He finds that the rate of transition to unemployment increased in the 1980's relative to

the 1970's, but did not increase in the 1990's. For example, for most groups this rate was lower


                                                 11
during the 1990 recession than during the more severe 1982 recession. However, this was

reversed for some groups that typically are quite insulated from recession-induced spells of

unemployment, including more-educated workers, more-experienced workers, and white-collar

workers. This may provide some support for the greater media attention and–in my

view–hyperbole regarding decreased job stability and job security in the 1990's. In particular,

media attention may have increased in part because the peers of those in the media were

experiencing far greater dislocation than they had at other times.6

       Schmidt presents a different kind of evidence altogether, namely estimates of how

workers’ perceptions regarding job security have changed over time. Using the General Social

Survey (GSS) from 1977-1996, Schmidt studies changes over time in the perceived likelihood of

job loss or layoff (in the next 12 months) and the perceived likelihood of job loss coupled with

the perceived difficulty of finding a job with similar income and benefits; she refers to the latter

combination as “costly job loss.” Since these are unconventional data to bring to bear on the

question of changes in job security, it is useful to consider what they can tell us. There are at

least three ways to interpret the GSS data, all of them potentially informative. One is as a

“check” on the objective findings from other data sources. If workers’ perceptions parallel

evidence on job loss from the PSID, DWS, and CPS, then the strength of that evidence would be

bolstered. On the other hand, if we found undue pessimism in workers’ subjective assessments,

we might attribute this to exaggerated claims in the media and elsewhere regarding the decline of

long-term employment relationships. Second, these data may be informative about changes in

the distribution of the probabilities of job loss, as they measure ex ante probabilities that workers

may face job loss, rather than ex post measures of actual job loss. For example, an employer

could lay off a higher-than-normal fraction of its workforce, but commit to lifetime job security


                                                 12
for the remaining workers, in which case we might observe more job loss, but increases in

perceived job security for many workers. Third, “security” is, in essence, a subjective

characteristic, and a change in workers’ subjective assessment of their job security–whether or

not validated in observed behavior for the same period–may still have implications for labor

market behavior. For example, as Schmidt suggests, drawing on testimony by Federal Reserve

Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, a greater perceived threat of job loss could moderate wage

inflation demands; yet if these demands do indeed moderate wage demands, the threat may never

be realized.7

       Schmidt’s evidence suggests that, in terms of workers’ perceptions of job security, the

1990's were different from the earlier decade-and-a-half. While perceived risk of job loss

generally and of costly job loss in particular both rise during a recession, workers were more

pessimistic in the period following the 1990-1991 recession than in earlier comparable periods,

although the perceived risks of both types of job loss declined following the recession. In

common with the other work on both job stability and job security, these findings do not

establish any long term trends, while pointing to some unique developments in the early- to mid-

1990's. More importantly, perhaps, Schmidt’s research suggests the value of more careful

analysis of how data on workers’ perceptions of job security can further our understanding of

labor market developments–not limited to changes in job stability and job security.8

Reconciling the Conflicting Findings

       There is not as much conflicting evidence in the prior literature on job security as there is

on job stability. Across most of the existing papers, including those in this volume, there is some

evidence of declining job security. The disagreements focus more on the timing of the changes,

in particular whether job security declined in the 1990's. This is, of course, an important issue, as


                                                 13
tests of potential explanations of changes in job security will to some extent hinge on the

coincidence of timing of changes in job security and the causal factors under consideration.

        Although not central to their analysis, Gottschalk and Moffitt replicate some PSID results

on changes in involuntary terminations based on careful consideration of how best to use the

PSID in a consistent manner over time. Based on these replications, they conclude that the

findings from the PSID reported in Boisjoly, et al. (1998)–that involuntary terminations rose over

the 1970's and 1980's–were driven by increases from the 1970's to the 1980's, but not increases

over the 1980's. Note that this squares with Stewart’s conclusions noted above, and also in Table

4, which points out that in his data there was little change in job security from the mid-1970's

through the mid-to-late 1990's.

        Aside from addressing the evidence in Boisjoly, et al., Stewart also carefully explores two

other sets of findings on changes in job security from the previous literature. He devotes most of

his attention to Farber’s (1997b) conclusion based on the DWS that the rate of job loss increased

over the 1990's (from 1991-1993 to 1993-1995), a finding not replicated in Stewart’s data.

Stewart is cognizant of the fact that his employment-to-unemployment transitions do not

necessarily measure the same thing as job loss in the DWS. But following careful consideration

of discrepancies between the two measures, and the effects of changes in the DWS questionnaire,

he concludes that changes in the questions in the 1996 DWS (covering the 1993-1995 period)

resulted in more job leavers being classified as job losers than in previous surveys, and that the

job loss rate actually did decline in this period.

        Finally, Stewart also revisits the evidence in Monks and Pizer (1998) reporting an

increase in the rate of job loss across the NLS cohorts. Stewart finds consistent evidence in the

CPS data for some education groups (those with only a high school education), but no rise for


                                                     14
other groups (college graduates or those with some college). Whereas other authors have

speculated that the NLS findings (including possibly those by Bernhardt, et al., on job stability)

may be driven by differences between the survey methods used for the different NLS cohorts,

Stewart suggests that this is unlikely to be the case, as this explanation would tend to apply

across all schooling groups, not just isolated ones.

IV. Interpreting and Understanding Sources of Change in the Employment Relationship:

A Beginning

        The papers discussed to this point parallel the existing research on job stability and job

security in that they focus primarily on measurement of changes in these characteristics of the

employment relationship. While an accurate description of changes in job stability and job

security is of course critical, especially in light of the disagreements in past research, it is equally

imperative to begin to develop an understanding of why any changes may have occurred. Job

stability and job security are, after all, only symptoms of underlying behavioral changes. Among

the previous papers, only Valletta’s emphasizes this point explicitly, but his focus is theoretical.

The final four papers in the book, in contrast, seek to understand which changes in the behavior

or decisions of employers and in the choices of workers underlie changes in job stability and job

security. Because this inquiry is new, and not as focused on a previous literature, these papers

are a bit more eclectic than the other ones in the book in terms of types of behaviors, decisions,

or outcomes studied.

        Levenson focuses on changes in part-time and temporary work (i.e., employment in the

temporary staffing industry). He considers both voluntary and involuntary part-time work,

because the latter, in particular, is thought to correspond more to the “menu” of jobs that firms

offer workers in the labor market, although this presumption is questioned in his paper. Overall,


                                                   15
the rate of involuntary part-time employment has grown since the 1970's, although this growth

occurred principally between the 1970's and 1980's (see Levenson, 1996, for a thorough analysis

of overall trends in part-time employment). The rate of temporary employment increased sharply

after the 1970's, though it grew from a very small base and therefore remains low. Levenson first

documents that involuntary part-time work has grown faster for low-skill men and women than

for high-skill men and women, and that voluntary part-time work and temporary employment

increased faster for low-skill men. These findings provide the jumping-off point for his inquiry.

The growth in involuntary part-time and temporary work appears to be part and parcel of the shift

toward increasingly “bad” jobs offered to low-skill workers. Although not documented in this

paper (see, however, the Farber paper discussed below), these jobs are likely less stable and

secure, thus suggesting a link between the types of jobs some firms are offering and changes in

job stability and job security.

        However, Levenson considers an important alternative hypothesis. We know that wages

of low-skill workers fell over the past couple of decades, both absolutely (in real terms) and

relative to high-wage workers, and that this is in part responsible for relative declines in labor

force participation among low-skill individuals (e.g., Katz and Murphy, 1991; Juhn, 1991).

Levenson builds on this research by asking whether the relative rise in involuntary part-time and

temporary work among low-skill workers in fact reflects a voluntary labor supply response to

lower wages. With respect to part-time work this would imply, of course, that the “involuntary”

distinction used in the CPS may not be meaningful, reflecting an inability to find full-time work

at the wage at which one would choose to work full-time, rather than an inability to find such

work per se. Levenson finds that for men, but not for women, the relative increase in involuntary

part-time work among the less-skilled can be partly understood as a labor supply response, while


                                                 16
only a small amount of the relative increase in temporary employment among low-skill men can

be explained as a labor supply response. This injects an important perspective into the debate

about changes in the employment relationship broadly defined, namely whether some of the

changes reflect market responses to relative wages or perhaps changes in workers’ preferences or

constraints, rather than changes in the nature of the employment relationship per se driven by

corporate restructuring, management strategies, etc.

       Farber looks at a different source of the flow of workers into temporary and involuntary

part-time employment. He defines temporary employment more broadly to include on-call and

contract work. Matching data from the DWS to the 1995 and 1997 Contingent and Alternative

Employment Arrangements Supplements to the CPS, his key finding is that workers who lose

jobs are more likely to be in temporary or involuntary part-time jobs than workers who have not

lost their jobs. Farber goes on to characterize these jobs and the workers who fill them more

fully. In particular, he finds that the relationships between job loss and temporary or involuntary

part-time employment weaken with time, suggesting that these jobs are to some extent used as

workers make transitions back to full-time, regular employment following a job loss. Indeed, his

evidence suggests that those in temporary jobs, specifically, are of two types: job losers using

them as transitions back to full-time, regular employment; and voluntary part-time workers, for

whom these jobs may be preferred over other alternatives.

       Although the nature of the evidence is different, the perspective it yields is in some ways

similar to Levenson’s. In particular, we should not necessarily view employment relationships

such as involuntary part-time or temporary employment as “bad” jobs foisted on workers who

would otherwise have full-time, regular jobs. Job loss is a persistent phenomenon, and the

availability of transitional jobs may serve a useful function. Moreover, and more closely related


                                                17
to Levenson’s work, some types of flexible or non-permanent employment relationships may be

preferred by workers. While the evidence Farber presents is cross-sectional, coupled with some

other evidence suggesting that the rate of job loss has increased, it also potentially explains part

of the growth in involuntary part-time employment and temporary employment. If the

relationship between job loss and employment in these types of jobs has been stable over time,

then higher rates of job loss would lead to higher incidence of these types of employment.

However, this cannot be established with the data Farber has available; data on most forms of

temporary employment, in particular, are available beginning only with the CPS contingent work

supplements in 1995.

       Houseman and Polivka study flexible employment arrangements broadly defined. They

begin by presenting evidence from an Upjohn Institute employer survey regarding why employers

report using flexible staffing arrangements. The authors focus on those reasons likely to have

implications for job stability, in particular whether employers use these arrangements to screen

workers for more permanent positions, and whether they actually move employees in flexible

arrangements into regular positions. Houseman and Polivka conclude that employers sometimes

use flexible arrangements for screening, most notably agency temporaries, but that other factors

are generally more important in determining employers’ reliance on these employment

arrangements.9

       The main part of their analysis exploits the CPS contingent work supplement, matching

the 1995 supplement to other CPS files to obtain evidence on job turnover among workers in

flexible and regular employment relationships. Their principal finding is that workers in these

flexible employment relationships are less likely to remain in their jobs for an additional year (or

an additional month) than workers in full-time employment. Among workers in such flexible


                                                 18
arrangements, this is especially true for agency temps, on-call workers, direct-hire temps, and

contract workers. Houseman and Polivka are naturally concerned with the possibility that

workers in these latter types of jobs are simply higher turnover workers, suggesting that it is not

the nature of these jobs, per se, that reduces job stability. Although more complete panel or work

history data might better resolve this issue, they argue–based on controls they can include

(measures of very recent job loss, turnover, unemployment, and non-employment), as well as

other evidence from longitudinal data for temporary services workers (Segal and Sullivan,

1997)–that there is a causal effect of employment in these types of arrangements on job stability.

        On the assumption that their evidence points to such a causal effect, Houseman and

Polivka also attempt to answer the question of whether growth of flexible staffing arrangements

can explain part of the modest decline in job stability in the 1990's. Because of data limitations

and the lack of evidence on the relationship between flexible employment arrangements and job

stability in earlier years, this exercise must be viewed cautiously. But based on their estimates,

the authors’ calculations suggest that the growth in flexible employment arrangements from 1986

to 1996 may explain nearly a third of the modest decline in job stability over this period.

        Finally, the paper by Cappelli seeks to shed light on the corporate downsizing

phenomenon, which has been fingered by the media as a prime cause of the decline in job

stability and job security in the 1990's, although its contribution to the overall trends is difficult

to gauge. Cappelli seeks to accomplish two goals with his analysis of establishment-level data

from the 1994 and 1997 National Employer Surveys. First, he is interested in understanding

some of the characteristics of establishments and their workforces that are related to the

incidence and magnitude of downsizings. Second, he examines the consequences of downsizing

for productivity and labor costs per employee. To operationalize the concept of “downsizing,”


                                                  19
Cappelli defines such an event as an employment reduction that is not associated with excess

capacity. Such employment reductions, it seems, are more likely to coincide with corporate

reorganizations, management restructurings, etc., that correspond to the popular conception of a

downsizing, as opposed to employment reductions associated with slack demand.10 To the best

of my knowledge this paper is the first establishment-level empirical analysis, based on

representative data, of the determinants and consequences of downsizing in terms of workforce

and establishment characteristics or outcomes. It is easy to criticize the data for a failure to

capture unambiguous downsizings or specific events or factors that might have spurred them.

Nonetheless, it presents some new evidence that helps inform our understanding of downsizing.

       The paper reports that downsizings are associated with not only reductions in labor costs

per worker, but also with declines in sales per worker (productivity). This suggests that overall

performance is unlikely to be enhanced by downsizing.11 The failure to find beneficial

consequences of downsizing is consistent with existing research cited in the paper indicating that

financial performance on average declines following a downsizing, although this research also

indicates that downsizings accompanied by specific features–such as restructuring plans–may

have more beneficial financial effects.12 The apparent absence of beneficial performance effects

implies that the motivations for the downsizings, which are believed to have generated at least

some of the increased job loss in the 1990's, remain somewhat of a mystery. Of course a strong

possibility is that the existing studies, including Cappelli’s, fail to completely capture the right

counterfactual via regression controls. That is, what may have happened to establishments or

firms had they not downsized could have been far worse than what happened to other

establishments or firms that are similar in terms of control variables available to researchers. In

this case downsizings are driven by idiosyncratic factors that are unobserved by the researcher,


                                                  20
and regressions such as those reported by Cappelli and elsewhere in the literature could be biased

against finding positive effects of downsizing. While Cappelli’s use of the National Employer

Surveys to study employment reductions in the absence of excess capacity ought to reduce any

such bias, this is a difficult issue to resolve fully. More importantly, though, this paper ought to

spur other researchers to attempt to better understand the decision to downsize and its

consequences, and to figure out how to gauge the aggregate role of downsizing in generating

changes in job stability and job security.

V. Conclusions

       This introduction is intended to provide a road map to the individual papers included in

this volume. Although readers may draw somewhat different conclusions from the papers, I

believe that they point to a relatively broad and in many cases consistent set of facts regarding

changes in the employment relationship. Overall, my reading of the evidence is that the 1990's

have witnessed some changes in the employment relationship consistent with weakened bonds

between workers and firms. But the magnitudes of these changes–while sometimes suggesting

sharp breaks with the recent past–nonetheless indicate that while these bonds may have

weakened, they have not been broken. Furthermore, the changes that occurred in the 1990's have

not persisted long enough even to earn the label “trends.” This makes it at least as plausible,

based on what we know at this point, to conclude that these changes are the unique product of

changes in the corporate world in the 1990's, rather than longer-term developments that will

necessarily persist or accelerate in the near future. It is therefore premature to infer long-term

trends towards declines in long-term employment relationships, and even more so to infer

anything like the disappearance of long-term, secure jobs.

       One shortfall in our knowledge, to which this volume has tried to make some initial


                                                 21
contributions, is the sources of changes in job stability and job security in the 1990's. The papers

addressing this question point to some potential explanations, including relative wage

movements, growth in alternative employment relationships, and downsizing. However, with the

possible exception of the first of these, this list does not encompass “fundamental” or exogenous

changes impacting the employment relationship, but rather to some extent suggests how various

changes in the employment relationship may reinforce each other. To the extent that we could

understand the structural changes underlying empirical observations on changes in job stability

and job security, we would be in a better position to make inferences or predictions regarding

future developments. In my view, this is one of the most fruitful frontiers for research on

changes in the employment relationship.

       While this chapter provides a road map to the contributions made in the papers in this

volume, reading a map is not the same as taking the trip. It can convey the contours and present

a few key facts, but only the voyage can convey the full richness of the landscape. In addition to

gaining an appreciation of the rich and detailed analyses that each paper presents, I fully

anticipate that researchers interested in exploring the employment relationship will find in the

papers many interesting detours, side trips, and perhaps even a few unmarked highways that

invite further exploration and ultimately a better understanding of this complex topic.

                                               Notes

1. I do not review the previous literature except in cases where its
findings are directly addressed in the present papers. For reviews
of that literature see Schmidt and Svorny (1998), Marcotte (1995),
and Diebold, et al. (1997). For broader reviews of workplace
changes extending well beyond job stability and job security, see
Cappelli, et al. (1997), Cappelli (1999), and Committee on
Techniques for the Enhancement of Human Resources (1999). For
a brief overview of a subset of the papers included in this volume,
see Valletta (1999).

2. This emphasizes a more general issue in this research, namely that we do not have sufficient
data to observe changes over time in full distributions of completed tenure spells for jobs
beginning at different points of time. Rather, we have to choose particular metrics that
potentially obscure some of the details regarding changes in these distributions.

3. Jaeger and Stevens present results that address the issue of changing participation in another
way, by comparing employment-based and population-based measures.

4. In research released after the earlier versions of this paper, but apparently done concurrently,
Bansak and Raphael (1998) and Fitzgerald (1999) reach the similar conclusion that the SIPP data
do not provide evidence of a decline in job stability.

5. To the best of my knowledge, this distinction was introduced into the recent debate by Valletta
(1996).

6. This hypothesis was suggested in Neumark and Polsky (1998). See Kletzer (1994) for a
review of evidence on the changing incidence of displacement for white-collar workers in the
early 1990's.

7. Greenspan stated in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs, on February 26, 1997 that “atypical restraint on compensation increases has been
evident for a few years now and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker
insecurity.” See also Aaronson and Sullivan (1998).

8. For another recent attempt to study workers perceptions of job security and likely outcomes in
the event of job loss (using the Survey of Economic Expectations, or SEE), see Manski and
Straub (1999). This paper takes some steps in the direction of deriving theoretical predictions for
patterns of these perceptions/expectations in the data.

9. They also report some suggestive evidence, based on CPS data discussed below, that workers
are sometimes moved from “regular permanent positions” into flexible arrangements.

10. This definition contrasts with much existing work equating downsizing with employment
reductions, including Allen, et al. (this volume), Farber and Hallock (1999), and the annual
survey of the American Management Association’s “AMA Survey on Downsizing, Job
Elimination and Job Creation.”
11. This parallels findings in Cappelli and Neumark (1999) that introduction of innovative work
practices appears to move labor costs per worker and productivity in the same direction– positive
in this case.

12. In a recent study of this issue, Farber and Hallock (1999) report that the magnitude of
negative effects of reductions in force on stock prices has declined over time, suggesting that
more recent reductions in force have focused on improvements in efficiency (downsizing?) rather
than reductions in product demand.
