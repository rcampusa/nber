                                              ABSTRACT

The direct benefits of infrastructure in developing countries can be large, but if new infrastructure
induces in-migration, congestion of other local publicly provided goods may offset the direct benefits.
Using the example of rural household electrification in South Africa, we demonstrate the importance
of accounting for migration when evaluating welfare gains of spatial programs. We also provide a
practical approach to computing welfare gains that does not rely on land prices. We develop a location
choice model that incorporates missing land markets and allows for congestion in local land. Using
this model, we construct welfare bounds as a function of the income and population effects of the new
electricity infrastructure. A novel prediction from the model is that migration elasticities and congestion
effects are especially large when land markets are missing. We empirically estimate these welfare
bounds for rural electrification in South Africa, and show that congestion externalities from program-
induced migration reduced local welfare gains by about 40%.

1       Introduction
Governments in poor countries spend large sums on programs with spatial components, such
as transport, sanitation, and energy infrastructure; schools, hospitals, and clinics; and irri-
gation facilities.1 A key feature of most such investments is that they take place in only part
of a country, changing the relative attractiveness of certain regions for inhabitants. Standard
approaches to evaluating the impacts of such development programs do not always account
for the possibility that this change in relative attractiveness can induce a migration response.
Much of the recent development literature measures the impact of new infrastructure on in-
cumbent residents’ outcomes along dimensions that the infrastructure directly affects, such
as the effect of subsidized private tap connections on water use, health, well-being, and
time use (Devoto et al., 2011, studying urban Morocco) or the impact of household elec-
trification on home production technologies, employment, and earnings (Dinkelman, 2011,
studying rural South Africa).2 While this direct approach provides some insight into the
effects of spatial programs, by design it is not informative about how increased in-migration
and reduced out-migration could alter the gains from a program of infrastructure investment.
The omission of migration becomes particularly important when other local, rival, publicly
provided goods, such as schools or hospitals, are in short supply: Any migration response
to a location-based investment may end up congesting access to other such goods, thereby
undermining welfare gains from the investment.
     This paper is motivated by the idea that evaluations of place-based programs should
account for migration responses and the related congestion externalities. We use a specific
example — rural electrification in South Africa — to illustrate why and how migration could
matter for evaluating welfare gains of spatial programs and propose a way to quantify these
gains. Our example builds on the evaluation of the labor market effects of the rural electri-
fication program in Dinkelman (2011). We begin by showing that the migration response to
the program was very large, and we provide new evidence that the migration response was
    1
     In Africa, spatial projects account for between 6% and 12% of GDP (Briceño-Garmendia, Smits, and
Foster, 2008). The United States is a key contributor to infrastructure investments in developing countries,
spending up to U.S. $50 billion on such projects in 2009 (Lin and Doemeland, 2012).
   2
     This direct approach has many other recent examples: Kremer et al. (2011) measure the impact of
subsidized spring protection on disease incidence in rural Kenya; Cattaneo et al. (2009) estimate the impact
of cement floors on child health, child cognition, and adult happiness in urban Mexico; Duflo and Pande
(2007) measure the impact of irrigation dams on agricultural output and rural poverty in India; Donaldson
(forthcoming) estimates the impact of Indian railroad expansion on agricultural prices and income levels and
variability; Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian (2012) estimate the effect of transportation infrastructure on regional
output in China; Lipscomb, Mobarak, and Barham (2013) estimate the impacts of hydropower electrification
in Brazil on a host of economic outcomes.

associated with congestion in households and in local schools.
     In theory, one could account for the welfare consequences of migration responses to rural
electrification and related congestion by estimating impacts of this investment on land prices
and wages. Such an analysis would follow the urban and local public finance literatures (e.g.,
Albouy, 2009; Glaeser, 2007, 2008; Roback, 1982) that use land prices and wages to value
place-based policies. Many authors have applied such methods in developed-country con-
texts, where land markets operate well and researchers can measure how the value of spatial
investments is capitalized in housing prices and wages.3 In practice, however, rural South
Africa is characterized by a lack of land markets: Land is communal and typically allocated
through non-price mechanisms, which we describe in Section 2.1. The usual framework
for using land prices to evaluate place-based policies is thus infeasible. This problem arises
quite frequently in developing-country settings because missing markets for land are common
(Adams, Cousins, and Manona, 1999; Udry, 2012) — land sales are prohibited in Ethiopia,
and formal land title is lacking in large parts of the world, including rural India and Mexico
(Banerjee and Duflo, 2007)— and even where land markets do exist, high-quality data on
land rents often do not (Lozano-Gracia et al., 2013).
     This paper provides an example of how one can address migration responses, related
congestion externalities, and missing land markets in estimating the welfare effects of a
spatial program. We adapt the spatial equilibrium model from Moretti (2011) to the case of
rural electrification in South Africa. Individuals in our model choose between an urban area
and a rural one; infrastructure improvements in the rural area cause people to migrate there.4
We model congestion by assuming an equal-sharing rule for the allocation of a rival publicly
provided good. (Less extreme forms of congestion would produce similar but attenuated
quantitative results.)
     We use the stylized model to construct welfare bounds for the South African rural elec-
trification program. The bounds arise because we do not know the distribution of tastes
for living in the location that receives the program; the upper bound is reached when in-
   3
     For example, Black (1999) measures the value of school quality by estimating how differences in
otherwise-identical school neighborhoods are capitalized in housing prices, Davis (2011) examines how con-
struction of a power plant reduces land values in a county, and Busso, Gregory, and Kline (2013) use land
rents as a component of their estimated effects of federal Enterprise Zone policies. Fewer examples exist for
developing countries, and where they do, they almost always occur in urban areas, for example: Lall and
Lundberg (2008).
   4
     We model congestion in rural areas because our application focuses on rural infrastructure. But rural
congestion is relevant more generally: Young (2013) provides new estimates from 65 poor and middle-income
countries that while 20% of rural-born adults migrate to urban areas, 25% of urban-born adults migrate to
rural areas. Moreover, rural areas are more likely to suffer from a lack of land markets than urban areas.



                                                     2
migrants have as strong a preference as incumbents for living in the program location, and
the lower bound is reached when in-migrants are almost indifferent between living in the pro-
gram location and living elsewhere. Given credible estimates of the income and population
effects of rural electrification and of relative preferences for public versus private goods, we
can calculate these welfare bounds even when land markets or land price data are missing.
We find that taking migration into account reduces the welfare benefit of rural household
electrification by about 40%.
    Our paper makes three main contributions. First, we highlight why migration can be of
first-order importance in understanding welfare impacts of spatial programs in developing
countries. Our paper provides the first empirical evidence from a developing-country context
that congestion effects exist and can be quantitatively large. While congestion externalities
are important in urban economics, they have not yet received much attention in the de-
velopment literature (Quigley, 2008).5 Because there is no guarantee that governments in
developing countries will be able to increase the supply of congestible local public goods even
over very long periods of time, this is not merely a problem of the short run.
    Second, our model highlights an often-overlooked but important theoretical concern: Mi-
gration responses to spatial programs are inefficiently large when land markets are missing.
Without the information captured in land prices that could alert people to congestion ex-
ternalities, less of a brake on migration is applied in response to a place-based program. We
show that with no land market, the welfare benefits of a spatial program for both incumbents
and movers are lower than they would be if a land market existed — a version of the tragedy
of the commons. This excess migration is more likely to occur in developing countries where
property rights are commonly unspecified and where access to publicly provided services
such as education and health care is typically not priced.
    Third, we illustrate how researchers might account for the welfare-reducing effects of con-
gestion in a developing country, complementing traditional approaches to valuing the impact
of place-based programs that rely on measures of land rents. By computing welfare bounds
for the impact of rural household electrification in South Africa as a function of income and
population responses to the program, we show it is feasible to account for migration when
land markets are missing. While our model is designed to capture important characteristics
of the particular economic context and infrastructure investment in our empirical applica-
   5
     Usher (1977) examines the theoretical effects of international migration on access to public property.
Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1986), in a study of family planning policies, show that program evaluation is
difficult when there is selective migration in response to the policies and heterogeneity in the policies’
treatment effects but do not explore the impact of migration on access to other publicly available services.



                                                     3
tion, the approach of calculating welfare effects without relying on housing price data is likely
to have broad relevance because developing countries typically lack functional land markets
or high-quality land price data.
    One implication of our analysis is that researchers can learn much more about the effects
of spatial programs in poor countries by using information about migration, rather than
treating migration responses as a nuisance. Researchers conducting randomized controlled
trials involving spatial treatments may be particularly well placed to measure migration
externalities, if they collect appropriate data on population densities.
    A few recent papers have begun to innovate in the use of randomized controlled trials to
measure different types of spillover effects of programs with spatial components, for example
Crépon et al., 2013, studying job training programs in France, and Mobarak and Rosenzweig,
2014, studying insurance products in India. One approach has been to quantify negative
spillover effects on program-related outcomes for non-treated individuals. A second approach
is to use a structural model to trace out the impact of spatially targeted programs on welfare
through price changes in general equilibrium. Our paper is related to this second approach.
However, we highlight that when land price data do not exist, and in particular when land
markets do not exist, we require a fundamentally different approach to estimate the welfare
impact of a spatial investment program.
    Our work carries some important caveats. First, we ignore urban agglomeration external-
ities and urban congestion effects, partly for tractability and partly because the evidence for
(in particular) agglomeration externalities is scant in developed countries and nonexistent
for developing countries (Quigley, 2008). Without measuring urban welfare, our estimates of
the welfare impacts of the rural electrification program are limited to rural areas. In Section
3.8, we discuss extensions to our model that allow for urban agglomeration and congestion
effects. This discussion illustrates that the net impact of rural electrification on urban areas
is not unambiguously positive, but rather depends on the relative size of congestion and ag-
glomeration effects in cities. Determining the existence of positive agglomeration or negative
congestion effects in urban areas is beyond the scope of this paper. In our quantitative anal-
ysis, we discuss how large (or small) the impact on urban areas would need to be to eliminate
remaining positive impacts of rural electrification or to make a substantial difference to the
upper bound on our welfare estimates.
    A second, related caveat is that we use a partial-equilibrium model. We assume that
overall migration effects are small enough so that the effects of out-migration in other parts
of the country are ignorable, but we also discuss how the model could be modified to account


                                               4
for this general equilibrium concern. Third, we ignore the questions of how to optimally
finance local programs through taxation6 and how to optimally allocate spatial investments;
to highlight how congestion affects welfare, we focus on estimating welfare gains from local
programs in the places where these local programs occur. Finally, our analysis is static; we
do not consider the dynamic effects of place-based policies.
    The paper begins by describing the example of a spatial investment that motivates our
paper: rural household electrification in South Africa. We briefly review the context and
methods in Dinkelman (2011) and describe the particular institutions of land allocation in
these rural areas that lead us to develop a model with missing land markets. We provide
new estimates of the population and congestion effects of this infrastructure investment. The
next part of the paper develops a two-period model of location choice under the assumption
of missing land markets. We derive equilibrium conditions for period 1 and describe the
new equilibrium after a local infrastructure project is implemented in period 2. Crucially,
the characteristics of this new equilibrium depend on whether we allow a land market in the
second period. We derive formulae for the compensating variation of the program and welfare
bounds for the impact of the program as functions of income and migration (population)
elasticities. We discuss several extensions to the model that allow infrastructure to be an
amenity, allow production to be decreasing returns to scale, and address general equilibrium
concerns by including urban agglomeration and congestion effects. Finally, we implement
the bounds from our model given consistent estimates of the relevant model parameters from
the South African case.


2       Rural household electrification in South Africa
Electric service is a classic example of an infrastructure good that is tied to place. Because
electrification changes living conditions and work possibilities, the relative attractiveness of
living in a community could change when it gets electricity. In South Africa, rural elec-
trification directly affected labor market outcomes and induced migration. We begin by
reviewing the program of rural electrification in South Africa and describing a key feature
of the institutional setting in which this infrastructure development took place: a setting of
missing land markets. We recap the empirical strategy used in Dinkelman (2011) and report
    6
     Typically, the local public finance literature takes into account both the benefit incidence of local pro-
grams as well as the cost incidence in terms of who pays the taxes that fund local programs. Tiebout (1956) is
a classic reference; Wildasin (1991) and Calabrese, Epple, and Romano (2012) provide more recent analyses
focusing on questions of incidence.

the effects of the program on migration, measured by changes in population. Using the same
empirical strategy and new data, we present additional evidence that program-induced mi-
gration resulted in congestion in households and in local schools. The details of this example
inform the structure of the model that we use to compute welfare bounds.


2.1     Program description, institutional setting, and prior estimates
        of program impact
Between 1995 and 2001, roughly 200,000 households in rural KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) benefited
from new electricity connections installed by South Africa’s national power utility, Eskom.7
Connections were free, and although electricity was priced (at a low rate), most households
could afford to light their homes and some were able to purchase power for cooking. Dinkel-
man (2011) identifies the causal impact of this infrastructure rollout on employment using
an instrumental variables strategy relying on land gradient, a key factor affecting the cost
of providing household connections.
    Using community-level Census data from before and after the program matched to ad-
ministrative data on the location and timing of electrification projects and to geographic
features of the communities (land gradient, distance from roads and towns, and distance
from electricity substations), Dinkelman (2011) finds that employment rises for women and
men in electrifying communities. These direct effects on employment are driven by increases
in female labor force participation: The IV results indicate a significant 9 percentage point
increase in female employment in electrified communities.
    A key feature of the communities in this study is the absence of a market-based system for
land transactions, along with unpriced publicly provided goods and services. Land is largely
state owned or held in trust, often untitled, and communally operated. As in many other
parts of Africa (Adams, Cousins, and Manona, 1999), local chiefs, kin-based networks, or
tribal authorities decide who can access land and for what purposes (residential, cropping, or
communal grazing), although details of these allocation mechanisms are unclear.8 Without
a land market, newcomers to a rural community may gain access to land and housing by
moving in with relatives and increasing household size. They may also occupy communal
land illegally, as squatters. In our empirical example, such land occupation was facilitated by
   7
    See Dinkelman (2011) for a detailed discussion of the program.
   8
    Historically, chiefs were supposed to discern good from bad community members and newcomers, and so
protect the community from unsavory types (Hall, 2009). In practice, kin networks often receive preferential
treatment in the allocation of land.



                                                     6
the complete breakdown of the land administration regime in rural ex-homeland areas and
the resulting increase in uncertainty over land rights in the post-apartheid period (Adams,
Cousins, and Manona, 1999; Lahiff, 2001). In addition to land, the provision of and access to
many publicly provided goods, such as local schools, health clinics, and water infrastructure,
is also outside the ambit of the market. The state provides these goods and services for all
residents in a given locality, and access is often determined through queueing.
    The absence of a land market in this rural setting means that we cannot use estimates
of the wage and land price effects of the program to measure the value of the new electricity
infrastructure to consumers. Despite this difficulty, we will show that it is still possible to
say something about the welfare effects of the program by using the structure of a location
choice model along with estimates of the population’s income and population effects. In the
process, our model will yield some novel insights into how the lack of land markets leads to
excess congestion in other local publicly provided goods.
    Before turning to the model, we provide empirical evidence on the population impacts of
the South African electrification and associated congestion externalities.


2.2     Population and congestion effects of rural electrification

2.2.1   Empirical methods and data

Dinkelman (2011) provides some estimates of the impact of electrification on total popula-
tion. We extend these results to show the direct effects of providing this new infrastructure
on the number of individuals older and younger than 14 years of age in electrifying communi-
ties, and on household density and household size. To do so, we follow the same instrumental
variables empirical strategy:

                         ∆yjdt = ν1 + ν2 ∆Ijdt + ν3 Xjd0 + νd + ∆jdt                     (1a)
                         ∆Ijdt = δ1 + δ2 Zjd + δ3 Xjd0 + δd + ∆ωjdt ,                     (1b)

where ∆yjdt is the change in the outcome variable (such as population) in community j
and district d between 1996 and 2001, and where ∆Ijdt = 1 if a community was electrified
between 1996 and 2001. Xjd0 controls for baseline characteristics of the community including
household density and distance from the initial grid, νd and δd are district-specific trends,
and jdt and ωjdt are community-specific error terms. Since there are good reasons to suspect
that electricity projects were not assigned randomly, and to be concerned about correlation

                                               7
between project assignment and unobservable community-level trends (i.e., to suspect that
E[∆jdt ∆Ijdt ] 6= 0), Dinkelman (2011) instruments for ∆Ijdt with community land gradient
Zjd . The identification assumption is that, conditional on controls, population growth trends
should not be different across communities with steeper versus flatter land gradients.
    To provide evidence for local congestion effects in the wake of the migration response to
the program, we supplement the community-level data set with spatially matched data from
South Africa’s national School Register of Needs Survey (also before and after electrification)
and assign school-level variables to communities in which schools are located. We estimate
the indirect effects of electrification through crowding using the same system of equations
in (1), the change in student-teacher ratio and number of learners per school as outcomes,
and check that the number of schools does not increase in electrifying communities over the
same time period.

2.2.2    Population and congestion results

Table 1 presents key summary statistics. Between 1996 and 2001, about 20% of the 1,816
rural communities received free Eskom electrification. The employment rate in the baseline
period is 10%, an extremely low level of participation. Because these former homeland
areas have poor land, employment opportunities were very sparse (Dinkelman, 2011). At
baseline, household density is relatively high — 22 households per square kilometer — and
the average household size is under 4, with a wide range (2 to 14). Each community has on
average 0.94 schools, also with a wide range: Some communities contain no schools, while
other, larger communities have up to 11 schools. Conditional on having at least one school
in the area, average student-teacher ratios (STRs) are high, at 39 for an average community.
Some schools serve very small populations and have just four learners per teacher, while
other schools are burdened with STRs of over 100.
    Table 2, Panel A, presents evidence on the migration response to the program. The
first two columns reproduce the OLS and IV population growth regressions from Dinkelman
(2011).9 Population grows by 3.8 log points over five years in electrifying communities. The
95% confidence interval is wide, and at the lower bound, electrification increases district-
level population by a factor of about 4. Even this lower bound is a massive effect.10 On
   9
     Appendix C presents the first-stage regression results for the instrumental variables regressions in Table
2. The excluded instrument is land gradient, and the F-statistic on this instrument is 8.26 (p-value=0.00).
This relatively weak instrument means that the effects of the program will be difficult to measure precisely,
which will in turn mean that our welfare bounds will be estimated with less precision than we would like.
  10
     We have checked that the large IV coefficients for population growth are not driven by outliers or by



                                                      8
average across all communities, annual population growth is between 2% and 3%, but there
is substantial heterogeneity (the standard deviation is 12%). Some very small communities
grow enormously, while other, larger communities, grow at slower rates. The evidence in
Table 2 suggests that electrifying communities grew particularly fast. This growth is far
larger than the natural increase in population can explain. The growth rate of the adult
population (ages 14 to 60) is even higher than the growth rate of the child population (under
age 14) in electrifying communities. The final two columns of Panel A of the table show
that the increased number of adults and children in electrifying communities resulted in a
substantial increase in household density. Electrifying areas become fives times more dense
than the average over five years (again, with a very wide confidence interval). These changes
in population reflect the change in relative attractiveness of electrifying communities as a
result of the infrastructure program.11
    The results in Table 2, Panel B, show how this growth in population in electrifying
communities led to crowding in other local congestible public goods. In column 2 of Panel
B, we see the IV estimates of the impact of electrification on household size. In places getting
access to electricity between 1996 and 2001, household size increases by almost one person.
This is a large increase relative to average household size (3.62) and the median number of
rooms per house for this sample (3).
    The next set of columns show the consequences for access to schooling. (Unfortunately,
there are no data on patients served by local clinics or hospitals that could be used to show
congestion in other important publicly provided congestible services.) Schools become more
crowded in areas getting access to electricity by virtue of gradient: Student-teacher ratios
increase by more than 26 students on average, or about 66% relative to the average STR.
The number of school-registered learners in each community increases by a large (but not
statistically significant) 239 students, or 27%. Importantly, the final two columns of Panel
B show no evidence that the number of schools in electrifying areas is increasing over the
period. At least in the short run (five years), important local publicly provided goods (other
than electricity) are not elastically supplied in these areas.
functional form. Because we use these IV estimates to calculate the welfare effects of electrification, our
welfare bounds will be Local Average Treatment Effects capturing the welfare effect of the program for
areas induced into treatment by the instrumental variable we use. However, this limitation of our results
is a property of the particular instrumental variable rather than of our method for adjusting for migration
impacts; if causal estimates of the program’s average treatment effect were available, they could be used in
constructing our welfare bounds.
   11
      Unfortunately, the data on the number of in-migrants to these areas are not very well measured, making
it difficult to precisely estimate the impact of electrification on the number of in-migrants to electrifying
areas.


                                                     9
    These results on congestion in communities, in households, and in public schools after
rural electrification represent some of the first empirical estimates of congestion externalities
in a developing country. They highlight a powerful channel through which migration may
have negative consequences for at least some incumbents.12
    To summarize: Rural electrification in South Africa provides us with a classic example
of a spatial program that affected specific communities. This program increased employ-
ment for incumbents, induced population growth through in-migration and likely reduced
outmigration, and led to congestion in households and schools. Since this migration response
occurred in a setting without land prices, we require a model to measure the welfare effects
of the electrification program. The rest of the paper sets up such a model, then combines
it with the empirical estimates of income and population effects of rural electrification to
estimate welfare bounds.


3     Welfare effects of rural electrification in the presence
      of migration: A model
This section describes how one can use a simple model of migration to value a place-based
development program such as rural electrification. We adapt the spatial equilibrium model
of Moretti (2011) to the South African rural electrification case. We innovate by contrasting
the model’s solutions in two distinct institutional settings: one in which there is no land
market and another in which such a market exists. We show that differences in migration
responses and related congestion externalities drive a wedge between the two solutions, so
that rural electrification produces smaller welfare benefits when there is no land market. We
show how the model structure can be used to estimate welfare bounds for this infrastructure
investment when land markets are missing or land prices are not measured.
    Our baseline model is designed to match several important characteristics of the South
African context. For example, we assume that production has constant returns to scale.
In extensions, we show some ways in which the model could be enriched to apply to other
contexts and demonstrate that the key qualitative findings are robust to these extensions.
We primarily focus on measuring the impact of the spatial investment on rural areas but
also show how our findings would change if we extended the model to consider impacts on
  12
     For example, if recent empirical evidence from the United States (Chetty et al., 2011) is any guide, then
larger class sizes (higher STRs) may have negative effects on human capital attainment in the short run and
on educational attainment, savings, and home ownership in the long run.

urban areas that supply rural migrants.


3.1     Preferences and endowments
There are two time periods, t = 1, 2. In each period, a given consumer i chooses whether to
live in an urban area or a rural area.13 For simplicity, and to match what we are able to do
in our empirical work, we assume that different individuals consider different rural areas as
their alternative to the urban location but that each individual may consider only one rural
area as a possible location. Consumers are myopic: In each period, they consider only that
period’s utility in deciding where to live, and they choose whichever location gives them the
highest utility.
    In each period, all consumers receive the same utility Ū from living in the urban area.
Consumer i’s utility of living in the rural area in period t is

                                        Ui (ct , at ) = cαt a1−α
                                                             t   + i ,                                 (2)

where ct is a freely tradable consumption good; at is person i’s share of some local publicly
provided good; and i captures heterogeneity in preferences for living in the rural area,
uniformly distributed on the interval [−s, s].
    The publicly provided good at is a reduced form for any rival, potentially excludable,
nontraded good, such as schooling, health-care services, congestion in communal land from
in-migrants who occupy public spaces, as well as congestion in households from in-migrants
who move into existing households with relatives (as the household size results in Table 2
suggested). We assume that at enters directly into utility, rather than serving as a factor of
production, because much of the land in rural South Africa is not suitable for farming and
because many local publicly provided goods we have in mind, such as schooling, are at best
investments that affect future productivity but not current productivity. For the rest of our
analysis, we refer to A as land and at as an individual’s share of that land (again bearing in
mind that these variables could represent any rival, nontraded good that is fixed in supply
at the local level, such as schools, clinics, water infrastructure, or space in existing housing).
    The taste shock i does not change over time for a given individual. Preference hetero-
geneity implies that some individuals will be inframarginal in the spatial equilibrium and will
not be indifferent between rural and urban locations. These individuals capture utility rents
  13
    We use the labels “urban” and “rural” for ease of exposition. However, the core idea is that individuals
are choosing between only two places, one of which — the place labeled “urban” — is outside the reach of
the program we are evaluating. We discuss extensions to this assumption below.


                                                     11
in equilibrium; heterogeneity in preferences prevents migration from arbitraging away all of
the gains from local infrastructure programs.14 The assumption of a uniform distribution
for preferences gives us tractable expressions for the program’s quantitative effect but is not
crucial for the qualitative results. The parameter s measures how much variation there is in
the strength of consumers’ attachment to the rural area. If s is large, some individuals are
strongly attached to the rural area and will prefer the city only given large reductions in ct
or at .
    Each consumer has a time endowment Tt that she supplies inelastically to the market.
We assume that rural consumers have exogenously given productivity wt per unit time,
regardless of the rural population, and are paid their marginal product when they work.
Under these assumptions, labor income is wt Tt . Given our assumptions, employers earn
zero profits regardless of the infrastructure investment, so we need to keep track only of
consumers’ welfare to measure the welfare impact of the investment.15
    The rural area has a perfectly elastic supply of the consumption good, which we treat
as numeraire, and a perfectly inelastic supply A of land. In the first time period, there is
no market for land; rather, it is rationed equally across all consumers who choose to live
in the rural area. By adopting this “equal-sharing” rule, we simplify the non-market-based
allocation of the local public good described in Section 2.1. This simplification allows us to
examine what a complete lack of markets for these goods implies for migration responses
to local programs. Imperfect markets for such publicly provided goods are likely to have
similar, although attenuated, effects.
    Under the equal-sharing rule for land, the budget set in the rural area in the first period
is
                                                        A
                                     c1 ≤ w1 T1 , a1 =     ,                                (3)
                                                        N1
where N1 is the number of consumers in the rural area in period 1. We will investigate
two alternative allocation mechanisms for land allocation in period 2: equal sharing and
market-based allocation.

spatial equilibrium models.
  15
     Decreasing returns to scale do not change our qualitative results, but in contexts where decreasing returns
are important, researchers would want to add this feature to the model to obtain accurate quantitative results.
We show how to do this in Section 3.7.

3.2    Equilibrium in period 1: Before the program
An equilibrium in period 1 is a consumption choice for each consumer and an assignment
of consumers to locations such that, given Ū , each consumer’s consumption and location
choices maximize utility, taking the rationing of the publicly provided good as given. The
indirect utility of living in the rural area in period 1 is

                                                                                       A
                      Ui1∗ = max cα a1−α + i s.t. c ≤ w1 T1 ,                    a=
                              c,a                                                      N1
                                        1−α                                               (4)
                                     α  A
                           = (w1 T1 )          + i .
                                        N1

Thus, i chooses to live in the rural area in period 1 if and only if Ui1∗ ≥ Ū , or
                                                                1−α
                                                    α       A
                               i ≥ Ū − (w1 T1 )                       ≡ ¯1 .             (5)
                                                            N1

This result defines a cutoff for the preference shock ¯1 , below which individuals choose to
stay in the urban area and above which individuals choose the rural area.


3.3    Modeling the effect of infrastructure
We assume that the rural electrification program raises income, wt Tt , in the rural area by
changing the time endowment. For example, household electrification can allow women to
devote more time to market work by reducing the time they must spend gathering firewood
for cooking. Although electrification potentially makes workers more productive on the job
(thereby possibly affecting wt ), this did not occur in South Africa (see Dinkelman, 2011).
    We assume the infrastructure program does not affect urban utility Ū . This amounts to
assuming that migrants out of the urban area represent a small fraction of the urban popula-
tion, even though they may be a large fraction of the rural population. This assumption also
rules out potential benefits or costs to the urban area arising from people leaving the urban
area. We discuss in Section 3.8 how relaxing this assumption would change our equilibrium
and the calculation of welfare benefits.


3.4    Equilibrium in period 2
We now characterize the spatial equilibrium that arises in period 2, after the infrastructure
program is implemented. The nature of the post-program equilibrium depends on the form

                                                13
of the market for land.

3.4.1   No land markets

Suppose that, in period 2, land is again rationed across consumers who choose to live in the
rural area. Then the equilibrium is identical to that in period 1, except that w2 T2 > w1 T1 ;
consumer i chooses to live in the rural area in period 2 if and only if
                                                               1−α
                                                   α       A
                              i ≥ Ū − (w2 T2 )                       ≡ ¯2 .               (6)
                                                           N2

   The fraction of individuals living in the rural area is the same as the probability that
i ≥ ¯2 . Hence, using the uniform distribution of i , we can write the local labor supply
function,                                       1−α
                           2N2 − P           α  A
                         s         = (w2 T2 )             − Ū = −¯2 ,                  (7)
                             P                  N2
where P is the total population in the urban and rural areas. The left-hand side of (7) is
strictly increasing in N2 , while the right-hand side is strictly decreasing in N2 and strictly
increasing in w2 T2 . Therefore, the equilibrium population N2 is strictly increasing in income
w2 T2 ; more people live in the rural area after the infrastructure is built (or, ¯2 < ¯1 ).
    Because the indirect utility of the rural area is monotonic in i , anyone who chose the
rural area in period 1 will continue to choose it when rural income rises in period 2. Thus,
after the infrastructure program, two kinds of people are in the rural area: rural stayers,
who lived in the rural area in period 1 and remain there in period 2, and movers, who lived
in the urban area in period 1 but are induced by higher incomes to move to the rural area in
period 2. We will take into account the welfare gains of the program accruing to both rural
stayers and movers in constructing our welfare bounds.

3.4.2   With a land market

Suppose alternatively that in period 2, there is a market for land: It can be bought and sold
at price r̂2 . (Land might be traded for a price, or, if we consider schooling or health services
as the local, rival publicly provided good, slots in school could be “bought” for a school fee,
or private health care might be available.) To keep notation clear, we will use hats to denote
all variables corresponding to the equilibrium with a market for the local public good. We
assume that the people who lived in the rural area in period 1 (when land was rationed)
own equal shares of the land endowment. We continue to assume the infrastructure program

                                               14
raises incomes (i.e., w2 T2 > w1 T1 ). We show below that, as in the no-markets case, this
assumption implies that no one who lives in the rural area in period 1 moves away in period
2. Thus, we must continue to distinguish between rural stayers and movers into the rural
area. The period 2 budget constraints of rural stayers and movers are

                                                                                 A
                                     ĉ2,stayer + r̂2 â2,stayer = w2 T2 + r̂2                            (8a)
                                                                                 N1
                                     ĉ2,mover + r̂2 â2,mover = w2 T2 .                                 (8b)



    An equilibrium in period 2 with a land market is a price r̂2 , consumption and land
choices for each consumer, and an assignment of consumers to locations such that, given Ū ,
(i) each consumer’s consumption and location choices maximize utility, taking the land price
as given, and (ii) the land market clears. We show in Appendix A1 that, in the equilibrium,
the indirect utilities of rural stayers and movers are
                                                               !                    1−α
                         ∗                      1 − α N̂2                        A
                       Ûi2,stayer   =α 1+                (w2 T2 )α                         + i          (9a)
                                                  α N1                         N̂2
                                                   1−α
                         ∗                          A
                       Ûi2,mover    = α(w2 T2 )α          + i .                                        (9b)
                                                   N̂2

Because stayers collect rents, they have higher indirect utility than movers for any given
value of i . Therefore, if anyone who started in the rural area moves out, no one will move
in — all of the potential in-migrants have lower i and would have to pay rent, besides.
   The effect of creating a market for land on migration depends on whether w2 T2 is larger
than w1 T1 . If w2 T2 = w1 T1 , creating a market does not change incumbents’ budget sets.
Hence, if w2 T2 = w1 T1 , then N2 = N1 regardless of whether there is a land market in the
second period.16 This result says that, without the infrastructure program, having a market
does not change the equilibrium allocation and thus does not change welfare. Thus, we can
analyze how markets change the welfare impact of the program by comparing post-program
welfare in the market and no-market cases.
  16
     The proof of this claim is by contradiction. If creating a land market caused the rural population to
fall, then for people who were in the rural area in period 1, the period 1 consumption bundle would remain
feasible in period 2 for any value of r̂2 and would be preferred to living in the urban area, implying that all
of the initial rural residents would prefer to stay and contradicting the hypothesis that the rural population
falls. Alternatively, if creating a land market caused the rural population to rise, anyone who preferred the
urban area in period 1 must still prefer it in period 2, when wages are no higher than before and in-migrants
must pay rent, contradicting the hypothesis that the rural population rises.


                                                          15
   If w2 T2 > w1 T1 , the number of people who move to the rural area depends on whether
there is a land market. First, if w2 T2 > w1 T1 , it cannot be an equilibrium for anyone to
move out: Just as in the no-markets case, because rural incomes in period 2 are larger than
they were in period 1, no one who preferred the rural area in period 1 will prefer the urban
area in period 2. Second, a person who was in the urban area in period 1 will move to the
                                        ∗
rural area in period 2 if and only if Ûi2,mover ≥ Ū , or
                                                              1−α
                                                 α       A
                              i ≥ Ū − α(w2 T2 )                     ≡ ˆ¯2 .               (10)
                                                         N̂2

Depending on the parameters of the model, ¯ˆ2 may be larger or smaller than ¯1 . If ˆ¯2 ≥ ¯1 ,
no one moves to the rural area; the populations remain the same. This would be the case
if the increase in income driven by the new infrastructure was exactly offset by an increase
in rents to be paid by any movers. If ˆ¯2 < ¯1 , some people move to the rural area and its
population increases. Regardless of the parameters, we have the following result:

Proposition 1 The migration response to an increase in the time endowment caused by
the local infrastructure program is strictly smaller when there is a market for land (i.e.,
N̂2 < N2 ).

    The migration response without a land market is strictly positive. If ¯ˆ2 ≥ ¯1 , then the
migration response with a land market is zero, which is strictly less than the response without
a land market. If ˆ¯2 < ¯1 , the rural population in period 2 with a land market satisfies
                                                                  1−α
                              2N̂2 − P                       A
                            s          = α(w2 T2 )α                       − Ū .             (11)
                                 P                           N̂2

The left-hand sides of (7) and (11) are identical and are both strictly increasing in the rural
population. Since α ∈ (0, 1), the right-hand side of (11) is strictly less than the right-hand
side of (7) for a fixed value of the rural population. Further, the right-hand sides of both
equations are strictly decreasing in the rural population. Thus, the rural population that
solves (7) — the no-markets equilibrium population — is strictly greater than the equilibrium
population with a market, which solves (11).                                                 
    Proposition 1 is the first main theoretical result from our model. The proposition demon-
strates that more people move into the rural area in response to a local infrastructure program
when the land market is missing. Put differently, when a market for land exists, the price
of land gives consumers information about crowding and acts as a brake on migration. In

                                               16
essence, this is a version of the tragedy of the commons. When individuals move into a rural
area after the program, congestion in the local publicly provided good A is taken account
of only when that good is priced. In contrast, when anyone in the rural area can access the
congestible good, the migration response to the program is higher, which reduces welfare.17
    Although the migration response is strictly smaller when there is a land market, the
existence of a land market does not ensure a socially optimal distribution of people across
rural and urban locations. This is because, in the model, the only way for landlords to
collect rent from rural property is for them to remain in rural areas. Hence, if the rural
area is initially overcrowded compared with the efficient allocation, creating a land market
will not induce people to leave the rural area. The implication is that while land markets
enable rents to act as a brake on migration, the creation of land markets does not by itself
guarantee efficiency.


3.5     Bounding the welfare effects of the infrastructure investment
The main contribution of this paper is to show how one can estimate welfare effects of a place-
based development program in a manner that accounts for migration responses but does not
require data on land prices. With our stylized model in hand, we are ready to compute the
welfare impact of rural household electrification using consumers’ compensating variation:
the reduction in income, after the program, that would leave the consumer just indifferent
between not having the program or having the program but paying for it with a reduction
in income.18 (Recall that firms earn zero profits in our model, so the program affects welfare
only by affecting consumers’ welfare. Also, we ignore urban welfare for now and return to a
discussion of this in Section 3.8.) Specifically, for each person in the rural area in period 2
— both stayers and movers — we ask: For what number k would a 100k% reduction in the
rural wage, after the program, return this person to his or her period 1 utility level? The
  17
      Unpriced amenities in our model also stand in for any unpriced local nontradeables. If local nontradeables
(such as hairdressing services) are instead priced, congestion in the wake of in-migration will also be reflected
in real income. People will account for these price changes by considering real (rather than nominal) income
gains from moving. Taking account of this congestion in the quantitative exercise would therefore require
measuring real income. Unfortunately, in our empirical exercise, we do not have local price indices and so are
limited to measuring changes in nominal income after an electricity project. This limitation implies that we
potentially overestimate (real) income gains from electrification as well as welfare gains from the program.
   18
      The use of compensating variation is not uncommon in the local public finance literature, for example
Calabrese, Epple, and Romano (2012). To calculate the equivalent variation, we would need an explicit
model of consumers’ maximization problem in the urban area. The compensating variation allows us to
sidestep this issue, but it does have costs. Primarily, it is impossible to compare benefits of different types of
programs using compensating variation, since the new prices used to value the welfare change are different
for each kind of intervention.

answer depends both on the crowding induced by the project and on the structure of the
market for land.

Rearranging terms,
                                                                    w2 T2 1 − α N2

                                                                    w 1 T1   α    N1
    Equation (13) provides a useful decomposition of the program’s welfare impact. The
first term on the right-hand side is the program’s income effect; the second is the congestion
effect caused by migration. The argument of our paper is that this congestion effect can
be just as important as the income effect when the migration response to the program,
ln(N2 /N1 ), is not small and when the preference for the local, rival publicly provided good
does not substantially outweigh the preference for the consumption good ((1 − α)/α is not
too small).19
    Since any mover has ¯2 ≤ i < ¯1 ,

                             0 ≤ − ln (1 − kimover ) < − ln (1 − k stayer ).                                  (14)

Also, because all agents in our model have the same income, we can aggregate the compen-
sating variation across individuals:
                                          X                               X
                            CV =                k stayer w2 T2 +                  kimover w2 T2 .             (15)
                                      stayers                            movers


The bounds in (14) then imply the following bounds on welfare:

                                 N1 k stayer w2 T2 ≤ CV < N2 k stayer w2 T2 .                                 (16)

       At the lower bound, the compensating variation to the marginal mover is zero; at the
  19
    Different assumptions about the functional form of congestion in a particular publicly provided good or
the presence of agglomeration effects could affect the specific form of equation (13). However, as long as
in-migrants create some congestion (or contribute agglomeration externalities), the migration response to
the initial spatial program will appear as part of the compensating variation.


                                                                  18
upper bound, the marginal mover gains just less than the utility gain that rural stayers
enjoy. Empirically calculating these bounds does not require any information about who is
a mover or stayer. Rather, all we need are estimates of kstayer , which is itself a function of
the program’s effect on income (w2 T2 /w1 T1 ) and population (N2 /N1 ) and of α, the relative
preference for consumption goods. In Section 4, we show that equation (13) is straightforward
to estimate from data on the infrastructure program’s impact on income and population,
and we describe ways to choose sensible values of α.
    Although our model does not explicitly include moving costs, adding heterogeneous mov-
ing costs would not change the calculation of the welfare bounds — only their interpretation.
At one extreme, movers gaining zero utility from moving can be thought of as paying a mov-
ing cost equal to their entire utility gain from rural consumption and rural land; at the other
extreme, movers with no moving cost enjoy the same gain in utility as the stayers do.

For rural stayers, we must find the k that solves

Rearranging terms,
                                                                                     !

            − ln (1 − k̂ stayer ) = ln         −       ln      + ln α + (1 − α)       .                              (18)

   We can now relate the compensating variation with a land market to the compensating
variation without a land market:
                                                                                          !
                                                    (1 − α)    N̂ 2  1               N̂ 2
     − ln (1 − k̂ stayer ) = − ln (1 − k stayer ) −         ln      + ln α + (1 − α)       . (19)
                                                       α       N2 α                  N1

Thus, a rural stayer’s compensating variation with a land market is the compensating vari-
ation without the land market, plus the difference in utility between the two states of the
world driven by the difference in the migration response to the program, plus a term that
accounts for the rents the stayers collect from the movers.
    Recall from Proposition 1 that N̂2 < N2 . Equation (19) thus implies the following:

Proposition 2 Rural incumbents’ welfare gain from the program is higher when there is a

                                                        19
land market.

Proof: Since N̂2 < N2 and α ∈ (0, 1), the second term in (19) is strictly positive. Since
N̂2 ≥ N1 , the third term is weakly positive. Therefore, − ln (1 − k̂ stayer ) > − ln (1 − k stayer ),
which implies k stayer < k̂ stayer .                                                               
    Proposition 2 is our second main theoretical result. When there is a market for the local,
rival publicly provided good, the gain for rural incumbents is larger than when there is no
market for this good.
    If there are any movers, they have ˆ¯2 ≤ i < ¯1 ; in addition, holding i fixed, a stayer
has higher welfare than a mover in period 2 since r2 > r1 . Therefore, stayers’ compensating
variation is strictly greater than movers’ compensating variation and, similar to the no-
markets case, we have

                              0 ≤ − ln (1 − k̂imover ) < − ln (1 − k̂ stayer ).                           (20)

The aggregate value of the compensating variation for consumers thus satisfies

                                                      ˆ < N̂2 k̂ stayer w2 T2 .
                                N1 k̂ stayer w2 T2 ≤ CV                                                   (21)

   Equation (20) is important because it indicates that even if all markets exist, we do
not need price data to compute welfare bounds. This is a useful result in settings where
population and income can be measured but high-quality land price data are difficult to
come by.20

3.5.3    Comparing welfare bounds with and without a land market

We have shown that incumbents enjoy higher welfare gains when there is a market for land.
What about aggregate welfare gains across these rural areas? The lower bound in the no-
markets case (16) is strictly lower than the lower bound in the markets case (21) because
k stayer < k̂ stayer . However, the upper bounds cannot be similarly ordered: The upper bound
  20
    We can, of course, use land price information if there are land markets and if these prices are observed.
In Appendix A1, we show that in equilibrium, r̂2 = [(1 − α)/α]N̂2 w2 T2 /A. Substituting this result into (18),
and assuming that we also observe a period 1 land price r̂1 such that the period 1 population is a market
equilibrium, the compensating variation for a rural stayer can be expressed as
                                                                                               

           − ln (1 − k̂ stayer ) = ln     −       ln      + ln α + (1 − α) − (1 − α)              .
                                  α w1 T1     α       r̂1  α                 r̂1          w1 T1




                                                      20
on welfare could be larger in the no-markets case if there is a very large population response to
the infrastructure program and if congestion due to the lack of a land market does not reduce
stayers’ welfare too much. Alternatively, the upper bound on welfare could be smaller in the
no-markets case if there is a small population response and yet congestion greatly reduces
stayers’ welfare. Which of these outcomes applies will depend on the parameters s (that
affects the migration response to the program) and α.


3.6     Extension: Infrastructure as an amenity
So far, we have assumed that the rural electrification program affects communities by raising
incomes. This makes sense in the empirical setting of rural household electrification in South
Africa. We can easily modify the model to allow electrification to also be an amenity, with
no impact on our central propositions.
    Assume that at the same time electrification raises incomes, it also raises A1 to A2 ,
increasing the supply of local public goods. Intuitively, we should see more in-migration
toward electrifying areas, as these places are now better places to live in for two reasons:
higher incomes and more amenities. We can see this by looking at the labor supply equations
(7) and (11): with a higher value of A2 on the right-hand side of each equation, the cutoff
value for the preference shock  is lower, which in turn means that more people are willing
to live in the rural area after the program relative to before. It is still the case that in
equilibrium, there is more migration in the no land markets case than in the land markets
case (i.e., Proposition 1 still holds).
    The compensating variation for rural stayers also adjusts if electrification has an amenity
value. Since A2 > A1 , the amenity stock no longer cancels out of expressions for compen-
sating variation. Equation (13) becomes
                                                                                    
                                  stayer          w 2 T2         1−α        N2      A2
                    − ln (1 − k            ) = ln        −               ln    − ln      .                (22)
                                                  w 1 T1          α         N1      A1
   Similarly, equation (18) becomes
                                                                       !                          !
                             w 2 T2         1−α          N̂2      A2          1               N̂2
  − ln (1 − k̂ stayer ) = ln        −                 ln     − ln            + ln α + (1 − α)           . (23)
                             w 1 T1          α           N1       A1          α               N1

    This change effectively reduces the negative impact of migration on welfare: The conges-
tion effect is moderated by the fact that the new infrastructure has also increased the supply
of amenities. Because the difference in the compensating variation for rural stayers in the

                                                        21
land markets and no land markets cases is not affected by this constant positive shock to A,
Proposition 2 also continues to hold: Rural incumbents’ welfare gain from the program is
still higher when there is a land market.
     While the central insights from our model do not change, we would need additional
data on the response of A to the program to empirically estimate welfare gains from an
infrastructure program when infrastructure is also an amenity.


3.7    Extension: Decreasing returns to scale in production
In some settings, it may be appropriate to allow production to have decreasing, rather than
constant, returns to scale. This adaptation also does not change the qualitative results in
our model. To see this, assume that firms in the rural area are perfectly immobile, operate
a decreasing returns to scale aggregate production function F and sell output on a world
market. Labor markets are competitive, and so the wage in the rural areas is

                                       wt = F 0 (Tt Nt ).                                 (24)

where Nt is the population in the rural area in period t. Capital, land, and other amenities
do not enter in the production function, except implicitly as the source of decreasing returns.
We assume that F 0 > 0, F 00 < 0, and for all x, F 0 (x) + xF 00 (x) > 0. This final assumption
implies that the wage bill rises as labor inputs rise, so that profits are not unbounded as
firms expand.
    We can substitute the wage expression into the consumers’ budget constraint, into their
indirect utility functions in equilibrium, and into the two labor supply equations that de-
termine equilibrium population in the post-program period, (7) and (11). The formulae
for the compensating variation for consumers and the welfare bounds for this compensating
variation remain the same in both the land market and no land market settings.
    This adaptation does not affect the conclusions of Propositions 1 and 2 from our simple
model. It is still the case that there is more migration in equilibrium without land markets
relative to the case with land markets, and rural incumbents still benefit more from the
program when there is a land market. However, relative to the case of constant returns to
scale, decreasing returns to scale imply less overall migration in both the land markets and no
land markets cases. This is because the assumption introduces another margin of adjustment
to the program: Wages. If workers become more productive with the infrastructure, they
inelastically supply more effective units of labor (T ∗ N ) to the market, and so earnings


                                              22
increase. However, because F 00 < 0, equilibrium wages fall with this additional labor input.
So although this new infrastructure has raised the utility gain of living in the rural area
relative to the urban area, this increase is smaller than it would have been under constant
returns to scale. Allowing wages to fall as effective labor inputs rise therefore reduces the
incentive to move toward the rural area.
    The assumption of decreasing returns to scale has two implications for quantitative esti-
mation of the welfare bounds of the program. First, the migration response to the program
would be smaller than under the assumption of constant returns to scale, but none of our
formulae for compensating variation of movers and stayers would change. Second, because
there would now be positive profits, we would need to keep track of these profits to compute
aggregate welfare from the program. If we assumed that firm owners do not live in the rural
areas, then we would need to add aggregate post-program profits to both the upper and
lower bounds of equations (16) and (21). If instead we assumed that firm owners are rural
incumbents, then firm profits would appear in the budget constraint of these incumbents in
(4) and (8). In both the land market and no land markets cases, we would then need to have
a credible, causal estimate of the impact of electrification on total income (earnings plus
profits) among incumbents to compute accurate measures of the compensating variation.


3.8     Extension: Adding urban welfare to the model
Up to this point, we have assumed that utility in the urban area is fixed at Ū no matter how
many people live there. We now consider how our results would change if the urban area
were subject to either congestion effects of the same type as we model for the rural area or
agglomeration benefits that raise welfare when population is higher.

3.8.1   Urban congestion effects

First, consider congestion effects in the urban area. We assume that urban residents, like
rural residents, get utility from consumption c and a public good a. Since i reflects the
relative preference for living in the rural area, the utility of living in the urban area is
given by Uu (c, a) = cα a1−α for all consumers. We assume that congestion changes only the
allocation of the public good in the urban area, not the urban wage or time endowment.
We also assume that neither the urban nor the rural area has a land market; otherwise, we
would need to keep track of people who own land and collect rent in one area while living




                                             23
in the other.21
    In Appendix B, we show that allowing for congestion in urban areas does not change the
basic form of the rural labor supply function. However, urban congestion does reduce the
migration response to the rural infrastructure program, because when there is an urban con-
gestion externality, any program-induced migration from the city to the countryside makes
cities more attractive.
    As before, in calculating welfare effects, we can distinguish between rural stayers and rural
movers, and the welfare impacts of rural infrastructure for these two groups continue to be as
given in equations (13) to (16). But we now must also calculate the welfare impact on urban
stayers, who have a welfare gain from the rural infrastructure program because the resulting
out-migration from urban areas means that urban stayers experience less congestion. Urban
stayers’ compensating variation as a percentage of consumption satisfies

                                                                   1 − α Nu,2

                                                                                                                          (26)

Thus, urban congestion effects would raise both the upper and lower bounds of the total com-
pensating variation of the program by the product of post-program urban income Nu,2 wu Tu

and a congestion adjustment 1 − Nu,1          . If we had data on the population in urban areas
(which we do not in the South African case), we could estimate this quantity by the same
methods as we use to estimate the compensating variation assuming that urban utility is
constant.
  21
    The assumption of no urban land market is extreme — but if we included such a market, then the increase
in welfare associated with reduced congestion would be smaller than if there were no urban land market.
Therefore, the welfare effect of a rural infrastructure program that is calculated while entirely ignoring the
urban area provides a lower bound on the true effect of the program, whereas the welfare effect calculated
by including an urban area and assuming no operating urban land market, as we do in this section, provides
an upper bound on the true effect of the program.

3.8.2    Urban agglomeration effects

Urban agglomeration effects have the opposite consequence from congestion effects: As peo-
ple leave the urban area, it becomes less attractive. The literature has identified a variety
of reasons why this might happen, including lower wages (if high population raises labor
productivity) or the reduced availability of cultural amenities. We do not attempt to model
these effects in detail but note only that they would reduce the total compensating variation
of the program below what we show above. Therefore, if there are urban agglomeration
effects, all of our estimates give an upper bound for the compensating variation of a rural
infrastructure program.


3.9     A note on generality
Our stylized model is adapted to deal with the specifics of the empirical setting of house-
hold electrification in rural South Africa. In a different empirical setting, different features
could require alternative functional forms or different assumptions about the way in which
the spatial investment affects the local economy. For example, a new road might directly
affect production, which was not the case for household electrification. Nevertheless, the
base components of our approach remain general: Migration responds to new infrastructure,
and this response results in crowding of amenities that are in inelastic supply. Because mi-
gration (or population change) is much more easily measured than land rents, well-estimated
migration and income elasticities can be used to create welfare bounds for more complete
evaluation of spatial investments. We next turn to implementing our welfare bounds for
rural electrification in South Africa.


4       Empirically implementing the welfare bounds
Because the South African context we study does not have markets for land, we estimate
the rural electrification program’s effect on rural consumer welfare using the bounds given in
(16) for the case of no land markets. The formula for the bounds shows that we can estimate
this welfare impact if we know the parameter α and have estimates of the program’s effect
on income (w2 T2 /w1 T1 ) and population (N2 /N1 ). The basic idea is that as long as we have
causal estimates of the impact of an infrastructure program on incomes and population, we
do not need any data on local land prices, regardless of whether there is a market for land.



                                              25
4.1     Estimating income and population impacts of rural electrifi-
        cation
We estimate the income and population effects of the rural electrification program from the
following system of equations, which is the same specification as in Dinkelman (2011) and
we used in (1a) to estimate effects on other variables:

                       ∆ ln (wjdt Tjdt ) = β1 + β2 ∆Ijdt + β3 Xjd0 + βd + ∆uwT
                                                                            jdt ,                       (27a)
                           ∆ ln (Njdt ) = γ1 + γ2 ∆Ijdt + γ3 Xjd0 + γd + ∆uN
                                                                           jdt .                        (27b)

The parameters β1 and γ1 reflect common trends in income and population across all com-
munities, whether or not they receive the infrastructure program, while the parameters β2
and γ2 are the effects of the infrastructure program on income and population, Xjd0 repre-
sents baseline characteristics, βd and γd represent district-specific trends, and the residuals
uwT        N
 jt and ujt represent all other factors affecting income and population.
                                                                               22
                                                                                  Thus, in the
no-markets case, the compensating variation for a stayer from equation (13) is

                                                                 1−α
                                   − ln (1 − k stayer ) = β2 −       γ2 .                                 (28)
                                                                  α

We obtain consistent estimates of β2 and γ2 from system IV-GMM regressions of equations
(27) that use land gradient as an instrument for infrastructure placement and account for
possible correlation of residuals across equations.23
   Since we want to aggregate the compensating variation across individuals in equation
(15) to estimate the total monetary value of the program, we need to know w2 T2 , the post-
program income in communities that receive the program. We can estimate w2 T2 from a
regression of Ijd2 × (wjd2 Tjd2 ) on Ijd2 ; this regression is estimated jointly with the system
(27) so that standard errors account for the possible covariance between estimates of β2 , γ2 ,
  22
     Empirically, equation (27b) estimates the relative increase in population in an electrified rural district
compared with a non-electrified rural district. In our setting, only a small fraction of internal migration is
rural-to-rural migration (Cornwell and Inder, 2004; Reed, 2013; Van der Berg et al., 2002), and so we are
not too worried about spatial spillovers between rural areas in our sample.
  23
     Allowing infrastructure to also be an amenity would require estimating a third equation in the system
to capture the causal effect of electrification on an index of local amenities. This estimate would then be
included into the estimate of (28), following (22). If we allowed decreasing returns to scale in production, we
would need to add a profit equation to the system and estimate the impact of electrification on profits. This
estimate would then be added to the upper and lower bounds of our estimate of the compensating variation
for consumers if firm owners were not rural incumbents. If firm owners were rural incumbents, we would
include this profit response as part of the first term in (28) before creating the aggregate welfare bounds.



                                                      26
and w2 T2 .
   We also need to know N1 and N2 . In the model, N1 is the rural area’s pre-program
population and N2 is the rural area’s post-program population (in the no-markets case). We
can observe N2 directly: It is the total population in areas that received the infrastructure
program, after the program is implemented, or
                                                        X
                                        N2 =                           Nj2 .                         (29)
                                                j : received program


Since we have population data from a census, N2 is not a random variable and need not
be estimated jointly with the other parameters.24 Because other factors besides the infra-
structure program may also be changing the rural population, we cannot calculate N1 from
the observed pre-program populations, Nj1 . Rather, N1 should be the counterfactual popu-
lation that the rural area would have had at t = 2 if it did not get the program. That is, for
a community j that received the program, we should set

                                          N1 (j) = Nj2 / exp (γ2 ).                                  (30)

The total population in treated areas, if the program had not taken place, is thus
                                    X                          X     Nj2         N2
                      N1 =                          N1 (j) =                 =           .           (31)
                             j : received program              j
                                                                   exp (γ2 )   exp (γ2 )

    Putting together all of our results, the empirical bounds on the compensating variation
in the no-markets case can be estimated using
                                                                         
   N2                      1−α                                          1−α
             1 − exp −β2 +       γ2 w2 T2 ≤ CV < N2 1 − exp −β2 +           γ 2 w 2 T2 .
 exp (γ2 )                   α                                           α
                                                                                  (32)
Conditional on α and N2 , standard errors for these bounds are obtained from the joint
variance-covariance matrix of the estimators of β2 , γ2 , and w2 T2 .25
  24
     If the population data came from a survey or from a randomly sampled subset of treated communities,
then N2 would need to be estimated jointly with the rest of the system using a regression analogous to the
mean post-program income regression.
  25
     Point estimates and standard errors for model parameters come from jointly estimating equations (27)
and a regression of Ijd2 × (wjd2 Tjd2 ) on Ijd2 . We combine these point estimates with N2 and a chosen α
to construct the compensating variation for stayers, k, in equation (28) and the upper and lower bounds on
welfare in equation (16). Since k and the welfare bounds are nonlinear combinations of model parameters,
we use the delta method to construct standard errors. We have also constructed Anderson-Rubin confidence
intervals for β2 and γ2 that are robust to weak instruments. Our IV point estimates fall within these


                                                        27
    A similar formula expressing the welfare bounds as a function of α, β2 , γ2 , w2 T2 , and N2
— derived from (18) — would apply for the markets case. That case does not apply here
because the context we study does not have land markets. However, even in contexts where
land markets exist, calculations based on population and income may be more attractive than
calculations based on land prices because collecting good data on population and income may
be more feasible than collecting good data on land prices.26


4.2     Two ways to estimate α
The last piece we need before computing the welfare bounds is an estimate of α.
    As α → 1, consumer preferences shift toward the consumption good and away from the
local, rival publicly provided good (land). A weak preference for the public good minimizes
the negative congestion impact of migration and moves the welfare bounds for the markets
and no-markets cases toward each other. In the limit, if consumers did not care for land (or
schooling or health services) at all, the welfare bounds would be identical — and equal to
the program’s income effect — regardless of whether there were a market for these goods.
    Alternatively, as α → 0, consumer preferences shift toward land (or other publicly pro-
vided goods) and away from the consumption good, and the migration response to the pro-
gram gains a larger weight in the welfare bounds. In both the market and no markets cases,
the welfare bounds get wider, admitting a larger range of possible effects of the program.
    Clearly, then, the choice of α parameter strongly affects the welfare calculation. We
calibrate a sensible value for this parameter using two different strategies that turn out to
suggest similar values.
    Our first strategy is to assume that self-reported life satisfaction in a survey is monoton-
ically related to a household’s utility from consumption and public goods. Specifically, we
assume that
                                 Ui = [U (ci , ai )]θ1 exp (θ0 + vi ),                      (33)

where Ui is household i’s self-reported life satisfaction, U (ci , ai ) = cα a1−α , and exp (vi ) is a
multiplicative measurement error. Then

                          ln (Ui ) = θ0 + θ1 α ln (ci ) + θ1 (1 − α) ln (ai ) + vi .                   (34)
confidence intervals.
  26
     A caveat is that these estimates also need to be reasonably precise for the welfare bounds to be infor-
mative.




                                                     28
We estimate (34) on a data set of rural African households interviewed in 1993, prior to
the implementation of the electrification program.27 We use measures of monthly income to
proxy for consumption and measures of district population density to construct a measure
of ai (which is the inverse of population density). Our outcome measure is the (log of
the) household’s response to the following question: “Taking everything into account, how
satisfied is the household with the way it lives these days?” and where answers were given
on a scale of one to five. We restrict the value of α to lie between 0 and 1 by specifying that
α = exp(q)/(1 + exp(q)) for some parameter q and estimating θ0 , θ1 , and q by nonlinear least
squares.
    Summary statistics for the life satisfaction data are in Appendix D, and results from
estimating (34) are in Table 3. We find a point estimate for α of 0.991. This value does not
depend on any particular model for migration, nor on any assumptions about the market for
land, nor on estimates of the income and population effects of the infrastructure investments.
(Nonetheless, our estimation of α is not entirely consistent with our migration model because
we have ignored the additive preference for the rural area i .) This large a value of α implies
that congestible publicly provided goods have only a very small impact on utility. Still, when
we use this value for α in our welfare calculations, we will find that migration responses
remain large enough to appreciably change the evaluation of the place-based program in
South Africa.
    Our second strategy for calibrating α uses our migration model to derive a lower bound
for the parameter. Equation (32) shows that, for any given income and population elas-
ticities, the welfare impact of a program is negative when α is sufficiently small. However,
in equilibrium in our model, any program that raises incomes cannot reduce total welfare.
Thus, the lower bound for α is the value that makes the program’s estimated welfare impact
zero. In the no-markets case, the welfare effect of the program is zero when k stayer is zero,
or when
                                         ln (N2 /N1 )                  γ2
                        α=                                        =         .              (35)
                            ln [(w2 T2 )/(w1 T1 )] + ln (N2 /N1 )   β2 + γ2
The expression for the markets case would be derived in the same way, under the condition
that k̂ stayer is zero (that is, using (18) and solving for the value of α that sets the right-hand
side of this equation to zero).
    Given estimates of β2 and γ2 , we estimate the highest lower bound for α is 0.979. Our
  27
    The data are commonly known as the SALDRU data and are obtained from the first Living Standards
Measurement Study-type household survey conducted in South Africa in 1993. This is the only year in the
1990s for which there exists a question on life satisfaction.



                                                  29
satisfaction-based point estimate of 0.991 is thus consistent with the model-implied lower
bound. However, the lower bound rules out much of the confidence interval for α implied by
the standard error of the satisfaction-based estimate. Therefore, in constructing standard
errors for our welfare bounds, we treat the point estimate as the exact value of α and do not
account for estimation error in α.28


4.3      Welfare bounds on rural electrification in South Africa
Table 4 presents the main results for key parameters and our estimated bounds on the welfare
impact of the electrification program.
    First, in Panel A, we present consistent estimates of the overall employment and pop-
ulation impacts of rural electrification. We combine employment data for men and women
and find that electrification raises the overall employment rate by 8.3 percentage points, al-
though this change is not significantly different from zero (t-statistic of 1.63).29 As described
in Dinkelman (2011), electrification likely increases employment in rural KZN through some
combination of releasing time from home production into market work and enabling people
to make new jobs for themselves in self-employment or small enterprise. There is also sub-
stantial population growth in electrifying areas using the IV results. This was the population
increase underlying the crowding of households and schools in Table 2.
    To compute welfare effects, we value employment gains and migration crowd-out in terms
of local monthly earnings. Since the Census does not contain measures of hours of work,
wages, or income, we use community-level data from the 2001 October Household Survey
to construct average post-program monthly earnings for African workers in 44 areas and
assign these averages to each of the 1,816 census communities. Average monthly earnings
in 2001 were just over ZAR1,200, or 285USD in 2001 dollars according to the purchasing
power parity reported in the Penn World Table (Heston, Summers, and Aten, 2011). Using
a different data set and an alternative identification strategy, Dinkelman (2011) shows that
wages do not rise significantly in response to the new infrastructure. If all response is on the
extensive margin, then employment growth (valued by average earnings) gives us the total
  28
      Taking the standard error of the estimate of α into account in computing the welfare bounds would
create “bounds on bounds” that would be less informative than using the point estimate for α. We note
that while our approach gets around the thorny issue of having no data on land prices, the usefulness of
our approach relies on having precisely estimated causal effects of the impact of a program on income and
migration as well as precise estimates of α.
   29
      Separately estimating male and female employment effects, Dinkelman (2011) finds that female employ-
ment rises by 9 percentage points in electrified relative to non-electrified areas, and this result is statistically
significant at the 10% level. There are no significant impacts on male employment in the Census data.


                                                        30
income gain associated with the program.
    Panel B of Table 4 calculates bounds on the compensating variation associated with
the program. We use the no markets version of the compensating variation in (13) to
estimate values for k — the fraction of post-program income that a rural stayer would need
to give up in order to keep utility the same before and after the program. We present
these estimates ignoring the migration response in column 1 and then taking account of the
migration response in column 2. Column 2 bounds are computed under the assumption that
α = 0.991; in other words, only 0.9% of utility comes from local publicly provided goods
such as land or schooling, and 99.1% from consumption.
    Under the assumptions of our model, rural stayers would be willing to give up 8% of
their income to keep the program. We monetize this compensating variation by multiplying
k by the average monthly earnings in treated areas post-electrification, weighted by the
increased employment in these areas.30 The monthly value of the compensating variation for
an average rural stayer is about ZAR17 ignoring the migration effect. That is, individuals
would be willing to give up ZAR17 per month to retain the program.
    In contrast, when we include the migration impact, just over 40% of this welfare gain
disappears. The compensating variation of the program is only 0.9% of income, assuming
α = 0.991. The value of this is only ZAR9.9 per month.
    Finally, we compute the lower and upper bounds on the total monetary value of the
compensating variation using information about N2 and N1 — the post-program population
and the counterfactual population without the program. As shown in the final two rows of
Table 4, we find that the program was worth between ZAR127,623 and ZAR6.3 million per
month in all treated areas if migration is ignored. When we add in the migration effects,
the bounds shrink to between about ZAR74,000 and ZAR3.6 million per month. Given the
standard errors on these bounds, we can reject zero impact of the program when migration
is not included. However, once we include the effects of congestion in local, rival publicly
provided goods induced by the higher population, it is no longer possible to reject that the
program had zero impact on overall welfare. This is notable: Even when people do not value
local public goods very highly (since α = 0.991), the value of the electrification program is
substantially diminished in the presence of migration.
    If urban areas experience congestion externalities, then migration toward rural areas
  30
    Specifically, we multiply our estimate of k by 213.47 taking into account the error variance of this estimate
(standard error 25.48). This number is the coefficient on the treatment indicator in the third equation of our
IV system: an IV regression of the interaction of treatment, post-program employment levels, and monthly
earnings (from an external data set) on a treatment indicator and district fixed effects.

generates additional benefits from the rural electrification program that we do not capture.
These gains could shift aggregate welfare bounds away from zero. Looking at our lower
bound welfare estimate, we see that the magnitude of these congestion effects would have to
be at least ZAR 7,198,082 (the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval on the welfare
lower bound in the final column of Table 4) to shift the lower bound on welfare above
zero. This gain could only be generated by reductions in population in urban areas. Since
the number of people living in urban areas in South Africa over this period increased by
15% (Statistics South Africa, 1996, 2001), we do not think such magnitudes are plausible.31
Leaving urban congestion effects out of the analysis is therefore unlikely to substantially
change our estimates of the welfare bounds. Of course, if there are positive agglomeration
externalities in urban areas, then the effect of migration from urban to rural areas would
shift the welfare bounds down even further.


5      Conclusions
Our paper is motivated by the idea that any place-based program may induce migration
responses, that such migration responses could lead to important congestion in inelastically
supplied local publicly provided goods, and that this migration and congestion should be
accounted for in evaluations of spatial investments. We use the South African example
of rural household electrification to illustrate these ideas. Furthermore, we show how the
welfare effects of spatial programs can be estimated even in settings where land markets do
not exist or land price data are scarce.
    The paper adapts a spatial model of location choice to the rural South African context.
This is a setting in which substantial migration and related congestion in local homes and
schools occurred in response to new infrastructure. We use the model to show three things.
First, ignoring migration responses to a spatial program may lead researchers to miscalcu-
late the program’s welfare benefits to incumbents. Second, when there are no markets for
important local, congestible publicly provided goods (such as land, schools, or health care),
the migration response to a spatial program is larger, leading to greater congestion in in-
elastically supplied publicly provided goods. This story of the tragedy of the commons has
important implications for evaluating location-based programs.
    Third, accounting for migration responses is possible by combining the structure of a

    To see this, we can construct a back-of-the-envelope estimate of (25) for the compensating variation for
urban stayers. This magnitude will be negative unless Nu,2 ≤ Nu,1 .

model suited to the specific institutional environment with consistent estimates of the income
and population effects of the spatial program. We show how to estimate upper and lower
bounds for the compensating variation of the rural electrification investment using income
and population elasticities and an estimate of preferences for consumption relative to a local
publicly provided good. In this South African case, taking migration into account reduced
the compensating variation from the rural electrification program by just over 40%.
    Although migration is a key component of any spatial equilibrium model, the migra-
tion response to spatial investments appears to have fallen off the agenda of development
economists. Future urbanization and development of rural areas in poor countries is likely
to bring migration and related congestion issues to the fore once more.32 Our approach
complements traditional approaches to valuing the impact of place-based programs that rely
on measures of land rents, which are often unavailable in developing countries.
    Our work carries several caveats. We do not allow for dynamic effects of programs, for
general equilibrium effects on the national price level from local programs, or for agglom-
eration externalities from changes in population density in either the area that receives a
program or areas that send migrants. In addition, our welfare analysis ignores the issue
of how and where to raise tax revenue to pay for a local program (although in many poor
countries, international donors may be the most common source of funds for such projects).
Broadening the analysis along these dimensions would further sharpen our understanding of
how migration changes the costs and benefits of place-based programs in developing coun-
tries.

    More than three-quarters of the urban population in Africa live in slums; future urbanization trends in
these areas will continue to put pressure on existing urban areas (Cohen, 2006).

A       Derivation of indirect utilities when there is a land
        market
There are N1 stayers and N̂2 − N1 movers, so market clearing for the local public good (land)
requires
                            N1 â2,stayer + (N̂2 − N1 )â2,mover = A.                    (36)

Maximization by rural stayers implies
                                                                                                      
                                               A                                  1−α                 A
                 ĉ2,stayer    = α w2 T2 + r̂2                ,   â2 ,stayer   =         w2 T2 + r̂2      ,   (37)
                                               N1                                  r̂2                N1

while maximization by movers to the rural area implies

                                                                                  1−α
                                          ĉ2,mover = αw2 T2 ,    â2 ,mover =         w 2 T2 .                (38)
                                                                                   r̂2

Rural stayers now collect rent from land, while movers must pay rent for (or buy) land.
Hence, incumbents enjoy a wealth effect associated with the new infrastructure, if there are
any in-migrants and if land (or housing) is inelastic in supply.
   Market clearing for land requires

                            N1                 w2 T2 + r̂2      + (N̂2 − N1 )      w 2 T2 = A                  (39)

B     Derivation of rural labor supply function when ur-
      ban utility is added to the model
This section assumes the basic structure of the spatial equilibrium model and adds urban
welfare. The utility of urban residents is given by Uu (c, a) = cα a1−α , since i reflects the
relative preference for living in the rural area. Urban congestion changes only the allocation
of the public good in the urban area, and we assume no urban land market.
    An equilibrium in each period is a consumption choice for each consumer and an assign-
ment of consumers to locations such that each consumer’s consumption and location choices
maximize utility, taking the rationing of the public good in both urban and rural areas as
given. Let Nu,1 and Nu,2 be the urban population before and after the rural infrastructure
program is implemented. Also let wu , Au , and Tu be the urban wage and the urban endow-
ments of public goods and amenities. Then the indirect utility of living in the urban area in
period t ∈ {1, 2} is
                                                           1−α
                                     ∗             α   Au
                                   Uu,t = (wu Tu )               .                         (43)
                                                       Nu,t
Thus, i chooses to live in the rural area in period t if and only if
                                                         1−α                          1−α
                                           α       Au                       α       A
                              i ≥ (wu Tu )                        − (wt Tt )                   .             (44)

The rural labor supply function in period t now becomes
                                                           1−α                                1−α

                                                                                                        ,     (45)
                         P                             Nt                               P − Nt

where we have used the fact that Nt + Nu,t = P .
  The left-hand side of (45) is increasing in rural population Nt , while the right-hand side

is decreasing in Nt and increasing in wt Tt . Hence, just as when urban utility was fixed, more
people live in the rural area after the infrastructure is built. However, the right-hand side of
(45) decreases more rapidly with rural population than the right-hand side of (7), because
migration from the city to the countryside now makes the city more attractive in addition
to making the rural area less attractive. Therefore, the population response to the rural
infrastructure program is smaller if there are congestion effects in the urban area.

All non-school-related data are from Dinkelman (2011). See appendix of that paper for original data sources. Unit of observation is the
community. ~Data on schools are from the 1995 and 2000 South African School Register of Needs Survey. Data on schools were linked to
communities by spatially matching the GPS coordinates of schools in each year with Census community boundaries. *Average monthly
earnings are computed from individual-level data (October Household Survey 2001) for African workers using sample weights to compute
community-level means.

Each column shows output from a separate regression, unit of observation is the community. Every regression includes the full set of
community-level controls as in Dinkelman (2011), Tables 4 and 5, columns (4) and (9). Robust standard errors are clustered at the
main place level. Not all communities have a school in the baseline year, and some data on educators are missing for some schools.

Panel A presents program impact estimates from GMM-IV estimation of the system in equation (27) and from a regression of
Ijd2*(wjd2*Tjd2) on Ijd2, where Ijd2 is a post-program indicator variable. This procedure uses land gradient to instrument for program
placement and accounts for potential correlated residuals across regressions. Panel B combines model parameter estimates from Panel A
to present results relevant to the welfare calculations. First, we ignore migration effects or, equivalently, assume = 1 so that all utility
comes from consumption goods (column 1). Second, we take into account migration responses to the program under the assumption that 
= 0.991 (column 2). Standard errors in Panel B are computed using the delta method.
