                                         ABSTRACT

Liquidity shocks transmitted through interbank connections contributed to bank distress during
the Great Depression. New data on interbank connections reveal that banks were much more
likely to close when their correspondents closed. Further, after the Federal Reserve was
established, banks’ management of cash and capital buffers was less responsive to network
liquidity risk, suggesting that banks expected the Fed to reduce that risk. Because the Fed’s
presence removed the incentives for the most systemically important banks to maintain capital
and cash buffers that had protected against liquidity risk, it likely contributed to the banking
system’s vulnerability to contagion during the Depression.

1. Introduction

         The financial crisis of 2008-09 heightened interest in how relationships within the

financial system can amplify exogenous shocks. Amplification can occur through multiple

channels. Distress in one firm can signal potential problems in other firms with correlated

positions and trigger withdrawals of short-term debt whether or not the firms are contractually

connected. For example, during the 2008-09 financial crisis, the inability of Reserve Primary

Fund, a money market mutual fund with a large exposure to Lehman Brothers, to maintain a

constant $1 per share price triggered runs on other mutual funds, including many that had little or

no counterparty exposure to Lehman or direct connections to Reserve Primary Fund.

         Counterparty contagion can also occur through direct contractual relationships between

firms. A default by one firm can impose distress on other firms that hold significant liabilities of

the defaulting firm. For example, some observers believe that because of its exposure to AIG,

Goldman Sachs might have failed if AIG had been permitted to fail in 2008.1 As the interbank

lending market collapsed in September 2008, banks scrambled to hoard reserves as a means of

self-insurance against prospective liquidity needs, which aggravated declines in risky asset prices

and bank lending (e.g., Iyer et al. 2014; Heider, Hoerova, and Holthausen 2015).

         This paper investigates the role of contagion on bank distress during the Great

Depression. Specifically, we examine the effects of i) direct contractual obligations between

banks and ii) geographic proximity to distressed banks on increasing the closure probability of

individual banks. Despite a large amount of research on the causes and consequences of bank

distress during the Depression, previous studies have not examined comprehensively whether or

how bilateral bank network connections contributed to bank failure risk during the Depression.


1
 However, Scott (2012) argues that contractual contagion was not as important as the effect of correlated positions
during the recent financial crisis.

                                                         1
We do so by mapping the interbank network in detail and examining how network connections

affected the risk of bank failure and other closure events.

         Using interbank network and balance sheet data for the decades prior to the Depression,

we also investigate how the founding of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) affected network risk.

Existing literature criticizes the Fed for failing to offset major liquidity shocks during the

Depression. We consider a new channel: Did the Fed’s establishment lead banks to become

complacent about liquidity risk and, therefore, more vulnerable to liquidity shocks?

         In the early 20th century, contractual exposures between banks occurred mainly through

correspondent relationships, which from a research perspective have the advantage of being

readily observable and without the complexity of many types of modern contractual exposures.2

Furthermore, because banks and their correspondents were typically located in different cities for

regulatory reasons, we can isolate the effects of the contractual relationship from local shocks

hitting the markets of the bank and its correspondents.3 For these reasons, it can be easier to

identify the role of contractual exposures on interbank liquidity risk in the historical banking

system than it is in the modern system.

         Most banks maintained deposits with other banks (i.e., their correspondents) for

payments and other services, as well as to invest surplus funds or obtain credit. Correspondent

relationships were both a source of liquidity risk and a means of mitigating liquidity risk.


2
  As discussed below, most banks deposited funds in other banks, i.e., their correspondents, in exchange for various
services and as a source of liquidity. The banks that were the customers of a correspondent bank are commonly
referred to as the respondents of the correspondent bank. The correspondent system continues to exist today.
However, international banking relationships, and relationships between different types of financial intermediaries,
which are not always transparent, have become more important and complex. The relatively straightforward and
transparent nature of interbank relationships in the historical period facilitates study of network risk and contagion
during the Great Depression.
3
  Legal restrictions on branching (including a total prohibition in most states) encouraged banks to contract with
banks in other cities because most banks were restricted to a single office location. The structure of reserve
requirements on deposits before 1914 also encouraged the interbank system by permitting banks to use deposits
placed in national banks in designated reserve cities to satisfy a portion of their reserve requirements.

                                                           2
Ordinarily, funds deposited in correspondent banks were a liquid asset that banks could tap as

needed. Banks with established connections could also borrow in the interbank market when

their own depositors withdrew funds. For example, when faced with deposit withdrawals in

1931-32, Chicago banks borrowed from other banks to replace lost deposits, thus mitigating the

need to liquidate assets (Calomiris and Mason 2003). Banks that were better known and had a

larger network profile were better able to borrow funds when needed.

        However, the interbank market was also a source of liquidity risk, especially for banks

that relied heavily on interbank deposits as a funding source. Funds that a bank deposited in a

correspondent were an asset of the depositing bank but a liability of the correspondent. Those

deposits could be withdrawn suddenly, and often were withdrawn during panics, putting the

correspondent bank in an illiquid position. The interbank system had a “core-periphery”

structure, with large banks in New York City, Chicago and other major cities at the core of a

system comprised of local, regional and national nodes connecting banks across the country

(James and Weiman 2010). Most banks had at least one correspondent in New York or Chicago,

and often one or more correspondents in other cities.

        The interbank network dissipated seasonal needs and minor liquidity disturbances across

the system, but large shocks that overwhelmed the ability of correspondent banks to provide

liquidity resulted in nation-wide banking panics.4 Several major panics occurred in the 19th and

early 20th centuries, and the liquidity risk associated with interbank deposit withdrawals was an

important magnifier of distress during those panics (Calomiris and Carlson 2016, 2017;




4
  Acemoglu, et al. (2015) provide a theoretical framework for studying the network’s role as a shock propagation
and amplification mechanism, and show that a densely connected network enhances financial stability when shocks
are small, but beyond a certain point, dense interconnections amplify shocks and increase instability. Other papers
that discuss the “robust-yet-fragile” aspects of interconnectedness include Allen and Gale (2007) and Gai, Haldane
and Kapadia (2011).

                                                         3
Calomiris and Gorton 1991; Wicker 2006). Congress sought to eliminate panics by establishing

the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The System’s founders expected that the Fed would greatly

reduce the size and importance of the interbank network, which they saw as a conduit for

instability. However, interbank deposit exposures remained large in the aggregate, making up

almost $4 billion, or 6.5 percent of total banking system assets in 1929, and thus were potentially

a major source of risk to the banking system.

       Studies of local panics at the beginning of the Great Depression find that correspondent

relationships contributed to contagion, as did close geographic proximity to distressed

institutions (Heitfield, Richardson and Wang 2017; Wicker 1996). However, in a broader study

of bank failures during the Depression, Calomiris and Mason (2003) found no evidence that the

volume of a bank’s interbank deposit liabilities affected its failure risk, though Calomiris and

Mason did not explore the impact of bilateral network connections. More recently, based on

aggregated data, Mitchener and Richardson (2019) find that outflows of correspondent deposits

likely caused banks in major cities to contract their loans and other assets, suggesting that

contagion contributed to bank distress. Further, Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) find that

greater connectedness to the interbank network (reflected in eigenvalue centrality) increased the

odds that a bank would close during the Depression, but that a larger contribution to network

systemic risk lowered the likelihood of closing. However, neither Das, Mitchener and

Vossmeyer (2018) nor other studies examine whether or how contagion among related banks

(either geographically or through explicit connections) affected survival probability over the

course of the Depression. One of the main contributions of our paper is in showing that




                                                 4
contagion occurred both through contractual relationships in the interbank network and

geographical proximity to other distressed firms.5

         Given the severity of liquidity risk in magnifying failures during the Depression, we also

consider how the establishment of the Federal Reserve System might have altered banks’

incentives to manage liquidity risk associated with their position in the interbank network. Based

on aggregated data, Carlson and Wheelock (2018) find that national banks generally were less

liquid during the 1920s than they had been in the 20 years before the Fed was established. Here,

we probe the cross-sectional variation in individual banks’ liquidity holdings to see how the

Fed’s presence affected banks’ management of network liquidity risk. We find that, before the

founding of the Fed, banks managed this risk by maintaining higher equity relative to assets

when their exposure to network liquidity risk was relatively high. After the founding of the Fed,

however, correspondent banks were less prudent in their management of network liquidity risk.

Reduced prudence by the most systemically important banks in the system likely contributed to

the banking system’s vulnerability to contagion during the Depression.

         Our study relies on newly digitized data on the entire U.S. interbank network on key

dates before the establishment of the Fed (1910), soon after the Fed was founded (1919) and on

the eve of the Great Depression (1929). Most banks had multiple correspondents located in

major cities outside their local market (very few banks had any correspondents in their local

market). Using information about the identities and performance of each bank’s correspondents,

as well as the bank’s own balance sheet and local market, we study the impact of interbank

contagion on bank closure risk and the effect of the founding of the Fed on bank management of

network liquidity risks.

 For interested readers, the Appendix provides a detailed review of the literature on bank distress during the
Depression and its potential relationship to liquidity risk through interbank contagion.

       Controlling for various balance sheet characteristics that are commonly associated with

the probability of failure, we find that a bank’s probability of closing during the Depression was

higher when a higher percentage of its correspondents closed. A bank would lose access, at least

temporarily, to funds it had on deposit in correspondents that closed, and the outright failure of a

correspondent could permanently impair a bank’s assets, leading to the bank’s own downfall. We

also find that having a large number of respondent banks increased a correspondent bank’s

closure risk. Although having multiple respondents probably mitigated liquidity risk in normal

times, it likely had the opposite effect when a major banking panic or other adverse shock caused

all of a correspondent bank’s depositors to withdraw their funds simultaneously. Our results

indicate, therefore, that contagion through network ties was a significant source of banking

instability during the Great Depression. Finally, we also find important location-specific closure

risks in that banks were more likely to fail when other banks in their local market closed, which

could be indicative of either location-specific loan risk or local contagion.

       To examine how the founding of the Fed affected banks’ management of network

liquidity risks, we identify two separable aspects of network relationships that affected liquidity

risk in the pre-Fed era, consistent with the fact that network relationships could be either a source

of liquidity risk or a means of mitigating liquidity risk. One aspect (the amount of deposits due to

respondents) created liquidity risk, and the other (the total number of network relationships,

which we interpret as a measure of the bank’s reputation and credit worthiness within the

network, and thus its ability to access resources) mitigated liquidity risk. After controlling for the

amount of deposits due to respondents, which would tend to increase risk, the size of a bank’s

respondent network should ordinarily mitigate liquidity risk. We find that before the Fed was

established, both aspects affected how correspondent banks managed their portfolio risk and



                                                  6
leverage. Greater exposure to interbank deposits encouraged banks to increase their capital

ratios, while more network relationships (holding constant the amount of interbank deposits) led

them to hold lower cash and capital ratios.

        By contrast, after the Fed was established, correspondent banks appear less sensitive to

network liquidity risk. We find that both aspects of network connections had much less impact

on banks’ risk management decisions in the years after the Fed’s founding, suggesting that

expected access to liquidity from the Fed reduced cross-sectional differences in perceived

liquidity risk for correspondent banks, which likely heightened contagion risk through the

interbank network. In essence, the founding of the Fed provided a perception of liquidity risk

insurance against the sorts of shocks associated with banking panics in the National Banking era,

and in so doing weakened the incentives for correspondent banks to guard against interbank

liquidity risks by holding more capital or liquid assets. Ultimately, the Fed failed to provide

sufficient liquidity to prevent contagion during the Great Depression, and thus did not fulfill the

promise of the System’s founders or the expectations of banks that the Fed would insure them

against liquidity risk shocks.6 Our findings thus contribute new information about how the

interbank network contributed to banking system instability during the Great Depression.

        The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data that we use to measure

closure and bank contagion. Section 3 provides the results of the empirical analysis of bank

closure. Section 4 examines ex ante perceptions of liquidity risk related to the network prior to

the Depression, and shows the risk-creating consequences of the founding of the Fed on banks’

portfolio and leverage decisions. Section 5 concludes.

2. Data

         Our study examines closures of national banks during the Great Depression.7 Although

national banks represented just 30 percent of all U.S. commercial banks in 1929, they held nearly

44 percent of all U.S. bank assets (Board of Governors 1959). We focus on national banks

because they faced a common regulatory regime throughout the United States and because

Annual Reports of the Comptroller of the Currency provide comprehensive end-of-year balance

sheets for every national bank. State-chartered banks were subject to various state-specific

regulations, and many states did not report consistent or comprehensive balance sheets for

individual banks.8 We digitized year-end balance sheets for all national banks from 1929 through

1934.9 We assume that a national bank closed in the year after the bank last appeared in the

Comptroller’s Annual Report. Identifying closures in this way avoids conflating temporary

suspensions with terminal bank closures.

         We identified the interbank connections of every national bank as reported in the January

1929 edition of Rand McNally Bankers’ Directory. The Directory provides a complete list of

banks in the United States as well as each bank’s “principal correspondents.”10 Although the


7
  National banks are banks with federal charters (as opposed to banks with charters issued by individual states). We
define a closure as any event that extinguishes a bank charter, including a failure that results in a bank being placed
into receivership and liquidated or merged with another bank, a voluntary liquidation, or a charter conversion, e.g., a
conversion from a state-chartered to a federally-chartered (national) bank. During the Depression, almost all
closures were associated with financial distress, whether they were failures, mergers or voluntary liquidations.
Importantly, however, we do not treat temporary bank suspensions as closures.
8
  Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) use balance sheet data as reported in Rand McNally Bankers’ Directory for
both national and state banks in their study of bank survivorship during the Great Depression. However, the balance
sheet data reported in Rand McNally for earlier years are more highly aggregated than the data in the Annual
Reports of the Comptroller of the Currency. In particular, Rand McNally does not report information on interbank
deposits, which is required for our analysis of how the founding of the Fed changed banks’ management of network
liquidity risk. Hence, we focus on national banks throughout our study and use balance sheet information as reported
by the Comptroller.
9
  We drop a few banks that had extreme values as they were likely to be typos in the original document or brand new
banks that had not started business.
10
   Directories include listings of private (i.e., unchartered) banks, and bank branches as well as commercial banks,
mutual savings banks and institutions, and trust companies. We focus on chartered depository institutions and as
such omit (1) private banks (i.e., financial institutions with no charters or regulation) because they typically were
small and did not always take deposits, and (2) bank branches because they either mimicked their head office’s

                                                          8
Directory does not define “principal correspondents,” the evidence suggests that it lists each

bank’s largest and most important correspondents.11 By identifying the correspondents of every

bank, the information allows us to identify every correspondent bank’s respondents and thus

observe both sides of the interbank network. For our analysis of pre-Depression changes in bank

risk management in Section 4, we use similar data on network structure and balance sheets for

1910 and 1919 from the same sources.

         We use the list of “Discontinued Banks” in the January 1935 edition of Rand McNally

Bankers’ Directory to determine if and when each state-chartered bank that served as a

correspondent of a national bank closed (again, closures of national banks are determined by

their omission from Annual Reports of the Comptroller of the Currency).



3. Interbank Connections and Closure Risk During the Great Depression

         We estimate limited dependent variable models to examine the role of contagion on bank

closure risk during the Great Depression. The models include balance sheet and other bank-

specific information, as well as information about the market in which the bank operated. To

capture possible contagion, we include the fraction of a bank’s correspondents that closed, as

well as the fraction of other national banks in the bank’s market (i.e., county) that closed. If

contractual contagion was important, we expect that a bank was more likely to close, the larger

the fraction of its correspondents that closed. Banks lost access, at least temporarily, to their

deposits in closed correspondent banks. Although a bank might eventually regain access to some




correspondents or did not list any. We also omit the few banks (i.e., generally less than 1 percent of banks) that did
not list any correspondents as we are unsure whether the data are missing or that they had no correspondents.
11
   From the few surviving archival records that contain full correspondent information for comparison, we
determined that by 1900 the correspondent lists in Rand McNally cover the vast majority of funds placed in
correspondents.

                                                           9
or all of its funds, the abrupt closure of a correspondent could impair a bank’s assets and threaten

its own survival. Because the vast majority of correspondents of national banks were located in

cities outside the bank’s local market, the estimated effect of correspondent closures would most

likely reflect contractual connections between the banks rather than a spurious correlation caused

by exposure of related banks to common local shocks.

       Contagion might also occur from closures of nearby, but otherwise unrelated, banks. We

include the percentage of other national banks in a bank’s local market (county) that closed as an

additional independent variable. We expect that a bank was more likely to close when a higher

percentage of nearby banks failed. Obviously, the correlation between local bank closures might

reflect common local shocks, though it could also reflect local panics or other manifestations of

contagion. However, including this variable in our regressions provides further assurance that the

effect of correspondent closures does not simply reflect common local shocks.

       We also include logarithms of the numbers of the bank’s respondents and correspondents

(in 1929) as independent variables. Having more correspondents might provide a bank with more

potential sources of funds if needed. The likely effect of having more respondents is less clear,

and likely depended on the size of shocks hitting the banking system. Ordinarily, having more

respondents could mitigate risk for a correspondent bank because the seasonal and other

demands for funds from the bank’s respondents were typically not highly correlated (Carlson and

Wheelock 2018). However, a large common shock – like the massive, nationwide liquidity

shocks that struck during the Great Depression – could put a great deal of pressure on

correspondent banks with a large number of respondents all clamoring for funds at the same

time. Thus, while a larger number of respondents might have mitigated liquidity risk arising from




                                                10
correspondent deposits in the pre-Depression era, it might not have done so during the

Depression.

         Making use of the detailed interbank data, we also control for the composition of a bank’s

interbank connections. Because the failure rate of national banks was lower than that of state-

chartered banks, we hypothesize that banks fared better when more of their correspondents were

national banks; hence, we include the fraction of a bank’s correspondents that were national

banks. Similarly, banks with correspondents in Federal Reserve cities might have had better

access to liquidity provided by the Fed. To test this, we include the fraction of a bank’s

correspondents in cities with a Federal Reserve Bank or branch office.12

         In addition to variables meant to capture aspects of interbank connections, we include

various balance sheet measures that have often been found to be correlated with the probability

of a bank’s failing or being acquired. These include the logarithm of a bank’s assets, loans-to-

assets ratio, capital-to-assets ratio (i.e., the sum of paid in capital, surplus, and undivided

profit/total assets), cash-like-assets-to-total-deposits (i.e., cash in vault, due from banks, and due

from the Fed)/(individual deposits and due to banks).13 We also include the logarithm of bank

age. Consistent with previous studies across many different periods including the Great

Depression, we expect that older and larger banks, those with a lower ratio of loans-to-assets,

and those with higher capital-to-assets or higher cash-like assets-to-total deposits, were less

likely to close.14


12
   In unreported regressions, we decompose the Fed effect into cities within the bank’s Fed district, central reserve
cities (i.e., New York, Chicago, and St Louis) as distinct from other Fed cities, and looked at the geographic
diversity of correspondents. The results in each case are statistically insignificant when the other controls are
included.
13
   Individual deposits refer to deposits of firms, households and state and local governments, i.e., deposits other than
those of other banks.
14
   Historical studies include White (1984), Calomiris and Mason (1997, 2003), Heitfield, Richardson and Wang
(2017), and Wheelock and Wilson (2000), the latter of which examines the determinants of closing via merger as
well as by failure.

                                                          11
          Finally, we include variables that control for aspects of the bank’s location and market.

Using the Census of Population data from Haines (2004), we start with the 1930 population and

urbanization rate of the bank’s county to capture the local demand for deposits and loans. We

control for other aspects of a bank’s market by including the logarithm of the number of other

national banks in the bank’s county in 1929, and indicator variables for whether the bank was

located in a city with a Federal Reserve Bank or branch office, and denoting its Fed district.

These types of factors were likely important over the course of the Great Depression when many

local waves of bank closures occurred.

          We first estimate a cross-sectional probit model where the dependent variable is an

indicator variable that takes the value 1 if the bank closed between January 1, 1930 and

December 31, 1934.15 The model takes the form:

     𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑖,𝑐,1929−34

                    = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖,1929−34 + 𝛽2 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖,1929

                    + 𝛽3 𝑁𝐵𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐,1929−34 + 𝛽4 𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑆ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑖,1929 + 𝛽5 𝑋𝑐,1930 + 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑐 + 𝑠𝑠

                    + 𝑒𝑖,𝑐 (1)

𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑖,𝑐,1929−34 is an indicator variable for whether bank i in county c closed between 1929

and 1934. 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖,1929−34 is the fraction of the bank i’s correspondents that closed by

1934. 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖,1929 is a vector of interbank variables (observed in 1929) including the

logarithm of the number of respondents, the logarithm of the number of correspondents, the

fraction of correspondents that were in a Fed Reserve Bank or branch office city, and the fraction

of correspondents that were national banks.16 𝑁𝐵𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐,1929−34 is the fraction of other


15
  The results are similar if we exclude bank closures in 1933 or 1934.

  We add 1 to the numbers of respondents, correspondents, and number of national bank correspondents before
taking logs because many banks had no respondents or national bank correspondents.

        Table 1 presents summary statistics for the variables used in the regression broken down

by the bank’s outcome. The data indicate that the means of all of the variables included in the

model are significantly different between surviving and closing banks. On average, banks that

survived the Depression were larger and older than banks that closed. Survivors also tended to

have higher ratios of capital-to-assets and cash-like-assets-to-total-deposits, and lower ratios of

loans-to-assets in 1929 than banks that closed. Thus, as White (1984), Calomiris and Mason

(2003), and Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) show, banks that had more balance sheet risk

ex ante were more likely to fail (or otherwise close) during the Great Depression.

        The summary statistics also show that on average, banks that survived the Depression had

both more respondents and more correspondents, though the differences in the mean values

between survivors and closing banks are quantitatively small. Survivors also tended to have

higher percentages of national banks among their correspondents, and more of their

correspondents were located in Fed cities. Finally, banks that survived the Depression generally

had smaller fractions of correspondents that closed.




                                                  13
       Table 2 presents estimation results (i.e., marginal effects) for equation (1). The

coefficients on the balance sheet variables have the expected signs based on previous literature

for both the historical and modern period. As suggested by the comparison of mean values,

larger banks, older banks, and those with smaller ratios of loans-to-assets and higher ratios of

cash-like-assets-to-total-deposits and of capital-to-assets were more likely to survive the Great

Depression.

       In addition, banks were more likely to close when a larger fraction of their

correspondents closed and when a larger fraction of other national banks in their local market

closed. Quantitatively, the effect of local bank closures is somewhat larger than correspondent

closures. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the fraction of local closed

national banks (i.e., 0.453) increased the probability of closure by 3 percent. A one standard

deviation increase in the fraction of closed correspondents (i.e., 0.292) increased the probability

of closure by 2 percent. With a sample mean closure rate of 33 percent, these effects seem

modest except when noting the host of other variables included in the model.

       The regression results also indicate that an increase in the number of respondents

increased a bank’s risk of closing. Although on average banks that survived the Depression had

more respondents, the marginal effect of adding another respondent was to increase closure risk.

A one standard deviation increase in the logarithm of respondents (i.e., 1.0) increased the

probability of closing by 3 percentage points. The severity of the Great Depression likely

reduced any diversification benefit from having a large number of respondents. Instead, when

banks throughout the country were confronting deposit outflows and turning to their

correspondents for help, those with more respondents likely faced more withdrawal pressures.




                                                 14
        The interbank distribution variables in column (2) indicate that having more

correspondents that were national banks lowered a bank’s closure risk. National banks had lower

failure rates than state-chartered banks. Moreover, because they were members of the Federal

Reserve System, national banks had direct access to the Fed’s discount window, and thus could

have facilitated access to liquidity for their respondents.

        The results reported in Table 2 suggest a role for local and interbank contagion, but do

not address the timing of closures. Therefore, we next take advantage of the time-series variation

in the data to estimate a panel probit model of the form:

     𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝑎

                        + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖,𝑡 +𝛽2 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖,1929 + 𝛽3 𝑁𝐵𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐,𝑡

                        + 𝛽4 𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑆ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽5 𝑋𝑐,1930 + 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑐 + 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑐 ∗ 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑠𝑠 + 𝑡𝑡

                        + 𝑒𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 (2)

where 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is an indicator variable for whether bank i in county c closed in year

t, 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖,𝑡 is the fraction of bank i’s correspondents present in 1929 that closed in year t,

𝑁𝐵𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐,𝑡 is the fraction of other national banks in county c in 1929 that closed in year t,

𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑆ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑖,𝑡−1 is the vector of balance sheet statistics for bank i at the end of the previous year (t-

1), 𝑡𝑡 is a vector of year fixed effects, and the other variables retain their previous definitions.

We add the interaction between the Fed District dummies and the time fixed effects to control for

potential differences in discount window policies of the Reserve Banks as documented by

Richardson and Troost (2009) as well as the regional shocks that could be impacting different

parts of the country.




                                                  15
           Table 3 presents results of the panel probit regression in equation (2).17 The pattern of

coefficients is similar to those in Table 2. Closure probability is significantly and negatively

influenced by asset size, age, and ratios of capital-to-assets and cash-like-assets-to-total-deposits,

and is significantly and positively influenced by the ratio of loans-to-assets. Compared with the

cross-sectional regression results, the effect of cash-like-assets-to-total-deposits is higher and the

other factors are lower, suggesting that liquidity was a larger predictor of bank instability in each

year than it was over the entire period.

           Focusing on our measures of contagion risk, the coefficients on both the fraction of other

national banks in the market that closed and the fraction of correspondent closures remain

positive and statistically significant. However, the lagged values of the contagion variables are

not statistically significant, suggesting that much of the impact of contagion occurred in the

current year rather than in the year preceding closure.

           Having shown that correspondent closures and local bank panics contributed to bank

closures during the Great Depression, we next examine, in column (5) of Table 3, two specific

aspects of interbank contagion. First, we test whether local panics in one area were transmitted

through the interbank network to banks in other areas. We do this by calculating the fraction of

national banks that closed in the counties where a given bank’s correspondents were located.18

Because the year fixed effects should control for any nation-wide panic that affected all banks

and the Fed district-by-year interactions capture broader regional panics, including the fraction

of banks closing in the correspondent’s location captures any impact caused by distress in the

local markets of a bank’s correspondents. The results indicate that a high rate of closures in the

     We find qualitatively similar results when using a linear probability or Cox proportional hazard model.
18
     The variable is labeled “Correspondents’ Fraction of Other National Banks in County that Closed in Year.”

                                                          16
markets of a bank’s correspondents imposed distress on the respondent bank. The evidence thus

indicates that the interbank network connections transmitted local shocks to other areas.

           Second, to determine whether the failures of correspondents operated directly through

contractual connections, or alternatively were indicative of common shocks, we examine

whether a bank’s probability of closing was affected by closures of the correspondents of

neighboring banks. One can think of this as a placebo test for direct contractual contagion. We

do this by calculating the fraction of correspondents of neighboring banks that closed during the

year.19 The results show that closures of the correspondents of neighboring banks had no

significant effect on a given bank’s closure probability. Thus, we are confident that

correspondent closures are independent across neighboring banks and that contagion flowed

through direct interbank connections.

           Although most banks used correspondents in distant cities for check clearing and indirect

access to the Fed’s discount window, a handful of banks had more local correspondent

connections. In these few cases, the closures among correspondents could be picking up local

common influences, including local banking panics. Thus, we reestimate equation (2) dropping

out those correspondent closures that are within the same county as the observed bank. The

results in Table 4 are very similar to those previously reported. Correspondent closures outside a

local area of a bank still have a positive and significant effect on bank closure probability.

Combined with the previous results, this finding indicates that local shocks are not responsible

for our findings and that the direct correspondent relationships helped transmit shocks some

distance rather than just locally.




19
     The variable is labeled “Other National Banks’ Fraction of 1929 Correspondents that Closed in Year.”

                                                          17
          While correspondent closures increased a bank’s probability of closing, they would have

also affected bank balance sheets. Consequently, the closure regressions would underestimate the

effect of interbank closures on bank closure risk due to the inclusion of balance sheet controls.

Therefore, we examine the impacts of correspondent bank closures on the balance sheets of

surviving banks to gauge further the effects of contagion spread through the interbank system.

We also include nearby bank closures each year in our model, which captures some combination

of time-varying location-specific loan risks and location-specific closure contagion. We estimate

the following regressions:

     𝛥𝑌𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑁𝐵𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑐,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑐 ∗ 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑒𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 (3)

where 𝛥𝑌𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is a vector consisting of the change in the logarithm of assets, loans, cash-like

assets, capital, and total deposits, 𝑢𝑖 is a vector of bank-fixed effects, and the rest of the variables

retain their aforementioned definitions.

          The estimates reported in Table 5 show that surviving national banks gained deposits and

assets when neighboring banks closed, and they lost deposits and assets when more of their

correspondents closed. Thus, while an increase in the number of local bank closures tended to

increase a bank’s own probability of closing, closures of neighboring banks tended to increase

the size of banks that did not close. Surviving banks likely gained customers, and thus assets and

deposits, from banks that closed, either by acquiring distressed banks or as customers of those

banks moved their deposits to healthier banks. On the other hand, the decline in assets that banks

experienced when their correspondents closed likely forced some to reduce loans to their own

customers.20 In this way, we can clearly see the potential effect of interbank closures on the

balance sheets of connected banks, while the link with local closures is a bit less clear.


20
  The finding complements Mitchener and Richardson (2019), who find that withdrawals of interbank deposits led
to reduced lending by correspondent banks.

4. Imprudence in Post-Fed Liquidity Risk Management by Correspondent Banks

        The high incidence of bank distress during the Great Depression is prime evidence that

the Fed did not prevent the sorts of liquidity crises that had plagued the interbank system during

the National Banking era.21 Although panics were not the principal cause of most bank failures

during the Depression (Calomiris and Mason 2003), our regression evidence indicates that

contagious liquidity shocks were transmitted through the interbank system and heightened bank

distress. The Fed should have, and apparently did reduce risks associated with seasonal variation

in reserve supply and demand, and thereby largely eliminate seasonal volatility in interest rates

and stock returns (Miron 1986; Bernstein et al. 2010; Calomiris 2013; Carlson and Wheelock

2018). The successful elimination of seasonal money market pressures and the absence of

significant banking crises during the Fed’s first 15 years likely encouraged banks to hold less

liquidity themselves and instead rely on the Fed in times of need (Carlson and Wheelock 2018).

Further, the Fed’s presence should have reduced perceived liquidity risk in the interbank network

and thereby encouraged correspondent banks to take on more balance sheet risk as expressed, for

example, by lower ratios of capital-to-assets and liquid-assets-to-total-deposits, defined as (cash

items + due from banks and Fed + bonds + stocks)/total deposits. If correspondent banks did

lower their guard in response to the introduction of a lender of last resort, then the Fed’s mistakes

during the Depression were compounded by the ex ante belief of banks that the Fed would be a

reliable source of liquidity.


21
  Numerous studies have examined why the Fed did not live up to the promise of its founders. Friedman and
Schwartz (1963) argue that the Fed should have done more to prevent the Great Depression, contending that the Fed
could have employed both open market operations and discount window lending to increase the money supply,
reduce the contraction in nominal income and prices, and prevent the financial distress of many bank borrowers
from causing bank distress. Meltzer (2003) shows that the Fed leadership failed to understand the difference
between low nominal interest rates and low real interest rates, and mistook the abundance of excess reserves as a
sign of monetary slack when in fact it was caused by banks’ scramble to shore up their positions in the face of
monetary contraction and increasing financial distress. Bordo and Wheelock (2013) point to flaws in the discount
window mechanism in the Federal Reserve Act.

                                                       19
       We investigate how the Fed’s establishment might have altered perceptions of risk in the

interbank system by focusing on the behavior of correspondent banks, which were central to

managing liquidity risk in the banking system. We construct panel datasets consisting of balance

sheet and respondent data for correspondent banks in 1910 (before the founding of the Fed), in

1919 (after the Fed’s founding) and at the end of 1928 (just prior to the Great Depression). We

identify two cross-sectional characteristics of correspondent banks that affected the extent of

their liquidity risk prior to the Fed, and measure the influence of those characteristics on capital-

to-assets and liquid assets-to-total deposits ratios in 1910. We then investigate whether banks’

risk management, as reflected in those two balance sheet ratios, changed after the founding of the

Fed.

       Our first measure of liquidity risk is the ratio of deposits due to banks to total deposits.

Correspondent banks with higher ratios of respondent deposits to total deposits should have

maintained a higher capital-to-assets ratio, a higher liquid-assets-to-total-deposits ratio, or both,

ceteris paribus. After the founding of the Fed, if correspondent banks believed that the Fed had

reduced systemic risk, then those with higher ratios of respondent deposits to total deposits

would have reduced one or both of those ratios compared to their levels in 1910.

       A correspondent bank’s reputation might have mitigated liquidity risk, however, as might

a large number of connections it maintained to other banks, which could lower liquidity risk

through diversification if the shocks hitting the bank’s respondents were not perfectly correlated.

Thus, in general, prior to the large common shock experienced during the Depression, more

connections should have reduced liquidity risk for a given ratio of due to banks-to-total deposits.

Of course, the number of connections a bank has is potentially endogenous. Banks with more

connections might have been better known, more diversified in their liquidity risk, or considered



                                                  20
more reputable (i.e., the number of respondents should reflect the reputation of the correspondent

bank). Therefore, we expect that, controlling for the due-to-banks-to-total-deposits ratio, more

respondent connections should be associated with less liquidity risk.

         If the number of respondent banks is an indicator of higher reputation, or a more diverse

network of respondents, then banks with larger respondent networks might have been able to

maintain lower capital-to-assets and liquid assets-to-total deposits ratios ceteris paribus.22 The

founding of the Fed might have mitigated cross-sectional differences in capital and cash ratios

that previously had reflected the need to respond to liquidity risk. If correspondent banks

believed that the Fed’s founding had reduced systemic risk, then those with lower (higher)

numbers of respondents would have reduced (increased) the relative sizes of their capital-to-

assets and liquid-assets-to-total deposits ratios (after removing the average year effect).

Furthermore, average year effects for the capital-to-assets and liquid-assets-to-total deposits

ratios should be negative in 1919 and 1929 compared to 1910, if banks believed that the

establishment of the Fed reduced systemic risk.

         We estimate the following model:

      𝑍𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 ∗ 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐷𝑢𝑒𝑡𝑜𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑖,𝑐,𝑡

                         + 𝛽3 𝐷𝑢𝑒𝑡𝑜𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 ∗ 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝑋𝑐,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑒𝑖,𝑡 (4)

where 𝑍𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is either the capital-to-assets or liquid-assets-to-deposits ratio, 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is a

vector of indicator variables for whether the bank i had 0 respondents (excluded group), 1-15




22
  Because the number of respondents is potentially endogenous (an increasing function of) lower risk, it is also
possible that more respondents could be correlated with higher capital ratios or higher liquid asset ratios. In our
empirical analysis, however, the opposite is true, indicating this reverse causality is not apparent. More respondents,
ceteris paribus, is associated with lower capital and cash ratios. That negative covariance indicates that
unobservable characteristics about the correspondent bank (a better reputation or a more diverse network of
respondents) drive the negative association between the number of respondents and the capital and liquid asset
ratios.

                                                          21
respondents, 16-100 respondents, or more than 100 respondents in year t, 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑡 is an indicator

variable for years after the Fed was in operation, and the rest of the variables retain their previous

definitions.23 The levels of our two interbank risk variables provide measures of the effect of

each across all periods, whereas the interaction between the variables and the Fed indicator tests

whether banks behaved differently after the Fed was established. We include bank fixed effects

to control for bank-specific characteristics, but allow banks to vary over time in the size of their

respondent networks.

         The results reported in Table 6 support our hypotheses about liquidity risk perceptions

before and after the Fed’s establishment. Results in the first two columns pertain to the capital-

to-assets ratio. The coefficient on the due-to-banks-to-total-deposits ratio of 0.082 in the first

column indicates a positive impact of the due-to-banks-to-total-deposits ratio on Capital/Assets.

The effect was reversed in 1919 and 1929, however, with the total effect being −0.047 (i.e.,

0.082 − 0.129). The results are similar for the panel estimates reported in the second column,

which are based on data for just 1910 and 1919.

         The year effects for 1919 and 1929 are negative and statistically significant in all of the

regressions, indicating that banks generally held lower capital/assets and liquid assets/total

deposits in the years after the Fed was established. This suggests that banks expected the Fed to

reduce systemic risk. Reserve requirements on national banks were lowered when the Fed was

established and again in 1917. For our broad measure of liquid assets, reserve requirements

generally should not bind for banks holding positive liquid assets in addition to reserves at the

Fed. In particular, a loosening of reserve requirements might lower reserves held at the Fed, but



23
  We chose the cutoff points based on the underlying distribution of respondents. The results are not sensitive to
picking different bins for the number of respondents or to using the log number of respondents instead. They are
also not sensitive to holding the number of respondents and due to banks fixed at their 1910 values.

                                                         22
that effect likely would be somewhat offset by increased holdings of other liquid assets that

could not be used to satisfy reserve requirements. However, the negative year effects on liquid

assets after the founding of the Fed suggest that banks chose to hold less liquidity after the

introduction of the lender of last resort.24

        We find a negative association between Capital/Assets and number of respondents in

1910. The capital-to-assets ratio is lower by 0.012 for banks with 1-15 respondents, by 0.037 for

banks with 16-100 respondents, and by 0.080 for banks with 101 or more respondents. After the

founding of the Fed, however, this association disappears. In the first column of the table, the net

effect for the 1-15 respondent group is 0.003 (i.e., 0.015 − 0.012), for example. The net effects

for those with larger size networks are similarly close to zero. Results reported in the second

column are similar.

        Results are also broadly similar for Liquid Assets/Total Deposits. We do not find that

banks held more liquid assets as the result of a greater exposure to interbank deposits (the

coefficient −0.060 is not statistically different from zero). The absence of a relationship between

due to banks/total deposits and the liquidity ratio does not necessarily mean that correspondent

banks were unresponsive to network liquidity risk, however, because banks could mitigate such

risk by holding either more capital or more liquidity. The use of greater equity capital as the

means of managing liquidity risk likely reflects the unusually low cost of raising equity in the

pre-Depression period which made the raising of additional equity the generally preferred tool

for absorbing increased risk (see Calomiris and Wilson 2004; Calomiris and Oh 2018).

        For the years after the founding of the Fed, we find that higher ratios of due to banks-to-

total deposits are associated with lower liquid-assets-to-total-deposits ratios, again suggesting


24
  Carlson and Wheelock (2018) find that national banks generally held lower levels of liquid assets in excess of
required reserves during the 1920s than they did before 1914.

                                                         23
that the founding of the Fed changed how correspondent banks managed interbank liquidity risk.

And, as with Capital/Assets, we observe positive reversals of the negative coefficients in the

liquid-assets-to-total-deposits ratio regressions for the effects of respondent network size, as well

as significant negative year effects for 1919 and 1929.

       Overall, these findings lend support to the view that prior to the founding of the Fed

correspondent banks managed their capital and liquidity in response to network liquidity risks,

but that in the years after the Fed was established, they were less responsive to such risks. Banks

likely expected that the Fed would supply any needed additional liquidity and, hence, that the

systemic liquidity risk associated with interbank connections had been lowered. Correspondent

banks not only reduced their average capital and liquid asset ratios, but they also cut them even

more if they had large due to banks/total deposits ratios and relatively small numbers of

respondents. Thus, the impact of interbank contagion during the Depression was likely magnified

by a pre-Depression perception that the Fed’s presence had reduced systemic risk.



5. Conclusion

       Using newly digitized data that identify all interbank network relationships before and

during the Great Depression, we explore how contractual connections among banks affected

liquidity risk. We find large effects. Banks with more respondents (a proxy for the greater

liquidity risk associated with more deposits due to respondent banks) were more likely to close.

Banks whose correspondents closed (making it harder for them to access their own deposits)

were also more likely to close. In addition, the interbank network transmitted shocks across

locations as banks in one location suffered when their correspondents were located in other

markets with higher numbers of bank closures.



                                                 24
       For liquidity risk to have contributed to bank closures, the amount of risk experienced

during the Depression must have exceeded the liquidity risk management precautions that banks

had undertaken prior to the crisis. The Depression was an extremely adverse event that produced

losses and increased risks that overwhelmed the risk management precautions that banks had

undertaken in the form of capital and liquid asset buffers. Compounding the problem,

systemically important banks acted as though they expected the Fed to provide liquidity risk

insurance that had not existed before the Fed’s founding. Before the Fed was established, bank

capital and cash ratios varied with cross-sectional differences in the two network influences that

we identify as important to their liquidity risk (interbank deposit exposure and number of

network connections). Those correlations largely disappeared after the founding of the Fed,

suggesting that correspondent banks no longer perceived a need to hold extra capital or liquidity

against systemic risk in the interbank network. Thus, when the Fed failed to deliver on the

promise of the System’s founders that the central bank would end the problem of banking panics,

banks were even more exposed to network liquidity risk than they would have been in pre-Fed

days. Hence, the response of banks to the creation of a lender of last resort likely made the

banking collapse worse than it otherwise would have been. An important lesson from that

experience is that lender of last resort policy requires an understanding of the incentives that the

policy creates as well as the actual execution of policy when a crisis occurs.

       Risks associated with relationships among financial firms remain relevant today, and

regulators attempt to take them into account. Banks continue to have direct contractual exposures

to one another through a variety of channels, including interbank loans and deposits, commercial

loan participations, and derivative contracts, and bank regulators remain concerned about the

systemic risk that may result from such contractual exposures. The Dodd Frank Act of 2010



                                                 25
requires regulators to write rules that limit the credit exposures of banks to one another, and new

liquidity regulations, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, comprise part of Basel III prudential

regulation.25 The founders of the Federal Reserve System believed that they had eliminated

systemic interbank risks in 1914. The Great Depression subsequently proved them wrong.

Insights from studies of the Great Depression and other stress episodes can help in the design of

policies to limit and contain spillovers associated with counterparty exposures among financial

institutions.

Appendix: Literature on Interbank Contagion During the Great Depression

On the eve of the Great Depression in 1929, the United States had some 24,970 commercial

banks (Board of Governors 1959). By 1934, that number had shrunk to 15,348. The decline was

due mostly to failures, voluntary liquidations, mergers, and acquisitions of unhealthy banks.26

Economists and historians have long been interested in the causes of bank distress during the

Great Depression, at least since Friedman and Schwartz (1963) attributed the Depression to

banking panics and collapse of the stock of money. One strand of the literature has focused on

banking panics, and attempted to determine whether local or national panics caused waves of

bank failures that could not otherwise be explained by fundamentals (Temin 1976; White 1984;

Calomiris and Mason 1997, 2003; Richardson 2007). Another strand has focused on the causes

and consequences of interbank connections in propagating contagion and contributing to the

demise of banks or collapse of bank lending (e.g., Heitfield, Richardson and Wang 2017;

Mitchener and Richardson 2019). Our paper brings these strands together in a bank-level

analysis of how network connections mattered for failure risk, after taking other influences into

account.

         Temin (1976) challenged the Friedman and Schwartz (1963) interpretation of the events

of the Great Depression. He argued that rather than the cause of the Depression, bank failures

primarily reflected the collapsing economy. White (1984) and Calomiris and Mason (1997,

2003) provide supporting evidence, showing that fundamental influences were often at the heart

of bank failures. White (1984) shows that the pattern of bank failures that occurred during 1930

was similar to the 1920s, when many small, rural banks failed due to weakness in the farm



26
  The vast majority of closed banks were either acquired by or merged into other banks. Because most mergers and
acquisitions at the time involved distressed banks, we treat any bank whose charter ended as a result of a merger or
acquisition as closed, similar to banks that failed and were placed into receivership or that voluntarily liquidated.

economy. White uses logit regressions to examine the microeconomic determinants of bank

failures in the final quarter of 1930 based on failures of national banks and a stratified random

sample of non-failing banks from the same cities or local areas. He finds that deteriorating asset

values was a primary cause of bank failures, and that the failures in 1930 can be predicted a year

in advance with some accuracy, suggesting that the causes of failures in that year were not

fundamentally different from those of earlier years. However, he finds that regressions estimated

on earlier data do not forecast bank failures in 1931-32 well, suggesting that the later failures had

fundamentally different causes.

       Calomiris and Mason (1997, 2003) pursue the causes of Depression-era bank failures,

first by studying patterns of failures during a banking panic in Chicago in June 1932 (Calomiris

and Mason 1997), and then by a detailed microeconomic study of the causes of bank failures

from 1930 to 1933 (Calomiris and Mason 2003). In their study of the Chicago panic, the authors

estimate logit and hazard models to test various hypotheses about the causes of failures during

the panic. Similar to White’s (1984) analysis of the banking panic episode of 1930, Calomiris

and Mason (1997, 2003) show that both in the case of the Chicago Panic of 1932, and for the

nationwide episodes identified as panics by Friedman and Schwartz (1963), bank failures were

similar to those occurring outside those windows of time, and are similarly predictable from

bank balance sheet and income statement information observable prior to the distress event. They

reject the null hypothesis that characteristics of banks that failed during the panic differed from

those of banks that failed in other months. The authors conclude that the failures that occurred

during panics reflected the relative weakness of those banks in the face of a common asset value

shock rather than illiquidity per se or contagion. Calomiris and Mason (2003) find no evidence

that deposits due to, or due from, other banks contributed to failure risk. However, that evidence



                                                 28
does not distinguish across banks based on their differences within the network (correspondent

or respondent banks), differences in the size of their exposures, or interactions between due to

and due from (i.e., the “two-sided liquidity risk” emphasized by Calomiris and Carlson 2017).

We show that modeling the network and taking these factors into account reveals an important

relation between interbank liquidity risk and bank failure risk.

       Richardson (2007) revisits the “insolvency versus illiquidity” debate using information

about the causes of bank suspensions as recorded by contemporary Fed officials. Whereas White

(1984) and Calomiris and Mason (1997, 2003) focused exclusively on national banks or Fed

member banks, respectively, because of a lack of balance sheet information about non-member

banks, the Fed information used by Richardson reports on suspensions by all types of banks.

From those reports, Richardson concludes that both illiquidity and insolvency were substantial

sources of bank distress during the Depression. Moreover, the information suggests that

contagion played some role in that the closure of a correspondent was the primary cause of

nearly 6 percent of suspensions occurring between January 1929 and March 1933. Although this

evidence is suggestive, the interpretation of the language used by examiners remains somewhat

unclear, and the accuracy of their causal inferences is unknown. Our analysis shows that liquidity

risk as measured by network exposures had identifiable consequences for failure risk after

controlling for other fundamental influences.

       Heitfield, Richardson and Wang (2017) examine further the impact of contagion on bank

failures by focusing on the banking panic of 1930, triggered by the collapse of Caldwell and

Company, a Nashville based financial holding company (Wicker 1996). The authors estimate

hazard models of the determinants of bank failures in three states (Alabama, Mississippi, and

Tennessee) during 1930-31. A key feature of their analysis is the inclusion of variables that



                                                 29
capture geographic proximity and contractual (correspondent) connections between banks. The

study finds that geographic proximity to other failed banks was an important source of contagion

causing bank failures. Interbank correspondent connections also were important, though

somewhat less so than geographic proximity. These findings are suggestive, but apply only to a

subset of banks during a specific period. Furthermore, as Calomiris and Mason (2003) note,

geographic attributes per se are easily confounded with location-specific omitted variables.

       Other than Heitfield, Richardson and Wang (2017), we are unaware of any direct

evidence that specific bilateral interbank connections help explain bank distress during the Great

Depression. However, Mitchener and Richardson (2019) find that outflows of interbank deposits

contributed significantly to the decline in aggregate commercial bank lending during the

Depression. Their evidence shows that the interbank network was a conduit for transmitting

economic distress, with suspensions by local banks putting pressure on their city correspondents.

It seems likely that the stresses on the system they identify as important for reducing the supply

of lending were also a factor in causing failures and suspensions. Until now, however,

researchers have been unable to test whether network connections between respondents and

correspondents contributed to failures. By digitizing the complete set of correspondent

connections among U.S. banks in 1929, we have the data that enable us to test whether interbank

connections help explain the disappearance of banks during the Great Depression.

       Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) construct a detailed bank-level mapping of the

interbank network for the Great Depression. Their focus is on estimating the extent to which

network attributes of banks, in combination with individual banks’ balance sheet characteristics,

contributed to systemic risk. Their study provides valuable evidence of the importance of

network connections, but differs from our study in several ways. First, and most importantly, we



                                                30
study specific bilateral connections between the failure risks of correspondents and respondents.

In our model, we consider bilateral network influences that should have mattered from the

perspective of liquidity risk. We find that having more respondents (which should be correlated

with total deposits due to banks) positively affected the risk of closure. We also find that the

failure of a correspondent (which should have reduced a respondent’s access to liquidity)

additionally affected the risk of failure. Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) focus on the

contribution of network risk to systemic risk, and do not model these sorts of specific influences

in the same way. They measure instead each bank’s importance in the network (e.g., captured by

eigenvalue centrality which treats respondent and correspondent connections the same) and use

that attribute to estimate the effect of network influences on failure rates.

       Second, in our study, we control for location-specific differences in the riskiness of the

loan portfolios of banks. We do so by including location characteristics and measures of local

bank failure rates as controls, in addition to measures of bank balance sheet characteristics. We

believe that doing so avoids the risk of over-estimating network liquidity risk influences. Das,

Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) do not include similar local bank closure risk- and location-

specific controls, which may affect their estimate of the contribution of network connections to

systemic risk.

       Finally, we restrict our sample to national banks using data from the official Office of the

Comptroller of the Currency reports of their balance sheets. Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer

(2018) include in some of their estimates data for state-chartered banks as reported in Rand

McNally Bankers’ Directory. While Das, Mitchener and Vossmeyer (2018) focus only on the

Depression and find in their robustness checks no difference in their main findings when they

drop state banks, the balance sheet data for state banks reported in Rand McNally Bankers’



                                                  31
Directory are less complete and less reliable for the pre-Depression years. Most importantly,

Rand McNally Bankers’ Directory only reports five balance sheet items before the mid-1920s:

Paid-in Capital, Surplus, Deposits, (Loans+Discounts+Stocks+Bonds), and (Cash+Exchanges).

Without total assets, deposits due to banks, or a separation of loans and discounts from stocks

and bonds, we would be unable to carry out our examination of the leverage or liquid assets

measures for the pre and post-Fed period. Moreover, Mitchener and Jaremski (2015) find that

many states had not yet begun to report official individual balance sheets even as late as 1910,

indicating that some of Rand McNally’s numbers for earlier years were either missing, estimated,

or obtained from communication with each bank itself. As a result, we have chosen to focus on

the sample of data that is consistently measured before and during the Great Depression and

contains sufficient balance sheet items to estimate the necessary regressions to identify changes

in interbank risk-taking after the Fed.

Notes: The table presents the coefficients from a probit model with random effects. The dependent variable is an
indicator variable for whether or not the bank closed in a given year. Each observation is a national bank in a specific
year. "Location Controls" includes the logarithm of county population, fraction of county population above 2,500, the
logarithm of other national banks in county, and dummies for whether the bank was located in a Federal Reserve Bank
city or whether the bank was located in a Federal Reserve Branch Office city. Robust standard errors clustered by
county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. Dollar values are deflated to 1929 using Officer (2008). *
