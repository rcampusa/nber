                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we estimate how hospital ownership of physicians’ practices affects their patients’ hospital
choices. We match data on the hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries, including the identity
of their admitting physician, with data on the identity of the owner of the admitting physician’s practice.
We find that a hospital's ownership of an admitting physician’s practice dramatically increases the
probability that the physician's patients will choose the owning hospital. We also find that patients
are more likely to choose a high-cost, low-quality hospital when their admitting physician’s practice
is owned by that hospital.

Introduction

       Over the past decade, hospitals and physicians have become more integrated due

to increases in hospitals' ownership of physician practices (Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler

2014). There is considerable debate over how integration has affected agency problems

between physicians and their patients. Agency problems arise in this context because

patients depend on their physician not only for health services but also for advice about

the types of services that they need (Evans 1974).

       Integration is often hypothesized to increase the incentive physicians have to refer

patients to the owning hospital (O'Malley, Bond, and Berenson 2011). Optimists about

integration think that this reduces agency problems. According to this reasoning, closer

ties between physicians and hospitals improve coordination across care settings and

reduce wasteful duplication of effort. Integration also facilitates the sharing of gains

from increased efficiency, thereby encouraging greater uptake of integration’s

opportunities. This is one goal of Accountable Care Organizations, a new form of

integration promoted by the Affordable Care Act.

       Pessimists think that integration’s impact on patient referrals increases agency

problems. According to this reasoning, coordination of referrals allows physicians and

hospitals to increase their market power, raise prices, and share the gains from doing so.

Some pessimists also believe that integration allows hospitals to pay physicians covertly

for referrals, which has the potential to allow physicians to profit from recommending

care that is cost-ineffective or even medically unnecessary.

       For this reason, how integration affects hospital choice is an important empirical

issue. Yet, despite this, no previous work has identified how a hospital's ownership of a



                                                                                             3
physician's practice affects her patients' hospital choices, or even whether it affects

patients’ hospital choices at all.

        In this paper, we seek to fill this gap. We use 2009 data on the ownership status

of the practices of approximately 400,000 physicians from SK&A, matched with data on

which hospitals own physician practices from AHA. Together, these data identify which

hospitals own physician practices, and among those that do, the identity of the physicians

in the practices they own. We match these data to Medicare beneficiaries' hospital

admissions by the National Provider Identifier (NPI) of the physician who admitted the

patient to the hospital. We estimate conditional logit models that specify the probability

of a patient choosing a particular hospital as a function of characteristics of the hospital

(including its size, for profit/nonprofit status, whether it owns physician practices, and

measures of its cost and quality of care), the admitting physician (owned by some

hospital and owned by the hospital of admission), and interactions between the two. The

parameters of interest are the effect on hospital choice of an admitting physician's

ownership status, and the effects of interactions between an admitting physician's

ownership status and measures of the hospital's cost and quality of care.



Previous Literature

        Our paper contributes to three literatures: the effects of physicians’ financial

incentives on agency conflicts between physicians and patients, the effects of hospital-

physician integration, and the effects of hospital and patient characteristics on hospital

choice. It is most closely related to papers about financial incentives and physician

agency such as Ho and Pakes (2014), Iizuka (2012), and Afendulis and Kessler (2007).



                                                                                               4
Using hospital discharge data for managed care enrollees from California in 2003, Ho

and Pakes (2014) investigate how insurer capitation rates affect the relationship between

hospital characteristics and enrollee hospital choices. They ask whether the observed

referrals for enrollees whose physicians face different financial incentives indicate

different tradeoffs between price, quality, and convenience. They find that physicians

with capitated insurance contracts send their patients to lower-priced, more-distant

hospitals, but that there is no effect on health outcomes or quality of care. Using patient-

level data on prescriptions from Japan from 2003-2005, Iizuka (2012) shows that the

choice between generic and branded drugs is influenced by the markups that doctors earn

between the two versions. In particular, he finds that physicians who are vertically

integrated with a pharmacy prescribe drugs with higher margins more frequently than do

physicians who are not, holding other factors constant. Using patient-level data on

elderly Medicare beneficiaries with coronary artery disease from 1998, Afendulis and

Kessler (2007) compare patients who were diagnosed by a cardiologist who also provides

surgical treatment to patients who were diagnosed by a cardiologist who does not. They

find that diagnosis by a cardiologist who provides surgical treatment leads to increases in

health spending, but not better health outcomes. Although these three papers show that

physicians’ financial incentives affect the extent of agency problems, none of them

examine the effects of hospital/physician integration.

       Other papers examine the effects of hospital-physician integration without

focusing on the extent of agency problems (e.g., Cuellar and Gertler 2006; Ciliberto and

Dranove 2006; Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler 2014). For example, using hospital claims

from Truven Analytics for the nonelderly privately insured from 2001-07, Baker,



                                                                                            5
Bundorf, and Kessler (2014) investigate the consequences of hospital/physician

integration for hospital prices, the volume of admissions, and spending. They find that

increases in the market share of hospitals that own physician practices is associated with

higher hospital prices and spending, whereas increases in the market share of hospitals

that are contractually integrated with physicians is associated with a small reduction in

the volume of admissions.

       We build on the modeling strategy used in a long literature investigating the

determinants of hospital choice (see Gaynor and Town 2012 for an excellent review).

These papers specify a patient’s hospital of admission as a conditional logit function of

hospital characteristics and interaction between hospital and patient characteristics.

These papers generally find that cost, distance to patients’ residence, and measured

quality all affect hospital choice in the expected direction (Kessler and McClellan 2000;

Gaynor and Vogt 2003; Tay 2003; Romley and Goldman 2011; Beckert, Christensen, and

Collyer 2012).

       We extend the standard hospital choice model to include the ownership status of

the physician admitting the patient to the hospital, the ownership status of the hospitals in

the choice set, and the interaction between these factors and the hospital’s cost, quality,

and distance to the patient’s residence. In this way, we identify the extent to which

hospital ownership of physicians affects choice, and the influence of cost, quality, and

distance on choice.




                                                                                              6
Model

        We model the utility of patient i living in zip code z from choosing hospital j

(Yijz*) as a function of the attributes of j: the hospital's size, ownership, and teaching

status (Wj); its quality, cost, and distance from patient i (Qjz | Cjz | Dijz = Xijz); its

relationships with physicians, including the physician who admitted patient i to the

hospital (Vijz); and unobserved variation in the attributes of hospitals, which may interact

with the characteristics of patient i (εijz). For ease of interpretation, we define higher

values of Xijz to be unfavorable, i.e., worse quality, higher cost, and longer distance. We

do not observe Yijz*, but only Yijz, where

                Yijz = 1              if Yijz* = max(Yi1z*, Yi2z*, Yi3z*, .. , YiJz*)

                         0            otherwise.

If Yijz* = Wjα + Xijzβ + Vijzγ + εijz and εijz are independently and identically distributed with

a type I extreme value distribution (McFadden 1973), then

                                                exp( W j  X ijz   V ijz  )
                      Pr( Yijz  1)                                                           (1)
                                              exp( W    j
                                                               X ijz   V ijz  )
                                              j J




        Vijz contains three variables: whether j owns any physician practices (VijzO);

whether i's admitting physician is part of a practice that is owned by any hospital

interacted with whether j owns any physician practices (VijzOO); and whether i's admitting

physician is part of a practice that is owned by j (VijzOO*). The effect of the ownership

status of i's admitting physician is not identified in the conditional logit model -- as are

none of the patient characteristics that are constant across choices.




                                                                                                7
        The coefficient of interest in equation (1) is the effect of VijzOO* on hospital

choice. It measures how hospital ownership of a physician practice affects the

probability that a patient admitted by a member of the owned practice will choose the

owning hospital, holding all else constant. Our estimate captures the incremental effect

of hospital ownership of a patient's physician's practice, over and above the general effect

of owning any physician's practice and the patient's physician's ownership status.

Estimates from this model, however, do not indicate the likely consequences of hospital

ownership of physician practices for patient well-being. If hospital ownership of a

physician's practice leads the owned physicians to direct their patients to the owning

hospital, patients may be better off if the owning hospital is of higher quality or lower

cost, or is a better match for the patient's condition or location. Conversely, patients may

be worse off if the owning hospital is lower quality, higher cost, or a worse match. To

investigate this question further, we estimate an expanded version of equation (1) that

includes interactions between Xijz and Vijz:

                                   exp( W j  X ijz   V ijz   ( X ijz  V ijz ) )
             Pr( Yijz  1)                                                                   .   (2)
                                  exp( W   j
                                                  X ijz   V ijz   ( X ijz  V ijz ) )
                                 j J



        The coefficients of interest in this model are the interactions between Xijz and

VijzOO*. They measure, respectively, whether hospital ownership of a physician practice

affects i's valuation of (i.e., the responsiveness of i's choice to) quality, cost, and distance.

If the coefficients on these interactions are positive, then ownership of a physician's

practice leads patients admitted by that physician to choose hospitals that are lower

quality, higher cost, or farther away. We also estimate a fully-interacted model that

includes interactions between Xijz and Wj:


                                                                                                   8
                           exp( W j  X ijz   V ijz   ( X ijz  V ijz )  ( X ijz  W j )  )
     Pr( Yijz  1)                                                                                   .   (3)
                          exp( W j  X ijz   V ijz   ( X ijz  V ijz )  ( X ijz  W j )  )
                         j J



        We estimate equations (1) - (3), allowing for arbitrary clustering of εijz within 3-

digit zip codes. We report coefficients in terms of their average marginal effects on

choice probabilities.



Data

        Our paper uses data from five sources: SK&A, Medicare (inpatient, carrier, and

denominator files), the American Hospital Association (AHA) Survey, CMS Hospital

Compare, and the Dartmouth Atlas.

        The SK&A data are a sample of 422,312 office-based physicians, or

approximately 75% of the population of active office-based physicians involved in

patient care in the AMA Masterfile (National Center for Health Statistics 2011). The

SK&A data contain, for each sampled physician, the physician's National Provider

Identifier (NPI), whether or not the physician is part of a practice that is owned by a

hospital, and if s/he is, the name and state of that hospital. We used the 2009 Medicare

Provider of Service file to obtain a Medicare Provider Number for each hospital in the

SK&A that had a sufficiently specific name/state combination to enable us to identify the

facility. For each physician we have up to three owning hospitals. This occurs when

ownership of a physician's practice is shared among several facilities.

        We define the physician that admits a patient to the hospital in two ways. First,

we use the "admitting physician" field from the 2009 Medicare inpatient file. The

Medicare inpatient file contains 100% of all hospital admissions for fee-for-service


                                                                                                           9
Medicare beneficiaries to short-stay, general/medical, acute care hospitals. We limit our

sample to only those beneficiaries aged 65-99, originally eligible for Medicare by reason

of their age, resident in a non-rural (metropolitan statistical) area, and those who choose a

hospital within 35 miles of their residence of record (within 100 miles for those who

choose a large teaching hospital) according to the Medicare enrollment file.

       Second, to validate this approach, we define a patient's admitting physician as the

physician in the carrier file with whom the patient had the greatest number of outpatient

encounters in the 30 days prior to and including the date of admission (excluding

emergency department encounters). Because the carrier data contain information only on

a 20% random sample of beneficiaries, we restrict our hospital choice analysis based on

the carrier admitting physician to this same 20% sample.

       We construct an analysis file in four steps. First, we match the SK&A data to the

universe of hospital admissions based on the NPI of the admitting physician, as defined

in the two ways described above. This yields two sets of admissions: one containing all

of the admissions of the physicians in SK&A, and one containing a 20% random sample

of these physicians' admissions. Admissions by physicians not in SK&A are excluded

from both sets; admissions of patients without a qualifying outpatient visit in the 30 days

prior to and including their hospitalization are additionally excluded from the latter set.

       Second, we construct for each admission the set of hospitals the patient could

have chosen, defined as hospitals within 35 miles (or 100 miles for large teaching

hospitals) of the patient's zip code. Third, we match by Medicare identifier the

characteristics of each hospital from SK&A, AHA, and the Dartmouth Atlas. We use the

AHA data for information on hospital size, ownership status (for-profit, non-profit, or



                                                                                              10
public), system membership status, teaching status, and whether or not the hospital

reports owning physicians. We use CMS Hospital Compare to compute a single-

dimensional measure of quality equal to the average Z-score of each hospital's 30 day

mortality and readmission rates for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia in 2009.1

We use the Dartmouth Atlas to obtain the Z-score for each hospital of the average 2009

Medicare hospital reimbursements per decedent in the last two years of life. Fourth, we

calculate for each choice any variables that are a function of the interaction between a

patient and a choice. This includes distance (Dijz), whether i's admitting physician is part

of a practice that is owned by a hospital interacted with whether j owns physician

practices (VijzOO), and whether i's admitting physician is part of a practice that is owned

by j (VijzOO*), along with the explicitly-specified interaction effects in equations (2) and

(3).



Results

           Table 1 presents the distribution of admissions, by the ownership status of the

admitting physician and the hospital of admission, defined in the two different ways

discussed above (row percentages in the table are in parentheses; column percentages are

brackets). According to the table, the distributions of admissions, stratified by the two

definitions of admitting physician described above, are similar (although not identical).

According to the inpatient file, an owned physician admits 83.4% of her hospitalized

patients to the hospital that owns her practice; the comparable statistic, assigning patients

to physicians based on the frequency of pre-admission encounters in the carrier file, is

69%. The two definitions agree that owned physicians are more likely to admit patients

                                                                                               11
to their owning hospital than anywhere else, although the inpatient file's measure of

admitting physician is more likely to assign the patient to the admitting physician's

owning hospital. The two definitions also agree on the approximate share of patient

admissions attributable to owned physicians (6.4% inpatient, 5.1% carrier).

       Table 2 presents mean values for the other variables we use in analysis, and

compares the means from our sample to those for all admissions of elderly Medicare

beneficiaries in 2009. The first three rows of Table 2 are derived from Table 1A. The

first row is simply the number of admissions by owned physicians to that physician’s

owning hospital divided by the total of admissions (0.0535 = 178,219 / 3,329,519). The

second row is the number of admissions by owned physicians to any owning hospital

divided by the total (0.0589 = ((178,219 + 17,755) / 3,329,519), and the third row is the

number of admissions by owned physicians divided by the total (0.0642 = 213,830 /

3,329,519). Because these variables are, by definition, only available for the subset of

admissions by SK&A physicians, we are not able to compare their means to those from

Medicare as a whole.

       The remainder of the table shows that the subsample of admissions by SK&A

physicians closely resembles the nonrural Medicare population as a whole. Mean

hospital ownership rates and cost and quality measures for our analysis sample are within

approximately one percent of the Medicare population as a whole. The distributions of

hospital choices are likewise similar. The greatest differences between our analysis

subsample and the population are in patients’ demographics, with slightly higher

proportions of younger and Black patients, but even these differences are relatively small.




                                                                                           12
        Table 3 presents estimates of equations (1) - (3) based on the inpatient file’s

definition of admitting physician. Column (1) presents estimates of β and γ from

equation (1). Cost, quality, and distance all affect hospital choice in the expected

direction. Hospitals with higher average Medicare hospital reimbursements per decedent

in the last two years of life are slightly less attractive to patients; a one-standard-deviation

increase in reimbursements per decedent decreases the probability that a patient will

choose the hospital by 0.8 percentage points. Hospitals with higher mortality and

readmission rates are also less-preferred; a one-standard-deviation increase in the average

rate of adverse outcomes decreases the probability that a patient will choose the hospital

by 1.1 percentage points. Hospitals that are farther away are also less attractive; a one-

mile increase in distance decreases the probability of choice by 1.4 percentage points. A

one standard deviation increase in travel distance (8.7 miles, not in any table) decreases

the probability that a patient chooses a hospital by 12.2 percentage points.

        The effects of the three ownership variables are also in the expected direction.

Patients are 1.1 percentage points (standard error 0.3 percentage points) more likely to

choose hospitals that own any physicians than those that do not own physicians, holding

other factors constant. The effect of practice ownership is larger if the patient’s admitting

physician is part of a practice that is owned by any hospital (by 3.4 percentage points,

standard error 1.3 percentage points), and substantially larger if the patient’s admitting

physician is part of a practice that the hospital owns (by 33.4 percentage points, standard

error 2 percentage points). The model does not include a control for the (uninteracted)

ownership status of the admitting physician because this variable is conditioned out of the

likelihood function along with all other patient-specific characteristics.



                                                                                             13
       Column (2) presents estimates of β, γ, and δ from equation (2). It shows that

patients are not only more likely to choose a high-cost, low-quality hospital than they

otherwise would when their admitting physician’s practice is owned by that hospital, but

also more likely to choose a high-cost, low-quality hospital than a low-cost, high-quality

hospital. In terms of the parameters of equation (2), the sum of the marginal effects on

the interaction terms between cost (quality) and ownership is not only positive, but also

greater in absolute value than the negative uninteracted effect of cost (quality).

       The largest effect of owning physicians is on patients' preference for low- versus

high-cost hospitals. This is not surprising. Medicare beneficiaries bear little of the

marginal cost of choosing a hospital with high spending at the end of life, and the effect

of high spending at the end of life on quality of care is (at least potentially) ambiguous.

For a patient whose admitting physician’s practice is not owned, a unit increase in the Z-

score of the costliness of a hospital is associated with a 0.4 percentage point decrease in

the likelihood of the patient choosing that hospital. But for a patient whose admitting

physician’s practice is owned by a hospital, a one standard-deviation increase in the

costliness of the owning hospital is associated with a 2.1 percentage point increase in the

likelihood of the patient choosing that hospital (0.021 = 0.027 + 0.002 - 0.004 - 0.004, the

sum of the marginal effects of cost and the interactions between cost and ownership.

       Along these lines, owning the admitting physician’s practice also flips patients

from preferring (i.e., being more likely to choose, all else constant) high-quality hospitals

to low-quality hospitals. For a patient whose admitting physician’s practice is not

owned, a one standard-deviation increase in the adverse outcome rate of a hospital is

associated with a 0.9 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of the patient choosing



                                                                                              14
that hospital. But for a patient whose admitting physician’s practice is owned by a

hospital, a one standard-deviation increase in the adverse outcome rate of the owning

hospital is associated with a 1.4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of the patient

choosing that hospital (0.014 = 0.018 + 0.007 – 0.002 – 0.009).

       Although owning the admitting physician’s practice doesn't flip patients from

preferring closer hospitals to those farther away, it does substantially reduce patients'

preference for proximity (compare -0.014, the marginal effect of distance, to the sum of

the marginal effects of distance and the interactions between ownership and distance of -

0.003 = 0.007 + 0.003 + 0.001 – 0.014. Column (3) of the Table (presenting estimates

from equation (3)) shows that this result is robust to inclusion of a full set of interactions

between Xijz and Wj.

       Table 4 presents estimates from alternative models of hospital choice, all of which

are variants on equation (3). Column (1) presents estimates of equation (3) that define

the admitting physician based on the frequency of pre-admission encounters in the carrier

file rather than the admitting physician field in the inpatient file. The effects of hospital

ownership of a physician's practice from column (1) of Table 4 is smaller in magnitude,

but of similar sign and importance, as the analogous effect from Table 3 (column (3)).

Owning an admitting physician's practice no longer flips patients from preferring high- to

low-quality hospitals, although it does continue to flip patients from preferring low- to

high-cost hospitals.

       One potential concern about our analysis is the endogeneity of hospitals' decisions

to purchase physician practices. In particular, hospitals may seek to buy practices with

physicians who would have been predisposed to admit to the hospital, even in the



                                                                                            15
absence of an ownership relationship. In this case, estimates of the effect of ownership

will overstate ownership's impact on hospital choice. Although our effect of interest is

the interaction between ownership and cost, quality, or distance -- not the direct effect of

ownership -- bias due to endogeneity in ownership may still be a problem. In particular,

high-cost or low-quality hospitals may be differentially likely to seek to buy practices

with physicians who would have been predisposed to admit to the hospital.

        To investigate this hypothesis, columns (2) and (3) present estimates from models

that include leads of Vijz and Wj (and interactions between leads of Vijz, Wj and Xijz) in

addition to the variables in equation (3), based on the inpatient and carrier file methods of

assigning patients to physicians, respectively. Although there is a significant direct effect

of the lead (2010) value of Vijz on (2009) hospital choice, the effect of the interactions

between the leads of Vijz and Xijz are small and insignificant. Hypothesis tests of the joint

significance of the interactions between the leads of Vijz and Xijz fail to reject that the

interactions between ownership and cost, quality, and distance are zero at conventional

significance levels (χ2(3) = 1.19 (p = 0.756) and 2.37 (p = 0.500) for columns (2) and (3),

respectively).



Conclusion

        As medical care has grown more costly and complex, the value of coordination

between physicians and other providers of health services such as hospitals has increased.

In response, both public policy and private purchasers have created new incentives for

hospital/physician integration. At least in part as a result of these incentives, such

integration has increased dramatically.



                                                                                              16
       But hospital/physician integration may have harmful as well as beneficial effects.

One of the most obvious channels of integration’s downside is the exacerbation of

patient/physician agency problems through its effect on patients’ choice of acute care

hospital. Although long-standing economics literature has documented the consequences

of agency problems inherent in the patient/physician relationship, no previous work has

sought to identify how hospital ownership of physician practices affects patients’ hospital

choices.

       In this paper, we integrate new data from several sources to fill this gap. We

match data from SK&A on the owners of the practices of approximately 75% of the

office-based physicians in the U.S. with data from the American Hospital Association,

individual-level hospital and physician claims from Medicare, and quality and cost data

from CMS Hospital Compare and the Dartmouth Atlas to investigate how

hospital/physician integration affects the way that patients choose hospitals.

       We find that a hospital's ownership of an admitting physician dramatically

increases the probability that the physician's patients will choose the owning hospital.

We also find that ownership of an admitting physician has large effects on how the

hospital's cost and quality affect patients' hospital choice. Patients whose admitting

physician is not owned by a hospital are more likely to choose facilities that are low cost

and high quality. For these patients, the marginal effect on choice of a hospital’s

costliness is negative, as is the marginal effect of a hospital’s rate of adverse health

outcomes. By contrast, patients are more likely to choose a high-cost, low-quality

hospital when their admitting physician’s practice is owned by that hospital. The sum of

the marginal effects on choice of cost and the interactions between ownership and cost



                                                                                           17
are positive, as is the sum of the marginal effects of a hospital’s adverse outcome rate and

the interactions between ownership and adverse outcomes. We conclude that

hospital/physician integration affects patients' hospital choices in a way that is

inconsistent with their best interests.

        Our results support and extend the findings of other recent research on physician

agency. Ho and Pakes (2014), for example, find that patients of physicians with capitated

contracts choose hospitals that are lower-priced and more-distant (although of no lower

quality); Iizuka (2012) finds that physicians who are integrated with a pharmacy in Japan

prescribe drugs with higher margins more frequently than those who are not. Our results

suggest that integration with a hospital operates along similar lines, with the important

addition that we find some evidence of adverse consequences for the quality of care as

well as cost and convenience.

        One potential concern about our analysis is the endogeneity of hospitals' decisions

to purchase physician practices. In particular, hospitals may seek to buy practices with

physicians who would have been predisposed to admit to the hospital, even in the

absence of an ownership relationship. Even if this were the case, however, it would not

necessarily bias our key parameter estimates – the interaction between ownership and

cost, quality, or distance. However, our estimates would be inconsistent to the extent that

high-cost or low-quality hospitals were differentially likely to seek to buy practices with

physicians who would have been predisposed to admit to the hospital. To investigate this

hypothesis, we obtained leads of physicians’ and hospitals’ ownership status from 2010

and included them as exogenous variables in our models. We found no evidence that

future ownership affected our estimates of the effects of cost, quality, and distance on



                                                                                            18
patient choice; hypothesis tests of the joint significance of the interactions fail to reject

the null hypothesis of no effect at conventional significance levels.

        Our results do not necessarily imply that hospital/physician integration is on net

harmful for patients. Other recent work shows, at least under some circumstances, that it

offers tangible benefits. Future work might investigate how these benefits can be reaped

without the disadvantages we document here.
