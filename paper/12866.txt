                                              ABSTRACT

This paper develops and implements a new test to investigate whether sell-side analysts herd around
the consensus when they make stock recommendations. Our empirical results support the herding
hypothesis. Stock price reactions following recommendation revisions are stronger when the new recommendation
is away from the consensus than when it is closer to it, indicating that the market recognizes analysts
tendency to herd. We find that analysts from larger brokerages and analysts following stocks with
smaller dispersion across recommendations are more likely to herd.

        Media accounts and academic studies often attribute many market ills such as

excess market volatility, the internet bubble and the emerging market meltdown in the

nineties to the phenomenon of herding. The term “herding” refers broadly to the tendency

of many different agents, who make their own individual decisions, to take similar

actions at roughly the same time. Portfolio managers, stock analysts, individual investors,

and corporate managers are among the many who have been portrayed as having been

afflicted by herding instincts.

        Why do individuals herd? The theoretical and empirical literature in economics

and finance offer many reasons.1 One reason why individuals may herd is because they

act based on similar information. Their information may be similar either because they all

independently acquired signals that happen to be correlated, or they may have rationally

extracted other agents’ information from their actions. Alternatively, individuals may

herd because they derive utility from imitating others, either because of an inherent desire

to conform2 or because their financial incentive structure rewards conformity.

        An anecdotal example which is often cited as evidence of herding is the

investment patterns during the latter half of the nineties, often referred to as the internet

bubble period. During this period, mutual funds as a group invested an increasing portion

of their assets in technology stocks. Even funds that traditionally invested in value stocks

moved progressively towards investing in new economy stocks. One possible explanation

for this herd behavior is that it is information driven. Funds may have optimally utilized

  See Bikhchandani and Sharma (2001), Hirshleifer and Teoh (2003), and Devenow and Welch (1996) for
detailed surveys of the herding literature.
2
  The idea of irrational herding dates back at least to Keynes (1936), where he compares stock market to a
beauty contest where judges voted on who they thought other judges would vote for.


                                                                                                         1
the information available at that point in time (which includes others’ actions), and

rationally anticipated unprecedented growth for internet stocks. Although in hindsight we

know that such expectations were overly optimistic, it is hard to rule out the possibility

that the internet stock prices were rational based on ex ante information available to

investors. Alternatively, it is possible that many funds moved into internet stocks merely

because of a desire to imitate their cohorts, although they truly believed that internet

stocks were overvalued based on all available information.

       As this anecdote illustrates, it is generally hard to empirically differentiate

between imitation and information-driven herding because we only observe the actions,

but not the motives behind those actions or the information available to the actors.

Nevertheless, the potential consequences of herding, and how observers should interpret

others’ actions depends on that underlying driving force. For instance, if herding is

information-driven, then herding behavior would not have the destabilizing effect on

prices that is often attributed to it. Moreover, investors should rationally update their

priors based on others’ actions if they do indeed contain new information.

       On the other hand, if herding is driven largely by a desire to imitate the actions of

others, then herding forces may move prices away from fundamentals. Trueman (1994)

presents an example where analysts herd to imitate other analysts. In Trueman’s model,

analysts’ compensation depends on their abilities as perceived by their clients. Trueman

shows that analysts with low abilities issue earnings forecasts that are close to those

announced by other analysts in order to mimic high ability analysts and get a bigger

compensation. Truman notes that in his model, “analysts exhibit herding behavior,




                                                                                             2
whereby they release forecasts similar to those previously announced by other analysts,

even when this is not justified by their information” (p. 97).

        Herding for the sake of imitation could potentially introduce noise in prices,

which in turn may contribute to excess volatility that many view as undesirable.

However, here again herding per se would not lead to excess volatility if the users of the

information are aware of the herding incentives, and take those incentives into account in

their trading decisions. For instance, in Trueman (1994), although the earnings forecasts

are biased, they bring new information to the market. The bias would mislead investors

about the value of the stock only if they take the forecast at face value. But, if the

investors correctly adjust for the herding bias in earnings forecasts, then this bias would

not translate into pricing errors. Therefore, to understand the broader consequences of

any herding behavior, it is important that we not only focus on whether or not analysts or

others herd, but also investigate whether the market recognizes the herding phenomenon,

and acts accordingly.

        This paper examines whether sell-side analysts herd when they make stock

recommendations. We develop a simple model that allows us to specifically examine

whether any herding behavior is driven by a desire to imitate. In addition, our model also

allows us to draw inferences about whether the market recognizes analysts’ tendencies to

deviate or conform at the time they make recommendation revisions. While the

phenomenon of herding has been examined in a variety of contexts in the literature, this

paper is the first to investigate whether the market recognizes herding behavior.3


3
  For instance, Graham (1999), Jaffe and Mahoney (1999), Desai et al. (2000), Hong et al. (2000), Welch
(2000) and Clement and Tse (2005) examine herding among stock analysts and newsletters. Lamont (2002)
and Gallo, Granger and Jeon (2002) examine herding among macroeconomic forecasters and Chevalier and
Ellison (1999) examine herding among mutual fund managers.


                                                                                                     3
       In related work, Welch (2000) examines whether analysts herd when they make

investment recommendations. He develops a statistical model to investigate herding, and

he finds that analysts are more likely to revise their recommendations towards prior

consensus recommendations than away from them. However, as he notes, “Lacking

access to the underlying information flow, I [Welch] cannot discern if the influence of

recent revisions is either a similar response by multiple analysts to the same underlying

information or is caused by direct mutual imitation” [Welch (2000), p. 393].

       In contrast, our paper empirically differentiates between imitation and

information-based herding. While Welch’s tests are based on the likelihoods of

recommendation revisions either moving towards or away from consensus, our tests are

based on market price reactions to recommendation revisions. Therefore, we are able to

not only test whether analysts herd without any assumptions about recommendation

transition probabilities, but we are also able to draw inferences about whether the market

recognizes analysts’ herding tendencies.

       Empirically differentiating between herding due to imitation and herding due to

common information is generally difficult because they are both observationally similar

in many respects. This difficulty is amply illustrated by the empirical literature that

examines whether analysts herd towards the consensus when they issue forecasts. Early

papers by Hong, Kubik and Solomon (2000), Lamont (2002), Gallo, Granger and Jeon

(2002) and Clement and Tse (2005) examine the clustering of earnings or

macroeconomic forecasts around consensus forecasts, and draw the conclusion that

analysts herd towards the consensus, consistent with the model of Trueman (1994),

Scharfstein and Stein (1990) and others. De Bondt and Forbes (1999) find similar results




                                                                                            4
using UK data. However, these papers do not adequately account for the fact that

analysts may cluster around the consensus because both the consensus and the individual

analyst’s forecast reflect similar information, and because analysts may attempt to extract

and use information from the forecasts of others when they update their own forecasts.

       Subsequent papers by Zitzewtiz (2001), Bernhardt, Campello and Kutsoati

(2006), and Chen and Jiang (2006) investigate herding behavior using methodologies that

specifically account for such information effects. In marked contrast with earlier studies,

these papers conclude that analysts “anti-herd,” or that they issue forecasts that are away

from the consensus relative to a forecast conditional on analysts’ information set at the

time of the forecast. For instance, Bernhardt et al. report that if an analyst’s revised

forecast is above the consensus then it is more likely that the forecast would overshoot

actual earnings than it would fall short of it, and the opposite is true when an analyst’s

revised forecast is below the consensus.

       We present a simple model that captures analysts’ potential incentives to herd or

exaggerate their differences with the consensus. In our model, analysts optimally revise

their stock recommendations based on their private information, and the market prices

efficiently reflect all publicly available information including consensus

recommendations and analysts’ recommendation revisions. We show that price reactions

to analysts’ recommendation revisions are unrelated to consensus recommendations if

analysts optimally revise their recommendations solely based on new information,

without attempting to imitate other analysts’ old recommendations. We also show that

stock price reactions would be positively related to how far analysts’ new




                                                                                              5
recommendations deviate from the consensus if analysts have an incentive to herd and

negatively related if analysts have a disincentive to herd.

         We use the results of our model to investigate whether analysts tend to herd or

anti-herd when they revise their stock recommendations. We also examine the relation

between analysts’ tendency to herd and their experience and the reputation of their

employer. Theoretical models by Trueman (1994) and Scharfstein and Stein (1990)

predict that analysts with lower reputation are more likely to herd because of career

concerns or because of their desire to imitate others with better abilities. In contrast,

Prendergast and Stole’s (1996) model predicts that inexperienced analysts are more likely

to exaggerate their differences so that they stand out from the crowd and appear talented.4

         The empirical results in the literature offer mixed support for the predictions of

these models. Chevalier and Ellison (1999), Hong et al. (2000), and Clement and Tse

(2005) present results that suggest less experienced analysts are more likely to herd.

However, Zitzewitz (2001) presents tests that control for information effects and shows

that less experienced analysts actually exaggerate their differences from the consensus.

Unlike these papers, our tests are based on market’s interpretation of any relation

between herding and reputation, and our results offer a different perspective.

         The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model that

lays the foundation for our empirical tests. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4

presents the empirical tests. Section 5 concludes the paper.

 Scharfstein and Stein (1990) also point out that analysts’ may earn wages that are higher than outside
alternatives for experienced analysts, which could enhance the herding incentives.

2. Model

        This section presents the model that provides the basis for our empirical tests. Our

model has two periods, 0 and 1. Suppose the price of a stock at time 0 is P0 . Consider a

sell-side analyst who makes investment recommendation about this stock. The

unconditional distribution of the stock price at time 1 is given by:

                                  P1 = P0 + ε , where ε ~ N (0, σ ε2 )        (1)

        The sell-side analyst observes a private noisy signal. He updates his priors about

the time 1 price for the stock, and his posterior S0 , conditional on his signal is:

                                  S0 = P1 + η ,                               (2)

where, η is noise, and η ~ N (0, σ η2 ) . The distribution of ε and η are common

knowledge.5

        After the analyst observes his private signal, he has to decide whether to upgrade,

downgrade or make no revision to his investment recommendation of the stock. First,

consider a situation where there is no incentive for herding. Suppose the analyst’s

compensation C is a function of the relation between the direction of future price and the

direction of his recommendation revision. Specifically, his compensation is:

                                  C = α + β ⋅ D − γ ⋅ (1 − D),                (3)

where D = 1 if future price change for the stock is in the same direction as the analyst’s

recommendation revision, and 0 otherwise. The parameters α , β , and γ are positive

constants. Since the compensation function rewards skill, the analyst should not have an

incentive to make a revision based on no information. Therefore, the penalty for a wrong

 Our main results obtain also when we assume that only the analyst knows the precision of his signal, and
not the market.


                                                                                                            7
call exceeds the reward for a correct call, i.e. β < γ . If he makes no revisions, his

compensation would be α , which is known at time 0.

       The analyst revises his recommendation only if the expected payoff conditional

on a revision exceeds α . The proposition below describes the analyst’s optimal rule for

recommendation revision.

Proposition 1a: The analyst’s optimal recommendation revision rule is:

                 Upgrade if S 0 ≥ P0 + kσ η ;

                 Downgrade if S 0 ≤ P0 − kσ η ; and

                 No revision otherwise.                                              (4)

where k is determined by the equation

                        γ
          Φ (k ) =              ,                                                    (5)
                     (β + γ )

and Φ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.

Proof: See Appendix.

If the analyst revises his recommendation, then the market rationally incorporates that

information into prices. The proposition below presents the market price conditional on a

recommendation revision.

Proposition 1b: The stock price conditional on an upgrade is:

                                                   φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                 P0, up | Upgrade = P0 + σ εη                                ; and
                                                ⎡⎣1 − Φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]⎤⎦

                                                         φ[k ⋅ (ση σ εη )]
                 P0, down | Downgrade = P0 − σ εη                                          (6)
                                                      ⎡⎣1 − Φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]⎤⎦


where φ is the standard normal density function, , and σ εη = σ ε2 + σ η2 .

Proof: See Appendix.


                                                                                                 8
         In our model, the analyst conveys his information through an upgrade or a

downgrade. Because our model assumes market efficiency, the particular label that the

analyst attaches to the recommendation per se, i.e. whether it is a buy, a hold or a sell,

does not convey any incremental information. Essentially, P0 incorporates all public

information including the analyst’s recommendation level prior to any revision.

Empirical evidence in Jegadeesh and Kim (2006) and others indicates that

recommendation levels do not contain any information about future returns and supports

this assumption.6

         Now, consider the case where the analyst has either an incentive or a disincentive

to herd with the consensus. We incorporate any incentives or disincentives to herd in the

analyst’s compensation function, which we specify as:

         C = α + β ⋅ D − γ ⋅ (1 − D) − δ ( Recnew − Consensus) 2 ,               (7)

where Recnew is the analyst’s new recommendation level and Consensus is the average

recommendation level of all the other analysts. If he makes no revisions, his

compensation would be C = α − δ ( Recold − Consensus) 2 .

         The compensation function (7) is a reduced form characterization of the

incentives to herd or to exaggerate differences, and it is similar to the objective function

that Zitzewitz (2001) uses in the context of analysts’ earnings forecasts. Incentives to

herd arise endogenously in Trueman (1994), and Ehrbeck and Waldmann (1996). In these

models, analysts herd to mimic their more skilled counterparts. It is also possible that

analysts herd because they perceive it to be a safe course of action. After all, if their

 In unreported results, we found that recommendation levels are not related to future returns in our sample
as well, and hence any information in recommendation levels is fully reflected in stock prices.


                                                                                                          9
predictions turn out to be wrong when they herd, then their cohorts would be wrong as

well. Regardless of the underlying reason, when analysts have an incentive to herd, δ > 0

in the analyst’s compensation function (7).

       Prendergast and Stole (1996) present a model where the opposite incentives are

present. In their model, agents who have not yet established a reputation for themselves,

or the “newcomers,” overemphasize their own information and exaggerate their

differences with others to appear talented. Similarly, Ottaviani and Sorensen (2006) show

that when analysts view their tasks as a winner-take-all contest, then they have an

incentive to excessively differentiate their views from those of other analysts. When

analysts were faced with incentives to deviate from the crowd, or to “anti-herd”, δ < 0 .

       The proposition below describes the analyst’s optimal rule for recommendation

revision when his compensation function is given by (7).

Proposition 2a: The analyst’s optimal recommendation revision rule is:

                     Upgrade if S 0 ≥ P0 + (k + θ )σ η ;

                     Downgrade if S 0 ≤ P0 − (k + θ )σ η ; and

                     No revision otherwise.                                            (8)

where θ is determined by the equation

                 γ           δ [( Recnew − Consensus ) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus ) 2 ]
Φ(k + θ ) =              +                                                            . (9)
              (β + γ )                             (β + γ )

Proof: See Appendix.

Now the analyst’s decision whether to revise his recommendation depends not only on

his signal but also on how far away his recommendation would be from the consensus.

Since the market rationally recognizes these incentives, the price reaction subsequent to a




                                                                                              10
revision would reflect the analyst’s decision rule. The proposition below presents the

market price conditional on a recommendation revision.

Proposition 2b: The stock price conditional on an upgrade is:

                                                     φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                    P0,up | Upgrade = P0 + σ εη
                                                  [1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]] ; and
                                                        φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                    P0,up | Downgrade = P0 − σ εη
                                                     [1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]      (10)


Proof: See Appendix.

           When there are incentives or disincentives to herd, the market price reaction is a

function of not only whether the analyst upgrades or downgrades his recommendation,

but also how far the recommendation is from the consensus. This relation is formally

described in the proposition below.

Proposition 3a: The price reaction to recommendation revision is stronger when, relative

to the old recommendation, the new recommendation moves away from the consensus

than when it moves towards the consensus if the analyst has an incentive to herd (i.e. if

δ > 0 ).

Proof: See Appendix.

Proposition 3b: The expected return following recommendation revision is:

(a) Positively related to the deviation between the analyst’s recommendation and the

    consensus if the analyst has an incentive to herd (i.e. if δ > 0 ); and

(b) Negatively related to the deviation between the analyst’s recommendation and the

    consensus if the analyst has an incentive to deviate from the herd (i.e. if δ < 0 ).

Proof: See Appendix.




                                                                                                 11
Proposition 3a and 3b form the basis for our empirical tests. Our tests use market price

reactions to investigate herding. In contrast, prior research on herding typically attempts

to set empirical benchmarks for how agents would behave in the absence of herding. For

instance, Chevalier and Ellison (1999) report that less experienced managers deviate less

from benchmark index than more experienced managers, and conclude that less

experienced managers herd more because of career concerns. Here the experienced

managers’ deviation from the index is used as a benchmark for the less experienced

managers. However, it is quite possible that less experienced analysts stay closer to the

benchmark because they are not as talented as the more experienced managers. As this

example illustrates, when there are differences across agents in skill or in access to

information, it is difficult specify how one set of agents should behave based on the

actions of another set of agents and draw reliable inferences about herding.

       Since we base our tests on market price reactions, we rely on market efficiency

and we do not need to specify a model that focuses on the transition probabilities for

recommendation revisions. Our model predicts that if recommendation revisions are

driven solely by new information, then market price reaction would not depend on the

distance between the consensus and new recommendations.



3. Data and Sample
       We obtain the stock recommendations data from the IBES detailed US

recommendations file; earnings announcement dates from the IBES actual earnings file;

and stock returns and index returns from daily CRSP. The sample period is from

November 1993 to December 2005.




                                                                                            12
          Most commonly, analyst recommendations rate stocks as “strong buy,” “buy,”

“hold,” “sell,” and “strong sell.”' Analysts also use other labels such as “market

underperform” and “market outperform,” or “underweight” and “overweight,” to convey

their opinions, but IBES standardizes the recommendations, and converts them to

numerical scores where “1” is strong buy, “2”' is buy, and so on. To map an upgrade to a

positive number and a downgrade to a negative number, we reverse IBES’ numerical

scores so that “1” would correspond to a strong sell and “5” would correspond to a strong

buy.

    Our sample comprises all stocks that satisfy the following criteria:

    (a)      There should be at least one analyst who issues a recommendation for the

             stock and revises the recommendation within 180 calendar days7.

    (b)      At least two analysts, other than the revising analyst, should have active

             recommendations for the stock as of the day before the revision.

    (c)      The stock return data on the recommendation revision date should be available

             on CRSP; and

    (d)      The stock price should be at least $1 on the day before the recommendation

             revision date.

    (e)      Recommendation revisions should be only one level up or down. That is,

             absolute difference between the previous recommendation and the new

             recommendation level should be one. For instance, we exclude all revisions

             where analysts upgrade from hold to strong buy because the revision spans




7
  IBES also provides stopped dates of the coverage for each stock and brokerage pair. We filter out
revisions that are made after the closest stopped date since the previous recommendation.


                                                                                                      13
            two levels, buy and strong buy. We impose this exclusion criterion to ensure

            consistency with our model.8,9

        Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the sample. The number of firms in

the sample ranges from a low of 139 in 1993 to a high of 1,783 in 2002. The sample size

is relatively small in 1993 largely because IBES coverage is incomplete in its first year.

The median number of analysts following a firm over the entire sample period is five.

The number of brokerages in database increases from 32 in 1993 to 145 in 2004 before

decreasing to 140 in 2005. The brokerages in the sample range from large brokerages like

Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to small ones that have only one analyst on IBES. The

median number of analysts in a brokerage is four.



4. Empirical Tests

        Our first set of tests examines stock price changes following recommendation

upgrades and downgrades over various horizons. We use the results from our model to

investigate whether stock price reactions to analysts’ recommendation revisions indicate

herding behavior. We then examine the cross-sectional relation between experience and

reputation, and analysts’ tendency to herd. Finally, we examine the robustness of our

results to alternate test specifications.



4.1 Price Reaction to Recommendation Revisions

        This subsection examines how stock prices react to recommendation revisions.

We characterize each revision as an upgrade or a downgrade by comparing the revised

8
  Sorescu and Subrahmanyam(2006) report that the market reactions are stronger for two level revisions
than for one level revisions.
9
  Our empirical results, however, do not change when we include multiple level revisions in the sample.


                                                                                                          14
recommendation with the previous active recommendation for the stock by the revising

analyst.

       After a recommendation revision for stock i on date t, we compute H-day buy-

and-hold abnormal returns ABRi (t , t + H ) as follows:

                                           t+H             t+H
                       ABRi (t , t + H ) = Π (1 + Ri ,τ ) − Π (1 + Rm ,τ )   (11)
                                           τ =t            τ =t


where, Ri ,τ and Rm,τ are the return on stock i and the value-weighted index return,

respectively.

       Table 2 presents abnormal stock returns over various horizons following

recommendation revisions. Day 0 is the revision date and the other days in the column

headings are the number of trading days from the revision date. For instance, the entries

under the column heading “21” presents cumulative abnormal returns over 21 trading

days, or roughly one calendar month, after the revision. We compute serial-correlation

consistent Hansen and Hodrick standard error estimates allowing for non-zero serial

correlation for up to 6 months to take into account that the return measurement intervals

overlap across longer horizons.

       The average abnormal return on the revision date is 2.03% for all upgrades and

- 3.14% for all downgrades. The abnormal return gradually increases to 4.85% by the end

of the sixth months for upgrades and decreases to –3.45% for downgrades. Therefore, a

large part of stock price response occurs on the day of the revision although the market

prices continue to reflect the information in recommendation revisions up to six months




                                                                                           15
into the future. These results are consistent with the previous literature that examines the

impact of analysts’ recommendations on stock prices.10

        Table 2 also presents abnormal returns separately for recommendation revisions

that move towards the consensus and those that move away from the consensus. We

define consensus recommendation level as the equal-weighted average of all active

recommendations that are outstanding for the stock as of the day before the revision,

excluding the revising analysts’ recommendation. We include a revision in the sample

only if at least two analysts beside the revising analyst have active recommendations.

We consider a recommendation to be active for up to 180 days after it is issued or until

IBES stopped file records that the analyst has stopped issuing recommendations for that

stock. We impose the 180-day criterion to screen out stale recommendations. We

categorize a revision as moving away from the consensus if the absolute value of

deviation from the consensus is larger for the new recommendation than for the old

recommendation, and moving towards the consensus otherwise.11

        The results in Table 2 indicate that the market reaction is stronger for revisions

that move away from the consensus than for those that move towards it. For upgrades,

the difference in abnormal returns is significant on the revision date. Because longer

horizon returns are noisier, we do not detect any reliable difference in returns over

horizon beyond two months. For downgrades, the differences between returns are much

larger and have a longer lasting effect. These results are consistent with the predictions

of our model under herding hypothesis and suggest that the market rationally takes into


10
  For example, Womack (1996), Jegadeesh, Kim, Krische and Lee (2004) and Jegadeesh and Kim (2006).
11
  In 985 revisions (2% of the sample), the absolute deviation is the same before and after the revision. We
exclude these revisions when we present stock price reactions in Table 2 for revisions that move away from
or towards the consensus.


                                                                                                        16
account the herding incentives of sell side analysts when they make recommendation

revisions and prices them accordingly.

           However, the analysis in this subsection considers only a binary classification of

potential indication of herding; movement towards or away from the consensus. Our

model also provides predictions regarding the relationship between the magnitude of the

move towards or away from the consensus and expected returns, which we expect to be

more powerful in testing the herding hypothesis. We now examine these predictions in

more detail.



4.2 Herding Regressions

       We use the following regression specification to investigate whether analysts herd:

       ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) + ε i , j ,t , H   (12)

       where,

       I = +1 if the revision is an upgrade

        = -1 if the revision is a downgrade

           The indicator variable I takes the sign of expected abnormal returns conditional

on an upgrade or a downgrade. We use this indicator variable so that we can pool

upgrades and downgrades in the same regression.

           The variable New _ reci , j ,t is the recommendation level after the revision for stock

i by analyst j on day t. If there are multiple revisions on any day t for stock i, then we

treat each revision as a separate observation.12 The variable Con _ reci ,t −1 is the




12
     About 7% of the sample are related with multiple revisions on a same day.


                                                                                                              17
consensus recommendation the day before the revision, excluding the revising analyst’s

recommendation.

          This regression specification is based on the results of our model given in

Equation (9) and (10). As Equation (9) and (10) indicate, if analysts were either herding

or exaggerating their differences, then the stock return on the revision date would not

only depend on the information in the revision per se, but also on whether the

recommendation is closer to or away from the consensus recommendation. As we discuss

in Proposition 3b, stock price reaction would be positively related to the deviation from

the consensus if analysts herd, and would be negatively related if they exaggerate.13

Therefore, our alternate hypotheses are:

          A1. Herding: Analysts have an incentive to herd close to the consensus when they

make recommendation revisions. Therefore, c > 0 .

          A2. Exaggeration: Analysts have an incentive to exaggerate their differences with

the consensus when they make recommendation revisions. Therefore, c < 0 .

          For convenience, we will be referring to c as the herding coefficient in the

subsequent analysis. We fit Regression (12) for holding periods ranging from one day to

about six-months. By allowing for holding period longer than just the day of revision, we

can examine whether market reaction recognizes any herding incentives on the revision

date or with some delay. For instance, if analysts tend to herd, but the immediate market

reaction does not take herding into account, then the coefficient c would be zero on the

revision date but it would be positive over longer horizons as the information in deviation


13
   We resort to ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) as the main explanatory variable rather than directly use
                                           2                                          2
[( New _ rec i , j ,t −l − Con _ rec i ,t ) - (Old _ rec i , j ,t −l − Con _ reci ,t ) ] * I , since this quantity is equivalent
to 2( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) − I when revisions are only one level up or down.


                                                                                                                            18
from consensus gets reflected in market prices. However, if coefficient c is not different

from zero over any holding period, then we would not be able to reject the null

hypothesis of no herding or exaggeration.

       Table 3 presents the estimates of Regression (12) using the Fama-MacBeth

approach. Specifically, we estimate a separate regression using all revision data within

each calendar quarter. The regression estimates and t-stats are based on the time-series

averages and standard errors of the corresponding quarterly regression coefficients.

       There are a total of 49,255 revisions in our sample. The slope coefficient on the

revision indicator on day 0 is 2.05, indicating that the average stock return is 2.05% in the

direction of recommendation revision. This slope coefficient increases gradually with the

holding period, reflecting the delay in market price reactions to recommendation

revisions.

       The slope coefficient on deviation from consensus is .75, which is significantly

positive. Therefore, in addition to the direction of recommendation revision, the deviation

from consensus also conveys information to the market. The stock return is more positive

for upgrades and more negative for downgrades when the new recommendation moves

farther away from the consensus than when it moves closer to it. As we discussed earlier,

the positive coefficient supports the hypothesis that analysts herd towards the consensus.

       The point estimates of the slope coefficients on deviation from consensus are .70

and .88 for two- and six-month holding periods, respectively. Although these point

estimates are smaller and larger than the corresponding slope coefficient on the revision

date return regression, the differences are not statistically significant. Therefore, the




                                                                                            19
market price fully incorporates the information in the deviation from consensus on the

revision date.

            Analysts’ tendency to herd may be different for upgrades and downgrades. For

instance, analysts may be more reluctant to stand out from the herd for downgrades since

they are typically reluctant to be negative on a stock.14 To investigate whether analysts

herd differently for upgrades versus downgrades, we fit the following regression:

     ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )

                  + d H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) × downgrade _ dummyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H (13)

where downgrade_dummyi,j,t equals 1 for downgrades and 0 for upgrades.

            Table 4 reports the regression estimates. The slope coefficient on the herding

coefficients for downgrade dummy is .90, which is significantly greater than zero.

Therefore, analysts tend to herd more for downgrades than for upgrades.



4.3 Cross-Sectional Determinants of Herding

            This subsection examines the factors that are related to analysts’ tendency to herd.

In the models of Scharfstein and Stein (1990) inexperienced agents are more likely to

herd because of career concerns. In contrast, Prendergast and Stole (1996) present a

model where “newcomers” exaggerate their differences more than well established

employees in order to stand out from the crowd and appear talented. Empirical evidence

offers mixed support for these predictions. For example, Hong et al. (2000), Clement and

Tse (2005), and Chevalier and Ellison (1999) find that less experienced analysts and

mutual fund managers are more likely to herd. On the other hand, Zitzewitz (2001)

14
  Analysts’ reluctance to issue negative opinion is evident in the distribution of their recommendations. For
example, Barber, LeHavy, McNichols and Trueman (2001) report that only 5.7% of the analysts’
recommendations in their sample were sell or strong sell.


                                                                                                                20
reports that more experienced analysts are more likely to herd when they make earnings

forecasts, after accounting for information effects. This subsection uses price reactions to

analysts’ recommendation revisions to investigate analysts’ tendency to herd from the

market’s perspective.

       We use two measures of analysts’ professional reputation. The first measure is the

length of time that the analyst is on the IBES database. The second measure is the size of

the brokerage that employs the analyst since larger brokerages are more established and

prestigious. We measure the size of the brokerage by the number of analysts who are on

the IBES database from that brokerage each year.

       We also examine the relation between analysts’ tendency to herd and the

dispersion of analysts’ outstanding recommendation prior to the revision. We expect that

if recommendations are dispersed analysts will have less of an incentive to herd because

they do not stand out as much when their opinion deviates from the average.

       We use the following regression to test the relation between herding and various

characteristics:

        ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )

                         + d H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) × char _ dummyi , j ,t

                         + e H × I × char _ dummyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H                         (14)

where char _ dummyi , j ,t is a dummy variable for each characteristic. The dummy variable

for analysts’ experience equals 1 if the analyst has more than three years of experience.

The dummy variable for brokerage reputation equals 1 if the number of analyst is

employed by a top 20 brokerage the previous year, based on the number of analysts

employed by the brokerage. The cross-sectional dispersion dummy equals 1 if the



                                                                                                          21
standard deviation of the consensus recommendation prior to the revision is greater than

0.75, which is the average dispersion in the sample. 15 We also include an additional

independent variable that interacts each dummy variable with I to examine whether the

characteristic directly affects market response to recommendation revisions.

         Table 5 reports the estimates of regression (14). Panels A, B, and C report results

for analyst experience, brokerage size, and pre-revision dispersion in recommendations,

respectively. The results from panel A indicate that the tendency to herd does not differ

across analysts depending on their experience.16 In contrast, Clement and Tse (2005) and

Zitzewitz (2001) find evidence of herding and anti-herding when analysts revise their

earnings forecasts.

         Panel B uses brokerage size as a measure of reputation. The herding coefficient

on brokerage size dummy is significantly positive, which indicates that analysts from

large brokerages tend to herd more than analysts from small brokerages. This finding

suggests that analysts from the less prestigious brokerage may try to stand out from the

crowd to attract attention, and it is consistent with the predictions of Prendergast and

Stole (1996).

         Panel C examines the relation between cross-sectional dispersion in

recommendations and analysts’ tendency to herd. The herding coefficient of the

dispersion dummy is significantly negative, which indicates that analysts are less likely to

herd when there is a large dispersion across analysts’ opinion. This result is consistent

with our prediction.



15
  The sample mean of cross-sectional dispersion in recommendations is 0.75 and the median is 0.753.
16
  The sub-sample used in panel A only includes those revisions that are made at least three years after the
beginning of the sample period so that we have at least a three-year history of employment.


                                                                                                         22
4.4 Robustness Check

          This subsection examines the robustness of our results to various changes in our

sample selection criteria. Analysts use a variety of different information when they arrive

at their recommendations. For instance, Ivkovic and Jegadeesh (2004) note that analysts’

recommendations immediately following earnings announcements are likely to be based

on their interpretation of financial data that the firm announces while their

recommendations at other times are likely to be based on information that they privately

gather.

          To examine whether analysts’ tendency to herd differs depending on the timing of

their revisions, we estimate regression (12) excluding revisions made within three days

before and after the earnings announcement date. Panel A of Table 6 presents the

regression estimates.17 We find that the herding coefficients now are quite similar to the

estimates we report in Table 3 for the full sample.

          It is possible that revisions made by two analysts close to one another are driven

by common information. Therefore, we re-estimate regression (12) for a sample of

revisions that are made at least five days after the most recent revision by a different

analyst. These results are also quite similar to the full sample results.

          Next, we exclude revisions that move across the consensus. For example, if an

analyst upgrades from 3 to 4 when the consensus is 3.3 it may not be an unambiguous

move away from the consensus. Panel C of Table 6 presents the regression estimates for

this restricted subsample. Here again, the results are quite similar to the full sample

results both in magnitude and significance of the coefficients.


17
  We lose roughly a quarter of our sample when we exclude the seven-day earnings announcement window
since analysts’ recommendation revisions tend to cluster within this event window.


                                                                                                 23
       Finally, we investigate the possibility that the herding coefficient is significant not

because of the deviation from consensus, but because of the information contained in the

new recommendation level. To examine this possibility, we fit the following regression:

        ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )

                         + d H × Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t + e H × StrongBuyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H   (15)

where Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t is a dummy variable equal to1 if the new recommendation is a

sell or a strong sell and 0 otherwise, and StrongBuyi , j ,t is a dummy variable equal to1 if

the new recommendation is a strong buy and 0 otherwise.

       Table 7 presents the estimates of regression (15). The slope coefficient on the

Sell _ StrongSell dummy is significantly positive on the revision date, while that on

the StrongBuy , is significantly negative. These results indicate that downgrades or

upgrades to these levels are less informative than others. However, the herding

coefficient is significantly positive, and of similar magnitude to the corresponding

coefficients in Table 3. Therefore the information contained in the deviation from the

consensus is orthogonal to the level of recommendations.



5. Conclusions

       This paper examines whether sell-side analysts herd when they make stock

recommendations. We develop a model that allows us to specifically examine whether

any herding behavior is driven by a desire to imitate. In addition, our model allows us to

draw inferences about whether the market recognizes analysts’ tendencies to deviate from

or conform to the consensus at the time they make recommendation revisions. While the




                                                                                                               24
phenomenon of herding has been examined in a variety of contexts in the literature, this

paper is the first to investigate whether the market recognizes herding behavior.

         We find that the market reaction to analysts’ recommendation revision is stronger

when the revised recommendations move away from the consensus than when they move

towards the consensus. Our results are robust to a variety of controls. Our results indicate

that recommendation revisions are partly driven by analysts’ desire to herd with the

crowd.

         We find stronger herding effects for downgrades than for upgrades, which

suggests that analysts are more reluctant to stand out from the crowd when they convey

negative information. We also find that analysts from more reputed brokerages are more

likely to herd than analysts from less reputed brokerages. This finding supports the

prediction of Prendergast and Stole (1996) that “new comers,” which in our context

represents analysts from less prestigious brokerages, are more likely to stand out from the

crowd than well established agents.

         Media accounts and some academic papers have suggested that analysts’ herding

tendencies could introduce noise into prices because the market could potentially

overweight the common mistakes of the herd. However, our results indicate that the

market anticipates analysts’ tendencies to herd, and the market price reaction on the

revision date accounts for such herding tendencies. Therefore, we doubt that herding by

analysts when they make recommendations would have any destabilizing effect on prices.

Proof of Proposition 1a
Let
                         X = Pr[ P1 > P0 | S 0 ] .                                         (A.1)
The condition for issuing an upgrade is given by;

and thus
                                                          γ                 1

                                                     (P − S0 )
Since P1 | S 0 ~ N ( S 0 , σ η2 ) , Eq. (A.3) implies 0        < −k . Therefore, the analyst
                                                                   ση

issuing downgrades can be similarly determined.

Proof of Proposition 1b
The expected stock price conditional on observing an upgrade is given by;
                                                         ∞

From the market’s perspective, S 0 = P0 + ε + η so that S 0 ~ N ( P0 , σ ε2 + σ η2 ) .

Then, based on the properties of the normal distribution, it can be shown that,
                                                                            φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
  E ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + kσ η ) = P0 + σ εη λ [k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )] = P0 + σ εη
                                                                         [1 − Φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]            (A.6)

                                                                                      φ

Similarly, the expected stock price conditional on observing a downgrade is given by;

 Proof of Proposition 2a

 Let X = Pr[ P1 > P0 | S 0 ] . Now, the analyst issues an upgrade if:

   α + ( β + γ ) X − γ − δ ( Recnew − Consensus) 2 > α − δ ( Recold − Consensus) 2                                (A.8)
 Therefore,
                                   γ     δ [( Rec new − Consensus ) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus ) 2 ]
 X = Pr[ P1 > P0 | S 0 ] >             +                                                           (A.9)
                            (β + γ )                             (β + γ )
 Define θ such that:
                  γ          δ [( Rec new − Consensus ) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus ) 2 ]
  Φ(k + θ ) =             +                                                            .          (A.10)
              (β + γ )                                  (β + γ )
                                                                         ( P0 − S 0 )
 Since P1 | S 0 ~ N ( S 0 , σ η2 ) , Eq. (A.10) implies that                            < −(k + θ ) . Therefore, an
                                                                                 ση
 analysts upgrades his recommendation when S0 > P0 + (k + θ )ση . The optimal rule for

 downgrades can be similarly determined.

 Proof of Proposition 2b
 The expected stock price conditional on observing an upgrade is now given by;
                                                                   ∞
P0,up | Upgrade = E ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + (k + θ )σ η ) =              ∫S      0 f ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + (k + θ )σ η )dS 0 (A.11)
                                                            p0 + ( k +θ k )σ η

 By Proposition 1b, it follows that,
  E ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + (k + θ )σ η ) = P0 + σ εη λ [(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                                                    φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                                   = P0 + σ εη
                                                 [1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]
                                                                                                                (A.12)

 Similarly, the expected stock price conditional on a downgrade is:
  E ( S 0 |S 0 < P0 − (k + θ )σ η ) = P0 − σ εη λ [(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                                                    φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
                                   = P0 − σ εη
                                                 [1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]
                                                                                                                (A.13)



 Proof of Proposition 3a
 A move away from the consensus implies that
 [( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] is positive. Suppose that analysts have

 incentives to herd so that δ > 0 . Then, from Eq. (A.10), θ > 0 . Similarly, a movement




                                                                                                                      29
towards the consensus implies that θ < 0. Based on the properties of normal distribution,
it follows that,
                                     λ ' (α ) = λ (α )[λ (α ) − α ] ∈ (0,1) .          (A.14)
Thus, according to Eq. (A.12) and (A.13), positive θ implies a higher expected price for
upgrades and a lower expected price for downgrades and negative θ leads to a lower
expected price for upgrades and a higher expected price for downgrades


Proof of Proposition 3b
Let
         ∆ = ( Recnew − Recold ) ,                                                     (A.15)
and
         Deviation = ( Recnew − Consensus) .                                           (A.16)
Then, it follows that
        [( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] = ∆[2 ⋅ Deviation − ∆ ]   (A.17)


For upgrades, Deviation would increase as the analyst first moves towards the consensus
and then away from it for given levels of ∆ and Consensus. Since ∆ > 0 , an increases in
Deviation implies an increase in [( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] . From

Eq. (A.10), this implies an increase θ when δ > 0 . It follows from Eq. (A.12) and
(A.14) that an increase in θ implies a higher expected price.


For downgrades, Deviation would decrease as the analyst first moves towards the
consensus and then away from it. Since ∆ < 0 , a decrease in Deviation implies an
increase in [( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] . Then, based on Eq. (A.10),

(A.13) and (A.14), this implies increases in θ and a lower expected price when δ > 0 .


Thus, Deviation and expected returns would be positively related for both upgrades and
downgrades. The opposite result obtains when analysts have incentives to anti-herd (i.e.
if δ < 0 ).

analyst. Within upgrades and downgrades, we further classify them into revisions that move towards the consensus and those that move
away from it. Consensus is the average of all outstanding recommendations with at least two analysts following the stock as of the day
before the revision, excluding the revising analyst. A revision is categorized as moving towards the consensus if the absolute value of
deviation from consensus is larger for the new recommendation than for the old recommendation. The abnormal return is the raw return
minus the CRSP value-weighted index return. Day 0 is the revision date and the other days in the column headings are the number of trading
days from the revision date. The average returns reported in bold face are statistically significant at least at the five percent level (absolute
value of t-statistics greater than 1.96). We use heteroskedasticity and serial correlation consistent standard errors to compute the t-statistics.
The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

consensus recommendation the day before the revision excluding the revising analyst’s recommendation . The char _ dummyi , j ,t in Panel A
equals 1 if the analyst has more than three years of experience, and zero otherwise; in Panel B it equals 1 if the number of analysts employed
by the brokerage is one of the top 20 the previous year, and zero otherwise; in Panel C it equals 1 if the standard deviation of the consensus
recommendation prior to the revision is greater than 0.75, which is the average dispersion in the sample. We obtain the regression estimates
using quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions. The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

Robustness Checks

         This table estimates average herding across multiple recommendation revisions for
various sub-samples. Panel A excludes all revisions made within a window three days before and
three days after the earnings announcement dates, panel B includes only those revisions that are
made at least five days after the most recent revision made by a different analyst, and panel C
excludes revisions that move across the consensus recommendation level. All specifications are
based on quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions where the coefficient and t-stats are based on time-
series averages and standard errors and require at least two analysts with active recommendations
before the revision. The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

Table 7

Herding and Recommendation Levels

          This table reports the estimates of the following cross sectional regression:
          ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) + d H × Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t + e H × StrongBuyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H
where t is the forecast revision date, ABRi (t , t + H ) is the H-period abnormal return following the revision date, I is the indicator variable for
upgrades ( I = +1) and downgrades ( I = −1) , New _ reci , j ,t is the revised individual recommendation on date t and Con _ reci ,t −1 is the
consensus recommendation the day before the revision excluding the revising analyst’s recommendation. Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t is a dummy
variable equal to1 if the new recommendation is a sell or a strong sell and 0 otherwise, and StrongBuy i , j ,t is a dummy variable equal to1 if the
new recommendation is a strong buy and 0 otherwise. We obtain the regression estimates using quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions. The sample
period is November 1993 to December 2005.
