1. The old and the new Mezzogiorno

The economic problems of the Italian Mezzogiorno are well known and have been extensively

studied by many authors.1 Despite massive aid from the north, the economy of the south does

not seem to catch up with the north. Its economy lags behind and is unable to develop the kind

of productivity that would enable it to successfully compete with other regions in Europe. By

way of contrast, the north has performed marvellously. Lombardia, Emilia Romagna,

Trentino-Alto Adige and Valle d‚ÄôAosta are now among the highly productive regions of

Europe, matching regions like Rheinland-Pfalz, Haute-Normandie or Noord-Brabant.2

        There now seems to be a second Mezzogiorno ‚Äì East Germany. After German

reunification many authors asked themselves whether a comparison between East Germany

and the Mezzogiorno was justified, but they typically came to a negative conclusion.3 The

initial growth performance of east Germany after unification was so promising that a

comparison with the Mezzogiorno seemed far fetched. Today, however, time has brought

more evidence. The evidence shows that the fundamental differences between Italy‚Äôs south

and Germany‚Äôs east that some authors had expected initially, have not materialised. In fact, as

this paper will argue, there is a striking similarity between the two regions both in terms of the

characteristics and the causes of the economic problems from which they suffer.

2. Historic Differences and Present Similarities



Different Histories

In order to place the problem in the right perspective, a look at the history is useful. From a

historical point of view it would be hard to find any two regions in Europe that were as

different as east Germany and southern Italy were before the second world war.4 At the time,

southern Italy was a predominantly agrarian region with an agricultural share in the work

force of about 56% in 1936, and its per capita income was 60% of that of the rest of Italy, the

Centro Nord5. East Germany (using today‚Äôs definition), on the other hand was more

productive than west Germany with an agricultural share of only 22,1% and a per capita

income of 27% above that of West Germany. In fact, east Germany was most productive

region of continental Europe, hosting some of the world‚Äôs most advanced firms in the areas of

precision engineering, optics, chemicals and aircraft production.

  In this paper we define east Germany as the former territory of the GDR (East Berlin, Mecklenburg-
Vorpommern, Sachsen, Th√ºringen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Brandenburg) and west Germany as the remaining parts of
Germany in today‚Äôs boundaries. Similarly, southern Italy (the Italian Mezzogiorno) is defined as the provinces of
Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicilia and Sardegna and ‚Äúnorthern‚Äù Italy or the
‚ÄúCentro Nord‚Äù as the rest of Italy, again in its current borders.

       After the war, east Germany became the industrial showcase of the eastern bloc, with

an enormously high labour share of manufacturing in the order of 34%. By contrast, the

corresponding manufacturing share in southern Italy was only about 20%.



Low per Capita Output, Low Growth and no Visible Convergence

Given these historical differences, it would be more than surprising if the two regions were

similar today. Yet, they are. The most striking similarity is shown in figure 1 which illustrates

the labour productivity aggregates in the two regions relative to the rest of their respective

countries for all years for which common data are available. While south Italian labour
                                                                                                               6

productivity has been slightly below 60% with a declining tendency over the period

considered, east German productivity was very low in 1991, but increased rapidly thereafter.

This rapid increase induced the initial optimism among the politicians and some economists.

Currently, however, no further increase is visible. Since 1996, where aggregate labour

productivity peaked at 59%, the level has not increased any further and is even declining. In

fact, it seems that both Mezzogiornos‚Äô productivity figures have been unable to permanently

exceed the 60%-level. Of course, no one knows whether this is mere chance and how the

future will be. However, at present, no change in this situation is visible.

  In 2000, Germany‚Äôs system of national accounts has been changed in a way which makes it more difficult to
trace the productivity figures back to the former communist region, because the two parts of Berlin are no longer
distinguished. The quoted figures were recalculated from the new GEP figures on the basis of the old borders by
the ifo Institute.

over the last four years, the respective regions have drifted away from the more productive

parts of their countries rather that converging with them.

        The time period for east Germany is too short to be sure about a lack of convergence.

However, in the Italian case, sufficient information is available. In the 1950ies the Italian

Mezzogiorno had shown a substantial amount of growth, allowing for some sort of catching

up process. However, thereafter, from about 1960 ‚Äì the introduction of the ‚Äúerga omnes‚Äù

wages rule -- no further convergence has been visible. To provide harder evidence of this fact,

we applied a statistical test based on unit root procedures looking at the time path in the cross

regional differences in real per capita income. Taking all available data from 1970 ‚Äì 1998 into

account, we reject the hypothesis of convergence. In fact, we find that there is a significant

time trend in the output differences which implies that the two regions have been drifting

apart. The appendix explains the details of our test.



Transfer Economies

The low productivity of the two Mezzogiornos would result in huge income differentials

relative to the more developed parts of their countries, if the two regions had to live on their

own. However, substantial fiscal transfers via central budgets have effectively reduced the

size of these differentials.

              In Germany, the main fiscal transfers flow via the social security system since

unification not only brought the same currency and the same economic laws, but also the

integration into the same social health, pension and unemployment systems. More than 60%

of all transfers fall into these categories. In addition, the Solidarpakt Ost defined a financial

transfer among the L√§nder in the order of 32% of the total or currently about 25 billion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

              Germany had hesitated to increase taxes to finance these transfers. It is true that there

is a solidarity tax charged on everyone, but its revenue is only 10.25 billion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !      "       #   $   %           &




more than 14% of the annual total. Most of the funds channelled to the east have been

borrowed in the capital market. This is probably the major reason for the high German interest

rates and the breakdown of the EMS in 1992 (see Sinn 1999), and it explains why Germany

       In Italy, there are various channels for transfers from the north to the south, but as Italy

is not a federal state, the transfers are not regularly documented. In 1987, the Bank of Italy

estimated the net transfers from the Centro-Nord to the Mezzogiorno to amount to 35 bill.

Euro. Galli and Onado (1990) estimate the transfers to amount to 43 bill. Euro in 1988.

Although there is the Patto di Stabilita Interno which resembles the German L√§nder-

Finanzausgleich, Faini and Galli (1993) argue that most funds are channelled in a hidden way

through the federal budget. Minimum pensions, the national health service, unemployment

insurance   and public expenditures which are financed by the federal government are

probably the major redistribution mechanisms. Faini and Galli (1993) further point out that

financial subsidies to investment, first introduced in the 1960s, have reduced the cost of long

term capital in Southern manufacturing by about 40%. There are even more indirect transfers

than these. For example, public firms have to invest most of their funds in southern Italy and,

according to Alesina et. al. (1999), public employment also plays a major role in the

redistribution process. In fact, while the shares of employees in the government sector are

between 12% and 15% in Central Nord, the Mezzogiorno has a share of 22 %.7 Expressed as

public employees per resident in working age (between 15 and 65 years of age), the numbers

are less dramatic, but point in the same direction. While in the north of Italy, there are 6.5

public employees per resident, the equivalent figure for the south is 8 - thus public

employment in the South is about 20% higher than in the north. By contrast, east Germany

has only a government share which is three percentage points more than in the west. Recently,

the internal Italian subsidies have gone down and have partly been replaced with EU

subsidies, which in 1999 amounted to about 3 billion   C   D

Note: The official absorption statistics for Germany are available only until 1994. In the subsequent years,
absorption has been calculated from the official GDP and transfer figures by adding an estimate of the private
capital import based on Ifo‚Äôs investment data base.



            The public transfers and private capital movements made it possible for the people

living in the Mezzogiornos to consume more than they produced. Figure 3 shows the time

paths of aggregate absorption ‚Äì the resources consumed by private households, firms and the

government ‚Äì and GDP. The difference between these two variables is the import surplus.

The figures also demonstrate, how much of this surplus is financed with public transfers and

private capital flows.8 In the east German case, the import surplus is currently about 46% of

east German GDP, and in the Italian case its is about 12% of south Italian GDP.

          The two regions‚Äô dependency on resource imports is extraordinary. Figure 4 ranks

different countries and regions of the world with regard to their respective net import shares in

GDP. It can be seen that east Germany, in particular, contrasts sharply with the others

depicted in the figure. Southern Italy, on the other hand resembles economies like Israel and

          Obviously, the south Italian reliance on external resources is much smaller than the

east German one if compared to the south Italian GDP. However, southern Italy is relatively

much larger than east Germany. While east Germany is inhabited by 18% of the German

population, southern Italy includes 36% of the total Italian population. Moreover, the private

capital import to southern Italy is less important than the private capital import to east

Germany which is still is heavily subsidised. These two aspects explain why the order of

magnitude of the resource transfers appears more similar when the transfers are related to the

GDP of the paying region rather than that of the recipient region. While internal German

public and private transfers comprise 6.2% of the west German GDP, the internal Italian

transfers amount to 4.2% of north Italian GDP.

          It is not surprising that transfer economies have high incomes despite their low

productivity. In 1997 east German disposable household income per capita was 85% of the

west German one, and southern Italy‚Äôs disposable income per capita was 65% of the

respective figure in Centro Nord. Pensions are even 10% higher in east than in west Germany

because more women were working in the communist state and because the GDR pension

claims had been converted with overly generous terms.9



3. The Reasons

The lack of productivity convergence between the Mezzogiornos and the more developed

north of Italy and west of Germany cannot easily be explained with a primitive two-factor

variant of the neo-classical model. Operating in the same country implies the same legal

system and full access to the technological knowledge which is available in the more

developed region. Thus, the production function should be the same and, with constant returns




9
    See Nierhaus (1999).
                                                                                                         14

to scale, capital and labour movements imply equal factor prices. Equal factor prices, in turn,

imply equal capital intensities and equal labour productivities.

         When the neo-classical model is enriched with location preferences of the population

and capital adjustment costs, it will not imply an immediate convergence, but a gradual

convergence with two sided guest-worker flows during the adjustment phase, which in the

end will also lead to a full equalisation of factor prices and productivities.10 So, why is it then

that convergence does not occur?



Locational Disadvantages

To find an answer, a yet more extended version of the neo-classical model could be

considered where land and similar idiosyncratic location factors are taken into account, which

cannot be altered. If a region has a worse location than another one, say, because its transport

costs to existing centres are high and/or its infrastructure is bad, it will have a lower ‚Äútotal‚Äù

factor productivity with regard to capital and labour. In the case of location preferences of the

labour force, this will imply a low capital intensity of production, a low labour productivity

and low wages.

        Such a situation could apply in the two Mezzogiornos which are both located at the

outskirts of the EU and are still lacking in adequate quality of their local infrastructure. If it

prevails and if a steady state growth path with a constant regional structure prevails,

investment per capita will be lower than in the rest of the country. The lower level of per

capita investment will not have to show up in terms of construction investment, because local

land prices are low, but in terms of low levels of equipment investment which consists mainly

of traded commodities.




10
   See Sinn (2000). Ordinary neo-classical growth models of the Solow or ‚Äûendogenous growth‚Äú variety are not
well suited to studying regional convergence, because they abstract from labour migration and assume an
internal capital formation from domestic savings rather than capital movements.
                                                                                                                                    15

                Figure 5 illustrates the time paths of construction and equipment investment in the two

  Mezzogiornos. The figure shows that east Germany is performing much better than southern

  Italy, with an impressive level of construction investment and substantially more equipment

  investment. However, recently even the east German equipment investment per capita has

  fallen significantly below the west German value, indicating a clear halt in convergence of the

  Unemployment

  Roughly speaking, the observed level of investment seems to be compatible with the neo-

  classical model thus described. Note, however, that the neo-classical model would predict full
                                                                                               16

employment. The low wage would imply a low population density, since many natives would

work and live in other regions, but it would not imply unemployment. As table 3 shows, this

prediction is not compatible with reality, though. In the Italian Mezzogiorno, unemployment

is 22%, but in the north it is only 6,5%, and the respective figures for east and west Germany

are 17,2% and 8,2%. Obviously the two Mezzogiornos do have severe employment problems.

       The neo-classical model can explain unemployment with wages that exceed the

market clearing level, and under the assumptions made it would be sufficient for such an

outcome if the Mezzogiorno wage were equal to the wage in the region with the better

location conditions. The high wage creates unemployment, which, because of the Harris-

Todardo argument, prevails in a migration equilibrium. It drives capital away, and although it

tends to increase the capital intensity inside the firms, it further reduces the aggregate capital

intensity and the aggregate labour productivity in terms of the number of people in working

age.



Proxy Negotiations

The question remains why wages have been set at a level above the market clearing wage.

Surprisingly, the answers for the two Mezzogiornos are very similar indeed.

       In Italy, regions could set their wages separately during the fifties and early sixties,

and this was the time when the south showed signs of catching up with the north. However, in
                                                                                              17

the late sixties, trade unions gained power (in the autunno caldo movement) and succeeded in

equalising the wages throughout Italy in collective nation-wide wage agreements.11 The

system of nation-wide wage formation has been operating since then and has effectively

equalised union wages in the north and the south. In 1999, the system was modified by

reintroducing the possibility of regional wage differentiation, but as of today this modification

has not had any influence.

           In east Germany, wages were only about one third of those in the west after the

German currency union in 1990, but the subsequent wage negotiations brought about a rapid

wage adjustment, even though Germany‚Äôs collective wage bargaining is carried out on a

regional rather than national level. The reason why the German negotiations nevertheless

resulted in a wage adjustment lies in the fact that it was the west German competitors of the

east German firms that had effectively taken over the task of negotiating the east German

wages. In 1991, when the decisive wage settlements took place, the Treuhand agency had just

started to privatise the ex-communist economy, and at that time there were no private

entrepreneurs who could have participated in the wage negotiations. Thus west German

employers stepped in as proxy negotiators. Moreover, the newly founded unions were under

full western control. Thus, in the negotiations westerners sat at both sides of the tables, and

they unanimously agreed to fully equalise the union wages as quickly as possible, which

basically meant tripling them. They even agreed to unusual five-year contracts which fully

specified the wage equalisation path in order to bind future east German firms and to

effectively prevent them from threatening their markets.

           It is unclear to the authors whether similar motives were driving the collective

negotiations in Italy, too. However, it seems plausible to assume, given that the wage had to

be uniform, that the employers and unions of the north had a much larger influence on the

determination of the Italian wages than those of the south and that they followed their own

objectives, disregarding the problems of the Mezzogiorno.




Overdrawn Wages

The implications of the Italian and German wage negotiations are shown in figure 6, which

gives the time paths of hourly wage cost in manufacturing for different countries and regions.

In this figure, the west German wage cost in manufacturing is set equal to 100, since it is the

highest in the world. All other wage costs are expressed in relation to the German one.

                The figure shows that east German wages have increased dramatically in the last

  decade although a full equalisation of actual wages has not taken place. Before unification,

  the east German wage cost in manufacturing was 7% of the west German wage, when

  calculated at the then prevailing exchange rate. Now it is over 70%. Wages were quadrupled

  by the one-to-one currency conversion in 1990 because this was an effective revaluation by

  the factor 4.3. And thereafter they were tripled in the proxy negotiations which did not,

  however, the for reasons explained below, fully affect the actual wages. No economy in the

  world could have survived the a ten-fold increase in the relative wage that was experienced by

  east Germany in only ten years. It should be stressed that the figure refers to the

  manufacturing sector whose wages are more moderate than those of others because the
                                                                                            20

competitive pressure is higher. In the government sector and elsewhere actual wages have

reached about 85% of those in the west.

        That the east German wage policy was beyond all economic reason, can best be seen

by comparing the east German wages with those of other countries. The figure shows that the

east German wages surpassed the Irish wages as early as 1991 although the east German

economy had nearly completely collapsed in a depression that was much more severe than the

great depression at the end of the twenties. In 1992 when the German depression still was

pronounced the east German wage curve cut the US wage curve, and in 1992/1993 it even cut

the south and north Italian wage curves. The Swedish wage curve was hit in 1995, but due to

a recovery of the Swedish crown east German wages have remained below the Swedish ones

since then.

        The Italian wages were, on average, at about 80% of the West German wages in the

beginning of the nineties when a thousand lira cost about 1,40 deutschmarks, but with the

collapse of the EMS in 1992 the value of the lira began to sink down to a minimum of about

0,82 deutschmarks in 1995. Also the Scala mobile was abolished in that year which allowed

real wages to fall. Both effects reduced the wages to about 50% of the German wages and

boosted the competitiveness of the Italian economy. Since then the south and north Italian

wages have come up again and are now at 62% and 72%, respectively, of the west German

ones.

        Through the period considered the wage gap between northern and southern Italy has

remained at about 15% of the northern level. As in Germany, this gap is probably due to the

fact that north Italian wages exceed the nation-wide union wages on average, while south

Italian wages are rather close to the union wages.

        It is remarkable, though, that the wage gap between east and west Germany is about

twice as large as the gap between the two Italian regions considered. In west Germany there is

a gap between union and actual wages of about 15% . With a zero gap in the east, this in itself
                                                                                            21

would have resulted in a wage convergence to 85% of the western level, just as in Italy. The

reason why the gap is much larger than this lies in the fact that east German firms found a

way to avoid the union wages altogether. Most of the new firms founded in east Germany

after 1991 decided not to join the employers unions in order not to be covered by the initial

wage agreements, and many other firms have simply violated the wage contracts with the tacit

agreement of the unions. Many firms went bankrupt and were founded again as new legal

entities in order to circumvent the binding power of the collective wage contracts. The result

is that currently about 85% of east German firms and more than 55% of east German

employees have wage contracts below the union wages. The economy has found a way to

partly heal the initial mistakes. Nevertheless, the initial wage agreements and the supportive

public statements by politicians have been able to catapult the east German wages to where

they are now and if only for psychological reasons it will be hardly possible to return to more

moderate wages in the near future.

       As was shown in figure 1, the two Mezzogiornos both have an aggregate productivity

which is less than 60% of the respective productivity in the more advanced parts of the two

countries. Thus, it seems, the wages should also stand at the 60%. However they do not. The

east German wages are more than 70% of the west German ones and the south Italian wages

are 85% of the north Italian ones. This is the problem

       That the wages are too high becomes particularly obvious when the Irish situation is

considered. Thirty years ago, when Ireland joined the EU, Ireland had a GDP per capita which

was only a quarter of that of Germany. Today it has reached about 90 percent of the German

GDP. Ireland is the fastest growing region in the EU with real growth rates of about 8% per

year. The Irish GDP per capita of the population in working age is currently 80% more than

the respective figure in southern Italy and 46% more than the east German value, but the Irish

wage cost per hour is only 85% of the respective south Italian figure and only 76% of the
                                                                                               22

east German one. It is clear why Ireland is a much better location for mobile capital than

southern Italy or east Germany and why its general economic performance is so much better.



4. Dutch Disease in Italy and Germany

Despite the possibility of explaining the combination of low productivity, high wages and a

lack of convergence as a long-run equilibrium phenomenon, it is not clear that the situation

will always be like that. After all, as already mentioned, Italy has allowed regional wage

differentiation in 1999, and in east Germany an increasing number of firms simply quit the

employers‚Äô associations. This new development will bring more dynamism to the labour

markets whose consequences will have to be guarded.

       Unfortunately, however, there is at least one important reason why optimistic

expectations do not seem to be justified at this stage. This is the existence of the welfare state

which, as was explained above, is channelling vast amounts of resources into the two

retarding regions. The welfare transfers are partly motivated by the wish to compensate for

the regional disadvantages, partly they are the seemingly self-evident implication of nation-

wide social security systems. But whatever their causes, they effectively change the incentive

structure in the economy and draw human resources away from productive activities towards

others for which the government is willing to pay. This may involve rent seeking with public

projects and criminal activities, but the most important element undoubtedly is the direct

repercussion on the labour market. In Germany, early retirement schemes, unemployment

benefits, retraining programmes and, in particular, social welfare, have to be mentioned,

which all have effectively increased the reservation wage and pulled parts of the labour force

away from the regular labour market. In Italy the situation is very similar, but the emphasis is

on different aspects of the welfare system.

       In Italy the pension system has a particularly strong diverting effect on the labour

market, because the rules under which early retirement is possible are very generous. While in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      23

Germany two thirds of the population between 55 and 64 years of age are still working, in

Italy, this share is only 43%. On the other hand, unemployment benefits are paid in Italy only

for a relatively short time period of up to 6 months. In Germany, the maximum number of

months is 32, which is two and a half years.

       In Germany, social aid programmes are a particular problem since they implicitly

define a minimum wage income below which no one is willing to work. In east Germany, an

individual receives about 9,416   T   U   V   W   X   V   Y   W   Z   Y   [   \   Y   ]   Y   ^   _   `   X   a   ]   ]   _   b   V   W   V   c   V   _   b   V   d   e   f       Z   g   h           h           i       Z   Y       [           \       _   [           j       V       d       k




Germany the figures are even slightly higher. In a country where the annual average wage

income net of taxes and social security contributions is about 16,000                                                                                                         i               l   m       n   o       n           p       q   r       s   t       n   o       u       t       n




definitely too high. It is impossible to run a market economy when the minimum income

guaranteed through the welfare system is equal to the average net-of-tax wage income.

       To gain a more systematic overview of the problem, figure 7 offers an international

comparison which contrasts the social aid level for a family of five with the respective

country‚Äôs or region‚Äôs average net wage income. The figure confirms the impression that the

problem is particularly severe in east Germany, where social aid is at a record level. In Italy,

by contrast, the share of wages in social aid is rather small by international standards.

           With regard to the private industry the disincentives created by the public transfers to

southern Italy and east Germany are very similar to the Dutch disease phenomenon which was

intensely discussed by economists in the early eighties.12 If a country detects a large quantity

of natural resources, which it can sell on the world market, the domestic currency tends to

appreciate, and with rising wages some of the labour force is relocated to the resource sector.

The international competitiveness of the manufacturing sector falls, and resource exports

crowd out commodity exports produced by that sector.

           It is true that none of the two Mezzogiornos enjoy an abundance of natural resources,

and they do not have a separate currency either. The effects observed in the Dutch disease

case nevertheless reappear. For one thing, it does not matter whether a region receives a gift

of nature or a gift from another region. The inflow of financial funds has similar

consequences. For another, the terms of trade effect does not need a formal currency

appreciation. It may also be brought about by internal price adjustments.

           In the case of the two Mezzogiornos the various types of idleness ‚Äì from retirement

via sickness and unemployment to laziness -- which are financed with the social transfers are

similar to the occupation in the resource sector, and the appreciation shows up in the increase

of the wage rate and the prices of land and non-traded commodities resulting therefrom. These

effects may perpetuate the problems discussed in the previous section despite the new

flexibility of wages resulting from most recent developments.

           As was mentioned, in Holland the resource sales crowded out some of the export-

intensive manufacturing industry. Table 4 shows that this aspect too, has its analogy in the

two Mezzogiornos. The table compares the sectoral composition of employment in the four

regions considered and reports the differences in the respective percentage points of

employment shares. It shows that, relative to the north, southern Italy lacks 7 percentage

points of manufacturing employment and, relative to the west, east Germany lacks about 10

percentage points. The latter is particularly alarming if it is considered that, during the

existence of the GDR, the east German manufacturing share exceeded the west German one

by 4.4 percentage points, being one of the highest in the world.13

        This completes the analysis of the causes of the Mezzogiorno problem. It is debatable

whether the term ‚Äúdisease‚Äù was really appropriate for the Dutch restructuring process, because

this process manifested a useful reaction to the new resource situation. However, in the case

of southern Italy and east Germany, the term clearly is appropriate for describing what is

going on. The artificial wage equalisation and voluminous transfers for non-market activities

is a dangerous blend of interventions in the market economy that will prolong the sickness of

the Italian and German Mezzogiornos.



5. The Cures

If there is a disease, a cure is needed. One obvious cure is, as explained, decentralised wage

bargaining, and it seems that the first steps towards such a system have already been taken in

the two countries. It is not enough, however, that the negotiations are shifted from the centre

to the provinces. Germany has a system which is based on provinces, and yet this system

proved unable to correct the initial mistakes in the proxy negotiations. An arguably better
                                                                                             27

system is one where only wage guidelines are negotiated on the province level, and where the

single companies would then have the right to agree on lower wages if they wished. Thereby,

many marginal firms which are at the brink of bankruptcy could be rescued, and new firms

could more easily get started. In east Germany, the association of the metal and electric

industries of Thuringia has recently negotiated such a revolutionary new wage contract. This

might be a good example for others.

       Decentralised bargaining would not help very much, however, unless the social system

is reformed. In Germany, and to a lesser extent in Italy, social aid is a major problem for the

labour market. Currently the system is designed such that the government pays people for

being idle, and, as explained, this fact implies that social aid is too high a lower boundary on

wages. The alternative is to pay people for working, as is done with the Earned Income Tax

Credit of the United States which recently was also introduced in Finland. In Germany the

government takes away one deutschmark of aid if the individual earns one additional

deutschmark. In the US, the government instead adds 40 cents to every dollar earned up to a

certain income target. Unlike the German system this system does not impose a lower

boundary on wages but, to the contrary, induces people to actively seek jobs even if they are

badly paid, because they can then claim more money from the government. This reduces the

wage for unqualified labour and creates jobs. The jobs are created everywhere, in households

and firms even without more capital formation. However, when wages are lower, it can be

expected that more capital will flow into the region. The overall labour productivity in the

sense of GDP per population in working age increases, and at least some productivity

convergence can take place.

               While the American system is run on such a low scale that it was unable to

avoid the problem of the working poor, Italy and Germany could install more generous

systems, fitting their social democratic traditions. This system would not necessarily be more

expensive than the current one. In fact, it can easily be shown that the government will save
                                                                                              28

money if the labour demand elasticity is above unity and a total income for unqualified labour

equal to the current level of social aid is aimed at. Conversely, if the government is willing to

spend the same amount of money on social aid as today, the degree of target achievement for

social policies will increase if all people whose wages fall because of the new system receive

social aid.

        In Italy such a system is less urgent than in Germany not only because social aid is

lower relative to wages, but also because black market activities seem to be more common

among the recipients of social aid. Black market work is better than no work. Yet, a system

that induces black market activities is certainly inferior to one which relies on official labour

contracts, because it is unable to fully exploit the benefits of specialisation and economies of

large scale.

        This remark also applies to the Italian pension system which is hardly sustainable in a

country which has the lowest birth rates in the world. The necessary pension cuts enforced by

the changing demographic composition of the population could easily be enacted by

increasing the retirement age instead of cutting the pension per year. Policemen do not have to

retire at 50 to become black market employees of lawyers thereafter.

        Apart from decentralised bargaining and the Earned Income Tax Credit, it would

probably make sense in Germany and Italy to target the public transfers to infrastructure

investment than to social support, because this would help overcome the locational

disadvantages which are the ultimate reason why wage equalisation policies have been so

harmful.

        In 1989 the Italian Prime Minister Andreotti had argued that he liked Germany so

much that he preferred having two Germany rather than one. But this applies to Italy as well.

Indeed, had there been two Germany and two Italy, the kinds of problems studied in this

paper would not have arisen, because neither the artificial wage equalisation nor the

problematic resource transfers would have occurred. However, we hope that the reader will
                                                                                         29

agree with the authors that national unity is a value beyond economics for which it may well

be worth sacrificing five percent of GDP. We are sure that the Italians will not demolish

Garibaldi‚Äôs statutes and the Germans will maintain those of Bismarck. After all, there are

possibilities of curing the problems as we have shown.

                                                  Appendix

         A statistical analysis of the time series properties of output differences between

                            the Centro Nord and the Mezzogiorno



This appendix discusses the question of whether the Mezzogiorno converges with northern
Italy. Figure 1 clearly illustrates that the per capita incomes of the Centro Nord and
Mezzogiorno of Italy are far from having converged to the same levels. This impression is
confirmed by Boltho et al (1997) who show that there has been a catching up process of the
Mezzogiorno during the fifties, but not during the subsequent decades. They show in a cross
section of Mezzogiorno regions that initial conditions only mattered for the growth
performance during the 1950‚Äôs, thus proving evidence of beta-convergence as defined by
Barro (1991). The results by Boltho et al (1997) are confirmed by Boldrin and Canova (2000)
for several less developed regions in Europe.
       However, what is less obvious is whether the time path of the regional differences is
moving towards a dynamic steady state where per capita incomes are different or towards a
process of divergence in the long run. We will show that the latter is the case, i.e. the two
parts of the country are indeed drifting apart.
       We apply the recently developed time series approach of Bernard and Durlauf (1996).
According to these authors, two series have reached a dynamic steady state if the long term
forecasts made at a given date are equal. The two series have thus converged if


                            Lim E ( y cn (t + T ) ‚àí y mez (t + T ) ‚Ñët ) = 0 ,
                            T ‚Üí‚àû




where E denotes the expectations operator, y denotes per capita GDP, t, time and ‚Ñë denotes
the information set a period t. The subscripts cn and mez indicate the Centro Nord and the
Mezzogiorno.
       In practice, the test for this definition of convergence amounts to testing whether the
cross regional differences in real per capita income are a zero mean stationary stochastic
process. This can be done with standard unit root procedures. In order to correct for the small
sample bias, inherent in time series studies based on annual data, we employ finite sample
critical values suggested by Cheung and Lai (1995).
                                                                                                                                                                                         31

                         Previous evidence from time series tests on output convergence is mixed. While
    Bernard and Durlauf (1995) find only little evidence of output convergence, Cheung and
    Garcia Pascual (2000) show that some earlier results of non-convergence are attributable to
    the low power of the unit root test.
                         In the following we formally test for the presence of a unit roots or deterministic
    component in the difference of the real per capita income in the Centro Nord and the
    Mezzogiorno of Italy. The augmented Dickey and Fuller (ADF) test allowing for both an
    intercept and a time trend is used. Let X t be the output difference at time t. The ADF test is
    based on the regression equation:


                                                                   ‚àÜ X t = ¬µ 0 + ¬µ 1t + Œ± X t ‚àí1 + Œ± 1 ‚àÜ X t ‚àí1 + ... + Œ± p ‚àÜ X t ‚àí p + Œµ t ,


y    z   {   |   {   }     ~      ¬Ä   ¬Å   ¬Ç   ¬É   ~   ¬Ñ      ¬Ä    ~   ¬É   ¬É   ¬Ç   ¬Ñ   ¬Ç   ¬Ü   ¬á   ¬Ç   ¬à   ¬â   ¬Ç   ¬Ñ   ¬ä   ¬Ä   ¬à   ¬Ñ   ¬ä   ¬Ü




                                                                                                                                                Œµ t is an error term. The Akaike information
    criterion (AIC) is used to determine p, the lag parameter. We start with the most general
    model as given above and subsequently drop insignificant parameters. The results of the
    regression are reported in table 1 for the aggregate production and 1 a to 1 c for three major
    sub-sectors.
                         The clear significance of the constant in table 1, ¬µ 0 , reflects the difference in the
    levels, which are obvious from figure 1. This would be enough to reject the convergence
    hypothesis according to the definition by Bernard and Durlauf (1996). In a less strict sense,
    one could still interpret the presence of a constant as evidence in favor of conditional
    convergence. However, we also reject this concept of convergence, because we cannot reject
    the null hypothesis of a unit root in the series, when looking at the Augmented Dickey Fuller
    (ADF) test. This implies that changes in the cross country differences of real per capita GDP
    are permanent shocks and do not die out completely after a certain period of time.
    Furthermore, the time trend, ¬µ 1 , is significant and positive. Although quite small, this implies
    that the two regions are in fact significantly diverging over time.
                         Furthermore, it is of interest to understand which sector in the economy is driving the
    divergence of the two regions. Is the problem of Southern Italy a sectoral problem of the
    agricultural sector, rather than a regional problem, as often claimed? Tables 1a-c report the
    unit root tests for three major sectors of the economies: agriculture, industry and services.
    Overall, the results indicate that the divergence phenomenon between the two regions is not
    explained by the agricultural sector, as often argued, but rather by the divergence of output
                                                                                                               32

per unit of labor in the industry sector - the only one with a significant constant and a
significant time trend in the output differences. Table 1a shows that the output differences in
the agricultural sector and services sector are not significantly different from zero, nor do they
display a significant time trend. For the industry sector, on the other hand, both the constant
and the time trend are significant. The deterioration of the industrial sector is again a common
phenomenon in the Two Mezzogiornos.
