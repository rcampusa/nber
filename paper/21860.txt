EU Accession and Foreign Owned Firms in Bulgaria

JEL No. F15,F21,F23

                                              ABSTRACT

Bulgaria signed the Europe Association Agreement (EAA) in 1995 and the European Union accession
treaty in 2005. Accession had the effect of increasing FDI in Bulgaria. We analyze World Bank BEEPS
firm level data for 2007 to better understand characteristics and performance of foreign firms in Bulgaria.
We estimate linear probability and logit models to determine the likelihood a firm is foreign in Bulgaria.
Regressions show foreign manufacturing firms in Bulgaria are larger than domestic firms, have lower
capital to labor ratios and are more likely to export. Foreign service sector firms are larger than domestic
firms, have lower capital to labor ratios, are more likely to export and to locate in Sofia, the capital.
Our analysis points to limited success of foreign firms in Bulgaria. Regressions show foreign manufacturing
firms do not have higher sales growth and made less capital investments than domestic firms. Foreign
firms in the service sector did not experience faster sales growth or had greater capital investments
than domestic firms. Institutional indicators show manufacturing and service sector firms with larger
fractions of exports relative to sales had a greater number of visits from tax officials. This suggests
that exporting firms receive larger scrutiny than other firms, which represents a challenge to foreign
firms in Bulgaria.

1. Bulgaria’s integration to the European Union

       With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, communist Eastern

European countries transitioned into market economies. One important part of this

transformation was the opening of trade between Eastern and Western Europe. Most

Eastern European countries signed preferential Trade Agreements with the European

Union (EU), and eventually joined the EU.

       Eastern European countries transformed from command and control economies,

where most firms were government owned, to economies that responded to market

supply and demand forces. Laws allowing private ownership and integration to the EU

led to a significant growth in foreign owned firms through privatizations and

establishment of new enterprises.

       In 1992 Bulgaria started negotiations with the European Community and became

an associate member of the EU by signing the Europe Association Agreement (EAA) in

1995. The EAA established free trade between a respective country and the EU through

gradual full elimination of barriers to trade in industrial goods and some liberalization of

trade in agricultural goods. In the case of Bulgaria, first EU eliminated all import duties

and non-tariff measures applied to Bulgarian exports of industrial products on January 1st

1998 and then Bulgaria eliminated all import duties and non-tariff measures on EU

exports of industrial goods on January 1st 2002.1

       In 2005, Bulgaria signed an accession treaty, which came into force in January

2007. Bulgaria’s accession was part of the fifth enlargement of the EU, and was the first

1
 The free trade area agreements within the European Union apply only to industrial
production and not to agricultural goods. There are additional reciprocal concessions for
some agricultural goods, such as tobacco, cheese and wine.
                                              1
time the EU extended beyond the Iron Curtain. The first phase of the enlargement took

place in 2004 when Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,

Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined. During the second phase Bulgaria and Romania

joined (Kalotay, 2008). FDI almost doubled following the signing of the accession treaty

(Sakali, 2013). FDI continued to increase in 2007 but the rate of growth of FDI declined

in subsequent years.

       There has been limited research on the impact of the EU preferential trade

agreement and EU accession on the location, characteristics and performance of foreign

firms in Eastern Europe. In this paper, we analyze firm level data from the World Bank’s

Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) 2007, to better

understand the characteristics and performance of foreign firms in Bulgaria at a transition

point, when Bulgaria was completing the EU accession treaty. We estimate linear

probability and logit models to determine characteristics of foreign firms in Bulgaria. We

analyze economic outcomes of foreign firms and institutional conditions that may play a

role in their performance.



2. Determinants of FDI and Foreign Firms in Bulgaria

       The literature on the determinants of FDI is extensive. Blonigen (2005)

summarizes this literature into research that focuses on factors internal and external to the

firm. Factors internal to the firm include characteristics and price of capital and labor, and

intangible factors include technology and managerial skills. Factors external to the firm

include macroeconomic conditions, exchange rates, taxes, trade policy and institutions.

       EU accession gave Bulgaria a location advantage by expanding the market size



                                              2
firms were able to reach, by improving the availability of resources for infrastructure

development and by providing more political and legal stability. According to Bitzenis

and Vlachos (2013), FDI stock in Bulgaria doubled after EU accession. Four-fifth of the

foreign investment originated in countries from the EU.

       The literature on Bulgaria’s integration to the EU and it’s impact on FDI has

focused on aggregate FDI inflows. Kalotay (2008) analyzed aggregate FDI inflows to

Bulgaria from 1994 to 2006 and finds that that despite lower labor costs and lower

corporate taxes, Bulgaria attracted relatively few efficiency seeking foreign investments,

mostly in garments and footwear industries. These industries are under a global

competitive threat and their growth prospects are limited.

       Sakali (2013) analyzes bilateral FDI inflows from a panel of countries investing in

Bulgaria from 1996 to 2010 and finds that Bulgaria’s trade integration, secondary and

tertiary education and transition reforms increased FDI in Bulgaria. Bitzenis and Vlachos

(2013) also analyze FDI inflows to Bulgaria from 1999 to 2011 and find that the main

drivers of FDI in Bulgaria are the prospects of extra EU exports and the size of the

domestic market.

       The literature has also focused on Bulgaria’s institutional framework and it’s

impact on foreign firms’ ability to do business. According to Bozhilova (2010), Bulgaria

and Romania were slower at adapting and applying open market rules when compared to

other countries that became part of the EU during the 5th enlargement. Moreover,

Bulgaria was the poorest country to join the EU during the 5th enlargement. Bitzenis and

Marangos (2008) surveyed 64 foreign firms on their views of the business environment in

Bulgaria. The authors find that 52% perceived Bulgarian business environment to be high



                                             3
risk, primarily due to an unstable legal framework, large bureaucracy, corruption and

crime.

         More research is needed on FDI in Bulgaria using micro level data to understand

the characteristics of foreign firms, their economic performance and their interaction with

institutions. Firm level data can help us better understand how EU accession has affected

foreign firms in Bulgaria.



3. Data Description

         We use World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey

(BEEPS) for Bulgaria, 2007. This is a stratified random sample of firms outside

agriculture in four major cities in Bulgaria: Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas (See Figure

1). These are the main cities in Bulgaria and major industrial clusters of the country.

They comprise 40% of the country’s population and 23% of the territory. The sample

includes all manufacturing sectors according to ISIC classifications Revision 3.1,

construction (group F), services (groups G and H), transport, storage and communications

(group I) and ISIC 72 Computer and Related Activities. The sample excludes financial

intermediation (group J), real estate and renting activities (group K). Data was collected

on 1,087 firms. Due to omitted variables, our sample includes 856 of those firms.

Additional data was collected from the World Trade Organization on European Union

most favored nations tariff rates by 3 digit level ISIC industry.




                                              4
4. Methodology

We estimate the probability that a firm is foreign based on firm characteristics, EU tariffs,

and location of the firm.

We estimate the following probability model using OLS and logit regressions:

PForeignijk    1Kijk / Lijk   2 LogSalesijk  3 PExportsijk   4 DTariff j 
5 Sizeijk  Ind j  Sofiak   (1)
                              ijk




The subscript ijk refers to firm i in industry j and city k. Where Foreign is a dummy

variable that equals 1 if the firm is foreign and 0 if the firm is domestic. Capital/Labor is

the capital to labor ratio of the firm. LogSales is the natural log of sales of the firm in

2006. PExports is the percent of sales that is exported. DTariff is the difference between

average EU Tariff and Bulgarian Tariffs in 2006.2 The difference captures changes in

the tariff structure when Bulgaria joined the EU.3 Size is a series of dummy variables for

employment size of the firm. The employment categories are small, 0 to 49 employees,

medium, 50 to 249 employees and large, 250 and more employees. The omitted

employment category is small. Ind are industry dummies. There are 6 industry dummies,

three in manufacturing and three in the service sector. They are described in Table 1.

Sofia is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm is located in Sofia and  is a random

component, assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero. We estimated equation

(1) separately for manufacturing and service sector firms.

        To compare the economic performance of domestic and foreign firms, we

estimate the following equation separately for manufacturing and service sector firms:



2 Bulgarian Tariffs were eliminated in 2007 and replaced with EU Tariffs.
3 Average EU and Bulgarian tariffs were estimated for the 3 digit level ISIC industry of
the firm.
                                                  5
DLogSalesijk    1Foreignijk   2 Ageijk  3 Kijk / Lijk   4 Salesijk  5 PExportsijk 
6 DTariff j   7 Size  Ind  Sofiak  ijk (2)
                      ijk     j




Where DLogSalesijk is the difference in the natural log of sales of the firm from 2005 to

2006. Age is the years since the firm was initially established. Other variables in the

regression are the same as in equation (1). We also analyze other firm level economic

outcomes and institutional variables. One of them is capital investments in 2006, a

variable that equals 1 if the firm made capital investments in 2006 and 0 otherwise.

Another one is access to a credit line, which equals 1 if the firm has access to a credit line

and 0 otherwise. We also estimate regressions on time spent on government regulation

and number of times visited by Bulgarian tax officials during the year.

        All regressions measuring economic outcomes and institutional framework faced

by firms in Bulgaria were estimated using OLS with the exception of number of times

visited by tax officials, which was estimated using Poisson regressions. All standard

errors were estimated using clustered standard errors, which were based on industry

affiliation.



5. FDI in Bulgaria

        Figure 1 shows a map of Bulgaria, which includes markers on the four cities

included in the BEEPS survey: Sofia, the capital, Plovdiv, located in the center of the

country, Burgas and Varna located in the Black Sea coast.

        Figure 2 shows net inflows of Foreign Direct Investment in Bulgaria from 1998 to

2014. It shows an increase in foreign direct investment starting in 2002, the year when

Bulgaria eliminated all import duties and non-tariff measures on EU exports of industrial


                                                    6
goods. Bulgaria’s inward FDI grew by approximately 50% from 2005 to 2006

immediately after the country signed the accession treaty. Inward FDI peaked in 2007,

the year of accession, and decreased in subsequent years. By 2010, net FDI inflows were

below the 2002 levels and had little improvement in subsequent years.

       A comparison between FDI inflows in Bulgaria before and after accession to

those of the European Union suggest that FDI flows into Bulgaria were positively

affected by accession in 2007. The timing of FDI inflows in Bulgaria is different from

that of the European Union (28 countries), shown in figure 3.4 While Bulgaria’s FDI was

steadily increasing from 2002 to 2007, FDI in Europe fluctuated, declining from 2002 to

2004 and increasing from 2005 to 2007. From 2007 to 2008, FDI declined in both

Bulgaria and the EU, but unlike the European Union, Bulgaria’s FDI continued its

decline after 2008.

       Figure 4 shows net FDI inflows in Bulgaria by industry from 1998 to 2014. Most

industries experienced an increase in FDI before EU accession and decreased after EU

accession. FDI in Real estate and business services, financial services, and retail and

wholesale trade peaked in 2007 and declined in subsequent years. FDI in Manufacturing

peaked in 2006 and declined in subsequent years. FDI in hotels and restaurants has been

more stables over time.

       The distribution of Bulgaria’s FDI stock by industry for 2006 is shown in Figure

and retail trade, 16% in real estate and business services, 15% in financial services, 8% in

utilities, 7% in transportation and communication, 5% in construction and 5% in other.

Most of the foreign direct investment in Bulgaria originates in Europe. Distribution of

FDI by country of ultimate ownership in 2006 is shown in Figure 6. The largest investor

countries are Austria (17%), Netherlands (10%), Greece (9%) and the United Kingdom

(8%). Other countries with substantial investments in Bulgaria, 4% to 5% each, include

Belgium, Cyprus, Hungary and the United States.



6. Empirical Analysis and Results

         Statistical descriptions of the data are available in Tables 1 and 2. Of the 856

firms, 13.1% are foreign owned (112 firms) (see Table 1). Table 1 shows the distribution

of domestic and foreign firms by industry. Each firm has a two digit SIC Code that was

classified into six industries, three in manufacturing and three in services. Foreign firms

in manufacturing are more likely to be in Industry 1. Industry 1 includes food products,

beverages, tobacco, textiles and apparels. Foreign firms in Services are more likely to be

in industry 6, which includes computer and related services, other business services,

recreational, cultural and sporting activities. Overall, most foreign firms are in services,

in industry 6, which includes 33% of all foreign firms, compared to 14.3% of domestic

firms.

         Table 2 shows average statistics for foreign and domestic firms in manufacturing

and service industries. The table shows annual sales growth of domestic firms is higher

than those of foreign firms. From 2005 to 2006, sales grew by 41.1% on average in

domestic manufacturing firms compared with 16.9% in foreign firms. In the service



                                               8
sector sales grew by 35.1% in domestic firms compared with 26.5% in foreign firms.

Foreign firms are more likely to be exporters. In manufacturing, foreign firms exported

67.0% of their sales compared 20.1% of sales of domestic firms. In services, foreign

firms exported 50.8% of sales compared with 8.5% of domestic firms. Capital to labor

ratios are lower for foreign firms than for domestic firms in both services and

manufacturing. Foreign firms are more likely to be larger, with a larger percentage in

medium and large employment categories. Moreover, foreign firms are more likely to

locate in Sofia.

       The determinants of FDI regression results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

According to OLS and Logit regressions in Table 3, foreign manufacturing firms have

higher sales, export a larger percentage of their sales, have lower capital to labor ratio, are

more likely to have a medium or large employment size and are more likely to locate in

Sofia. Coefficients on these variables are significant at the 5% and 10% levels. Foreign

firms are not in industries with a large reduction in tariffs due to EU accession.

       OLS and Logit regressions for service sector firms are shown in Table 4.

Foreign firms have higher sales, export a larger percentage of their sales and have lower

capital to labor ratio than domestic firms and are more likely to have a medium or large

employment size. They are also more likely to locate in Sofia. The coefficients are

significant at the 5% and 10% levels.

       To analyze firm performance and investments, we estimated sales growth from

2005 to 2006, measured as the change in log of sales, whether the firm made capital

investments in 2006, and whether the firm has access to a credit line. Results for

manufacturing are shown in Table 5. Sales growth of manufacturing foreign firm is not



                                              9
significantly different from domestic firms. Foreign manufacturing firms are less likely

to have made capital investments in 2006. The coefficient is significant at the 5% level.

We also find that firms that export a larger fraction of their sales are more likely to have

made capital investments in 2006. The coefficients are significant at the 5% level.

Foreign firms access to a credit line is not different from that of domestic firms. The

results also show firms with higher sales are more likely to have a credit line. The

coefficient is significant at the 10% level.

       Results for service sector firms are shown in Table 6. Foreign firms’ sales growth

is not statistically from domestic firms. Foreign firms are not statistically different from

domestic firms in their likelihood of making capital investments in 2006. Firms with

greater sales are more likely to make capital investments. The coefficients are significant

at the 5% level. Foreign firms have similar access to a credit line than domestic firms.

Firms with higher capital to labor ratio are more likely to have a credit line. The

coefficients are significant at the 10% level.

       To better understand the institutional conditions affecting firms in Bulgaria, we

estimated regressions on management time spent on government regulation and number

of times visited by tax officials. Results for manufacturing firms are shown in Table 7

and for service sector firms in Table 8. In manufacturing, foreign firms’ management

time spent on government regulation is not statistically different from domestics firms.

Firms with higher rates of exports are less likely to spend time on regulation. The

coefficient is significant at the 5% level. Firms that are in industries that experienced a

larger reduction in tariffs spend less time on government regulation. The coefficients are

significant at the 5% level. Foreign firms do not receive more visits from tax officials



                                               10
when compared to domestic firms. However, firms that export a larger fraction of sales

experience more visits from tax officials.

       In the service sector, time spent on government regulation for foreign firms is not

statistically different from domestics firms. Foreign firms receive less number of visits

from tax officials. The coefficient is significant at the 5% level. Service sector firms with

higher percentages of exports relative to sales and higher sales receive more visits from

tax officials. Older firms receive fewer visits from tax officials. All of these coefficients

are significant at the 5% level.



7. Conclusion

       EU accession had the effect of increasing net inflows of FDI in Bulgaria.

However, net inflows of FDI peaked in 2007, the year of EU accession, gradually

declining until 2010. Net inflows of FDI have stayed below the levels Bulgaria achieved

in the early 2000s when the country signed the EU accession treaty.

       We analyze World Bank BEEPS firm level data for 2007 to better understand the

characteristics and performance of foreign firms in Bulgaria. We estimate linear

probability and logit models to determine the likelihood a firm is foreign in Bulgaria.

Regressions show foreign manufacturing firms in Bulgaria are larger than domestic firms,

have lower capital to labor ratios and higher percentage of sales in exports. Foreign firms

are not in manufacturing industries that experienced larger reductions in tariffs due to

accession to the EU. Foreign firms in the service sector in Bulgaria are larger than

domestic firms, have a higher percentage of sales in exports and are more likely to locate

in Sofia.



                                              11
       We find sales growth and access to credit of foreign manufacturing firms are not

different from domestic firms. However, foreign manufacturing firms are less likely to

make capital investments than domestic firms. Sales growth, capital investments and

access to credit of service sector foreign firms are not different from domestic firms.

These results suggest foreign firm have had limited success in Bulgaria.

       We measure institutional factors affecting foreign firms with time spent on

government regulation and number of times visited by tax officials. We find time spent

on government regulation is not different for foreign and domestic firms. Exporting firms

spend less time on government regulations. Number of visits from tax officials is not

different for domestic and foreign firms in manufacturing. Foreign firms experience less

visits from tax officials in the service sector. However, both in manufacturing and the

service sector , firms with a larger fraction of exports relative to sales experience greater

number of visits from tax officials. Since foreign firms are more likely to be exporters,

this suggests foreign firms are under more scrutiny. The findings suggest foreign firms

may be facing institutional challenges in Bulgaria.

       While our findings do not explain the decline in FDI in Bulgaria after accession,

they provide a firm level perspective on the challenges foreign firms experience in

Bulgaria.
