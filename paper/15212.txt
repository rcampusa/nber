We investigate whether bank performance during the credit crisis of 2008 is related to CEO incentives
and share ownership before the crisis and whether CEOs reduced their equity stakes in their banks
in anticipation of the crisis. There is no evidence that banks with CEOs whose incentives were better
aligned with the interests of their shareholders performed better during the crisis and some evidence
that these banks actually performed worse both in terms of stock returns and in terms of accounting
return on equity. Further, option compensation did not have an adverse impact on bank performance
during the crisis. Bank CEOs did not reduce their holdings of shares in anticipation of the crisis or
during the crisis; further, there is no evidence that they hedged their equity exposure. Consequently,
they suffered extremely large wealth losses as a result of the crisis.

    In the search of explanations for the dramatic collapse of the stock market capitalization of

much of the banking industry in the U.S. during the credit crisis, one prominent argument is that

executives at banks had poor incentives. For instance, Blinder argues that these poor incentives are

“one of [the] most fundamental causes” of the credit crisis.1 The argument seems to be that

executives’ compensation was not properly related to long-term performance, leading the Obama

administration to discuss ways to change compensation practices “to more closely align pay with

long-term performance”2 and to give more voice to shareholders through the adoption of “say on

pay” for firms that received public funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.3

    We investigate in this paper how closely the interests of the CEOs of banks were aligned with

those of their shareholders before the start of the crisis, whether the alignment of interests between

CEOs and shareholders can explain the performance of banks in the cross-section during the credit

crisis, and how CEOs fared during the crisis. Traditionally, corporate governance experts and

economists since Adam Smith have considered that management’s interests are better aligned with

those of shareholders when managers’ compensation increases when shareholders gain and falls

when shareholders lose. Our results show that there is no evidence that banks with a better

alignment of CEOs’ interests with those of their shareholders had higher stock returns during the

crisis and some evidence that banks led by CEOs whose interests were better aligned with those of

their shareholders had worse stock returns and a worse return on equity. Though options have been

blamed for leading to excessive risk-taking, there is no evidence in our sample that greater

sensitivity of CEO pay to stock volatility led to worse stock returns during the credit crisis. A

plausible explanation for these findings is that CEOs focused on the interests of their shareholders

in the build-up to the crisis and took actions that they believed the market would welcome. Ex post,

these actions were costly to their banks and to themselves when the results turned out to be poor.

These poor results were not expected by the CEOs to the extent that they did not reduce or hedge

their holdings of shares in anticipation of poor outcomes.

      There are many versions of the poor incentives explanation of the crisis. One version is that

CEOs were focused on the short run rather than the long run. Another version is that option

compensation gave incentives to CEOs to take more risks than would have been optimal for

shareholders. A third version is that the high leverage of financial institutions implies that CEOs

can increase the value of their shares by increasing the volatility of the assets since the shares are

effectively options on the value of the assets.4 To the extent that the market for a bank’s stock is

efficient, changes in a bank’s long-term performance will be properly reflected in the stock price,

so that greater sensitivity of a CEO’s wealth to his bank’s stock price will make it advantageous for

the CEO to improve his bank’s long-term performance when it makes economic sense to do so.

Focusing on the short run rather than the long run would be costly for CEOs since their stock price

would be lower than if they took actions to maximize shareholder wealth. The incentive effects of

options would be diluted in the CEO’s portfolio if he has large holdings of shares. Keeping the

CEO’s holdings of his firm’s stock constant, greater sensitivity of his wealth to increases in the

volatility of his firm’s stock return brought about by greater stock option holdings would increase

the CEO’s incentives to take risks as long as these options are not too much in the money. Whether

greater sensitivity of CEO wealth to volatility makes the CEO’s interests better aligned with the

interests of shareholders would seem to depend on many considerations. For example, if the CEO’s

holdings of stock make him more conservative, greater sensitivity of his wealth to volatility would

help in aligning the CEO’s incentives with those of shareholders.

      CEOs with greater incentive alignment would therefore be expected to take different risks from

those with weaker incentive alignment. To the extent that the bank exposures that performed poorly

during the crisis were viewed as risky by CEOs in 2006, we would expect that bank CEOs with

                                                  2
greater incentive alignment would have chosen to take fewer such exposures than CEOs with poor

incentive alignment: CEOs with low holdings of shares would have had much less to lose in the

event of bad outcomes as a result of these exposures. Further, CEOs with more options in their

portfolio relative to shares would have been more willing to take risky exposures.

    We find that bank CEOs had substantial wealth invested in their banks. On average, the value

of stock and options in the CEO’s portfolio was more than ten times the value of the CEO’s

compensation in 2006. Consequently, changes in his bank’s stock price could easily wipe out all a

CEO’s annual compensation. On average, CEOs owned 1.6% of the outstanding shares of their

bank. Taking into account vested, but unexercised options, this fraction increases to 2.4%. The

large holdings of vested unexercised options are striking. They are not consistent with the view that

somehow the typical CEO knew that there was a substantial risk of a crash in the stock price of his

bank.

    A bank’s stock return performance in 2007-2008 is negatively related to the dollar value of a

CEO’s holdings of shares in 2006. This effect is substantial. An increase of one standard deviation

in dollar ownership is associated with lower returns of 10.2%. Similarly, a bank’s return on equity

in 2008 is negatively related to its CEO’s holdings of shares in 2006 – a one standard deviation

increase in dollar ownership is associated with approximately a 10.1% lower return on equity. This

evidence is inconsistent with the view that CEOs took exposures that were not in the interests of

shareholders. Rather, this evidence suggests that CEOs took exposures that they felt were profitable

for their shareholders ex ante but that these exposures performed very poorly ex post. The

convexity introduced by options does not appear to have had an adverse impact on accounting

performance measured by ROE or by ROA. `

    An important issue with our approach is that CEOs could have sharply decreased their holdings

after 2006 but before the full impact of the crisis, so that they did not have to bear the cost of the

exposures they took. In that case, they would have appeared to have incentives aligned with those

of the other shareholders in 2006, but they would have traded out of these incentives or would have


                                                  3
hedged them. Consequently, their behavior in 2006 might have been based on their knowledge that

they would trade out of these incentives before the value of their portfolio fell substantially. For

such a strategy to make sense, CEOs would have had to be able to anticipate the crisis. We

investigate the insider trading of bank CEOs in 2007-2008. We find no evidence that they traded

out of their positions. CEOs therefore had to bear the losses associated with the poor outcomes of

the exposures their banks had at the end of 2006. Our evidence on CEO trading of shares in 2007

and 2008 is consistent with the hypothesis that the crisis and its evolution were unexpected for

bank top executives. Some might argue that they should have known better, but our evidence also

shows that they had stronger incentives than most to understand the distribution of the return of

their stock and of the overall performance of their bank.

    There is a long literature on the compensation of bank CEOs. This literature shows that CEO

compensation depends on stock return and accounting performance (Barro and Barro (1990)) as

does the compensation of CEOs generally, but also that the composition of pay differs for bank

CEOs from CEOs of other industries. In particular, the share of pay in the form of stock and

options for bank CEOs is lower than in other industries (e.g., Adams and Mehran (2003) or

Houston and James (1995)). Several papers investigate the impact of deregulation and greater

competition on bank CEO compensation. In particular, Hubbard and Palia (1995) and Crawford,

Ezzell, and Miles (2003) conclude that deregulation led to greater pay-for-performance sensitivity

of CEO pay at banks. Further, Crawford, Ezzell, and Miles (2003) find that, following

deregulation, pay-for-performance sensitivity of CEO pay increased more at less well-capitalized

institutions. They interpret this result as evidence of a moral hazard problem induced by the

existence of deposit insurance priced in a way that does not reflect the risks taken on by individual

banks.

    More recently, a series of papers has analyzed whether bank CEO compensation is optimally

designed to trade off two types of agency problems: the standard managerial agency problem as

well as the risk-shifting problem between shareholders and debtholders that may be particularly


                                                  4
severe in highly leveraged institutions (e.g., John, Mehran and Qian (2008) and John and Qian

(2003)). These papers also argue that leverage should reduce the pay-for-performance sensitivity of

bank CEOs compared to other CEOs because of monitoring by debtholders. Accordingly, John and

Quian (2003) show that bank CEOs have lower pay-for-performance sensitivity than other CEOs.

This literature emphasizes that it may be optimal for shareholders to take more risks because doing

so increases the value of the put granted to banks by the FDIC. According to this literature,

aligning the incentives of CEOs better with those of shareholders may increase rather than decrease

systemic risk. John, Saunders, and Senbet (2000) develop a model in which it is optimal for the

FDIC to set insurance premiums taking into account the compensation contract of the bank’s CEO.

    The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we introduce our sample of banks. In Section 2,

we present data on CEO compensation and equity ownership at the end of fiscal year 2006. We

then turn to the relation between CEO compensation, equity ownership, and bank performance

during the crisis in Section 3. In Section 4, we investigate the trading of CEOs in shares of their

own bank after the end of 2006 and how their equity ownership evolves during the crisis. We

conclude in Section 5.



1. The sample of banks

    Our study requires compensation data. This data is available through Standard and Poor’s

Execucomp database. We use that database as the starting point for the formation of our sample.

We download all firm-year observations for firms with SIC codes between 6000 and 6300 in fiscal

year 2006. This yields 132 unique firms. We exclude firms with SIC codes 6282 (Investment

Advice), because these are not in the lending business (e.g., Janus, T Rowe Price). In addition, we

manually go through the list of firms in SIC codes 6199 (Finance Services) and SIC code 6211

(Security Brokers and Dealers). Such a manual search is necessary because SEC code 6211




                                                5
includes not only investment banks but also pure brokerage houses such as Charles Schwab.5

Further, SIC code 6199 contains both American Express and Citigroup. Though our sample has

investment banks, we exclude pure brokerage houses and also report tests that exclude investment

banks. For increased transparency, we show the firms we exclude from our analysis and those we

include in Appendices A and B. Our final raw sample contains 98 firms. In addition, we obtain

accounting data from Compustat, additional banking data from Compustat Bank, insider trading

data from Thomson Financial, and stock return data from CRSP.

    Table 1 provides summary statistics of our sample of banks. It shows that we cover very large

financial institutions. This is not surprising since Execucomp is biased towards larger firms. The

median asset value is $15.5 billion, and the mean asset value is $129.3 billion. The sum of total

assets of sample firms at the end-of-fiscal year 2006 is $12.3 trillion. At the end of 2006, the

average (median) market capitalization of sample banks is $18.7 billion ($2.8 billion). The average

net income over assets (over equity) is 1.2% (13.5%). We also report two measures of capital

strength, the tier 1 capital ratio and the tangible common equity divided by tangible assets. The

Tier 1 capital ratio is on average 9.7%, while the tangible common equity ratio is 6.7% at the end

of fiscal year 2006. On average, the Tier 1 capital ratio makes these banks well capitalized. The

lowest Tier 1 ratio is 5.73%, which is substantially above the regulatory minimum of 4%. No bank

in our sample has negative net income in 2006.

    Our study examines the accounting and stock return performance of the sample banks until the

end of 2008. Table 2 shows the attrition of sample firms from fiscal year end 2006 to the end of

2008. Of the 95 banks with complete CEO compensation data in 2006, 77 survived until December

2008. 12 banks were acquired, and 6 banks delisted from the exchange due to a violation of listing

requirements or bankruptcy.

 Using the finer North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not resolve the issues. For
example, Goldman Sachs Group is classified as 523110 (Investment Banking & Brokerage) while Bear
Stearns is classified as 523120 (Securities Brokerage).


                                                    6
2. CEO compensation and equity ownership at the end of fiscal year 2006

    We now turn to an examination of CEO’s compensation and of their equity and option

holdings at the end of 2006. Table 3 provides summary statistics on CEOs’ equity position and

compensation. The Table has 95 observations because three firms do not report CEO equity

holdings for 2006 as a result of a change in CEO. Starting with fiscal year 2006, FASB 123(R)

changed the way executive compensation is reported in proxy statements. For example, it

introduced finer reporting requirements for deferred compensation, pension benefits, and details on

all option series held by executives. The latter change greatly facilitates the calculation of the

sensitivity of the executive’s option portfolio to volatility and stock price changes.

    The total compensation (including new option and stock grants, but excluding gains from

exercising options) of sample CEOs was on average $7.9 million, and the median compensation

was $2.5 million. The majority of CEO compensation stems from performance-based pay, as the

average base salary of $760,000 is less than 10% of the average total compensation. John and Qian

(2003) use a sample constructed similarly to ours and investigate compensation for 120 commercial

banks from 1992 to 2000. In that study, they find that the ratio of average salary to average total

direct compensation is higher than what we find (16% versus 10%). Annual bonuses are paid both

in cash for achievements of accounting based goals, and in equity to align incentives of CEOs and

shareholders. More than 70% of all CEOs receive at least some of their 2006 compensation in

equity. Conditional on at least receiving some compensation in equity, the fraction of equity pay is

on average 48.5%. The dollar value of the annual equity grants is $4.3 million on average.

    As Hall and Liebman (1998) and Core and Guay (1999) point out, most CEO equity incentives

stem from the existing portfolio of stock and options, and not from annual grants. A similar result

holds for our sample. We define the total dollar value of equity of a CEO at the end of fiscal year

2006 as the sum of unrestricted and restricted shares held multiplied by the end-of-year share price




                                                   7
plus the FASB 123R fair value (where available)6 or Black-Scholes value of exercisable and

unexercisable stock options plus the fair value of unearned equity incentive plans. The mean

(median) value of the CEO’s equity stake is $88.1 million ($36.3 million). The average value of the

overall equity portfolio is 20 times larger than the dollar value of annual grants of stocks and

options ($2.6 million + $1.6 million) and more than ten times larger than the CEO’s total annual

compensation. Perhaps surprisingly, much of the equity of the CEO is held voluntarily through

unrestricted stock and vested, exercisable options.7 There are 20 CEOs in our sample that have

equity stakes valued at more than $100 million. The top 5 equity positions at the end of fiscal year

2006 are held by Richard Fuld (Lehman Brothers, $1,003 million), James Cayne (Bear Stearns,

$953 million), Stan O’Neal (Merrill Lynch, $359 million), John Mack (Morgan Stanley, $320

million), and Angelo Mozilo (Countrywide Financial, $285 million). On average, the shares owned

by CEOs in our sample correspond to 1.6% of the shares of the company. In their sample, John and

Qian (2003) found average equity holdings of 1.3% for their sample of commercial banks.

    We use the detailed option plan table to calculate the delta and vega of each option grant

(current and past grants). To calculate delta and vega, we need the option’s exercise price,

expiration date, volatility, the current stock price, the relevant interest rate, and the dividend yield.

Option exercise price and expiration date come directly from Execucomp. We use the fiscal year-

end closing price of 2006 as the current stock price, the 3-year lagged volatility at the end of 2006

as an estimate of the volatility, and the annual cash dividend for 2006 divided by the fiscal-year

end closing price as an estimate of the dividend yield. The 10-year treasury rate is used as an

estimate of the risk-free interest rate.




6
  Fair values need to be reported according to FASB 123R, but the new format only became mandatory
starting 12/31/2006, so that firms that have a fiscal year end not equal to December will report according to
the old rules in our data. There are a total of 7 firms that do not report these values. For those firms, we use
the aggregate values given for the exercisable and unexercisable options.
7
  Some companies may have established target stock ownership plans for their executives, so that the
executive is not free to sell his or her entire stake (see, e.g., Core and Larcker (2002)).


                                                        8
    Table 3 presents two measures of sensitivity of the equity portfolio of the CEO. We show that

the average (median) CEO has an ownership from shares and delta-weighted options of 2.4%

(1.1%). In other words, the CEO’s wealth increases by $24 ($11) for every $1,000 in created

shareholder wealth. The second measure is the dollar gain for a 1% increase in shareholder value.

Table 3 shows that the average dollar gain is $1.1 million for a 1% change in firm value.

    We calculate the percentage change in the equity portfolio value of a CEO for a one percent

increase in volatility using options only. We call this measure percentage equity risk sensitivity.

Although common stock has some exposure to volatility (because it can be considered as a call

option), Guay (1999) shows that for the typical firm, the volatility exposure of common stock is

negligible. This result may not apply to banks because they are highly levered. Nevertheless, we

use the traditional approach to estimate the equity risk sensitivity since its interpretation is well

understood. It is possible that by proceeding this way we understate the equity risk sensitivity of

CEOs. The average CEO in our sample stands to gain 0.5% of his total portfolio value if the stock

price volatility increased by 1%. Alternatively, we can estimate the change in the dollar value of

the CEO’s wealth for a 1% increase in stock price volatility. We call this measure the dollar equity

risk sensitivity. In our sample, the average dollar equity risk sensitivity is $187,000. A risk-averse

CEO would have to trade off the monetary value of an increase in volatility against its impact on

the volatility of his wealth.



3. CEO incentives and bank performance during the crisis

    In this section, we investigate the relation between CEO incentives as of the end of fiscal year

2006 and bank performance during the crisis. For the purpose of this paper, we consider the returns

of banks from July 1, 2007, to December 31, 2008, to correspond to the returns of these banks

during the crisis period. Admittedly, the crisis did not end in December 2008. Bank stocks lost

substantial ground in the first quarter of 2009. However, during the period we consider the banking

sector suffered losses not observed since the Great Depression. The subsequent losses were at least


                                                  9
partly affected by uncertainty about whether banks would be nationalized. Since it is not clear how

the impact on bank stocks of the threat of nationalization would be affected by the incentives of

CEOs before the crisis, it may well be that it is better to evaluate returns only until the end of 2008.

    There is a longstanding debate in the corporate finance literature on how to assess long-run

performance (see Fama (1998) and Ritter and Loughran (2000)). One approach is to construct

portfolios and evaluate the abnormal performance of these portfolios from the intercept of

regressions of the returns of the portfolios on known risk factors. This approach has the advantage

of evaluating performance in the context of a portfolio strategy. Another approach is to use buy-

and-hold returns. Using buy-and-hold returns is generally a better approach when attempting to

explain the cross-sectional variation in performance when performance can be affected by many

factors. In this paper, we use both approaches.

    Our first approach to estimate the relation between bank stock returns and bank CEO

incentives is to construct portfolios of banks that differ in CEO incentives and to compare the

excess returns of these portfolios. We have four measures of incentives. The first two measures are

percentage ownership and dollar ownership. The last two measures are percentage equity risk

sensitivity and dollar equity risk sensitivity.

    We first construct portfolios of banks that, respectively, are in the top quartile and the bottom

quartile of percentage ownership. In Panel A of Table 4, we report the mean weekly raw return and

the median weekly raw return of a portfolio that is long the top quartile portfolio and short the

bottom quartile portfolio. A negative return for the long-short portfolio means that the banks with

CEOs who have the highest percentage ownership fared more poorly than the banks with CEOs

who have the lowest percentage ownership. We find that the mean and median raw returns are

insignificantly negative. The same result holds when we use dollar ownership instead of percentage

ownership (row 2). Figure 1 plots the cumulative weekly raw returns of the portfolio that is long

banks with CEOs in the top quartile of dollar ownership and short banks with CEOs in the bottom

quartile of dollar ownership starting on July 1, 2007. The figure shows that the high ownership


                                                  10
portfolio underperforms the low ownership portfolio. While the effects are statistically insignificant

in Table 4, Figure 1 is suggestive of economically large return differences. We also construct

extreme quartile portfolios for percentage equity risk sensitivity and dollar equity risk sensitivity.

The portfolio long the banks in the top quartile and short the banks in the bottom quartile of

percentage equity risk sensitivity has a positive insignificant average and median return. In the case

of dollar equity risk sensitivity, the mean and median returns are indistinguishable from zero.

    Panel B of Table 4 estimates the Fama and French (1993) model for each of the four portfolio

strategies. This approach controls for factors known to affect returns of portfolios. The first row

provides results for the high minus low percentage ownership portfolio. The intercept of the

regression (alpha) is -0.62% per week and statistically insignificant. In other words, a portfolio

long the banks where the CEO has high equity incentives in the form of high share percentage

ownership and short the banks where the CEO has low equity incentives underperforms, but not

significantly so. We also estimated the same model starting on January 1, 2007. If we do that, the

intercept is -0.0067 and is significant at the 10% level. The advantage of using the longer sample

period is that the number of observations increases by a third, but at the cost that we include some

months that precede the credit crisis to estimate the model more precisely. The regression for dollar

ownership is presented next. With that regression, the intercept is again negative and not

significant. It is interesting to note that the percentage ownership portfolio strategy and the dollar

ownership portfolio strategy have very different exposures to the risk factors. In the case of the

percentage ownership portfolio strategy, the firms with high percentage ownership CEOs are less

exposed to the market portfolio and more exposed to the SMB portfolio (which is the return of

small firms minus the return of large firms). The opposite is true for the dollar ownership portfolio.

This suggests that firms with high percentage equity ownership are smaller firms, whereas perhaps

not surprisingly the firms with high dollar ownership are larger firms. We then turn to the equity

risk sensitivity incentive regressions. With the regression that uses percentage equity risk

sensitivity, the intercept is positive and insignificant. This coefficient is positive and significant if


                                                   11
we estimate the model starting on January 1, 2007. The final regression uses the dollar equity risk

sensitivity. For that regression, the intercept is also indistinguishable from zero. Again, the firms

with more dollar equity risk sensitivity appear to be larger firms.

    Table 4 shows that there is no evidence that banks with higher CEO ownership performed

better during the crisis and no evidence that banks where the risk incentives resulting from option

holding were higher performed worse. With the longer sample period, there is evidence that banks

with higher CEO ownership performed worse. The advantage of the approach used in that table is

that it evaluates returns on portfolios that investors could have held. However, by forming

portfolios, we cannot use much information about individual banks. We now turn to tests that

exploit more information about individual banks.

    We investigate the determinants of returns of individual banks using multiple regressions of

buy-and-hold returns of banks from July 1, 2007, to December 31, 2008, on various bank

characteristics.8 The first four regressions respectively use each one of our incentive measures. Our

other determinants of stock performance are the performance of the bank’s stock in 2006, the

equity book-to-market ratio, and the log of the bank’s market value. Past returns, the book-to-

market ratio, and the log of market value are all variables known to be related to returns. However,

here, these variables could affect performance for other reasons than for their role as risk factors

that affect expected returns. For instance, it could be that larger banks were able to take more risks.

A log transformation is applied to both the percentage ownership and the percentage vega. This

transformation reduces the influence of extremely high values of these variables and makes the

distribution closer to the normal distribution (e.g., Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Himmelberg,

Hubbard, and Palia (1999)). We winsorize the dollar incentive measures at the 2nd and 98th

percentile. Regression (1) uses the logarithm of dollar ownership. The coefficient on dollar

ownership is significantly negative. The coefficient on percentage ownership in regression (2) is

                                                   12
negative as well but not significant. We also estimated this regression without the log

transformation, in which case the coefficient on percentage ownership is negative and marginally

significant. However, the significance is driven by a few large values and disappears when we

winsorize percentage ownership at the 5% level. We then turn to equity risk incentives. Regression

(3) uses the dollar measure. The coefficient is negative and insignificant. In regression (4), the

coefficient on the percentage measure is positive and significant.

    In regressions (5) and (6), we use respectively dollar and percentage incentive measures and

control for other determinants of performance measured as of the end of 2006. In regression (5),

the dollar share ownership has a negative significant coefficient. This effect is economically

significant. The standard deviation of the logarithm of dollar equity incentives is 1.6.

Consequently, an increase of one standard deviation in dollar ownership is associated with lower

returns of 10.2% (0.064 x 1.6). Also, a bank’s return during the crisis is negatively related to the

bank’s stock return performance in 2006, although the result is not statistically significant. Beltratti

and Stulz (2009) also find this result – but with statistical significance - for a sample of

international banks. This result suggests that banks that took on more exposures that the market

approved of in 2006 suffered more during the crisis. We find next that banks with a higher book-to-

market ratio in 2006 have worse performance during the crisis. A possible explanation for this

result is that banks with less franchise value took more risks that worked out poorly during the

crisis. Large banks perform worse. Turning to regression (6), percentage ownership has a negative

insignificant coefficient and percentage equity risk incentive has a positive significant coefficient.

The coefficients on the other explanatory variables are similar to those of regression (5).

Regressions (7) and (8) require information on the Tier 1 capital ratio of banks. This requirement

removes from the sample all non-depository banks. In particular, all large investment banks drop

out of the sample. The coefficients on the incentive variables of CEOs are largely the same. It

follows therefore that our results cannot be explained by the large share ownership of some CEOs

of investment banks that performed poorly.


                                                  13
    The results of Table 5 are robust when we change the sample period or variables. In

regressions not reproduced here, we use tangible common equity to assets as a measure of the

capital ratio and obtain similar results. We also find similar results if we use returns from January

1, 2007, to December 31, 2008, or if we use only 2008. The same results hold if we do not

winsorize dollar incentives or if we truncate dollar incentives.

    So far, we have focused on bank performance measured by equity returns. We now turn to the

performance of banks using two measures of accounting performance: Return on assets (ROA) and

return on equity (ROE). In Figure 2, we show the evolution of quarterly ROA from 2005Q4 to

2008Q3. Not surprisingly, the average ROA plummets in 2008. For our regression analysis, return

on assets is defined as the cumulative quarterly net income from 2007Q3 to 2008Q3 divided by

total assets at the end of 2007Q2. For return on equity, we divide the cumulative quarterly net

income by the book value of equity at the end of 2007Q2. In the regressions we report in Table 6,

we use the same control variables as those used in Table 5. Regressions (1) through (4) use ROA as

the dependent variable. The first two regressions use all banks; the last two regressions require

availability of the Tier 1 capital ratio. In the sample of all banks, neither the CEO’s dollar incentive

measure nor his percentage ownership measure has a significant coefficient. With the equity risk

sensitivity measure, neither the dollar measure nor the percentage measure is significant. In

regressions (3) and (4), the only change for the CEO incentive measures is that the CEO’s dollar

incentive measure has a significant negative coefficient. The only other explanatory variable that is

significant in the regressions is the book-to-market ratio. Turning to the four ROE regressions, we

see that the CEO’s dollar incentive measure has a negative significant coefficient in both

regressions. In regression (7), which uses a sample of depository banks only, the percentage

ownership measure has a negative significant coefficient. The percentage risk sensitivity measure is

significant in regression (5) but, although the coefficient is similar, it is not in regression (7) that

uses a smaller sample. The dollar risk sensitivity measure is significant in the larger sample, but not




                                                  14
in the smaller one. In addition to book-to-market, the lagged return is now significant in regressions

(5) and (6).

    We estimate other regressions using ROA and ROE that we do not reproduce in a table. First,

we estimate regressions where the additional explanatory variables besides the CEO incentive

measures are the log of the bank’s market value at the end of 2006, the volatility of its stock return

in the three previous years, and the Tier I capital ratio. We find that the coefficient on dollar equity

incentives is negative and significant in the ROE regression. The coefficient on volatility is

negative and significant. We also estimate these regressions on changes in ROA and changes in

ROE. The dollar equity incentive has a significant negative coefficient and the dollar equity risk

sensitivity measure has a positive significant coefficient.



4. CEO equity losses during the crisis

    We have uncovered no evidence supportive of the view that better alignment of incentives

between CEOs and shareholders would have led to better bank performance or that option

compensation is to blame for the poor performance of banks. Our evidence is consistent with the

hypothesis that CEOs who took exposures that performed poorly during the crisis did so because

they thought that doing so was good for shareholders as well as for themselves. Our evidence

provides no support for the hypothesis that option compensation led CEOs to take on more

exposures that performed poorly during the crisis. Finally, our evidence is consistent with the

hypothesis that CEOs did not expect these exposures to work out poorly.

    So far, however, we proceeded with our analysis using CEO share and option holdings at the

end of 2006. If CEOs saw the crisis coming some time after the end of 2006, they could have sold

their holdings and hence would not have been affected adversely by their decisions. We investigate

in this section how share ownership of CEOs evolved during the crisis. For this analysis, we use

Execucomp and the database on insider transactions from Thomsom Financial. We aggregate CEO




                                                  15
transactions by firm and quarter. We are able to match 88 of the 95 bank CEOs in Execucomp to

the Thomson Financial database.

    Figure 3 reports the quarterly mean and median of CEO net share purchases between 2007Q1

and 2008Q4. Throughout the period, on average, CEOs sell less than 2% of their holdings per

quarter. The exception is for the quarter ending in September 2008, when they sell almost 4% of

their holdings on average. It is common for executives to sell shares because their portfolio tends to

become less diversified as they exercise options and receive stock grants. Figure 3 also shows the

increase in ownership of CEOs through new grants of options and stock. They receive grants

throughout the period.

    In Table 7, we attempt to estimate the dollar loss of CEOs in our sample on their stock

holdings resulting from the fall in the value of their holdings over the period from the end of fiscal

year 2006 through December 31, 2008. Our starting point for each CEO is the shares held at the

end of 2006. We then use the insider trading data to evaluate the price at which the CEO sold

shares if he sold shares. The CEO’s loss is then defined as the loss in value of the shares not sold,

evaluated using the price of the shares at the end of December 2008 or when the CEO loses his job

plus the loss made on shares sold, measured as the difference between the value of shares at the end

of 2006 and the price of the shares sold. The average value of shares held at the end of 2006 is

$61.503 million. On average, a CEO lost $28.771 million on the shares not sold and $2.719 million

on the shares sold. More than three quarters of the CEOs did not report any insider sales. On

average, a CEO lost $31.490 million. The median loss is sharply less, however, at $5.084 million.

It follows from Table 7 that CEOs made large losses on their wealth during the crisis and that most

of these losses come from holding on to their shares. Had CEOs seen the crisis coming, they could

have avoided most of these losses by selling their shares. They clearly did not do so.

    We also investigate what happened to the options held by CEOs. Strikingly, only 12% of the

options granted before 2007 were out of the money at fiscal year end 2006. In contrast,




                                                 16
approximately 70% of all options granted before 2007 were out of the money at the end of the

sample period. Consequently, CEOs suffered large losses on their options as well.

       A valid concern is whether we overestimate the equity losses of insiders. We could be missing

hedging activities by insiders that are carried out through off-market equity transactions such as

zero-cost equity collars, exchange funds, or variable prepaid forward contracts.9 All these

transactions have in common that the insider does not sell the shares and thus retains the voting

rights of the stock while receiving significant downside protection.

       It is important to note that the SEC has mandated reporting of such hedging transactions since

1996. Thomson Financial, our data provider for insider transactions, has specific fields that capture

trading of prepaid variable forward contracts, exchange funds, and equity swaps. When we search

for zero-cost collars, exchange funds, and prepaid variable forward contracts by the CEOs of

sample banks, we do not find a single hedging transaction. When we expand the search to all bank

insiders between January 2007 and December 2008, we find less than 10 transactions, mostly

prepaid variable forward contracts by non-executive directors.

       The lack of reported hedging activities is not surprising in light of the sample sizes of two

comprehensive studies on off-market equity transactions. Bettis, Bizjak, and Lemmon (2001) study

all filings by all insiders between January 1996 and December 1998 and are only able to identify 85

zero-cost collars. Jagolinzer, Matsunaga, and Yeung (2007) examine prepaid variable forward

transactions and are able to find only 174 contracts from the universe of filings between August

1996 and June 2004, with roughly a third of them carried out by CEOs.

       While there is some debate on the issue of whether insiders underreport hedging transactions, it

is argued by most legal experts that not reporting hedging transactions is illegal (see the discussion

in Smith and Eisinger (2004)). Overall, we have no reason to believe that significant hedging

activities attenuate the finding of large equity losses documented in Table 7.

    The use of equity swaps disappeared in the mid-nineties because of their disadvantageous tax treatment.

5. Conclusion

    Bank CEO incentives cannot be blamed for the credit crisis or for the performance of banks

during that crisis. Whether we look at depository banks only or at a larger sample that includes

investment banks as well, there is no evidence that banks with CEOs whose incentives were less

well aligned with the interests of their shareholders performed worse during the crisis. When we

attempt to explain the performance of banks in the cross-section, we find evidence that banks

where CEOs had better incentives in terms of the dollar value of their stake in their bank performed

significantly worse than banks where CEOs had poorer incentives. Stock options had no adverse

impact on bank performance during the crisis.

    A possible explanation for our results is that CEOs with better incentives to maximize

shareholder wealth took risks that other CEOs did not. Ex ante, these risks looked profitable for

shareholders. Ex post, these risks had unexpected poor outcomes. These poor outcomes are not

evidence of CEOs acting in their own interest at the expense of shareholder wealth.

    Support for this possible explanation is provided by our examination of the wealth

consequences of the crisis for bank CEOs. If CEOs took risks that they knew were not in the

interests of their shareholders, we would expect them to have sold shares ahead of the crisis. We

find that this did not happen. In fact, CEO holdings of shares on net increased. Not surprisingly,

CEOs therefore made large losses on their holdings of shares and on their holdings of options. On

average, CEOs in our sample lost at least $30 million and the median CEO loss is more than $5

million.

Table 3: CEO compensation and equity ownership at the end of fiscal year 2006

The table shows summary statistics for key compensation variables for a sample of 95 bank
holding companies and investment banks for fiscal year 2006. The data are from the Compustat
Execucomp database. Values are reported in thousands of dollars. Most of the variables of the table
are directly taken from Execucomp. The percentage change in portfolio value for a 1% increase in
volatility is calculated using the detailed information on all current and previous option grants
mandated by FASB 123R. Percentage ownership from shares and exercisable options is from the
proxy statement and counts exercisable options and options that become exercisable within 60 days
after the record date as the equivalent of 1 share. Percentage ownership from shares and all options
(delta-weighted) uses the detailed information on current and previous option grants to calculate
the options’ delta and multiplies the number of options held in each series by its delta when
calculating the percentage ownership.

Table 4: Returns to equal-weighted high and low ownership and equity risk portfolios

Panel A of the table shows the average and median weekly return of a portfolio of high CEO
ownership (high CEO equity risk) firms minus low CEO ownership (low CEO equity risk) firms.
Firms are classified as high ownership (high equity risk) if the ownership (equity risk) of the CEO
at the end of fiscal year 2006 is in the top quartile of all CEOs. Low ownership (low equity risk) is
defined accordingly. The table reports results for a percentage ownership measure, which is equal
to the number of shares and all options (delta-weighted) held by the CEO divided by the total
number of shares outstanding as well as a dollar ownership measure, which is equal to the dollar
change in the executive’s portfolio for a 1% change in the stock price. Percentage equity risk is
equal to the percentage change in the executive’s equity portfolio value for a 1% change in
volatility. Dollar equity risk is equal to the dollar change in the executive’s portfolio value for a 1%
change in volatility. In Panel A, p- and z-values of tests of statistical differences from zero are
reported in parenthesis. Panel B reports estimates from a regression based on a three- factor
performance attribution model for the weekly return difference of a high ownership (equity risk)
minus low ownership (equity risk) portfolio. The panel reports equal-weighted weekly return
regressions. The three factors are defined in Fama and French (1993). The factors are the returns to
zero-investment portfolios designed to capture market (RMRF), size (SMB), and book-to-market
(HML) effects, respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance
at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 5: Buy-and-hold returns and CEO ownership and equity risk exposure

The Table shows results from a cross-sectional regression of buy-and-hold returns for banks from July 2007 – December 2008 on CEO
equity ownership and firm characteristics measured at the end of fiscal year 2006. CEO equity ownership (dollar incentives) is the dollar
change in the value of the CEO’s equity portfolio for a 1% change in the stock price. CEO ownership (%) is the sum of all shares (restricted
and unrestricted) and delta-weighted options (exercisable and unexercisable) held by the CEO divided by the total number of shares
outstanding multiplied by 100. CEO $ equity risk is defined as the dollar change in portfolio value for a 1% increase in volatility. CEO %
equity risk is defined as the percentage change in portfolio value for a 1% increase in volatility and is calculated from all option series held
by the CEO. A log transformation is applied to both the percentage ownership and percentage equity risk. The firm characteristics are
measured at the end of year 2006. These characteristics include the stock return in 2006, the book-to-market ratio, the natural logarithm of
the market capitalization, and the tier 1 capital ratio. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and
10% level is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

Table 6: ROA and ROE regressions
The Table shows regressions of the return on assets and return on equity on CEO ownership, CEO equity risk exposure, and control
variables. Return on assets is defined as the cumulative quarterly net income from 2007Q3 to 2008Q3 divided by the total assets at the end
of 2007Q2. Return on equity is defined as the cumulative quarterly net income from 2007Q3 to 2008Q3 divided by the book value of
common equity at the end of 2007Q2. CEO % ownership is the sum of all shares (restricted and unrestricted) and delta-weighted options
(exercisable and unexercisable) held by the CEO divided by the total number of shares outstanding multiplied by 100. CEO dollar
ownership is the dollar change in the value of the CEO’s equity portfolio for a 1% change in the stock price. CEO % equity risk is defined
as the percentage change in portfolio value for a 1% increase in volatility and is calculated from all option series held by the CEO. CEO
dollar equity risk is defined as the dollar change in portfolio value for a 1% increase in volatility. A log transformation is applied to both the
percentage ownership and percentage equity risk. Columns 1 through 4 show results for return on assets regressions, and columns 5
through 8 show corresponding results for the return on equity. The control variables include the natural logarithm of the market
capitalization, the tier 1 capital ratio, and the book-to-market ratio, all measured at the end of fiscal year 2006. Lagged return is the lagged
return on assets for columns 1 through 4 and the lagged return on equity for columns 5 through 8. It is measured over the five previous
quarters to be consistent. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level is indicated by
***, **, and *, respectively.

Table 7: Dollar Loss of CEOs’ equity portfolios during the credit crisis

The table shows the cumulative trading losses and the losses from shares held from the
beginning to the end of the sample period. The sample contains 80 bank CEOs. A CEO
who turned over prior to September 2007 is excluded from the sample. Cumulative trading
losses are calculated as shares sold multiplied with the difference of the price at the fiscal
year end 2006 and the transaction price. Only insider sales unrelated to option exercises are
included in the calculations. The ‘loss from not acting’ is calculated as the shares held at
the end of the sample period multiplied with the difference of the fiscal year end price
2006 and the stock price at the end of the sample period. End of the sample period is
defined as either December 2008, the month of the turnover of the CEO, or the month of
the corporate event (merger, delisting), whichever comes earlier. The ‘total loss’ is
calculated as the sum of the cumulative trading loss and the loss from not acting. If
Thomson Financial does not report a sale of shares unrelated to options, it is assumed that
the CEO did not sell any of his shares, and cumulative trading losses are set to zero. All
numbers, except for stock prices, are reported in thousands of dollars.

Figure 1: Cumulative weekly portfolio returns July 2007 – December 2008

The figure shows cumulative weekly portfolio returns for a portfolio of high CEO
ownership financial firms, for a portfolio of low CEO ownership banks, and for a long-
short portfolio where the high CEO ownership banks are bought. Firms are classified as
high ownership if the ownership of the CEO at the end of fiscal year 2006 is in the top
quartile of all sample CEOs. Ownership is a dollar ownership measure, which is equal to
the dollar change in the executive’s portfolio for a 1% change in the stock price.

Figure 3: CEO insider trading

The figure shows the average total percentage changes in CEO ownership and ownership
changes caused by trading and new grants. The sample contains 80 bank CEOs that are
covered by both Execucomp and Thomson Financial’s insider trading database. A CEO
who turned over prior to September 2007 is excluded from the sample. For each CEO, all
insider transactions reported by Thomson Financial are aggregated by firm and quarter. If a
CEO does not trade or does not receive new grants, he is not included in the cross-sectional
average for a given quarter. The percentage change in ownership is defined as the number
of shares (or derivatives) traded divided by the total CEO ownership from stocks and
options at the end of fiscal year 2006.
