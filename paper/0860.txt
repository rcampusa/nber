            LABOR SUPPLY UNDER DISABILITY INSURANCE




                          Abstract


       There has been a significant recent growth in the Social
Security Administration's Disability Insurance (DI) program,
both in the number of covered workers under the program and in
the amount of monthly benefits. One possible factor causing
this growth has been labor supply disincentives under the pro-
gram. The labor supply decision by an individual involves the
effect of the disability benefit structure (potential benefits)
on labor force participation. Probit estimates from the 1969
original sample of the Longitudinal Retirement History Study
 (LRHS) indicated anelasticity  of participation with respect
to benefits of -.031 for married men aged 58—63, and —.023
for all men of the same age group. The magnitude of these
estimates are much less than those found by authors such as
Parsons, and suggest relatively insignificant efficiency
losses in terms of reduced work effort.

I. Introduction

           A major characteristic of the Social Security Administration's

Disability (DI) program has been the significant recent growth in the

program. The number of covered workers under DI increased from 59.6

million in 1954 to 98.7 million in 1973. Table 1 shows the large in-

crease from 1960—75 in the amount of monthly benefits. DI monthly

benefit payments in 1975 were over ten times what they were in 1960.

           Disability is defined under the DI program as an inability to

engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically

determinable physical or mental condition that has lasted or is ex-

pected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months

or result in death.1 Since the definition of disability is both work

(and health) dependent, this focuses attention on the effectiveness of

labor supply incentives under the program.

           If disability were an involuntary condition for the individual,

and   if    the Disability Insurance program was truly screening only the

severely disabled, the labor supply issue would not be a factor. How-

ever, disability may be a voluntary condition for the individual. The

decision to become disabled may     depend   on factors such as declining

stamina and motivation, assets, and      family   composition. Also likely to

influence     the decision is the structure of the DI program, the net mar-
ket wage rate, the existence of private employer disability plans, and
the availability of alternative income maintenance plans. To the extent

that the availability of DI enters the labor       supply   decision of the

individual, the efficiency loss from adverse incentives must be balanced

against the equity gains from insurance coverage of the disabled. The

following section examines labor supply under the Disability Insurance

program.


II. Labor Supply Under Disability Insurance

      In order to examine the effect of Social Security Disability Insur-

ance or labor supply, one must consider the program's benefit structure.

The primary elements of this structure are the basic monthly benefit

levels and the Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) level which is the

level of earnings mandated by law beyond which point a medically un-

recovered individual would lose their benefits.

      Figure 1 shows the budget constraint faced by the individual under

Disability Insurance. The potential beneficiary receives the basic

level of benefits (BEN). He or she may work without loss of benefits

up to $G1 of earnings which is the SGA level of K1 hours of work. At

this point, the benefit is in effect reduced dollar—for—dollar with

earnings along segment       At the point G, where the person works K2

hours, they no longer receive disability benefits, and they operate

along segment GH outside of the DI system. The amount of market time

needed to earn     depends on the individual's wage. The amount of

market time K2 needed to exhaust DI benefits depends on both wage and

benefit. We denote this version of the DI structure as the "hours

model," since the structure of the program is assumed to affect vary-

ing hours of work at low levels of work activity.

      On the other hand, it may be the case that the SGA represents

such a low level of earnings that it may be considered to be

essentially zero to the individual. For example, the SGA level in 1974

was $200 per month, which for most persons would connote less than part—

time work. In Figure 1, any positive amount of market time would there-

fore lead to immediate loss of benefits. The budget constraint is DE

for zero hours of work, but immediately drops down to DR as soon as the

individual works a positive amount. The disability system is therefore

reduced to a labor force participation decision subject to benefits BEN

and market wage w. We denote this alternative form of the DI system as

the "participation model."

      In the following discussion, we examine labor supply under the

"participation model." We do not discuss the hours model since the

supply decision from an empirical standpoint is basically a partici-

pation decision. Data from the 1969 sample of the Longitudinal Retire-

ment History Study (LRHS) shows that only .76 percent of males aged

58—63 who worked in 1968 worked at or above the SGA level.


III. Participation Model

      The participation model under disability insurance can be repre-

sented by three equations: a shadow price equation, a wage equation,

and a labor supply equation.

      We may specify the shadow price equation as


                       =       + u1                               (1)




and the market wage equation as:


                     w=c'x+U                                      (2)
                                               —6—

with labor supply H specified as:



                   H S'z+y1w+132                                   if w.s              (3)

                                  0                                if
                          (




where 112 may   or may not equal ( — 1i]) and H represents annual hours

worked.

        The reduced form hours and wage equations from equations (l)—(3)

may be written as:

                              Sj.     z1

where disability benefits would be expected to enter the vector z.

A priori, we would expect disability benefits to increase the value

of nonmarket time, therefore reducing the probability of working.

        The conditional hours and wage equations for the population with

possible censored sampling become.

       In equations (4) and         V1. and V2. are the conditional reduced
form disturbances, and A. is the inverse of Mill's ratio, which in re-

liability theory is known   as   the hazard rate.3

       In order to estimate the extent of sample selection bias, we seek

consistent estimates of 4,. Consistent estimates of        can be obtained

through probit analysis of the decision to work or not to work. Esti-

mates of 4, allows us to estimate A(4,.), which allows us to correct for

the fact that wages may be significantly higher for participants than

nonparticipants——a form of selectivity bias.

       The general form of the structural participation equation can be

written as:


                              LFP =   f(w,   BEN, X)                   (7)



where w is the market wage, BEN is the level of potential disability

benefits, and X represents a vector of variables which are expected to

affect individual preferences between leisure and consumption goods——

such as family assets and productivity at home. We do not consider here

the case of fixed costs of working which affect the shadow price but

have a negligible effect on hours worked. Hausman (1979) has pointed

out the possible problems arising from the wage-shadow price approach

when fixed costs are present.4

IV. Empirical Results

      Tables 3 and 4 show maximum likelihood probit estimates of the

structural labor force participation equation for males aged 58—63

from the 1969 original sample of the Longitudinal Retirement History

Study (LRHS). These males were eligible for Disability Insurance

benefits based on their past earnings and employment covered by

Social Security.

      Two variables are used which, in addition to entering the

shadow price equation, also standardize for the probability of

being certified as disabled by the Social Security Administration.

The first variable is LIMIT, which is a     dummy variable     equal to one

if the individual is limited   in   getting around,   and   zero otherwise.

This is a measure of the person's level of (poor) health, which is

an important criterion in being certified as disabled. We would

prefer a more lagged measure of health than LIMIT. This is because

a lagged measure would have a greater degree of exogeneity, and

would allow for the time period between onset of disability and           the
decision whether or not to apply for benefits and/or drop out of the

labor force. However, since we are using the 1969 original sample

which does not include retrospective health questions, we use the

variable LIMIT which partially reflects past health states.

      The second variable used is UE, which is the number         of   quarters

in the 40 quarters preceding 1968 in which the individual was not

credited with a quarter of coverage by the Social Security Adminis-

tration ($50 or more in wages in a calendar quarter or $100 or more

in self—employment income). Although the Social security Adminis-

tration does not specifically require a particular pattern of past

labor    force experience, the individual's preceding spells of unemploy-

ment and/or non—participation may be a factor in the certification

decision.

         Wages and benefits are entered separately in the equation in

order to allow more flexibility in the functional form and in inter-

preting the results. Collinearity would not appear to be a problem

here, with the correlation between the wage rate and benefits being

approximately .13 for the sample.

         The probit estimates in Tables 3 and 4 were done with non-

coverage of work under Social Security (UE) not included (column 1),

included (column 2). The results should be interpreted for the case

where tiE is included, assuming that tiE does not reflect a lagged value

of current labor force participation.5 Since UE is defined over the

past 40 quarters, this would reduce the likelihood that it is a lagged

value.

         Table 3, column (2) shows estimates for males regardless of mari-

tal status. The coefficients on marital status (MARRIED) and years of

schooling completed (EDUC) are positive and significant. The proxy

for health (LIMIT), age (AGE), and past non—coverage of work (UE) have

coefficients which are negative and significant. The coefficients of

LIMIT and tiE indicate the expected effect of poor health and past pe-

riods of nonwork in discouraging participation as a result of a favor-

able shift in the probability of certification. The negative effect

of LIMIT also reflects the effect of poor health in raising the

shadow price.

         It is also interesting to examine the coefficient on the race

dummy (RAcE). Although not highly significant, it is quite negative

(—.14).   This is not in line with the result found by Parsons (1980b),

whereby the race coefficient became virtually zero when controlling

for disability benefits.

      The coefficient for potential disability benefits (BEN) was

found to be —.0017, with a t—statistic of _i.i.6 The partial ef-

fect of benefits on labor force participation at the mean was —.0001,

with an elasticity of participation with respect to benefits of —.023.

The effect of benefits on participation found here is far smaller than

that found by Parsons (1980a,b). Parsons, in separate studies, found

elasticities of —.63 and —1.8 for middle—aged men.

      Table 4, column (2) shows probit estimates for the subsample of

married men. Estimates for most of the variables were similar to those

found for the total (married and unmarried) sample. For the married

subsample, wife's schooling (SPED) and wife's earnings (SPERN) were

added. The coefficients on SPED and SPERN were positive although not

highly significant.

      The coefficient on BEN was —.0026, with a t—statistic of -1.4.

This coefficient was slightly more negative than was the case for the

entire sample in Table 3. The greater negative valuation of disability

benefits for married men might reflect the availability of wife's

benefits, even when controlling for the wife's contribution to family

earnings (SPERN). The elasticity of participation with respect to

benefits at the means was —.031, still a great deal lower than Parson's

estimates.

  v.        clusion
           We have examined one possible factor which has
                                                            contributed   to the
  signifjcan recent growth in the Social
                                              Security Administration's Dis-
  ability Insurance (DI) program: that     of   labor supply incentives under
  the program.

         The examination of labor supply effects involved the effect of

  thedisability benefit structure (potential benefits) on labor force
 participation. A priori, it was expected that an increase in potential
 benefits would increase the value of time spent outside of      the labor
 market,   and would therefore reduce the probability of    working.
         Maximum likelihood probit estimates of labor force participation

 for males aged 58-63 in the
                                Longitudinal Retirement History Study (LRHs)
 indicated an elasticity of
                              participation with respect to benefits of
 —.023 for all men, and an elasticity of —.031 for married men. The

magnitude of these elasticities were far less than those found by other

authors such as Parsons.

        In interpreting these results from a social policy standpoint, a

few caveats should be noted. The
                                     analysis has ignored macroeconomic
factors such as the unemployment
                                    rate. Also not considered have been
temporal aspects of the Disability Insurance
                                                 program such as the five-
month waiting period for receipt of
                                       benefits, the appeals process, and
changes over time in the disability laws.

        The results obtained here do suggest a mixed response to the ques—

tion as to whether the Social
                                Security disability system should be
altered, or (as is a topic of lively current
                                                 debate) significantly di-
minished. The labor supply effects
                                      suggest relatively insignificant

      2The individual actually loses all of their benefits at K1 hours

of work, which we are "averaging" as a dollar—for—dollar reduction

along segment FG. Alternatively, we could have modeled this as a sharp

drop in the budget line from point F down to the horizontal axis, and

then a resumption of slope w along a segment below segment DH.


      3See Heckman (1976).


      4Hausxnan (1979) points out that fixed costs may lead to non—

convexities in the budget constraint faced by the worker because of

minimum labor supply conditions. These nonconvexities may cause

multiple tangencies of the indifference curve with the budget con-

straint, and cause the wage—shadow price approach to break down.


      5Since the variable UE reflects past labor force experience, this

may be measuring to a certain extent lagged values of the labor force

participation dependent variable.

       Taubman and Rosen (1980) have stressed the difference in inter-

pretation of results when the dependent variable represents a first

order difference from period t to period t +1, as opposed to a level

in period t.

       Consider the case of the effect of disability insurance on labor

force participation. If UE represented lagged labor force participation,

the coefficient on BEN would represent the difference in slopes between
                                F- 2


labor force participation "deterioration functions" where these functions

relate participation to time. On the other hand, to the extent that tiE

did not reflect lagged indicators of participation, the coefficients on

BEN would (in a cross—section) be measuring the difference in levels of

participation or the distance between deterioration functions at a given

point in time. For purposes of the analysis, participation is being

treated as a level.


      6 interaction term LIMIT x BEN was added to the equation. The

coefficient, however, was positive and significant. This seems to in-

dicate that the interaction term is picking up a past wage effect as

opposed to a benefit effect.
