          Patents and R&D: Searching for a Lag Structure

                            ABSTRACT


    This paper extends earlier work on the R&D to patents
relationship (Pakes—Griliches 1980, and Hausman, Hall, and
Griliches, 1984) to a larger but shorter panel of firms.
Using both non—linear least squares and Poisson type models
to treat the problem of discreteness in the dependent variable
the paper tries to discern the lag structure of this relation-
ship in greater detail. Since the available time series are
short, two different approaches are pursued in trying to solve
the lag truncation problem: In the first the influence of the
unseen past is assumed to decline geometrically; in the second,
the unobserved past series are assumed to have followed a low
order autoregression. Neither approach yields strong evidence
of a long lag. The available sample, though numerically large,
turns out not to be particularly informative on this question.
It does reconfirm, however, a significant effect of R&D on
patenting (with most of it occurring in the first year or two)
and the presence of rather wide and semi—permanent differences
among firms in their patenting policies.

     PATENTS AND R&D: SEARCHING FOR A LAG STRUCTURE*




    Bronwyn H. Hall, Zvi Griliches, and Jerry A. Hausman




                      INTRODUCTION



      In this paper we reexamine our earlier work on the rela-
tionship between R&D expenditures and patent applications
(Pakes-Griliches 1980, and Hausman, Hall and Griliches 1984)
using a larger sample and focusing primarily on trying to
characterize the lag structure of this relationship. Earlier
work had found a strong contemporaneous effect of R&D on patents
but was inconclusive as to whether there was a significant
lagged effect. Pakes and Griliches (1980) , using the standard
fixed effects model, found evidence of a lag truncation effect
in the distributed lag of patents on R&D. That is, when they
controlled for permanent differences across firms in the propen-
sity to patent, the estimated coefficient on the last lag of
R&D which they considered (R&D expenditures of four years prior)
was significantly higher than the coefficients of more recent R&D.
Hausman, Hall and Griliches (1984) used a different functional
form (which took the discreteness of the patent data explicitly
into account) and found similar results for the random (uncor—
related) effects model but not in their conditional fixed effects
version. When they conditioned their estimates on the total
number of patents received during the whole period, no coefficients
except for the contemporaneous R&D variable were statistically
significant either in the Poisson or negative binomial version.
                                 2




      Both studies used similar samples of about 120+ firms
with seven to eight years of patent data and twelve to thirteen
years of R&D data. In the meantime, a larger sample had become
available (see Bound et al, 1982, and Cummins, Hall and Laden-
man 1983) and it was decided to try to investigate this question
anew. Unfortunately, although this larger sample yielded con-
sistent data for close to 750 firms, it is relatively short on
R&D data. While we have patent data for the years 1967—77, the
R&D data are available only back to 1972 for most of these firms
and back to 1970 for about half of them. Thus, we cannot really
tell whether there may be long delayed lag effects (longer than
four years or so) . What we will be looking for is whether there
is a lag at all. The problem is complicated by our previous
finding of persistent individual firm differences in their pro-
pensity to patent. The need to allow for such individual effects
takes out much of the variance in the available short time series
on R&D and makes it rather hard to distinguish between "firms
differ because of their past R&D history" and "firms just differ"
views of how these data were generated.

      The other problem we have to deal with is the presence of
a large number of zeroes in our dependent variable, the number
of patents applied for in a particular year. We have dealt with
this in two ways: (1) We use nonlinear least squares with robust
standard errors on a model specified as P = expVp     log Rt_T) 4-
Et.
     Thi.s has the advantage of not requiring us to specify a
distribution for     but we are unable to obtain conditional
(fixed effect) estimates for this model due to its intrinsic
nonlinearity and the shortness of our panel. Therefore, (2) we
also chose to be explicit about the stochastic process generating
Pt and we estimated the comparable Poisson and negative binomial
versions of this relationship, including the conditional versions
of these models. (1)

      The basic model that we will use in estimating and inter-
preting our various results is

                                                             s+dt+ai
(1)         E(Pt             .
                                 ..x.t.s)   = e S'   x+S '




where the expected value of the number of patents applied for by
firm i in year t      (and ultimately granted) depends on the past
history of its R&D expenditures (xit= log       on permanent ob-
servable firm characteristics       (such as size, measured by the
net book value of its capital in 1972, and industrial specializa-
tion) , unmeasured permanent differences in their propensities to
patent x, and changes in the overall average propensity to
patent from year to year (across all firms) dt. The error
structure associated with different ways of estimating Cl) will
be discussed below. The main difference between various methods
of estimation will be in the treatment of zeroes, the extent to
which they recognize the intrinsic discreteness of the data, and
the weight that they give to different observations. Since
these issues were treated extensively in our previous papers, we
shall allude to them only briefly as we go along. The main prob-
lem that we shall be dealing with in this paper is the lack of a
long enough history on past R&D expenditures which will not allow
us to estimate this model fully in an unconstrained fashion. To
get somewhere we shall have to make strong assumptions either
about the structure of the 's as the lag increases or about
the structure of the unseen past x's. Before we elaborate
 further on this, it will prove useful to rewrite (1) in greater
detail and introduce the notion of the TI matrix (Chamberlain
 1980 and 1982) which sqmmarizes the available (linear) informa-
 tion on the relationship between the dependent variable and all
 the available x's.

                           II.   THE MODELS


      For ease of exposition, let us concentrate first on the
(log) linear version of our model.


                    Sox. + 1x1 + ...
(2)             =                             +       + i +

where the x's correspond now to the available information on
past R&D expenditures while the z. represent the impact of
the past (presample) unobserved history of the x's as of time
t. To simplify the exposition, we suppress the discussion of
the other terms (firm characteristics and time dummies) in this
section.      = log      is the dependent variable and e. is
a random error (sampling or specification) distributed indepen-
dently of the x's. Both z.. and          are vnobserved and may
be correlated with the included x's. If they are, the 3's
in (2) cannot be estimated consistently without making some
additional assumptions and/or transformations. If there were
no z1, the 's could be estimated consistently (barring
other problems such as errors in variables) from the 'within"
part of the samples, from deviations around each firm's own
means. We shall focus instead, at first, on the case where the
     are indeed important and the      are either absent or in-
dependent of the x's. Even in this case (no or uncorrelated
       we shall need to make strong assumptions about the
to be able to identify the 13's.Two classes of assumptions can be
used for this purpose, and we shall explore them both. The
first assumes that the contribution of past history decays geo-
metrically, at least after a few free terms in the lag structure.
I.e.,

                                                  2
                =
                    oxit   + 13i[x 1+Ax. 2+X                  + e.
                =
                    S0x    + Sj[x.1 +Xx2+. .
                                              5




where x10 is the first available x                          (that is, we are assuming
that we have available at least one lagged value of x) and z.
is the impact of the unobserved past history of the x's as of
the initial first period, whose importance declines at the rate
(1-A.) over time. Now, if we had only three cross—sections we
could rewrite          (3) as

                   =
                       0x3      +             +
                                                   A1x1     +
                                                                X2S1x0      +
                                                                                X2z+        e13


                   =                          +             +               +   Az.     +
                                                                                            e.2
                                      0x.2         S1x.1           AS1x.0

          yil
                                 .

                                                   soxil    +
                                                                    lxio    +
                                                                                    z   +




     Since    z is unobservable, estimating the observed part
of these equations (separately for each cross—section or jointly)
will result in biased coefficients, but the biases will be re—
lated and it may prove possible to unscramble them.
      Instead of treating each of these cross—sections asymet—
rically, as implied by (3'), consider estimating a symmetric
system, where each of the y's depends on all the available x's:


             'i3 =      7r3xL        +
                                         7132xi2
                                                   +   ?T31Xjj +                + v13

                   =                 +             +            +               +
                        u23x13           u22x2         u21x1

             Yil
                   =
                        l3i3         +             +            +               4 V0

      The resulting coefficients, the u's, summarize all the
available information about the (linear) relationship between
y's and of the x's in our sample. What is the expectation of
these   ii's ? To derive this, let us first define the projec-
tion of the excluded z.
                      1
                        on all the available x's:
                                                 6




(5)       E*(z x0,. ..x3) =                 6'x      =
                                                         63x3+62x2 + 61x1+60x0

where E* is the wide sense expectation operator and the 6's
are the projection or auxiliary equation coefficients? co-
efficients that summarize the relationship between the excluded
z and all the available x's. Given (5), it is easy to see
that the expectation of the estimated 7T' is equal to


          E*(n) =
(6)
                        26+13               A252+131 X261+X131 A260+2131


                                            X62+130           X61+131


                                            62


and the twelve available 's depend on only seven unknown
parameters (2 13's, 4 6's, and X). This matrix is in fact
heavily constrained. For example,

            =   71             =       71                 =     ii
                     23/1113                20fit10                  30fit20

and it is obvious how one would recover the 13's.  In practice,
this set of equations is estimated jointly, imposing the non-
linear constraints across equations. We shall use the non-
linear analogs of the SUR procedure in TSP to estimate such
models? allowing for arbitrary serial correlation of the
across time. This approach includes, as a special case, the
"random effects," uncorrelated a. 3-'s case. (.2)
                                                                               -




      [f we had just a's and no z's (e.g. A = 0), and the
a's were correlated with the x's, then by a similar argument

(7)      E*(a.x0,.. .     ,x3)
                                   =    m'x
                                             7




and the associated         TI       matrix would be

(8)          E*(fl) =
                                m3+S1        m2+S1   ml         m0

                               m3            m2+30   m1+S1      m0

                                                     m1+S0 m0+1


This is the pure fixed (or correlated) effects case, which could
also be estimated consistently from the "within" dimension of
the data (in the linear case)

         Assuming both the presence of z (X     0) and correlated
'5     would produce a II matrix which would be a mixture of (8)
and (6) and strain the identification potential of the data to
its limit. With a larger number of cross—sections such a model
might be estimable in principle but did not appear to be identifi-
able from the data available to us.
         One should note two other possible estimation approaches
to such a model. In the presence of the aj's one may be
tempted to first difference, with the result that (3') becomes

(9)         dy3 = 0dx3 + 31dx2 + A31dx1 + A(X—l)z                     +
                                                                          de3
            dy2 =                    B0dx2
                                             +
                                                 61dx1
                                                         +   (X—l)z   +
                                                                          de2

where dx =      x x1  —             and the associated       fl matrix is


(10)        E*(fl)=



                          c3              c2+130

where the c's are the coefficients in the projection of
(X—l)z     on the dx's. While this model is identified (1f31/1121 = A),
                                      8




the c's are unlikely to be well defined (since there may be
little correlation between the level variable z   and the sub-
sequent dx's) and an attempt to estimate all the coefficients
jointly may experience severe convergence problems.
       An alternative approach would take advantage of the geomet-
ric nature of the lag structure, and use lagged values of the
dependent variable to solve out the unobserved zr's. Using
the lagged dependent variables formulation would introduce both
an errors—in—variables problem (since      proxies for z sub-
ject to the e1 error) and a potential simultaneity problem
due to their correlation with the a. 's (even if the a 's are not
                                           1
correlated with the x's). Instruments are available, however,
in the form of past y's and future x's and thus such a system
might be estimable along the lines outlined by Bhargava and
Sargan (1983)

       We do not pursue this line further here because we will
be interested in estimating the nonlinear versions of our model,
where neither the first difference or the lagged dependent vari-
able option is available. In the nonlinear case, the first
difference approach is equivalent to taking ratios, which founders
on the presence of zeroes in our data. The lagged dependent
variable approach is also not operational since the instrumental
variable approach does not work for variables which are intrin-
sically nonlinear [i.e., there is no simple way to instrument
the (y1—e1) variable] . We shall return to this point
further on, when we show that even though we cannot estimate A
consistently, we can test the hypothesis A = 0 using Lagrange
Multiplier methods.
       While the      IT    matrix approach can be used also in the non—
linear context, it does require stronger assumptions to assure
consistency.   In particular, we shall have to assume the joint
normality of the z, and x,. That is, using (5) we can write

(11)       z    =   5'x    + r
                                        9



and rewrite (1) as

(12)          =   ei-               +       = [e+efi                    +


For non—linear least squares procedures to be consistent under
such circumstances we must assume independence between the
and the x's. Non—correlation, which follows from the projection
implicit in (11) is not enough.

      The preceding used constraints placed on the lag distribu-
tion of the past history of the x's to achieve identification.
Another approach to identification in such models is based on
assumptions about the past history of the x's and does not
require specific assumptions about the functional form of the
lag distribution (see Pakes and Griliches 1982). Let us return
to (3), free up the S's, and forget the a's for a moment:

where for illustrative purposes, we have assumed a five term lag
distribution with x1 through x3 constituting the relevant
unobserved past history of the x's. The basic assumption that
we shall make here is that the x's are generated by a relatively
simple autoregressive (AR) process. If, for example, x's follow
a first order AR, then in the projection of each of the unseen
x's on all the available x's

(14)       E*(x IxT0    . .x 3 )   = g 'x
                                    10


only the coefficient of x0 will be non—zero, since the partial
correlation of x1 with x, given x, is zero for all
T > 0 and t > 0.            The H matrix for this case is thus


(15)      E*(ll)=   S




                        0      0



and the first three S's can be estimated consistently, leaving
the last column of H free. If we had assumed that the x's
are AR(2), we would be able to identify only the first two
S's and would have to leave the last two columns of H free.&J)

      Following Chamberlain, the basic procedure in this type of
models is first to estimate the unconstrained version of the
H matrix, derive its correct variance—covariance matrix allowing
for the heteroscedasticity introduced by our having thrust the
parts of the a.1 or z.1 which are uncorrelated with the x's into
the random term (using the formulae in Chamberlain 1982, or
White 1980) , and then impose and test the constraints implied by
the specific version deemed relevant.

      Note that it is quite likely (in the context of longer T)
that the test will reject all the constraints at conventional
significance levels. This indicates that the underlying hypothe-
sis of stability over time of the relevant coefficients may not
really hold. Nevertheless, one may still use this framework to
compare among several more constrained versions of the model to
see whether the data indicate, for example, that "if you believe
in a distributed lag model with fixed weights, then two terms
are better than one."

                   III. DATA AND RESULTS

      The data we use are an extract from a larger and longer
panel of firms in U.S. manufacturing drawn from the Compustat
(Standard and Poor 1980) . This dataset was assembled and com-
bined with patent data from the Office of Technology Assessment
and Forecasting at the NBER and    is described in Bound et al
(1984) and Cummins, Hall, and Laderman (1982)   The original
universe from which our sample comes consisted of approximately
2700 firms in the manufacturing sector in 1976, and included
almost all of the firms which report R&D expenditures to the
Bureau of Census-NSF R&D survey.
      Our sample of firms was chosen from this universe by re-
quiring that data on sales, gross capital, market value (value
of common stock) , and R&D be available for all years from 1972
through 1977 with no large jumps during that period. A jump
is defined as an increase in capital stock or employment of more
than 100 percent or a decrease of more than 50 percent. This
test was not applied unless the change in employment was greater
than 500 employees or the change in capital stock was greater
than two million dollars. We also removed six firms wnicn had
abnormally small R&D values (less than $10,000) in one of the
years. The number of firms remaining in the sample after these
cuts was 738, with a size distribution heavily tilted toward the
larger firms in our original universe. Table 1 shows the selec-
tivity of this sample with respect to size and indicates that
although we have only a quarter of our original sample of firms,
most of those lost were either smaller or were not R&D-doing
(and reporting) firms. Our coverage of the larger R&D firms
is almost complete, and our sample includes 95 percent of the
R&D dollars expended by the manufacturing sector in 1976.

      Table 2 exhibits the characteristics of our remaining sample
of firms, both the 738 firms with R&D between 1972 and 1977 and a
subset of firms with a longer R&D history back to 1970. Quantiles
                              12



are shown in order to give some indication of the skewness of
the data: for example, median sales for this sample in 1976 was
177 million dollars, while mean sales was 979 million dollars.
The subset of firms with a longer R&D history consists of some-
what larger firms and is more heavily tilted toward the scienti-
fic sector. Even for this sample of relatively R&D—intensive
firms, we find that over 20 percent of the firms applied for
zero patents in 1976 and that more than half applied for less
than five. This confirms our impression that the patents
variable in this data must be treated in a way which correctly
reflects its relative imprecision at small values. Previous
experience with estimation of the patents equation in the
cross section (Bound et al 1982) has shown us that slope co-
efficient estimates may not be robust to changes in the way in
which we specify the error in the equation (and the weighting
which is implied by such specification)
      Bound et al found that estimates of the elasticity of
patenting with respect to R&D at the average R&D in the sample
varied from .35 to 2, depending on the choice of specification:
log linear, Poisson, negative binomial, or nonlinear least.
squares (exp (Xb)) . This difference was greatly attenuated when
the firms were divided into two groups, those with R&D budgets
larger than two million dollars and those with smaller R&D budgets.
In the present paper, the problem is not as severe, for two
reasons: first, our sample is more heavily weighted toward the
firms in the larger group (approximately 50 percent have R&D
greater than two million, rather than 20 percent) . Second, we
have chosen to estimate a linear relationship between the log of
patents and the log of R&D rather than the quadratic one in the
previous paper. In addition, we present standard errors for the
nonlinear least squares estimates which are computed without
assuming anything about the disturbances except that they are
additive and mean zero. That is, we assume that the model exp(Xb)
                                13




is correct but we let the data tell us the form of the hetero—
skedasticity. The formulas used are based on those of Eicker=
White—Chamberlain.

         Table 3 presents estimates of the nonlinear least squares
model,



 (16)           Pt = exp (ST log Rt_T) + e.


The estimates are obtained using the seemingly unrelated regression
(StiR) method. Specifically, we estimate the covariance of the
disturbances, £ ,      using residuals computed from the unconstrained
fl matrix, and then use this estimate as weights when computing all
the constrained models. This is a special case of generalized
least squares, and the objective function is


 (17)          (S) = e(S)   (E x 'N e()

where e is the "stacked" vector of residuals from the model
of equation (16). This method allows for a free correlation over
time for each firm, although it implicitly assumes that these
correlation patterns are the same from firm to firm in estimating
2 .   When we compute the standard errors for our estimates, we
do not impose this assumption; each observation (firm) is weighted
by its own residuals and their cross products, which allows for
the possible heteroskedasticity across firms.

         The first two rows of Table 3 present estimates of our most
general model of section 2, given by equation (3). First we
                              14



estimate a version with A equal to zero, which implies no
coefficients after the first two, and then we give the version
with X    free. Note that this model is fit within the context
of "random" rather than "correlated" firm effects, since the
high degree of correlation in our x's over time would make it
difficult to discern both a decaying lag structure and an effect
which has fixed coefficients with the x's over time. The
correlated effects question is addressed in the fourth row of
the table where, in addition to contemporaneous R&D and R&D lag-
ged once, we included all years of R&D with the same coefficients
in each equation. The estimated lag coefficients do not change
that much although the total effect drops from about .4 to .33,
and a test of significance of the correlated effects yields an
insignificant x.2 (6) = 4.4, using robust standard errors.
Accordingly, we feel reasonably confident that leaving out the
correlated effects should not bias our results too much.
      In fact, as can be seen in row 2, the model with geometric
decay on the lag coefficients after the first two is preferred.
The coefficient decays rather rapidly, 50 percent each year, but
it is estimated with considerable imprecision, so this result also
should not be taken too seriously. As we saw in section 2,
another way to ask the same questions is to model the past his-
tory of the x's, rather than of the coefficients. Although
there is some evidence that an AR(l) process might do just as
well, we choose to model them as an AR(2) process to be on the
conservative side. Then the fl matrix to be estimated has its
last two rows free due to correlation of the first two x 's with
the left out x's. Otherwise, it has free lag coefficients on
the diagonals and above, and zeroes below. The results for this
version are given in row 3 of Table 3, and show not much evidence
in the data of a lag longer than about two years.

      There are several findings of interest in Table 3. First,
the estimated total elasticity of patents with respect to R&D
                            15



expenditures is fairly stable across different versions, 0.33
to 0.43, except for the full model with geometric decay on
the lag coefficients. In this model it rises to .51, suggest-
ing that there is something, although it is small, in the firm's
history of R&D expenditures that matters for patenting. Second,
it appears that the effect of R&D peaks after one year. Even
in the geometric lag case, the estimated average lag of patents
applied for behind R&D expenditures is only one and one half years.
Third, it is difficult to tell whether there is any significant
lag beyond the first two years. In both the AR(2) case and the
geometric lag model, the additional terms are at best only mar-
ginally significant.
      To check on these conclusions, especially the last, we
have redone the same computations for the hafl of our sample
(N = 394) where we have data on R&D for two additional past years,
1970 and 1971. These results are shown in Table 4 and are incon-
clusive. The finding that correlated effects do not matter very
much seems to hold up in these data (compare rows 1 and 4 again,
and note that the goemetric decay model estimates almost the
same total effect with a better fit). However, the total contri-
bution of the lags beyond the first year in the A free model is
small (about .13) and in the AR(2) version it is negative,
albeit with large standard errors.

      We turn next to the results of estimating the Poisson and
negative binomial versions of our models. The advantage of these
models is that they take explicitly into account the non—negativ-
ity and discreteness of our data. Moreover, the conditional
versions of these models allow us to estimate a fixed effects
model, something that we could not do easily with the nonlinear
least squares estimates discussed in the previous section. On
the other hand, because they are significantly more expensive to
                                      16



compute and more complicated to manipulate, we cannot really
explore all the alternative hypotheses about the lag structure
in their framework.

      These models were described in detail in our earlier paper
(Hausman, Hall, Griliches 1984) and we shall summarize only their
main features here: The log likelihood function for the Poisson
model is given by



                      N     T
           log L =                         -

                                 [y.t!         exp(X.t13) +



and its conditional version is
                                                              -
                     N     T                    T

                                  1



       The Poisson estimates differ from the Nonlinear Least
Squares ones reported in Tables 3 and 4 primarily by the weight-
ing scheme used. The reported NLS estimates are unweighted,
weighting implicitly the numerically larger deviations of the
larger firms more than those of small firms. The Poisson esti-
mates assume that the variance of the disturbances is proportional
to the expected value of patents and weight the observations
accordingly. The negative binomial version of the model general-
izes the Poisson model by allowing for an additional source of
variance above that due to pure sampling error. The logarithm
of the likelihood for this model is

We estimate all these models using standard maximum likelihood
techniques.

       Since these models differ only by their distributional as-
sumptions and not by the specification of the expected value they
should all yield roughly the same results unless the basic speci-
fication of the model is wrong. In fact, it can be shown (see
Gourieroux, Monfort, and Trognon 1981) that the NLS estimates
are consistent even if the true distribution is Poisson and the
Poisson estimates are consistent even if the true distribution
is the negative binomial. Because they make different assump-
tions about the variance structure they do yield different esti-
mates of standard errors, even in the case of similar coefficients.

      Table 5 gives the major results of such computations. The
first half of this table corresponds to the model estimated in
our earlier paper and includes a time—R&D interaction in a search
for possible changes in the "fecundity" of R&D over time. In
general this interaction is not significant both because of the
rather short period examined, the six years of 1972—77, and
                               18



because there may not have been any systematic changes in the
R&D coefficient over this period. (5) The second half of Table
5 corresponds to the models examined in Tables 3 and 4, with
patents being a function of current and lagged R&D expenditures,
but allowing also for permanent differences across firms in their
patenting propensities. The results are rather similar except
that in this format the first R&D coefficient is higher than the
second and the estimated sum of the coefficients is somewhat
lower in the Poisson case, although not in the negative binomial.
      We turn now to the question whether there is any evidence
for additional lags within this framework and we try to use the
information contained in the lagged y's, past patenting levels,
to infer something about the importance of the unseen past. If
the lag structure were geometric after the first two terms then
we could solve out equation (3) for the missing y's and sub-
stitute        for them. However, what is needed here is the
true "index value' of         not its observed value which is
subject to significant sampling error. While in the usual linear
or log—linear models one could get around this by using instru-
mental variables, here, because of the intrinsic nonlinearity of
(y_e)A this does not really work. We turn, therefore, to a
Lagrange Multiplier test of the hypothesis that       belongs
in the equation. The test itself is outlined in Appendix A.
It is based on the computed residuals from the conditional Poisson
model. These residuals, which are computed assuming that
does not enter into the model, are then regressed on log
The coefficient in this regression should be zero if the null
hypothesis is indeed correct. Since
                                      _1   is subject to sampling
error, the resulting regression coefficient may be attenuated
and one may wish to use an instrumental variable estimation pro-
cedure here which is now consistent since the coeffi—
cient enters linearly in this equation. We use log
                                                     _2    as an
instrument, assuming that all the relevant serial correlation
has been taken care of by the estimated fixed effects. (6)
                             19



      The results of such computations are quite clear. For the
equation reported in column 5 of Table 5 , the estimated coeffi-
cient is .041 with an estimated t—ratio (using robust standard
errors) of .16 . using an instrumental variable estimator the
same numbers are .02 and .07 respectively. Thus, there is
no evidence that there is any additional serial correlation or
lagged x's effect left after one allows for permanent differ-
ences in the patenting propensity across firms.
      An alternative way of asking this question is to look at
the half of our sample where we have data on two more years of
lagged R&D, back to 1970. This is shown in the last part of
Table 5, where we see that including two more lagged logR terms
in the conditional Poisson and negative binomial models neither
improves the fit nor results in statistically significant coef-
ficients. The conclusion remains the same: allowing for fixed
effects it is not possible to estimate longer lag effects of
R&D in these data. The significant effect that one can observe
occurs in the first year or two.

      There are at least two reasons for our failure to discern
clear evidence of a longer lag structure from our data. First,
the effects we are looking for are relatively small (relative
to our ability to estimate them) . Assume, for a moment, that
the true total long run elasticity of patenting with respect
to R&D expenditures is 1. We estimate that about .4 of it
occurrs in the first two years and associate it with applied
research and development expenditures. The effects of basic
research take much longer, are more random, and hence are
"smeared" over a longer period. Say that the rest of the effect,
0.6, is distributed over the next eight years. Then the average
coefficient that we are looking for is .07, which is about the
order of standard errors of such coefficients in our data. That
is, the effect we are looking for is below the resolution power
of our data.
                              20



      The second related reason has to do with the properties
of the R&D series in the real world. By and large, different.
firms have roughly constant (over a six year horizon) R&D
budgets, which change from year to year, but largely randomly
from the point of view of the sample as a whole. The first five
serial correlation coefficients of log R.t are estimated (using
the MaCurdy (1982) approach) to be .99, .99, .96, .95 and .97
respectively, while the comparable serial correlations of the
first differences are —.05, —.02, .01, .06; all not signifi-
cantly different from zero. That is, we cannot reject the
hypothesis that log Rtt follows a random walk. This should
make it clear why we cannot estimate much of a lag structure
without having a long history of data. There may be effects
from the unseen past but we cannot learn about it from the ob-
served present if it is largely uncorrelated with it.



                          IV. CODA

      We should not close this paper on the usual note of the
failure of the data to live up to our econometric expertise.
Even though we have not been able to elucidate the R&D to
patents lag structure better, our overall findings are quite
interesting, showing a persistent significant effect of R&D on
patenting and rather wide and semi—permanent differences across
firms in their patenting policies. The later finding provides
the challenge for further and different style research: trying
to understand how and why firms differ in their responses to the
technological environment they find themselves in.

1. Note that nonlinear least squares is consistent even if
is distributed as Poisson or Negative Binomial and the Poisson
estimates are consistent even if the true distribution is Negative
Binomial. See Gourieroux, C., A. Monfort and A. Trognon, 1981,
and Hausman, Hall, and Griliches 1984.

2. The procedure we use is not fully efficient since we do not
take into account in the estimation the possible heteroscedasti—
city across i introduced by the projection of z on x and
inclusion of the remainder in the new disturbance.     (See Chamber-
lain 1982 for more detail.) We do, however, allow for such
heteroscedasticity in computing our standard errors using formulae
based on White 1980.

3. If the stochastic process generating the x's can be assumed
to be stable over time, efficiency could be improved by estimating
the g's jointly with the S's. See Pakes—Griliches 1982 for more
discussion on this.

4. For comparison purposes with subsequent models, this one is esti-
mated with the 1972 parameters left free and the 5's starting
only from 1973 on.

5. The year constants do decline in 1976 and 1977 but this
reflects the truncated property of our data. They are based on
total patents granted up to the end of 1979 and hence do not
include some of the patents applied for in 1976 and 1977 to be
granted after 1979. The year dummies decline by 7 and 21 per-
cent respectively, relative to 1973-75, which is very close to
the estimated decline in coverage: 4 and 21 percent respectively.

      In this appendix we develop a Lagrange Multiplier (LM)
test for the presence of a lagged dependent variable in a
Poisson type model. Since exponential models can always be
written in generalized least squares form, we write the model
which we wish to test as



(A.l)
                     X. +a,
                  = e it        i       A
                                                 +
                                                     Lit
where            is the "true" value of the lagged dependent vari-
                           —
able, equal to                 Lit_i
                                 Because we do not observe z
and it enters nonlinearity into the equation, we cannot estimate
(A.l) directly by instrumental variables. Instead we estimate
equation (A.l) under the null hypothesis    A = 0.

                     X, S+a.1
(A.2)             = e it            +


andwe do anLMtest for A                 =   0.
        The gradient of the sum of squares function (likelihood
function) for equation (A.l) with respect to A             is




(A.3)
                     X. +cz.
                 = (e it       '    (log z.t1) zi) L.t

Therefore,   an approximate LM test is to take the estimated re-
siduals from equation (A.2) and to do least squares with weights
e X±tS÷aI, on the equation:
(A.4)                = e   (log Y±) +

The test is a significance test on the estimated coefficient
0. We estimate equation (A.5) by instrumental variables to take
account of the possible errors in variables problem, which arises
from the fact that we use log         rather than log
        = (zt1   +
