            'Precautionary' Saving Revisited
Social Security, Individual Welfare, and the Capital Stock

                             ABSTRACT




This paper focuses on precautionary saving against uncertain longevity
and on the annuity insurance aspects of social security within the life—
cycle framework. The principal findings are three. First, the
evolution of social security is reviewed in response to missing markets
for providing insurance for consumption in the face of lifetime
uncertainty. A simple life—cycle model is used to show that even an
actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can reduce
national saving. Second, to the extent that the introduction of social
security reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect on the
consumption of subsequent generations is diminished. Finally,
consideration of the welfare gains from compulsory social security
requires an examination of the tradeoff between the benefits to early
participants from access to the annuities and the costs to generations
that follow of a lower capital stock. Across a range of parameter
values, the partial equilibrium impact of social security on consumption
is reversed. The introduction of an explicit bequest motive ivitigates
both the initial impact of social security on saving and the long—run
welfare loss from the introduction of social security.

 1.   INTRODUCTION

      Discussions    of the impact of social security on saving have

extended analysis of and estimation of life—cycle models of consumption

 (cf., Modigliani and Ando, 1957; Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954).1

Empirical work is usually conducted in the certainty version of the

model, wherein social security affects wealth accumulation in two ways:

(i) reducing disposable income by the amount of the tax, and

(ii) increasing lifetime resources and raising consumption over the       life
cycle to the extent that the present value of benefits exceeds the

present value of taxes paid.

      The emphasis here is on precautionary saving against uncertain

longevity and on the annuity insurance aspects of social security within

the life—cycle framework. This is a departure from the literature

beginning with Feldstein's (1974) seminal paper (and the corresponding

arguments in Barro, 1974, 1978), which focuses on the impact on

consumption of the way in which social security is financed, i.e., the

degree to which an unfunded social security system decreases private

saving.2 The principal findings are three. First, the evolution of

social security is reviewed in response to missing markets for providing

insurance for consumption in the face of uncertain lifetimes. A simple

life—cycle   model is put forth in section II to show that even an
actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can reduce
individual saving by more than the tax paid.3
      Second, the large   partial equilibrium saving impacts   found in
Section   II are mitigated when initial endowments are considered.

Specifically, accidental bequests, which arise in the model because of

lifetime uncertainty, provide an intergenerational link for saving
                                   —2—



decisions.    To the extent that the introduction of social security

reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect of social

security on the consumption of subsequent generations is diminished.

      Finally, while it is true that social security reduces individual

saving to a lesser degree in the generations after its introduction,

there is still a reduction in the aggregate capital stock in the long

run.4 Ultimately, consideration of the welfare gains from compulsory

social security requires an examination of the tradeoff between the

benefits to early participants from access to the annuities and the

costs to generations that follow of a lower capital stock.

      That general equilibrium analysis is carried out in Section IV.

Across a range of parameter values, the partial equilibrium impact of

social security on per capita consumption is reversed. Consumption and

welfare of the representative individual are reduced in the new steady

state. The introduction of an explicit bequest valuation function in

Section V mitigates the initial impact of social security on saving and

reduces   the long—run welfare loss from the introduction of social
security.
      Conclusions   and directions for future research are presented in

Section VI.




II.   SOCIAL SECURITY AN1) SAVING IN A LIFE-CYCLE W)DEL

      A. Individual Saving Decisions

      The type of precautionary saving considered here is that against

uncertain longevity. Yaari's (1965) seminal paper showed that with an

uncertain lifetime, intertemporal utility maximization can dictate
                                       —3—

 saving for the possibility of living longer than the expected lifetime

 to avoid depreviation in old age.5 That excess saving can be large.

Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981, P. 379) found for a set of plausible

underlying parameter values that the present expected value of

unintended bequests represented almost 25 percent of initial wealth for

a single male aged 55.

     To emphasize this point, consider the following life—cycle model.

Agents are assumed to be selfish, in that no bequests are desired; the

implications of relaxing this assumption are discussed in Section V.

The retirement age Q is taken as exogenous, and individuals live at

least Q periods. The probability of having died in the interval {O,tJ

      for each t; by assumption, i is equal to zero in the interval

[O,Q]. Individuals have an expected lifetime of D years, with D' > D

being the maximum age to which one can survive.6 Individuals are

assumed to supply labor inelastically and receive a gross wage    w in
each period t during their working life; individual wages are assumed to

grow over the working period at a constant rate g.

     Following Yaari (1965) and Barro and Friedman (1977), let utility

be additively separable across periods, and let U(C) be evaluated

contingent on being alive at time t. That is, the consumer's

intertemporal choice model is given by7

    (1)         max          (l—p) U(C) (1)_t
                      t =0
subject to8


                  C(1+r) =             +             (1+)t
                                  A0       w0
                                                tO

where C, 5, and r represent consumption and the (constant) subjective

discount rate and interest rate, respectively. A0 represents initial

resources from unplanned bequests from the previous generation.
                                      —4—

      Assuming U(C) =!1, we can rewrite (1) as9



      (2)        max
                                 Ct1(1)_t

                 tO C(1+r)           A0       w0



      Carrying out the maximization in (2) yields an optimal consumption

stream of

                                                         1+g i
                              A0+w0 i-U
      (4)        CU =

and

                                              1              1        ii   -.1

        The extent to which uncertainty over length of life affects the

stream of consumption depends on agents' degree of relative risk

aversion (a transformation of y, the elasticity of marginal utility

function). The higher is an individual's degree of relative risk

aversion (or, equivalently, the lower is his intertemporal elasticity of

substitution in consumption), the slower will consumption grow over

time.

 B.   The Introduction of Social Security
      Access to fair annuity market could remove the influence of

 lifetime uncertainty on consumption. Individuals could exchange a

 portion of their labor income when young to smooth consumption in old

 age.'° If all individuals were identical in terms of their survival

probabilities, then a competitive equilibrium would be possible. That

is, as individual deaths are presumably independent, annuities would be

actuarially fair in the competitive equilibrium.

      The existence of a competitive equilibrium may be precluded by

asymmetries of information between individuals and insurers. This is,

of course, the familiar "adverse selection" phenomenon, discussed by

Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). They found that the competitive outcome

may be inefficient, in the sense that the imposition of a common

contract in addition to the competitively supplied contracts may be

Pareto—improving. An interpretation of this compulsory additional

contract as social security has been offered by Eckstein, Eichenbaum,

and Peled (1983). There may be additional "moral hazard" or "free—

rider" barriers to the existence of an annuities market. If individuals

conjecture that the state will support them in deprivation, the need to

purchase annuities is diminished.

      Public provision of the annuities through public pensions is one

possibility.- Moral hazard problems still make voluntary participation

difficult. Consider, though, a social security system of the following

form. Individuals are compelled to pay a payroll tax at rate   t on
gross wages, from which the social security system is funded. During

retirement they receive annuity benefits St in each period t until

death. The budget constraint in (2) becomes

If benefits are set according to a replacement rate of the terminal

wage, then the economy—wide actuarially fair benefit S satisfies the

condition that'2

                        t=Q+1                          t=Q+1


Since w is greater than unity, the system generates an increase in

lifetime resources. Note that this increase in resources occurs even in

a system which is actuarially fair and fully funded (i.e., in which
                                    —7—

contributions are invested and earn the market rate of return r in each

period).12 In reality, the initial cohorts participating in social

security received a rate of return greater than the actuarially fair

return   (see   Hurd and Shoven, 1983). This analysis focuses only on an

actuarially fair system to point out that the negative impact of social

security on individual saving does not hinge on such initial
transfers. 13


       Table 1 shows the percentage increase in lifetime resources

generated by an actuarially fair social security system under various

assumptions about the rate of interest and the social security payroll

tax rate.'4 For example, when r = 0.06 and t =      0.10,   a 16 percent

increase in the propensity to consume out of lifetime resources is

afforded by an actuarially fair social security system. Because the

system generates an increase in lifetime consumption, individual saving

is reduced by more than the amount of the tax paid.

        The existence of social security annuities does not preclude the

possibility of excess demand for old—age annuities. Suppose for example

that effective participation in the system is higher for low—income

individuals than for high—income individuals. Let w represent the

ceiling on taxable income; the growth rate of the taxable wage base and

the determination of the replacement rate are as before. The budget

constraint in (7) then becomes

                 is               (f—).   The impact of social security on an

                                 so
                      lifetime resources depends on his income. As an annuity,

social security administered in this way generates a smaller reduction

in saving for high—income people than for low—income people.




III.     SOCIAL SECURITY AND DYNAMIC WEALTH ACCUMULATION

       A.        Individual Saving Behavior
       We can use the derivation from the previous section of the impact


of mandatory actuarially fair social security on saving to study

individual wealth accumulation over time. For any time t, the present

value (at time 0) of an individual's accumulated stock of wealth, AUt

(i.e., the present value of the "accidental bequest" of an individual

who died in period t), can be expressed as



       (9)              Ao =     (1 + r)'((l — t)w.       + S — C.).



Wages and social security benefits are the sources of income to the
                                                  —9—

individual. Wages are zero in the interval [Q÷1, D'J, and social

security benefits are zero in the interval [0,Q]. Using the expressions

derived above for w, St and C, we can rewrite (9) as

        The ratio AOt/VL tracks an individual's accumulated stock of assets

relative to lifetime earnings. In a world of no uncertainty over

longevity, AOt/VL is simply a function of age, and the results of the

basic life—cycle model are reproduced, as long as the present values of

social security contributions and benefits are equal. With lifetime

uncertainty, an actuarially fair social security system generates an

increase in individual lifetime resources, and lifetime consumption

rises. Much of this increase in consumption comes during an

individual's working life, as the need to save for retirement is

reduced. Depending on risk aversion, while retirement consumption is

higher in the presence of social security, dissaving in retirement is

likely to be less than in the certainty case.'5

       The problem becomes more complicated when the insurance coverage

provided   by social security is not the same across individuals. Suppose
again   that there is a ceiling on the level of earnings against which
payroll tax rates and replacement rates are calculated. If                               that   ceiling
is   w in period 0 and grows at the same rate as the wage base, then the

effective tax rate is not t,                 t   ',
                                                      =   t       (f—).   From equation (11), the
                                                           SW0
ratio of wealth to lifetime earnings should rise with the level of

lifetime earnings, though at a decreasing rate.16 This nonlinearity of

 saving rates with respect to lifetime earnings occurs in the absence of
 any explicit bequest motive.

 B. Long—Run Effects on Individual Saving

      Given uncertainty over length of life, an actuarially fair social

 security system can reduce individual saving by more than the amount of

 the taxes paid. For plausible underlying assumptions ahout individual

discount rates, survival probabilities, and the intertemporal elasticity

of substitution in consumption, the magnitude of that reduction is

substantial. The partial equilibrium conclusion is clear ——      estimates
of the reduction in individual saving brought about by social security

that focus only on the extent to which the system delivers a present

value of anticipated benefits greater than the present value of taxes

paid underestimate the true impact. Before discussing gereral

equilibrium interpretations of this finding (in the sense that the wage

rate and interest rate are endogenous and respond to changes in the

saving rate), it is important to address the issue raised in the

simulation exercises of the links among generations provided by

accidental bequests.

     An initial bequest from an   "early   death" of one's parent raises the

beneficiary's consumption relative to lifetime earnings. In the model,

the size of that bequest depends on the testator's coverage by social

security and his age at death. By facilitating greater consumption out

of lifetime earnings, social security reduces the accidental bequest.

On that account, the initial resources available to the heir (and

consumption when young) are lower. Even within the partial equilibrium

analysis, the impact of social security on the consumption and saving

patterns of individuals in a given generation depends on the balance

between the effective increase in lifetime resources made possible by
                                            — 12 —



access to a fair annuity and the reduction in inheritances because of

that impact on the saving of the previous generations.'7

    To see this more clearly, note that given an average age of death

of D, an individual testator's expected bequest relative to lifetime

resources aD is

                                                   i=0
     In general, the net increment to lifetime resources made possible

by social security depends on the age at which the parent died

(magnitude of the unplanned bequest). The role of family mortality

history is important here, as individuals whose progenitors all died

early will receive large bequests relative to those whose parent lived a

long time.

    Members of the first generation to participate in the social

security system benefit in two respects, as their lifetime resources are

augmented both by the bequests from the (uninsured) previous generation

and the gains from participation in the social security annuity

system. The reduced value of accidental bequests permits smaller

consumption gains for subsequent generations. While it is true that

social security reduces individual saving to a lesser degree in the
                                     — 13 —



 generations after its introduction, there is still a reduction in the

 long—run capital stock. Ultimately, to consider the potential welfare

gains from compulsory pensions, the tradeoff between the benefits to

early participants from access to the annuities and the costs to

generations that follow of a lower capital stock must be examined.



IV. GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

        The partial equilibrium effects of social security on individual
saving will be dampened      in a general equilibrium analysis of the impact

on aggregate capital formation. The reduction in individual wealth

accumulation brought about by social security will induce changes in

factor returns, exhibiting both income and substitution effects on

consumption. A higher interest rate decreases the present value of

lifetime resources; in addition, a higher rate of interest reduces the

price of consumption in old age.'9

        The following simple model of production and factor prices is used

to examine the impact of savings against lifetime uncertainty on

aggregate saving. Output Q is assumed to be produced according to a

Cobb—Douglas production function in capital K and effective labor L; the

capital share is equal to .        Again, labor L is inelastically supplied,
and labor—augmenting technical change occurs at a constant rate g, so

that




       (14)      L = (1+g)   L.




Hence output is determined by
                                             — 14 —




      (15)      Q =   K    L1

or, using lower—case letters to denote variables in intensive form



      (16)      q =   k.

Factor markets are assumed to be competitive, so that capital and labor

are paid their marginal products, i.e.,



                          ci —1
      (17)      r ak


and




      (18)     w = (1—o.)k.



      The work force grows at a constant rate n, producing a total

effective growth rate of n + g +             ng.   Aggregate saving SS is assumed to

be equivalent to the increase in the capital stock; that is, the

depreciation rate is set equal to zero. The capital stock is assumed to

result from individual saving and assets of the funded social security
          20
system.

      We can now solve for the steady—state values of aggregate

consumption, the aggregate capital stock, and the interest rate.

Aggregate consumption out of labor income in any period j in the absence

of social security can be written as

                                                              1

The definition of steady—state equilibrium requires that



     (20)      wL + rK — C          SS =    (n   + g + ng) K,



so that


                                                     1
                                            —1
     (21)         k = [(1-tx)                    )]1Ct




Hence the steady—state interest rate r solves


                        (—---)(n + g + rig)
                         1-tx
    (22)          r =
                                1
                                    -   C



     The steady state can be solved for as follows. A guess is made for

k. Solutions for r and w are then generated from the marginal

productivity conditions to produce individual consumption and wealth

profiles. The resulting aggregate consumption arid capital stock in

intensive form are compared with the initial guess, and iteration

proceeds until convergence is reached.

     To quantify the impact of social security on aggregate consumption,

the capital stock, and the welfare of a representative individual, the

general equilibrium system described above can be simulated for

plausible parameter values. In the Cobb—Douglas production function,

  is set equal to --.     The following relationships among the parameters

of the individual's optimization                                                            21
                                            problem are assumed: r > g, r > 5, and   > 0.
In addition, the interest rate is assumed to exceed the growth rate of

      There is some evidence on the value of y in the literature. In

their study of household portfolio allocation, Friend and Blume (1975)

estimated the coefficient of relative risk aversion to be in excess of

2.0, implying a value of y of at most —       1.0.   Farber's (1978) estimation

of preferences of United Mine Workers from collective bargaining

agreements yielded estimates of the coefficient of relative risk

aversion of 3.0 and 3.7. Hansen and Singleton (1983) found estimates of

the coefficient of relative risk aversion between 0 and 2.0. Here,

three alternative values of i will be used: —1.0, —3.0, and —5.0.

      Table 2 below describes the no—social—security steady states under

the three values of y, presenting the interest rate (r), output per

worker (q), consumption per head (c), capital per worker (k), and the

saving rate (s/q).

     Because of the risk of living longer than expected and facing

deprivation in retirement, substantial unplanned bequests are added on

average to the capital stock. The capital stock is higher in the more

risk—averse (y = —3, y = —5) economies because of the higher average

accidental bequests. As result, the interest rate is lower and per

capita consumption is higher in those cases.

     As in the discussion in Section II, the introduction of an

actuarially fair social security system permits an increase in

individual lifetime consumption. The resulting increase in consumption

lowers the capital stock, raising the interest rate and lowering the

wage rate in the new steady state. For the three cases considered here,

with an assumed tax rate t5 of 0.10, social security initially increases

the rate of consumption by 16.7 percent when y = — 1.0,     by 17.5 percent
when y = — 3.0, and by 17.8 percent when y = — 5.0.23     In Table 3 below,

we consider the impact of introducing an actuarially fair, fully funded

social security system (when t = 0.10) on the steady state values of

the variables described in Table 2.24

     Note that in all cases the introduction of the social security

annuity system leads to a significant reduction in the saving rate and

the aggregate capital stock. The reductions in the capital stock are

approximately half the value of the partial equilibrium reductions. As

pointed out earlier, while social security permits higher consumption

out of lifetime resources, intergenerational transfers (bequests) are

lowered, and the increase in the interest rate and decrease in the wage

rate work to lower lifetime resources. Though the rate of consumption

increases more initially as y gets smaller, the greater initial increase

in r is counterbalanced by a greater fall in w, narrowing the gap among

the cases. In the results presented here, per capita consumption

declined because of the fall in output. These losses in consumption per

head cannot, however, be interpreted as a measure of a change in steady—

state welfare, for which the appropriate concept is the utility of a

representative individual.

     The lifetime utility of a representative individual entering at

time j   (denoted V-) is


    (23)           V =
                           t=O

Substituting for C in (23) yields an expression for V that depends on

lifetime resources, the interest rate, and the social security tax rate:


    (24)           V- =!         EPV        x
                                       t            Q

                     w   (g) (1+t (w—1))(



                                                            EPV.
           where     = ( (j÷)(1÷))[(1-(1+t(w-1))(       D   EPV.
                                    — 20 —



       Differences   in welfare can be compared across steady states by

computing the percentage change in lifetime earnings (or w0, given g and

r) that would be necessary to yield the level of utility achieved in the

new steady state. That is, equation (24) below must solved for A,, which

serves as a measure of the difference In welfare between the two steady

states.




       (25)     V(w01(1+A,),r',t') = V(w02, r2, t2).



       Following the earlier experiment, we consider the introduction of

social security with t5 = 0.10 for the three cases

of y   = — 1.0, y = —3.0, y = — 5.0. The value of A is summarized in Table

4 below. In all cases, the reduction in the capital stock from the

imposition of the social security program leads to welfare losses in the

new steady state on the order of 9—12 percent of lifetime income, or

roughly four years' earnings.

      The results in Table 4 indicating that the introduction of a

 funded, actuarially fair social security system reduces steady—state

welfare are subject to some important qualifications. First, the

 analysis in Sections II — IV assumed the absence of any explicit bequest

motive. For any given set of parameter values, a positive bequest

motive would raise individual saving rates and mitigate the impact of

social security on the propensity to consume of the initial generation

and of generations to come. Second, the model has assumed complete

failure in the provision of private annuities. Finally, real—world

limitations on borrowing against future earnings dampen the impact of

social security on lifetime consumption. The first of these points is

considered in detail in the next section. The remaining two are

discussed briefly in Section VI.




V.   BEQUESTS AND THE LIFE—CYCLE GROWTH W)DEL

     A.   Individual Saving Behavior
     The theoretical and simulation results presented heretofore have

ignored the existence of explicit bequest motives. Some recent analyses

have suggested, however, that bequests and other intergenerational

transfers may account for a significant portion of the capital stock

(see for example Kotlikoff and Summers, 1981).   In the context of social

security, the discussion of bequests has centered around the question of

whether intergenerational transfers are adjusted in response to

liabilities placed on future generations by an unfunded system (see

Feldstein, 1974; Barro, 1974, 1978).
                                   — 22 —




     Again, to focus on the insurance features of social security, the
emphasis here is on a funded, actuarially fair system. That individuals

might gain utility from leaving a bequest (to provide capital to heirs

or for prestige or security) mitigates the impact of social security

annuities on life—cycle saving.

     Consider the basic individual optimization problem from before with

the addition of a bequest motive of the following form



    (26)       max (1 -    p)     U(Ct)(1)         + U(BD)(1+)D


subject to



                                            D =
                    C(1+r) + BD(1+r)              A0 + w0
                                                                  ()t
                                                            tO

where C, S, and r are as before. A0 and BD represent initial resources

and the bequest at the expected date of death D, respectively.

    Assuming U(C)      C and U(BD) =
                                        - B,        we can rewrite (26) as




    (27)       max(1_pt)Ct1(1)_t +B(l)




subject to the same budget constraint. The parameter               indexes the

desire to leave bequests; that is, a large value of              indicates a

significant desire to leave a bequest to one's heirs.
                                            — 23 —



        This   bequest framework is used by Seidman (1984) in his analysis of

the transition from capital taxation to consumption taxation in a life—

cycle growth model.25 Seidman points out that a given steady state with

a particular saving rate can be generated by different combinations of a

subjective discount rate and bequest motive. The more powerful is the

bequest motive, the greater is the discount rate parameterizing the

initial steady state. If r > S, the gain in lifetime resources offered

by access to the social security annuity system is smaller than in the

no—bequest case.

        Carrying out the optimization in (27) yields an optimal consumption

stream of




      (28)         Ct =   C0(.)'(1          —




where

                                           Qi

      (29a)




While the existence of a bequest motive does not change the shape of the

age—consumption profile, it does lower the fraction of lifetime

resources devoted to lifetime consumption.

      The addition of the bequest motive described here modifies

equations (ha) and (lib) as follows:

       As in the previous section, suppose that the aggregate production

 function is Cobb—Douglas, with a capital share of a.                              We can now solve

 for the steady—state values of aggregate consumption, the aggregate

 capital stock, and factor prices. Aggregate consumption in any period j

 in the absence of social security can be written as

      Two countervailing effects surface in examining the impact of

social security on steady—state consumption and welfare in the bequest

case. In the presence of the bequest motive modeled here, the increase

in consumption accompanying a social security system of a given size is

not as great as in the no—bequest case. However, because the capital—

labor ratio is higher in the bequest regime, the interest rate is lower,

and the gain from participating in a social security system of a given

size (i.e., a given t5)     is   greater (because w is greater).

with higher capital—labor ratios and higher saving rates.

     The results from introducing an actuarially fair, funded social

security system with t = 0.10 are displayed in Table 6; again only the

case of y = —1.0 is considered. The same five bequest regimes as in

Table 5 are considered. For the first four cases, the capital—reducing

(output—reducing) effect of social security still outweighs the

consumption—increasing effect; per capita consumption falls in the new

steady state in each case. As expected, larger values of 8 are

associated with smaller declines in consumption per head, as the impact

of the social security system on the long—run capital stock is

smaller. In the fifth case, consumption increases as a result of the

introduction of social security.

     The associated welfare changes are calculated as in the no—bequest

case and are reported in Table 7. While the costs are lower than in the

no—bequest case, the bequest motive in most cases did not eliminate the

long—run cost of the introduction of the system. The only gain came in

the 8 = 25 case.

VI.   CONCLUSIONS AND EXTENSIONS

      Assessing   the impact of social security and private pensions on

individ.al wealth accumulation is important for many analyses of

welfare, capital formation, and equity in the distributions of income

and wealth. Previous research efforts along the lines of Feldstein

(1974) have addressed the funding Status of social security and

pensions. The focus here is on insurance features of pension annuities

with respect to the problem of uncertainty over length of life.

      The first part of the paper considers the introduction of social

security into an economy with market failure in the provision of private

annuities. The principal findings are three. First, in such a world,

even an actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can

substantially reduce individual saving, though individual welfare is
                                   — 30 —




initially    improved. Hence, partial equilibrium estimates of the impact

of social security on saving relying solely on the extent to which

individuals earn a more than fair return on social security are

underestimates of the true effect.

     Second, the partial equilibrium impact of social security annuities

on non—pension saving is reduced when initial endowments are

considered. For example, to the extent that the introduction of social

security reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect of

social security on the consumption of succeeding generations is

mitigated.

     Third, general equilibrium considerations, namely the endogeneity

of factor returns, reverse the partial equilibrium impact in the new

steady state. In the simulation exercises presented in Section IV, the

accompanying reduction in the capital stock and output are sufficient to

reduce per capita consumption and individual welfare. For plausible

parameter values, the reduction in welfare is on the order of nine

percent of lifetime resources.

     The introduction in Section V of a bequest valuation into the life—

cycle model produced smaller initial impacts on consumption than in the

no—bequest case. While steady—state welfare is still reduced by the

introduction in social security, the loss is smaller than in the no—

bequest case. For very high weights on bequests, a small welfare gain

occurs as the result of introducing social security.

     Three extensions of the models presented here are left as tasks for

future research. First, additional research on private annuity markets

is needed to determine the actual extent of market failure. As

discussed elsewhere (see Hubbard, 1984), links between private pensions

and social security are important in this context.26 That annuity
                                  — 31 —




 markets are extremely imperfect in the real world need not be evidence

 of a severe market failure, as individuals have some control over their

 participation in private pensions either explicitly (for participants in

 defined—contribution plans) or implicitly (through choice of

 employer). To the extent that individuals adjust their pensions for

 variation in social security annuities, the effective annuity market may

 be quite large. The magnitude of that adjustment nust be resolved

 empirically.27 A second and related point is that, given the current

 political environment, introducing uncertainty over future social

 security benefits may be appropriate. That uncertainty would modify the

 wealth impacts derived here.

     A third extension is to consider the market imperfection introduced

by restrictions on borrowing against future earnings.28 Young workers

are hardest hit by this restriction, as their current earnings are below

their lifetime average earnings. If the liquidity constraint is then

binding in their life—cycle optimization, they Will consume all of their

after—tax income; that is, social security taxes reduce consumption one

for one. Hence, reducing payroll taxes during youth would raise

lifetime utility, even if the reduction were compensated (in the sense

of raising required contributions later in the life cycle).

     The debate over the influence of pensions on individual saving

brings together questions of consumer choice under uncertainty and the

effectiveness of fiscal policy. Researching the relationships among

social security, private pensions, annuity markets, and bequests

facilitates close empirical scrutiny of models of individual and

aggregate saving, permitting consideration of the welfare effects of

compulsory pensions. In addition, while this paper has concentrated on

annuity insurance, similar approaches could be used to study the impacts

of other social insurance programs on national
                                                 saving.

                               FOOTNOTES


'Empirical tests of the life—cycle model under certainty have tested the
    hypothesis of a hump—shaped wealth—age profile, but results have by
    no means unambiguously validated the model. See for example White
    (1978), Mirer (1979), and Kurz (1981). Even after controlling for
    the effects of permanent income, Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1981),
    Diamond and Hausman (1982), King and Dicks—Mireaux (1982), and
    Hubbard (1983) found results only mildly supportive of the basic
    theory. Other studies have addressed the possibility of other
    motives for saving. Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) rejected the
    ability of the life—cycle model to explain wealth accumulation in
    the U. S., putting forth a major role for bequests.

2Earlier studies for private pensions include those of Cagan (1965),
    Katona (1964), and Munnell (1974). Feldstein's results have by no
    means gone unchallenged; see for example Leimer and Lesnoy (1982)
    and the reply in Feldstein (1982). Microeconomic (cross—section)
    evidence has generally been supportive of the proposition that
    social security has reduced individual saving. See Feldstein and
    Pellechio (1979), Kotlikoff (1979b), Blinder, Gordon, and Wise
    (1981), Diamond and Hausman (1982), King and Dicks—Mireaux (1982),
    and Hubbard (1983).

3Hence, previous partial equilibrium estimates of the impact of social
    security on saving drawn solely from consideration of the inter-
    generational wealth transfer at the introduction of the system are,
    if anything, too small. Abel (1983) takes up the intergenerational
    consequences of this point in a two—period overlapping—generations
    model, with the implication that the insurance features of social
    security may reduce inequality in the distribution of wealth.

4Another discussion of this point can be found in Kotlikoff, Shoven, and
    Spivak (1983).

5The precise direction of the influence of this uncertainty for saving
    is unclear. Heightened uncertainty over the length of life may lead
    to more saving (because of a longer than expected lifetime) or to
    less saving (to maintain present consumption). In the argument of
    Yaari (1965), two individuals with identical tastes, income, and
    investment opportunities are compared. The difference between them
    is that one lives T periods for certain while the other faces an
    uncertain lifetime of t periods, up to a maximum of T periods.
    Given a shorter expected life, uncertainty over length of life
    unambiguously leads to increased initial consumption. Champernowne
    (1969) and Levhari and Mirman (1977), on the hand, consider two
    agents with identical expected lives, but differing in the
    distribution of length of life. In either case, the impact of
    uncertainty over length of life on wealth accumulation of a risk—
    averse individual is ambiguous and depends on the parameters of the
   model.

6That is, D is just the weighted average of the years t in (Q+1, D'),
    with weights 1Pt for each t.

7Discussions of the lifetime utility function can be found in Strotz
    (1956) and Atkinson (1971).

8lndividuals will die on average prior to reaching age D', but the
    lifetime budget constraint reflects the possibility that the
    Individual will live through D'. In no case can the present value
    of consumption exceed lifetime resources. The problem is simplified
    here by making lifespan (and earnings) in the interval (0, Q)
    nonstochastic.

9This formulation of the utility function is used by Summers (1981),
    Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), Kotlifkoff and Summer (1981), Evans
    (1983), and Seidman (1984). As noted by Evans (1983), it is the
    only additive utility function consistent with the original
    homogeneity hypothesis of Modigliani and Brumberg (1954).

10This role of annuities as a mechanism for sharing uncertainty about
    longevity is an integral part of Diamond's (1977) evaluation of the
    social security system, in which he focuses on the absence of
    complete markets for such contracts. Merton (1983) considers
    Pareto—improving social security programs in an intertemporal model
    in which human capital is not tradeable.

"Previous work in this area in the context of pensions includes the
    contributions of Davies (1981) and Sheshinski and Weiss (1981).
    Davies used a life—cycle model under uncertain lifetime to address
    the phenomenon of slow dissaving in retirement. The presence of
    pensions in his simulation model (using Canadian data) reduced, but
    by no means eliminated, the effect of uncertainty on retirement
    consumption. In the model of Sheshinski and Weiss, the ultimate
    impact of social security on saving depends on the availability of a
    private annuity market. They found that, at the optimum, Yaari's
    (1965) result holds, namely that private savings are reserved for
    bequests, while social security benefits are used to finance
    retirement consumption.

'2The actuarially fair benefit is constructed with respect to economy—
    wide survival probabilities. It is true that individuals who
    believe they will die "young" will want to purchase less than the
    "average optimal" amount of social security annuities, while those
    who expect to live a long time will want more. Both groups are
    better off, however, with the mandatory social security than without
    it, since in its absence, adverse selection is assumed to foreclose
    the possibility of a market of private annuities. A discussion of
    the potential separating equilibria in the private provision of
    annuities which may arise after the imposition of mandatory social
    security is given Eckstein, Eichenbaum, and Peled (1983).

'3LJncertairity
              over future social security benefits would mitigate the
    effect shown here. Watson (1982) discusses the influence of
    uncertainty over benefits in assessing the impact of social security
    on saving. Merton, Bodie, and Marcus (1984) show that many private
    pension integration arrangements remove much of this uncertainty.

    retirement age of 65 was assumed. Probabilities for survival were
    taken from Faber (1982).

15This effect is most pronounced in the absence of explicit capital
    market restrictions. With no initial endowment (and, hence, binding
    restrictions on the nomarketability of social security when young),
    relative impacts on "working—period" and "retirement—period"
    consumption will depend on the relationship of the individual's
    actual and optimal tax rate (participation). The importance of
    (accidental) bequests as intergenerational links will be discussed
    later.

'6Thjs nonlinearity has surfaced in some recent studies of the impact of
    social security on saving. See for example Diamond and Hausman
    (1982) and Hubbard (1983).

'71n a world with capital market restrictions, then, a social security
    system of this type may increase saving, since received initial
    bequests are more liquid than anticipated social security
    benefits. The impact of social security on intergenerational
    transfers is an important component of the system's net effect on
    individual saving.

'8The implicit assumption, of course, is that the parent dies at the
    beginning of the child's (optimizing) life, age twenty here. This
    assumption is made to highlight the point that the existence of
    social security for the previous generation mitigates the impact of
    the present generation's participation in social security on its own
    wealth accumulation. More general assumptions about the timing of a
    testator's death would complicate expressions like (13) in the text,
    but the qualitative point would remain.

'9Kotlikoff (1979a) used a life—cycle model with certain longevity and a
    Cobb—Douglas production technology to consider the general
    equilibrium impact of a pay—as—you—go social security system. For
    plausible parameter values, he found that the positive lifetime
    wealth increment traceable to social security (because of the growth
    of the wage base) caused a 20—percent reduction in the steady—state
    capital stock. While this effect is certainly substantial, it is
    roughly half of his calculated partial equilibrium effect, which is
    directly related to the excess of the present value of benefits over
    the present value of payroll contributions. Kotlikoff's analysis
    also incorporates the influence of social security on retirement
    age, which is taken as exogenous here. To the extent that social
    security lowers the desired retirement age, the partial equilibrium
    wealth replacement effect of social security on saving is dampened.

20Hence non—social—security government saving is zero, and no role for
    debt policy exists. Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983) discuss the
    importance of the stance of debt policy in assessing transitions
    between fiscal regimes.

21AS in Table 1, survival probabilities are taken from Faber. For a
    more complete discussion of the implications of the choice of
    parameter values, see Levhari and Nirman (1977) or Davies (1981).

22Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) report that annual growth rates of
    productivity (real GNP per man—hour) and population in the U. S.
    during the twentieth century have been 2.2 percent and 1.4 percent,
    respectively.

23Note that the consumption increase is higher in the case of risk
    aversion. The calculation proceed aas follows. When
      = —1.0, w = 2.677; when y = — 3.0, w = 2.747;     when
      = — 5.0, w = 2.784. The gains are evaluated as t(w—l) as
    described in Section II.

24Bequests are incorporated as follows. Using information on
    p(t= Q-I-1,...,D'), a distribution of bequests is generated.  All
    individuals receive the weighted average bequest regardless of their
    particular family mortality history. The implicit assumption is
    that individual bequests are taxed away by the government and
    distributed lump sum to individuals.

25Clearly other bequest formulations outside the infinite horizon
    optimization in Barro (1974) are available. Evans (1983), for
    example, considers two alternatives: (i) individuals pass on a
    bequest related by the steady—state growth rate to initial
    inheritances or (ii) both inheritances and bequests are invariant
    to interest rate movments. In Seidinan's certain lifetime model,
    is equivalent to the ratio of the bequest to consumption in the last
    period of life.

26To the extent that high—income individuals are constrained to less
    than their desired participation in social security, there is excess
    demand for social security annuities. Adverse selection and the
    possibility of multiple insurance still render unlikely the
    provision of such annuities by competitive insurance companies.
    Employer—sponsored private pensions may act to fill this gap.
    Employers are likely to have better information on individual
    workers' life expectancies than would a disinterested insurance
    company. Second, by definition, such annuities can only be
    purchased at an individual's place of work; multiple insurance is
    not possible. Pauly (1974) and Wilson (1977) discuss certain
    situations in which private market equilibria might occur after a
    compulsory insurance program is imposed.

271n addition, imperfect annuity arrangements may be present at the
    level of the family (see for example Kotlikoff, Shoven, and Spivak,
    1983). Given any of these modifications, the partial equilibrium
    impact of the capital stock of introducing actuarially fair social
                                — 36 —




   security annuities is mitigated. The point remains, however, that
   the impact of social security on individual consumption in the new
   steady state will differ from that on initial participants.

28Hayashi (1982) found that approximately 20 percent of all consumption
    is accounted for by such liquidity constrainted individuals. Flavin
    (1984) found that the estimate of the marginal propensity to consume
    is affected dramatically by the inclusion of proxies for liquidity
    constraints, suggesting that liquidity constraints are an important
