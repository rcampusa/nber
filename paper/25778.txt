Measuring Global Economic Activity
James D. Hamilton
NBER Working Paper No. 25778
April 2019
JEL No. E01,Q02

                                        ABSTRACT

A number of economic studies have used a proxy for world real economic activity derived from
shipping costs. This measure turns out to depend on a normalization that has substantive
consequences of which users of the index had been unaware prior to this paper. This paper
further evaluates this and alternative measures in terms of treatment of trends, coherence with
world output, and ability to predict commodity prices. I conclude that measures derived from
world industrial production offer a better indicator of global real economic activity.

    Applied economists often want a monthly measure of the level of global economic activity
in empirical models of variables like commodity prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
One popular measure that has been used in dozens of studies1 was developed by Kilian (2009)
based on the cost of shipping.
    In this paper I review the mechanical details behind Kilian’s index and evaluate its appro-
priateness as a measure of global real economic activity.


1       Details behind Kilian’s index.
The market for shipping services is governed by supply and demand, just like any other market.
In a typical year, increasing global economic activity increases the demand for shipping, which
by itself would lead to an increase in the cost of shipping. On the other hand, increases in
shipping capacity and improvements in shipping productivity also shift the supply curve out,
leading to lower prices. The trend in real shipping costs has been downward over time,
meaning that in most years the second eﬀect is bigger than the ﬁrst. If the growth in
shipping capacity, improvements in shipping productivity, and growth of potential real GDP
could be characterized by deterministic time trends, then we might interpret the residuals
from a regression of the real cost of shipping on a time trend as the cyclical component of
global real economic activity.
    As a ﬁrst step in constructing his index of real economic activity, Kilian (2009) developed
a monthly measure xt of the nominal cost of shipping. This was calculated by initializing
x1968:1 = 1 and for each subsequent month through 2007:12 adding an average of the change
in the natural logarithm across a set of diﬀerent freight rates to the previous month’s value
xt−1 ,
                               I
                                  δit ∆ log pit
               xt = xt−1 + i=1 I                for t = 1968:2, 1968:3, ...,2007:12          (1)
                                   i=1 δ it

where pit is the cost of shipping a particular bulk dry cargo i from monthly issues of Drewry’s
Shipping Insight and δit = 1 if that cost is known for t and t − 1. For data since 2008, Kilian
and Murphy (2014) updated xt using the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) of shipping costs:

                            xt = xt−1 + ∆ log(BDIt )      for t ≥ 2008:1.                           (2)

Kilian continued through 2018 to update xt using equation (2) and reported on his website a
measure of real economic activity described in equation (3) below.

    Kilian converted his nominal index xt into a real index by dividing xt by the U.S. consumer
price index (CP It ). He then took the log of this ratio,

                                 log(xt /CP It ) = log(xt ) − log(CP It ),

and regressed the result on a linear time trend:

                                  log(xt ) − log(CP It ) = α + βt + εt .                                 (3)

The residuals εt from this regression are the Kilian index of real economic activity that has
been used by the studies cited in footnote 1 and many others. This index is plotted in the
top panel of Figure 1.
   One feature of this construction that appears not to have been understood by the many
users of this index is the following. Equation (2) implies that for t ≥ 2008:1,

                              xt = x2008:1 + log(BDIt ) − log(BDI2008:1 )
                                 = log(BDIt ) + c0                                                       (4)

for c0 = x2008:1 − log(BDI2008:1 ). No one before me had noticed the simple identity in (4),
and Kilian has never made public his data for the underlying index xt . However, it turns
out to be possible to uncover the underlying series for xt from publicly available data. For
t ≥ 2008:1, the unknown value for xt is related to the observed value of BDIt according
to equation (4) which involves a single unknown constant c0 . We further know that zt =
log(log(BDIt ) + c0 ) − log(CP It ) − α − βt should be exactly equal to the value for εt reported
by Kilian for t ≥ 2008:1 for some values of c0 , α, and β. The values of c0 , α, and β can be
estimated by a nonlinear least squares regression2 of the reported εt on the value of zt using
data after 2008 and CP I of the appropriate vintages.3 The resulting estimated values for
c0 , α, and β give the ﬁtted regression an R2 of unity in explaining εt , conﬁrming that we have
exactly replicated Kilian’s procedure. With α and β thus known, the pre-2008 values of xt
are then obtained by adding back in the time trend to εt .4
     The uncovered series for xt is plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 1. The value for c0
turns out to be −5.236 when x1968:1 is normalized to be unity. However, if the sequence xt had
been generated with some initial value for x1968:1 other than unity (corresponding to choosing
   2
     One could also ﬁnd essentially the same answer using any arbitrary 3 data points. However, because
of rounding errors in the reported data, a more accurate reconstruction of the original series is obtained by
pooling all the observations in a nonlinear regression.
   3
     When matching Kilian and Murphy (2014), the CPI as reported in October 2009 was used (in order to
match their data exactly), and when matching the data as downloaded from Kilian’s website in July 2018, the
CPI as reported in April 2018 was used.

some month other than 1968:1 to be normalized to unity), the value of c0 would be a diﬀerent
number. For example, if we started the recursion from a value of x1968:1 that results in a value
for x1973:1 of 1, the value of c0 would be −5.694.
    The implications of this can be seen when we substitute (4) into (3):

                        log[log(BDIt ) + c0 ] − log(CP It ) = α + βt + εt .                   (5)

Taking logs twice is an uncommon procedure for economic data, but no one noticed prior to
my paper that this is what the Kilian index used in the papers referenced in footnote 1 was
in fact doing. One consequence of taking double logs in this context is that the resulting
series for real economic activity εt would be diﬀerent depending on the value of c0 , that is,
diﬀerent depending on whether we normalize x1968:1 to be 1, x1973:1 to be 1, or choose some
other month to normalize to be 1. Figure 2 shows how diﬀerent normalizations aﬀect the
resulting measure of real economic activity.
    After seeing an initial draft of this paper, Kilian (forthcoming) revised his index, and bases
it now on the residuals of the regression

                                 xt − log(CP It ) = α + βt + εt .                             (6)

The original index based on (3) and the revised index based on (6) are compared in Figure
3. Kilian (forthcoming) wrote that the revised index “diﬀers only slightly from the original
index.” However, statistical tests in the following section ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences.


2    Evaluating alternative measures of real economic ac-
     tivity.
A primary motivation given by Kilian (2009, p. 1057) for the validity of his index as a
measure of global real economic activity came from an anecdotal review of global developments
over 1970-2007. He concluded, “Figure 1 is fully consistent with the anecdotal evidence on
the relative importance and timing of these ﬂuctuations in global real economic activity.”
Applying that same standard to the more recent values of either of the indexes in Figure 3
raises substantial doubts about the measures’ continuing reliability. The series would lead us
to conclude that the cyclical component of world economic activity reached a far lower level in
2016 than was seen in either the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008-2009 or the 1974-75 global recession.
That conclusion seems hard to justify on the basis of GDP data for any major country, and
certainly does not square with the assertion in Kilian (2009, p. 1056) that “the level of global
real economic activity as it relates to industrial commodity markets is proportionate to this
index.” In later work, Kilian and Zhou (2018) stressed the index’s potential usefulness as a


                                                4
leading indicator of global real economic activity. But we now have several years of data from
which we know that no great global collapse followed the indexes’ extreme bearish signal in
2016.
   In this section I follow up with formal statistical tests, looking at evidence on stationarity,
coherence with known data on global real GDP, usefulness for modeling real commodity prices,
and other issues.


2.1     Deterministic time trends.
The implicit, but never tested, assumption behind the use of residuals from these time-trend
regressions is that either log(xt ) − log(CP It ) for Kilian’s original index or xt − log(CP It ) for
the revised index can be characterized as a stationary process around a deterministic linear
time trend. Letting st = xt − log(CP It ) and using the sample of observations for t = 1968:1
through 2018:6, an augmented Dickey-Fuller test (with 3 lags of ∆st ) of the null hypothesis
that st can be characterized as a unit-root process fails to reject the null at the 10% signiﬁcance
level.5 Alternatively, the test of Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) takes the null hypothesis to be
that st is stationary around a linear time trend. This test leads to rejection of the null at the
1% signiﬁcance level.6 Thus the assumption behind Kilian’s index is not supported by the
data.
    If real shipping costs in reality contain a unit root, ﬁtting a linear time trend causes the
residuals for date t to incorporate information about values observed through the end of the
sample. This could cause the residuals to perform spuriously well at in-sample forecasting
evaluations. In practice, we observe that the coeﬃcients characterizing the time trend continue
to change as more data are added. For example, Figure 4 compares the time trend when
estimated through 2009:8 (the sample period used by Kilian and Murphy (2014)) with the
trend estimated through 2018:6.


2.2     Coherence with world economic activity.
The results in Section 2.1 suggest that a better way to obtain a stationary series is by diﬀer-
encing rather than regressing on a time trend. If we want the cyclical component, Hamilton
(2018) proposed that the two-year diﬀerence

                                              ct = st − st−24                                             (7)
   5
     The t-statistic is −2.46 with T = 603, which falls short of the 10% critical value of −2.57 from Hamilton
(1994, Table B.6, Case 2).
   6
     Here I used 4 lags to obtain a test statistic of 0.321 which exceeds the 1% critical value of 0.216.




                                                      5
is often a robust way to isolate the cyclical component of most economic time series.7 Kilian’s
revised index is compared with (7) in the top two panels of Figure 5. The reason that Kilian’s
measure regards 2016 as the worst downturn in record is in part because a linear trend was
used to construct it. The measure in the second panel, which does not assume a linear time
trend, would still describe 2016 as a severe contraction, but not worse than the global ﬁnancial
crisis. Notwithstanding, a big factor in the record low shipping prices in 2016 was overbuilt
shipping capacity, not a severe global economic contraction.
    OECD Main Economic Indicators published an estimate of monthly industrial production
for the OECD plus 6 other major countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian
Federation and South Africa). The OECD series begins in 1958:1 and ends in 2011:10.8
Baumeister and Hamilton (2019) reproduced the methodology by which the original index
was constructed to extend the series through 2018:7.9 The bottom panel of Figure 5 plots the
cyclical component of the log of this series again using the two-year diﬀerence (7). Unlike the
Kilian index, the industrial production data imply that the 1974-75 and 2008-2009 recessions
were clearly the most signiﬁcant downturns in global real activity during this period. The
series also suggests that there was a period of strong growth following the recovery from
the 2008-2009 downturn, and characterizes 2015-2016 as sluggish global growth rather than a
separate severe global contraction. All of this accords well with what is commonly understood
about global economic activity.
    Kilian and Zhou (2018) argued that one drawback to using world real GDP is that re-
searchers often want to estimate higher frequency models, and they state that quarterly real
GDP is only available since 1990. However, the World Bank has published estimates of annual
world real GDP going back to 1960. One obvious check is to look at the correlation between
these annual ﬁgures and alternative proposed monthly measures of the cyclical component of
real economic activity. Consider an OLS estimation of

                                             gt = α + βct + vt                                             (8)

where gt is the growth rate of world real GDP in year t, ct is a proposed cyclical measure
as of the last month of year t, and t runs from 1971 to 2017. Row 1 of Table 1 shows
that the cyclical component of industrial production is very strongly correlated with observed
annual GDP growth. By contrast, the correlation between GDP growth and either of Kilian’s
measures is not statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels (rows 2 and 3). The cyclical
   7
     Hamilton (2018) proposed that we could isolate the cyclical component more generally using an OLS
regression. Given the evidence of a unit root noted above, here we use the simple and more robust alternative
in equation (7). This also simpliﬁes interpretation of forecasting regressions below as it is a true real-time
measure.
   8
     Kilian and Zhou (2018, Table A1a) mistakenly assert that the series is only available since 1973:1. Kilian
and Zhou (2018, p. 66) also give the mistaken impression that this series only included China beginning in
2006. In fact, China has been included in the world industrial production index at least since 1999.
   9
     This series is regularly updated at https://sites.google.com/site/cjsbaumeister/research.

                                                      6
component of real shipping costs (row 4) does somewhat better than Kilian’s measures but is
not nearly as strongly related to GDP as is world industrial production.
    Kilian and Zhou (2018) also noted that delays in obtaining the GDP or industrial pro-
duction numbers undermines their usefulness for real-time assessment. For example, as of
January of year t + 1 we would know the value of the BDI and CP I for December of year t
(and thus could construct any of the measures in rows 2-4 of Table 1 as of January) but would
typically only know the value for industrial production through June of year t at that time.10
Kilian and Zhou (2018, p. 58) asserted that another advantage of their approach is that “the
Kilian index [is] a leading indicator with respect to global real output, unlike global industrial
production, which is a coincident indicator,” though they provided no statistical evidence in
support of this claim.
    One obvious way to evaluate both concerns is to base the industrial-production measure
ct for year t on the June value of industrial production rather than December, evaluating
equation (8) as a possible tool for purposes of nowcasting. Row 5 of Table 1 shows that the
June value is still quite useful. Indeed, one gets a far better picture of world GDP growth
for year t by looking at industrial production through June of that year rather than shipping
costs through December. Interestingly, either of Kilian’s measures based on shipping costs
through June actually have a slight negative correlation with what world GDP growth for
that year turned out to be.


2.3     Forecasting commodity prices.
Another argument given by Kilian and Zhou (2018) in favor of their measure is based on its
purported usefulness for modeling commodity prices. Here I investigate this claim using a
number of diﬀerent commodity prices. Let pt be the change in the logarithm of the real price
of a particular commodity or index of commodities between month t−1 and t and zt either the
growth rate of industrial production or one of the two Kilian measures. Consider forecasting
regressions of the form

                                          3                 3
                             pt = α +     j=1 φj pt−j   +   j=1 βj zt−j   + vt .                     (9)

Table 2 reports p-values for the F -test of the null hypothesis H0 : β1 = β2 = β3 = 0 that the
measure of real economic activity is of no use for forecasting the commodity price pt . The
commodity prices considered are the World Bank’s two broad commodity price indexes (energy
and non-energy), two more specialized indexes (agriculture and base metals), and prices of
four important individual commodities (crude oil, soybeans, aluminum and copper).                   The
  10
     An alternative option is to use the production-weighted index of world industrial production that is
included in the World Trade Monitor Database reported by CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy
Analysis. This series begins in January 2000 and is reported with only a two-month delay. Its growth rate
is similar to the OECD+6 index and appears to be a good way to update the OECD+6 index.

                                                   7
regression (9) was estimated for t = 1968:4 to 2018:2. Industrial production has statistically
signiﬁcant coeﬃcients for purposes of forecasting every commodity except aluminum. The
Kilian-Zhou index does not give statistically signiﬁcant predictions of any of these prices.
The Kilian (forthcoming) index gives better forecasts than Kilian-Zhou, and is statistically
signiﬁcant for purposes of predicting the agricultural price index, the base-metals price index,
and copper prices. But it is never as good as industrial production.


2.4     Additional considerations.
Finally I oﬀer some observations on the nominal shipping index xt itself. One notices in the
bottom panel of Figure 1 that this series seems to behave diﬀerently before and after 2008.
This was the date at which Kilian switched from updating the index using equation (1) to
updating it based purely on the BDI as in equation (2). Odom (2010) noted that changes
in the methodology behind BDI may have contributed to its volatility. Figure 6 compares
Kilian’s nominal index xt with the path it would have taken since 2008 if he had continued
to update it using equation (1). The series would exhibit less of a downward trend, less of a
drop in 2016, and less volatility.
    If in spite of the many issues raised above one still wanted to use the BDI as a measure of
global real economic activity, it has the appealing feature that it is actually available daily.11
To use the daily BDI as a cyclical indicator, the evidence in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 argues
strongly for using a two-year diﬀerence rather than residuals from a linear time trend.12 A
daily indicator could thus be obtained from

                       ct = log(BDIt /CP It ) − log(BDIt−(2×247) /CP It−(2×247) )

where t now denotes daily data with 247 the number of business days in a year and CP It is a
value for the consumer price index associated with day t. Constructing the latter raises two
modest technical challenges. First, the CP I is only available with a lag, and second, the CP I
only changes at monthly intervals. To solve these issues, I associated the value of the BDI for
the ﬁrst business day in March with the CP I for January,13 and linearly interpolated between
the January and February CP I to ﬁll in each subsequent day in March.14 The resulting
  11
     Daily values for the BDI were obtained from TradingEconomics.com.
  12
     Bruno, Büyükşahin, and Robe (2016) used residuals from a regression of the BDI on a linear time trend
to construct a weekly indicator of economic activity. They did not propose solutions to how to develop this
into a practical real-time estimator.
  13
     Alternatively, if the goal is to develop a daily index for use in historical academic research rather than for
real-time nowcasting, one could logically associate the value of the BDI for the 11th business day in March
with the CP I for March and linearly interpolate using the CP I for April to ﬁll in subsequent days in March
and the ﬁrst 10 business days in April.
  14
     An alternative would be to use daily nowcasts of the CPI developed by Knotek and Zaman (2017) and
updated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. A drawback of this is that the series would exhibit discrete
jumps at release dates, unlike the procedure developed here.

series, plotted in Figure 7, might in the spirit of Kilian (2009) be viewed as a daily indicator
of the cyclical component of global real economic activity.


3    Conclusions.
This paper made publicly available for the ﬁrst time details that allow researchers to investigate
the properties of popular measures of global real economic activity based on shipping costs.
Doing so uncovered signiﬁcant problems in a widely-used index and established that alternative
approaches to handling the trend in shipping costs oﬀer both a better description of the
shipping data and better coherence with world GDP. Notwithstanding, monthly estimates of
world industrial production are far better than measures based on shipping costs at describing
world GDP or predicting commodity prices.
