                                           ABSTRACT

In Chinese culture those who are born in the year of the Dragon under the zodiac calendar are
believed to be destined for good fortune and greatness, and parents prefer their kids to be born in
a Dragon year. Using provincial level panel data, we first show that the number of marriages goes
up during the two years preceding a Dragon year and that births jump up in a Dragon year. Using
three recently collected micro data sets from China we show that those born in a Dragon year are
more likely to have a college education, and that they obtain higher scores at the university
entrance exam. Similarly, Chinese middle school students have higher test scores if they are born
in a Dragon year. We show that these results are not because of family background, student self-
esteem or students’ expectations about their future. We find, however, that the “Dragon” effect on
test scores is eliminated when we account for parents’ expectations about their children’s
educational and professional success. We find that parents of Dragon children have higher
expectations for their children in comparison to other parents, and that they invest more heavily
in their children in terms of time and money. We also show that girls are about six cm shorter
than boys, but that this height disadvantage is cut by about half if a girl is born in the year of the
Dragon and that effect is twice as strong in rural areas. Given that childhood nutrition is related to
adolescent height, this suggests that parents may also be investing in Dragon girls in terms of
nutrition. The results are insensitive to model specification and estimation strategy, including
using an RD design. These results show that even though neither the Dragon children nor their
families are inherently different from other children and families, the belief in the prophecy of
success and the ensuing investment become self-fulfilling.

     Can Superstition Create a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy? School Outcomes of Dragon
                                    Children of China



I.        Introduction

       Cultural beliefs and preferences impact the behavior of individuals who hold these

beliefs. For example, the strength of family ties, based on cultural heritage, negatively

influence political participation and civic engagement (Alesina and Giuliano 2011); labor

supply and fertility rates in a woman’s country of ancestry have explanatory power in

determining work and fertility decisions (Fernandez and Fogli 2009), and cultural

preferences towards leisure have an impact on the labor market activity of women (Mocan

forthcoming). The extent to which residents of a country consider people of another

country as untrustworthy has an influence on trade and foreign direct investment between

these countries (Guiso et al. 2009).

       Beliefs and behaviors, even those that can be thought of as having been engrained in

the fabric of culture, react to the economic and institutional environment (Mocan, Bielen

and Marneffe 2018, Mocan and Raschke 2016, Alesina, and Fuchs-Schündeln, 2007, Di

Tella et al. 2007). Yet, there is substantial persistence in beliefs over long periods of time,

and beliefs are transmitted through generations (Voigtlaender and Voth 2012; Guiso,

Sapienza and Zingales 2008). Such persistence raises the question of whether cultural

beliefs, even if they are completely untrue, can be self-fulfilling. For example, Nunn and

Sanches de la Sierra (2017) describe a superstitious belief which has emerged in the

Democratic Republic of Congo regarding how to become a bulletproof person through a

ritual. They show that, although untrue, this belief helped villagers coordinate their defense

activities against a group of bandits who possessed firearms, and it allowed the villagers to

                                              1
defeat the bandits. Even though some villagers died in the process because the ritual never

made them bulletproof, that most people believed in this superstition generated a mass

movement of organized and successful defense against the perpetrators, which then

reinforced people’s beliefs in this particular superstition.

     In this paper we investigate whether a cultural belief about the characteristics of a

group of people is self-fulfilling, and we analyze the mechanism which is a source of this

self-fulfilling belief. We focus on the wide-spread belief in Asian cultures that people born

in certain zodiac years are inherently different from those born in other years. Specifically,

in China people born in Dragon years are believed to be superior, powerful and destined

for good fortune.

     Because there is no biological reason for people who are born in a certain time period

be more successful economically in comparison to those who are born in adjacent time

periods, it is surprising that this superstition has persisted for centuries. In a related domain,

researchers started exploring the production of, and the reasons for persistence of

“motivated belief distortions,” including such concepts as wishful thinking and willful

blindness (Benabou and Tirole 2016, Benabou 2015). For example, Benabaou and Tirole

state that “People thus hold certain beliefs in part because they attach value to them, as a

result of some (usually implicit) tradeoff between accuracy and desirability. Such beliefs

will therefore be resistant to many forms of evidence, with individuals displaying non-

Bayesian behaviors such as not wanting to know, wishful thinking, and reality denial.”

     We first analyze province level panel data from China and find that the number of

marriages goes up during the two years before a Chinese Dragon year, arguably because

newly-wed parents would like their offspring to be born in a Dragon year. Consistent with


                                                2
this conjecture, using province panels we also show that the number of births rise in Dragon

years.

     If the cohort size of Dragon children is larger because of parents’ demand for a

“Dragon child” and the resultant increase in the number of birth in Dragon years, this would

intensify competition among children of that cohort in terms of educational resources. For

example, class sizes in schools would be larger for kids born in Dragon years, which may

reduce the quality of education they receive. Similarly, competition for a slot in a high-

quality college, and competition for good jobs could be more intense because kids born in

Dragon years would have to compete with a larger group of same-age peers. If this is the

case, and if children born in a Dragon year have worse educational outcomes in comparison

to their peers who are similar in age and in other attributes, this would beg the question of

how this particular belief about Dragon children being destined for good fortune greatness

could persist. 1

     Against this backdrop, we investigate whether educational outcomes of Dragon

children are different from that of their peers. We analyze two separate micro data sets and

find that students born in Dragon years are more likely, as opposed less likely, to receive

higher scores in the national college entrance examination, and that they are more likely to

have attained at least a college education in comparison to similar individuals who are of




1
  Suen (2004) shows that in a Bayesian framework if information is difficult to obtain or if the
person receives information from like-minded people who provide coarse information, then the
existing priors (beliefs) are reinforced, and incorrect beliefs can persist. Agarwal et al. (2017) show
that the number of births among the Chinese minorities in Singapore increases during the year of
the Dragon. Given the small size of the city-state and limited capacity of educational institutions,
this increase in the cohort size makes it more difficult for Chinese Dragon children to get admitted
to two top universities in Singapore. The income levels of Dragon Children are also lower in
Singapore.
                                                  3
the same age (or who are very similar in age), but who have different zodiac year

designations.

     When we analyze a third data set that contains detailed information on middle school

students we find that the same pattern exists in middle school. Middle school students who

are born in a Dragon year have higher test scores in comparison to other students who are

of the same age or similar in age, holding constant many determinants of test scores.

     We also conduct analyses in narrow samples that compare individuals who are born a

few months apart. The year of the Rabbit precedes the year of the Dragon in the zodiac

calendar, and Snake year follows the Dragon year (see Figure 1). We compare those who

are born in the last full month (or months) of the year of the Rabbit to those who were born

in the first full month (or months) of the year of the Dragon, as well as those who were

born at the end of the Dragon year to those born in the beginning of the year of the Snake.

We also conduct a sharp Regression Discontinuity analysis when the data set contains the

exact birth dates. Although sample sizes go down considerably in these analyses, the

inference is not altered.

     In all three data sets we find that parents of Dragon children and parents of other

children have similar educational attainment. The same is true regarding family income

and the propensity of parents having white collar jobs. This suggests that the differential

educational success of Dragon children is not related to family background. Better

educational outcomes of Dragon children cannot be related to teacher behavior either

because it is unlikely for teachers to know the exact birth dates of their pupils to determine

their zodiac, and the university entrance exam scores are graded with no information about

student identity.


                                              4
     One potential mechanism that can generate better educational outcomes for Dragon

children is higher self-esteem of these children. If children born in Dragon years believe

that they are superior to other children and if Dragon children have higher self-esteem, this

could impact their success in school as higher self-esteem and confidence may lead to

better learning. The data set on middle school children allows us to analyze this potential

channel because it includes questions designed to gauge the self-esteem of the students and

their aspirations about their own future. We find that students who are born in a Dragon

year do not consider themselves as having higher ability than other students. Similarly,

Dragon children in middle school are not more likely to believe that they will have a

successful future.

     On the other hand, we find that the parents of these Dragon children have substantially

higher expectations of their children regarding their children’s educational attainment and

about their children’s future success in comparison to other parents. In addition, we find

that parents of Dragon children invest more heavily in their children compared to other

parents in terms of time and money. Importantly, we find that the “Dragon impact” on test

scores disappears once we control for parents’ expectations about their children’s future.

This indicates that the educational success of Dragon children is driven by parent

expectations and parent investment.

     If parents of Dragon children believe that their children are inherently more

productive as suggested by the superstition, they would invest heavily in their kids in

comparison to other parents because the return of their investment is higher. It can be

argued, however, that parents of Dragon children do not believe in the superstition. They

want their kids to be born in a Dragon year for some other reason, but they don’t actually


                                             5
think that Dragon kids are destined for greatness. 2 Yet, they recognize that the Dragon

cohorts are larger and therefore their children would be at a disadvantage unless additional

resources are allocated to these kids to compensate for the intensity of competition they

would face due to the large cohort size. Under this conjecture, Dragon parents invest in

their children to counteract the drawback of their kids being a member or a large cohort.

We provide evidence in the paper against this hypothesis. In the middle school data set the

7th grade consists of only those students who were born in a Dragon year or in a Snake year.

This cohort of the 7th graders is large because of the Dragon children, and the parents of

the Snake children are presumably aware of this fact. Thus, the parents of the Snake

children should be similarly worried about the increased competition due to the large cohort

size and therefore they too should invest in their kids. This means that there should not be

a significant difference between the two groups of parents in terms of investment in their

children. However, analyzing this group of Dragon and Snake parents whose children are

classmates, we find that Dragon parents’ beliefs and behaviors are significantly different

from those of the Snake parent. Dragon parents have higher expectation of their children’s

future than the parents of Snake children whose kids are in the same classrooms.

Furthermore, Dragon parents invest significantly more in their children in comparison to

Snake parents. Unless one is prepared to argue that parents of Snake children do not care

about the success of their offspring, this finding refutes the conjecture that Dragon parents

invest in their kids because they are worried about the competition with a large number of

students in the cohort.




2
 As discussed earlier, we show in the paper that Dragon parents have, in fact, higher expectations
of their children in comparison to other parents, refuting this claim.
                                                6
     Finally, although we show that parents of Dragon children are no different from other

parents in observable ways, they could be different in ways we don’t observe as researchers.

For example, it could be that mothers of Dragon children are more cognizant of the positive

impact of a healthy pregnancy on birth outcomes, and therefore on the long-run benefits

for their children. As a result, expectant mothers of Dragon babies may have consumed

more health inputs such as medical care and nutritious foods during pregnancy to improve

the health of their baby. The most widely-used indicator of health at birth is the birth weight

of the baby. Research, however, has shown that an increase in birth weight has only a

modest impact on schooling and test scores. 3 This indicates that any potential investment

in child health by parents of Dragon babies during pregnancy, and the resultant increase in

birth weight, is unlikely to be a primary factor that drives the difference in educational

outcomes between Dragon children and others. 4 5 Any potential investment avenue that


3
 For example, Royer (2009) uses data from California and finds that a one-kilogram increase in
birth weight (which is a very substantial increase, given the mean birth weight in the population is
about 3,500 grams) is associated with an additional 0.16 years of schooling. Using Florida data,
Figlio et al. (2014) find that a one kg. increase in birth weight generates an increase in schooling
by 0.156 years. The authors also show that the same 1,000 gr. increase in birth weight is associated
with less than 1/20 of a standard deviation increases in tests scores in grades 3 to 8. Bharadwaj et
al. (2018) use data from Chile and report that at 10 percent increase in birth weight (which
corresponds to a 250-gram increase) raises test scores in math and language by 0.04-0.06 standard
deviations. Using Chinese data Rosenzweig and Zhang (2013) find that an increase in birth weight
by one standard deviation (about 0.48 lbs, or 220 gr) is associated with increase in a combination
of math and language grades of students ages 12-15 by 2.3 to 3.5 percent.
4
  One mechanism through which birth weight can impact school outcomes is through the potential
influence of birth weight on cognitions. The research on the impact of birth weight on IQ, however,
is not conclusive (Cook and Fletcher 2015, Newcombe et al. 2007). In our data set, there is no
difference in the cognitive test scores between Dragon children and other middle school children.)
5
  Furthermore, that we find a significant relationship between Dragon parents’ expectations of
their kids’ academic professional achievement and the investment parents make in their kids, and
that these parent expectations explain the difference in test scores between Dragon kids and other
kids, does not rule out other ways Dragon parents can help their kids fulfill these expectations.
For example, it could be that when Dragon parents invest in their kids in ways we measure in this
paper (talking to the classroom teachers more frequently, not asking their kids to help with house
                                                 7
may have been utilized by parents since the birth of their children does not alter the message

of this paper: Even though children born in a Dragon year are no different from other

children in the dimensions we observe in our data, ranging from family background to self-

esteem, and expectations and aspirations about their future, these students are more

successful in school. This is because the parents of Dragon children have higher

expectations of their children and they invest in their children more intensely. In the end,

these higher expectations yield better educational outcomes. Put differently, these

expectations and the ensuing investment create this self-fulfilling prophecy.

     Do and Phung (2010) show that in Vietnam children born in auspicious years have

two more months of schooling, and the authors attribute this outcome to the wantedness of

the children and the planning of these births by the parents. Thus, a hypothesis is that some

parents have high expectations of their children and they invest heavily in their children,

and that these parents also time their pregnancy so that their children are born in the year

of the Dragon. This is not because these parents necessarily believe in the superstition, but

“just in case.” In this scenario children are born in the Dragon year not primarily because

of parent superstition, but mainly because their parents are investor and planners,

(including planning the timing of the birth in a Dragon year). Such a conjecture, of course,

begs the question of why non-superstitious parents time the birth of child of their children

to coincide with the Dragon year after all. Nevertheless, if this is the dominant behavior,

parent expectations of children and the outcomes of these children should be similar in a

narrow window on both sides of Dragon zodiac cut-off. Put differently, parents who made

slight timing errors in pregnancy should be similar to parents who timed their pregnancy


chores, etc.), they could also invest in their children in other ways at the same time, such as by
buying books and computers for their children, hiring tutors for them, and so on.
                                                  8
accurately. The same should be true for the children of both types of parents. We show that

this is not the case. There are significant differences in parent expectations and student

outcomes between those who are born in the last month of the Dragon year and those who

are born just one month later.

      In Section II we provide the background regarding the belief on zodiacs in the Chinese

culture. Sections III and IV present some stylized facts showing the existence of

preferences for Dragon kids in China using national and provincial panel data. Empirical

framework is explained in Section V. The data used in the paper are presented in Section

VI, and the empirical results are reported in Section VII. Section VIII presents the analyses

of narrow samples which consist of individuals born in nearby months. Section IX is the

conclusion.



II.     Background and Previous Literature

        In traditional Chinese culture and in Asian cultures generally, there are 12 creature-

zodiacs, which represent different characteristics of the cohorts born in different Chinese

lunar years. The order of the zodiacs, depicted in Figure 1, are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit,

Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. The zodiacs follow Chinese

lunar calendar, and each zodiac appears approximately every 12 years. For example, the

Dragon year of 1988 started on February 17, 1988 (the first day of 1988 in Chinese lunar

calendar) and ended on February 5, 1989 (the last day of 1988 in Chinese lunar calendar).

Following a 12-year cycle, another Dragon year covered the time span between February

5, 2000 and January 23, 2001. 6


6
 Therefore, if a child was born in 1988, the child’s zodiac sign could be Rabbit (the zodiac before
Dragon) or Dragon depending on the specific date of his/her birthday. Similarly, if a child was born
                                                 9
       Of these 12 creatures, Dragon is considered as special because of its place in the

legends and mysteries. Dragon is a symbol of auspiciousness and power in Chinese culture.

One adage in Chinese states “wang zi cheng long”, which can be literally interpreted as

“hope that my children become Dragons.” Chinese people believe that babies born in a

Dragon year will have better fortunes than babies born in other years.

     There is evidence, reported by previous work, that in many Asian countries the

fertility rate goes up during dragon years. Vere (2008) reported that the number of live

births in Hong Kong increased significantly in the years of 1988 and 2000 which were two

Dragon years. Agarwal et al. (2017) found an increase in fertility among the Chinese

minorities in Singapore increases during the year of the Dragon. The same pattern in birth

rates was found among Chinese in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the U.S., 7 suggesting

that people of Chinese heritage indeed time the birth of their offspring to coincide with the

Dragon years. Yet, no evidence was found in mainland China to indicate the existence of

birth timing for Dragon children. Goodkind (1991) argued that compared to Taiwan, Hong

Kong, and Malaysia, local institutional conditions in China in the 1970s and 1980s, the

Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, and China’s birth control policies were

factors that prevented China from experiencing baby booms in the Dragon years of 1976

and 1988. During the period of Cultural Revolution, any activity connected with

superstition was strictly forbidden, and the One Child Policy had been implemented in

China starting in the late 1970s. According to the policy, each couple was allowed to have


in 1989, the zodiac sign of this child may be Dragon or Snake (the zodiac after Dragon), again
depending on the specific date of birth.

only one child, and if a couple just missed a Dragon year to have a baby, it would be hard

for them to plan for a Dragon baby unless they were willing to wait for 12 years to have a

child. Nevertheless, along with the process of becoming more open, the Dragon symbol

became acceptable in China again (Goodkind 1991). 8

     As explained in the next section, we show that despite these institutional barriers,

parents in mainland China do in fact time the birth of their children. Using national and

provincial data on live births we show that the number of live births spiked in the two most

recent Dragon years (2000 and 2012) 9. We also show that the number of marriages goes

up during the two years before a Dragon year, which supports the conjecture that couples

try and time their marriages and the subsequent pregnancy so that the birth of their child

would coincide with the Dragon year.

     A handful of studies have examined whether people born in Dragon years have better

“fortunes” and reported conflicting results. Using census datasets from Hong Kong, after

controlling for education, Wong and Yung (2005) did not find a significant correlation

between being born in a Dragon year and labor income. Sim (2015) suggested that due to

the large number of new babies born in the Dragon year of 1976 in Singapore, the Dragon

cohort should face higher competition when they apply for universities. He found a

negative impact of being born in the year of 1976 and 1977 on the probability of obtaining


8
 The One Child Policy of China has been relaxed over the years. Starting in 1984, parents were
allowed to have a second child as long as both parents were single children themselves. In 2013 the
policy has been revised further to allow parents have a second child as long as one of the parents
was a single child him/herself. Furthermore, parents can always have more than one child if they
are prepared to pay a monetary penalty or lose their government job.
9
  Our finding indirectly supports the argument of Goodkind (1991). It seems that when local
institutional conditions got better and when the impacts of the Cultural Revolution gradually faded
away, the favor of Dragon children re-appeared in mainland China.

                                                11
a college degree in Singapore, although the results need to be interpreted with caution due

to the very small sample size employed and the specific way how the Dragon cohort was

defined. 10 Johnson and Nye (2011) compared Asian immigrants to the U.S. to non-Asian

immigrants and reported a positive impact of being born in a Dragon year on educational

attainment among Asian immigrants. 11 Do and Phung (2010) found that in Vietnam,

children born in years that are thought to be auspicious have more years of schooling.

Agarwal et al. (2017) reported that income levels of Dragon Children were lower in

Singapore. They attribute this finding to the increase in cohort size due to the jump in birth

in Dragon years, which puts downward pressure on earnings given inelastic labor demand.

Lau (2019) shows that there was spike in fertility in Hong Kong during the Dragon years

of 1988, and using a diff-in-diff analysis he finds that both Dragon and non-Dragon



10
  In Sim (2015), the “Dragon cohort” is defined as all those born in 1976 and 1977. According to
the Chinese lunar calendar, the Dragon year of 1976 started on January 31, 1976 and ended on
February 17, 1977. This means that the “Dragon cohort” in Sim (2015) included not only Dragons
but also Rabbits (the cohort right before a Dragon cohort) and Snakes (the cohort right after a
Dragon cohort). Therefore, the negative “Dragon effect” on college entrance does not indicate that
the Dragon cohort but the mix of three cohorts had lower propensity of getting into a college in
Singapore on average. The author defined the “Dragon cohort” in this way to address that people
born in 1976 and 1977 all have to face the competition brought by the baby boom in the dragon
year of 1976. The author also mentioned that in the analysis sample, the Dragon cohort was on
average better educated in the sense that a higher proportion of the Dragon cohort were college
graduates in their sample compared with that among other cohorts.
11
  It is, however, difficult to interpret the results Johnson and Nye (2011). In the CPS data used in
the paper, the authors classify the “treated” group as those (i) who reported their race as Asians,
and (ii) who should culturally believe in the Dragon superstition. To arrive at the proper treated
group the authors correctly drop certain Asians such as Pakistanis, Indians and Filipinos from this
group, but they also drop mainland Chinese, although this latter group should be the most impacted
by the Dragon superstition. In the other data set used in the paper (the 2000 Census data), the
authors restrict the sample to the residents of California who reported their race as Asian, and define
the treatment dummy as being equal to one for those who reported their place of birth as Taiwan.
Thus, in these models, those with Chinese heritage are placed in the control group and thus they
are considered as being not impacted by the Dragon superstition (Johnson and Nye 2011, p. 95).
Other issues include admitted misclassification of the Dragon variable (footnote 10, and p.95), and
the very small number of Dragons in the analysis of mothers (34 individuals in a sample of 14,344,
and 116 people in the sample of 48,253; p. 92).
                                                  12
students of that Dragon-year cohort increase their time spent studying math, arguably

because of competitive pressures of being part of a larger peer group.



III.     Aggregate Fertility and Zodiacs in China

       Figure 2 presents the annual number of live births in mainland China between 1995

and 2014, obtained from China Health Statistical Yearbook. 12 Live births jumped up

significantly in 2000 and 2012 which are the two most recent Dragon years. Specifically,

the number of live births increased by 289,224 in 2000 compared to the year prior, and by

935,854 in 2012 compared to 2011. Even after the implementation of a new policy at the

end of 2013 allowing parents to have a second child as long as one of the parents was a

single child in his/her family, the number of babies born in China in 2014 was still much

lower than that in 2012, which was a Dragon year.

         To more formally analyze the impact of Dragon years on birth as well as marriages,

we employed province level panel data on the number of marriages and the number of live

births. 13 The results, reported in the Appendix Table A1, indicate that more people get


12
  We use the actual number of births rather than the birth rate because population data that are used
to calculate the birth rate information provided by the Chinese Statistical Yearbook or by the
National Bureau of Statistics of China, are inconsistent over time and across regions, and not
reliable. Population figures are estimated using different sources (some from household
registrations, some from census estimates, some others from annual national surveys on population
changes). In contrast, the data we use are the actual number of live births provided by the China
Health Statistical Yearbook.
13
   Using data on the number of marriages newly registered by the government every year
between 1979 and 2013, we investigate whether couples are more likely to get married before a
Dragon year (so that it would be easier for them to have a Dragon baby). Similarly, using
province-level data on live births, we are able to analyze whether more babies were born in
Dragon years. The provincial marriage data are from the China Civil Affair’s Statistical
Yearbook 1979-2014. The data are available for the period of 1978 – 2013. The provincial live
births data are available for the year span from 2003 to 2013, collected from the China Health
Statistical Yearbook 2004 - 2014. Because the Chinese zodiacs follow the Chinese lunar calendar
but the provincial data on the number of marriages and live births follow the Gregorian calendar,
                                                 13
married in a Tiger year and a Rabbit year, which are the two consecutive years before the

Dragon year. This is presumably because getting married within two years before a Dragon

year makes it easier for couples to plan for a Dragon baby. The results also show that more

births are given in a Dragon year. Thus, Chinese who live in mainland China care about

the zodiacs and that they time both their marriages and the birth of their children

accordingly, and that about half a million more babies are born in a Dragon year in

comparison to other years.



IV.     Empirical Framework

        To investigate the relationship between having been born in a Dragon year and

educational achievement, and the potential mechanisms of such a relationship, we employ

three different data sets and estimate the following three models below.

        Using data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) we estimate

(1)                  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾1 X𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑐𝑐 + 𝜉𝜉𝑖𝑖

where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable indicating whether individual 𝑖𝑖 has attained a college

education or higher. 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable indicating that an individual was born

in the Dragon year. As explained in the Data Section below, the CGSS contains information

on the exact date of birth of the respondents; thus their Zodiac affiliation can be determined


and because the two calendars do not overlap perfectly, an adjustment needs to be made to the
reported births and marriages. For instance, we let Dragon = (366-31-4)/366 for the year 2000.
This is based on the fact that the entire month of January and the first 4 days in February of 2000
do not belong to the Dragon year. Therefore, only (366-31-4) days in the year of 2000 (there are
366 days in 2000 since the year of 2000 is a leap year) belong to the Dragon year. We let Dragon
take the value of 23/365 in the year 2001 because the first 23 days in 2001 were still inside the
range of the Dragon year. We define Tiger and Rabbit similarly. We control for per capita income
of the province to account for the impact of economic conditions, and province-level
unobservables are accounted for by province fixed effects and province-specific linear trends.
The data are from 30 provinces/municipalities of China, spanning the years 1979 to 2013.
                                                       14
with precision. X𝑖𝑖 stands for a vector of controls, including gender, age, ethnicity, parents’

educational level as well as occupation and survey wave dummies; θc stands for province

fixed effects, and 𝜉𝜉𝑖𝑖 is the error term.

          In the second set of regressions we utilize the Beijing College Students Survey

(BCSS) data to investigate whether Dragon children perform better in the National College

Entrance Examination in comparison to other children. Specifically, we estimate

(2) 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝛾2 Λ𝑗𝑗 + 𝜌𝜌𝑠𝑠 + 𝜐𝜐𝑗𝑗

      where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 is college student 𝑗𝑗′𝑠𝑠 score in the National

College Entrance Examination. 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗 is a dummy to indicate that student 𝑗𝑗 was born

in a Dragon year. Λ𝑗𝑗 stands for a set of controls including the student’s gender, ethnicity,

parents’ educational level, family’s economic condition and whether the student took the

National College Entrance Examination multiple times. 14 Although the college entrance

examination is a national exam in China, the questions differ between provinces and

municipal cities in different years. To account for differences in educational quality, we

include province fixed effects, 𝜌𝜌𝑠𝑠 . Due to the design of the survey, all students surveyed

took the exam in either 2006 or 2008; thus, the model also controls for the year in which

the student took the exam.

      In the third set of analyses, we examine the relationship between having a Dragon

zodiac and the test scores among middle school students by making use of the China

Education Panel Study (CEPS) data. We estimate regressions of the form:



14
   We also have information on whether the student graduated from an elite high school. Although
we do not include this variable as a control as it could be endogenous if Dragon status determines
the type of high school the student attends, controlling for this variable does not influence the results.

                                                            15
(3)            𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝛼𝛼3 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 + 𝛾𝛾3 Θ𝑘𝑘 + λ𝑐𝑐 + 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘

        where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is the mid-term test score of student 𝑘𝑘 in subject s, where the

subjects are Mathematics, Chinese and English. 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 is a dummy variable equal to

one if student 𝑘𝑘 was born in a Dragon year. Θ𝑘𝑘 is the vector of control variables, including

the attributes of the students such as age, gender, type of hukou, 15, ethnicity, whether they

are the only child in their family. 16 Also included in the data set are parents’ characteristics,

ranging from parents’ education to whether parents have white collar jobs, to the income

level of the family, reported by parents. λc stands for a set of classroom fixed-effects, and

𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘 is an error term. Standard errors are clustered at the classroom level, with 438

classrooms.

      Using the same CESP data, we also run models depicted by Equation (3), but we

employ as dependent variables those that gauge the extent of students’ self-esteem and

aspirations, reported by the students. These dependent variables include the following six

separate indicators that measure if the student believes he/she is (i) articulate, (ii) fast

thinker, (iii) quick learner, (iv) has faith in his/her future, (v) wants to go to college, and

(vi) if s/he expects to be a leader or officer in national/government institutions, a scientist,

an engineer or an executive in a company.

      We similarly analyze the extent to which parents’ expectations regarding their

children’s future are different between parents of Dragon-year children and other parents.



15
  Hukou can be understood as a certificate of residency in China. It is correlated with people’s
choices and rights in terms of housing and schooling.
16
  The CEPS data provide information on students’ cognitive ability. The baseline regressions do
not include this variable as cognitive ability may be “determined” by the zodiac of the student if
cognitive ability measures, in part, skills learned at school or in the family. Adding cognitive ability
to the model, however, has no impact on the results.
                                                        16
These regressions follow the same format as Equation (3), but the dependent variables

include such measures as whether the parent expects his/her child to obtain at least a college

degree, whether the parent expects the child to get a job in the future as a leader or officer

in national/government institutions, a scientist, an engineer or an executive in a company,

and whether the parent has faith in the child’s future.

        Finally, we investigate parents’ investment in their children. The questions we use

include whether the child went to kindergarten 17, the amount of pocket money parents give

to the child (in middle school), how many times parents talked to the teachers this semester,

and whether the kids do any chores at home, helping parents.

        It is conceivable that the parents of Dragon children are systematically different from

other parents. For example, they can be more educated, or they can have more income. In

all data sets we used, we investigated whether Dragon parents differ from other parents in

observable dimensions, ranging from parent education to occupation and family income.

As explained later in the paper, there is no difference between the two groups of parents in

terms of these attributes and controlling for these attributes in regressions does not alter the

results.



Analyses of Individuals who are around the Zodiac Cutoffs

        We supplement the analyses described earlier with additional investigation of the

outcomes (i.e. education level, university entrance exams, middle school test scores) using

individuals who are at both ends of the Dragon year cutoffs.




17
     In China children are not allowed to enter kindergarten before they are 3 years old.
                                                   17
           Using the CGSS data, we implement a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) design

(Imbens and Lemieux 2008, Lee and Lemieux 2010) taking advantage of the information

on the exact birthdates of the survey respondents. Our preferred specification is the local

linear regression without specifying a functional form on the data. 18 To estimate the causal

impact of being born in the Dragon year on the propensity of earning a bachelor’s or higher

degree, we estimate the following local linear regression equation:

(4) 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼4 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 (𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐)𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝐷𝐷 ∗ (𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐)𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾4 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

           where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 is the outcome, and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 is the Dragon dummy. The running variable is the

birthdate of the individuals.

           Because the Dragon year has two cutoffs at the beginning and the end of the year,

each individual in the sample faces two potential cutoffs. Following Pop-Eleches and

Urquiola (2013), Hoekstra et al. (2018), and Zimmerman (2019), we utilize both cutoffs in

the analyses. 19 We allow for different treatment effects on both sides of the cutoff by

interacting the Dragon dummy with the distance between the birthdate and cutoff date. The

coefficient of interest, 𝛼𝛼1 in Equation (4), measures the effect of being born in the Dragon

year on the outcome. 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 is the same full set of covariates included in Equation (1), and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

is the error term. The optimal bandwidths are selected by the data-driven procedure

developed by Calonico et al. (2017) and Calonico et al. (2018) for both sides of the cutoffs


18
   As suggested by Gelman and Imbens (2017), local linear regressions (non-parametric) are more
stable in uncovering the true estimates than polynomial models because polynomial models are
prone to providing noisy estimates. Moreover, estimates obtained from polynomial models could
be sensitive to the degree of the polynomial. Nevertheless, we also provide the RD estimates
obtained from the first and second order polynomials (parametric) in the Appendix.
19
   We replicate each observation in the original working sample once. Consequently, each
individual is presented twice in the sample. We employ the two observations of each individual
for the two cutoffs, respectively. In practice, however, each individual is only utilized once in the
analysis.

                                                                 18
separately with a uniform kernel, but employ various bandwidths to investigate the

robustness of the results. 20 The RD results are presented in Section VII.

     In the BCSS and CEPS samples we are not able to implement an RD estimation

because although the month of birth in reported, the birthday is not recorded. In the same

spirit of local linear regressions, however, we implement analyses using individuals born

in the nearest full months to the cutoffs. For example, a Dragon year started on February

17, 1988 and ended on February 5, 1989. The year before the Dragon is a Rabbit year and

the year after the Dragon is a Snake year. Thus, using the BCSS data we run the models

using those who were born in the last full month of a Rabbit year (born too early to have a

Dragon zodiac) and those whore born at the first full month of the Snake year (born too

late and missed being a Dragon) as well as the Dragons who were born in the first and the

last full month of the Dragon year. We conduct a similar analysis using the CEPS data.

Although the sample sizes decline by design, we obtain the same inference.



V.      Data

Chinese General Social Survey Data.

     We construct separate datasets based on three newly released surveys from China.

The data employed to analyze the educational level of the Dragon cohort are obtained from

the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). CGSS is a large and nationally representative

social survey that covers all provinces, and both rural and urban areas in China. We use the

2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015 waves of CGSS because the exact birthdates of the respondents

are provided in these waves, which allows for the determination of their zodiacs accurately.


20
  We also estimate specifications using a triangular kernel using various bandwidths, which
provide similar results, reported in Panel B of Appendix Table A5.
                                               19
In addition, these four waves include consistent measurement of parents’ employment

status. We restrict our data to the survey respondents who were born between 1985 and

1991 (1988 is the Dragon year). Hence, in our effective sample the age of the respondents

ranges from 19 to 30. In alternative specifications, we narrow the age window to those

who are born between 1986 and 1990 and between 1987 and 1989. For example, Figure 3

displays the proportion of individuals with a college degree or higher by their zodiac year

and it shows that the Dragon cohort is more likely to have a college education than the

Rabbit and Snake cohorts who were in the same academic years with the “Dragons.”

     Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the CGSS dataset. The total number of

observations is 3,835. The dataset covers one Dragon cohort (the Dragon year of 1988).

As shown in Table 1, the Dragon and non-Dragon cohorts are similar in attributes such as

gender, ethnicity, and parent education.



Beijing College Students Survey Data

     The second data set is the Beijing College Students Survey (BCSS), which we use to

examine the relationship between having a Dragon zodiac and students’ performance in

the National College Entrance Examination in China (see Equation 2 above). Around 5,000

students from 15 universities in Beijing were randomly selected to answer the survey in

2009 (Li, 2016). 21 Students were asked to report when they took the National College

Entrance Examinations and what their scores were.




21
  Almost all the universities in the sample are top 50 schools in China. Only one of them has a
rank of 52.

                                              20
     The summary statistics of the BCSS dataset are presented in Table 2. Our effective

sample contains 2,956 observations. Twenty-three percent of the students were born in the

Dragon year of 1988. In various specifications estimated we created sub-samples with

narrower age bands. For example, we focused on those born in the Dragon year (1988),

those born the year before (1987) and the year after (1989).

      Due to the design of the survey, students in the sample took the national entrance

exam in either 2006 or 2008, and we restrict the sample to students who took the exam

when they were 18 or 19 years old, which is the typical age when a high school graduate

takes the college entrance exam in China. Students whose score is lower than 500 points

are dropped and students from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macaw and Tibet are dropped 22.

     As shown in Table 2, twelve percent of students belong to a minority group in China,

and 10 percent of them took the National College Entrance Examination more than once.

The students were asked to rank the income status of their family in their local area, from

1 to 5 indicating from the best to the worst. We create a dummy variable to indicate that

the economic status of the student’s family is good. This variable takes the value of one if

the respondent indicated that his/her family’s economic condition is the best in the local

area, or better than local average income. Table 2 shows that 15 percent of students

indicated that their family income can be classified as such. Table 2 also shows that the



22
  Every year in each province in China, there is a minimum cutoff point which determines whether
a student can go to a “key” college in China. All the students in our sample are from top colleges
where the cutoff scores are usually much higher than the cutoff point for “key” colleges. Because
the lowest minimum cutoff point in 2006 and 2008 was higher than 500 points in most of the
provinces, we therefore drop students whose scores are below 500 points. For the similar reason,
we drop students who took the exam in Shanghai, Guangdong or in Jiangsu province in 2008,
because the total score in Shanghai, Guangdong or in Jiangsu in 2008 are much different from those
in other provinces, which make their students incomparable to others students.

                                               21
average college entrance exam score is about 603, and Figure 4 reveals that those with a

Dragon zodiac have higher scores in comparison to individuals with other zodiac

affiliations.



Middle School Students: China Education Panel Study Data

     The third data set analyzed is the China Education Panel Study (CEPS). The CEPS

sampling design is based on randomly selecting 438 classrooms from 112 schools in 28

districts, counties or cites, after the first-stage stratification by education level and intensity

of population mobility. In the main analyses, we use the first wave of CEPS, which is

conducted in 2013-2014. CEPS collects data on middle school students in grades of 7 and

9, who were born in 1996-2002. Consequently, we have a Dragon cohort (spanning

February 5, 2000 to January 23, 2001).

     As shown in Table 3, of approximately 15,000 middle school students in our sample,

23 percent were born in the Dragon year of 2000. About half of the students are female.

The data set contains the mid-term test scores in the subjects of Math, English and Chinese.

The mid-term exam scores are provided by the head teacher of the class or the dean of

studies in these middle schools.

     A unique aspect of this data set is the questions about self-esteem and expectations

about the future. The students answered questions measuring their self-esteem and

ambitions and expectations about their future. Specifically, students are asked to evaluate

statements about themselves by providing a rating to each statement, ranging from 1

“Completely disagree” to 4 “Completely agree”. The dummy variable Articulate takes the

value of 1 if the student “completely agrees” or “agrees” with the statement that “I can

express my opinions clearly.” Fast Thinker is another dummy variable that takes the value
                                                22
of 1 if the student completely agrees or agrees with the statement of “I respond quickly to

things”. Quick Lerner takes the value of one if the student believes that s/he can learn new

knowledge quickly.

     The students were also asked to evaluate the extent of their faith in their own future.

Possible answers range from “I have no faith at all in my future” to “I have a lot of faith in

my future.” We build a dummy to indicate that a student has some faith or a lot of faith in

his/her future. In addition, the survey asks the students what degree they would like to

obtain and what kind of job they would like to have in the future. The variable Wants

College Degree or Higher takes the value of one if the student wishes to obtain at least a

college degree. We define Strong Career Ambition as a dummy variable indicating

whether a student expects to have a job as a leader or officer in national/government

institutions, a scientist, an engineer or an executive in a company.

     The CEPS also asked parents about their expectations for their children. We create a

dummy variable to indicate that parents expect their children to have at least a bachelor’s

degree based on the question: “what degree do you expect your children to achieve?”

Parents are also asked the question “what occupation do you expect your children to have

in the future?” We created a dummy variable to indicate whether parents have strong career

ambition for their children, revealed by their expectation of their children becoming a

leader or officer in national/government institutions, a scientist, an engineer or an executive

in a company. Another dummy takes the value of one if parents are “confident” or “very

confident” that their children are going to have a bright future. We also constructed a

dummy variable to indicate whether parents expect of their child to perform better than

class average.


                                              23
     We created a set of dichotomous indicators that measure various aspects of parents’

investment in their children. For example, we created a dummy variable to indicate

whether parents contact the teachers of their kids frequently in the current semester. We

also built a variable which measures the amount of pocket money given to the kids each

week by their parents. The CEPS survey asks the students whether they usually help parents

in housework and during the summer/winter holiday. A similar question asks the students

how much time they spent helping parents in house chores during the past week. We

created two separate dummy variables indicating whether the kids help parents around the

house with chores during the holiday, and whether the child help with house chores during

the past week. The survey also contains a question asking the students whether they ever

attended kindergarten after 3 years old. We treat the information on the kindergarten

attendance as another aspect of parents’ investment in children and we create a dummy

variable which takes the value of one if the child attended kindergarten.

     We observe in the data whether it was the mother or the father who answered the

questions about parents’ expectations, and we add this dichotomous indicator to the

relevant regressions as a control. We drop an observation if someone other than the

student’s parents (e.g. uncle or grandfather) answered the survey questions.

     We have indicators for both the mother and the father having at least a college degree.

Similarly, Father White Collar and Mother White Collar are two dummy variables

indicating whether the father and the mother have white collar and skilled jobs. The model

also includes a dummy variable gauging the income status of the family. Parents were

asked about their current economic conditions of their family. The alternatives were: very




                                            24
bad, bad, intermediate, rich and very rich. The dichotomous variable Family Has High

Income takes the value of one if the parent indicated that they feel rich and very rich.



The Determination of the Dragon Zodiac

     To determine the zodiac of the students, the exact date of birth needs to be known.

The first data set analyzed, the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), contains this

information. The other two data sets (BCSS and CEPS) include information only on the

birth year and birth month of the student, but the day of the birth is not reported. Hence,

we are not able to determine the zodiacs for those students who were born in a particular

month if a lunar Chinese new year started somewhere other than the beginning or the end

of that month. We apply two procedures to deal with such cases in which the zodiac cannot

be identified with precision. First, we treat those students as having been born in a Dragon

zodiac if at least half of the month in which they were born belongs to a Dragon year zodiac.

The results in the paper are based on this procedure. Alternatively, we created an adjusted

Dragon dummy which takes the value of the proportion of days belonging to the “Dragon”

year in that month. For example, if a student was born in February 1988, the Dragon

dummy will be equal to 12/28 (there were 28 days in February of 1988; the first 16 days

belong to the Rabbit year, the rest 12 days belong to the Dragon year). The results obtained

from both procedures are very similar.




                                             25
VI.     Results

Dragons and College Education

      Table 4 presents the results obtained by estimating Equation (1) using the CGSS data.

The summary statistics of the sample are provided in Table 1. The dependent variable is

an indicator to show whether or not the respondent has attained a bachelor’s degree or

higher. Figure 3 displays the mean of dependent variable by zodiac for the Rabbit, Dragon,

and Snake cohorts. Note that the CGSS survey is registered in different years. Thus, the

respondents who are of the same age in the data may have different birth years. The

regressions control for age, thus the variation in zodiac years is obtained from the

incomplete overlap between the lunar and Gregorian calendars. All models contain

dummies for labor market activity of both the mother and the father. These classifications

include not only general categories such as full-time farming, casual worker, individual

business, unemployed, retired, and housework, it also includes such categories as disabled

and passed away. 23

      Column 1 of Table 4 shows that all else the same, those born in Dragon year have

seven percentage points higher probability to have obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher

in comparison to individuals born in other zodiac years. When the individual’s father has

a college degree or higher, his/her propensity to obtain a bachelor’s degree is increased by

around 20 percentage points.




23
   The 17 categories are: 1. Employed by others (having a fixed employer); 2.full-time farmer; 3.
Part-time farmer; 4. Contract employee/dispatched worker; 5. Casual worker (no fixed employer);
6. Working in family business, with salary; 7. Working in family business, no salary; 8. Freelance;
9. Individual business; 10. Owner or partner of a business; 11. Retired; 12. Unemployed; 13.
Disabled; 14. In school without having a job; 15. Does housework; 16. Passed away; 17. Others.
                                                26
     The sample used in regressions reported in column (1) of Table 4 includes individuals

who are born between 1985 and 1991. There is one Dragon cohort in this group: those who

are born in 1988 (The Dragon year covered the period between February 17, 1988 and

February 5, 1989). To create cohorts of individuals who are more similar in their birth

years, we kept those who are born between 1986 and 1990. This group contains those who

are born in the year of Rabbit (the year before Dragon), the year of the Snake (the year

after the Dragon), the year of the Tiger (two years before the Dragon), and Horse (two

years after the Dragon). The results are reported in column (2) of Table 4. The sample size

goes down to 2,850, but the estimated impact of the Dragon dummy remains significant

with a point estimate of 0.06. Narrowing the window of birth year to 1987 - 1989 reduces

the samples size further to 1,714 in column (3), but the inference is not altered. The Dragon

dummy in column (3) of Table 4, indicates that a Dragon child is six percentage points

more likely to receive at least a bachelor’s degree. All models contain dummies for labor

market activity of both the mother and father. These classifications include not only general

categories, such as full-time farming, casual workers, individual business, unemployed,

retired, and housework, it also includes such categories as disabled and passed away.

     In summary, consistent with the picture revealed in Figure 3, the results of Table 4

indicate that those who are born in a Dragon year are about 6 percentage points (or 19

percent) more likely to have a college education in comparison to those born in other zodiac

years in cohorts that one or two years older or younger, as well as those who directly

compete with the Dragon cohort in the same academic year.

Dragons and University Entrance Exam Scores

     Table 5 presents the results obtained from estimating Equation (2). The outcome is

students’ test scores on the National College Entrance Examinations. The descriptive

statistics of the data used in these regressions (BCSS) are provided in Table 2.

     The results, reported in column (1) of Table 5 show that, all else the same, the National

College Entrance Examination scores of those who are born in a Dragon zodiac are around

10.5 points higher. Although this is only about 1.7 percent impact relative to the average

score, this difference can have a profound effect on student placement. This is because a

large population of students takes the exam each year in China, and in the extremely

competitive environment each additional point has an impact on whether or not, and to

which university or major the student will qualify to attend.

     Table 5 also shows that female students and minorities have lower scores. In

regressions not reported here, we found that those who have attended an elite high school

receive substantially higher scores than students who graduate from other high schools, but

that adding this (potentially endogenous) variable to the model had no impact on the

estimated coefficient of the Dragon dummy24.

     Column (2) of Table 5 shows that students whose parents are better educated score

higher on the University Entrance Exam. The same is true if family income is above

average. The magnitude of the coefficient of the Dragon dummy is reduced slightly by



24
  The elite high schools are called key high schools or key-point (literal interpretation) high schools.
There are some key high schools in China in different jurisdictions (province level, city level,
county level). The government allocates much more resources to the key high schools, such that
the key high schools have more funding, better teachers, etc. Every middle school has to take a
high school entrance exam to apply to a high school, and the score a student gets in this exam is
the only determinant of the acceptance. Key high schools have higher minimum required scores
than ordinary high schools. Some details are discussed in Ye (2015).

controlling for parent education and family income. Column (3) restricts the sample to the

cohorts born between 1987 and 1989; thus in this sample students differ in age by a

maximum of three years. There was a Dragon year in 1988 (between February 17, 1988

and February 5, 1989). Thus, of the 2,029 students in this sample (born between 1987 and

1989), 622 (30.7%) are born in the year of the Dragon, 666 (31.9%) are born in the year of

the Snake, and the rests are born the year of the Rabbit or Tiger. In this sample, being a

Dragon child is associated with an increase in the College Entrance Exam score by about

9.1 points.

     The BCSS provides information on the birth month, but not the birth date. Thus, we

are unable to determine the zodiac for students who were born in the cutoff months of the

Dragon year. Therefore, we employ an alternative measure of the Dragon dummy.

Specifically, we let the adjusted Dragon dummy equal to the proportion of days belonging

to the Dragon year if a student was born in the cutoff months of a Dragon year. The results

using this adjusted Dragon dummy are reported in columns (4) to (6) in Table 5. The

inference does not change.

     Overall, the results in Table 5 show that, controlling for a number of covariates,

having been born in a Dragon year is associated with an increase in the university exam

score by 9 to 10 points. This result is consistent with the raw differences depicted by Figure

4.




                                              29
Analysis of Middle School Students

     The regressions reported in Table 6 analyze the impact of having been born in a

Dragon year on test scores of middle school students. The descriptive statistics used in

these regressions are provided in Table 3. The regressions use 13,309 middle school

students who are in the 7th or 9th grade in 438 classrooms from 112 schools. In this sample,

those born in 2000 have the zodiac of the Dragon. Figure 5 presents the timeline of the

Gregorian calendar, its overlap with the relevant zodiacs and the school years.

     The results in Table 6 display three regressions, where the dependent variables are

students’ midterm test scores in Mathematics, Chinese and English. In addition to student

characteristics, the regressions also control for parent attributes and classroom fixed effects.

Standard errors are clustered at the classroom level. The coefficients reported in Table 6

reveal that parent education has a significant impact on test scores in all three subjects.

Female students score higher, and age-for-grade has a negative impact on midterm scores.

     Column (1) of Table 6 shows that the students born in a Dragon year score higher in

Mathematics, although the estimated impact is not statistically different from zero.

Columns (2) and (3) indicates that Dragon children score higher in both Chinese and

English mid-term exams and that these magnitudes are statistically different from zero.

Specifically, being born in the Dragon year leads to around 0.04 and 0.03 of a standard

deviation increase in the test scores in Chinese and English, respectively. The magnitude

of the effect is as large as peer effect and teacher’s gender effect found in some previous

studies (eg. Lavy et al., 2012; Hanushek et al., 2009; Brunello et al., 2010; Lim and Meer,

2017). Alternatively, we present the results obtained utilizing the adjusted Dragon dummy

in the Appendix Table A2. The results are very similar to the baseline results.


                                              30
     Regressions in Table 6 control for parents’ education, parents’ job type (white collar

occupations) and an indicator for high family income. Therefore, the impact of the Dragon

zodiac on test scores are not driven by parents’ education or income. It could, however, be

the case that Dragon children have higher self-esteem than other kids, and that higher self-

esteem can have a positive impact on test scores. The detail of the data set allows us to test

this hypothesis. Specifically, students were asked to evaluate their own attributes ranging

from beliefs in their mental ability to their career ambitions.

     Regressions reported in Table 7 explain students’ self-evaluations on six dimensions.

For example, the dependent variable in column (1) of Table 7 is a dummy variable to

indicate if the student believes that she/he can articulate his/her thoughts clearly. The

dependent variable of the model in column (2) is an indicator on whether the student

believes that he/she is a fast thinker. Other self-evaluated attributes are whether the student

believes that she/he is a quick thinker, whether she/he wants to go to college, whether

she/she wants to be a leader or officer in national/government institutions, a scientist, an

engineer or an executive in a company and whether he has faith in this/her own future. The

descriptive statistics of these variables are provided in Table 3.

     The results of Table 7 show that the coefficient of the Dragon dummy is small in each

regression and never significantly different from zero. This indicates that having been born

in a Dragon year has no impact on various aspects of self-esteem. Thus, self-esteem cannot

be the reason to explain the impact of the Dragon dummy on test scores, reported in Table

6.




                                              31
Are Dragon Parents Different?

     As mentioned earlier in the paper, it can be argued that parents of Dragon children

may be different from other parents. For example, they may be more educated, or they

may have more income. If such attributes of the parents make them more likely to time

their birth and make it more likely for them to have Dragon child, and if these attributes

also impact child outcomes, then it would be the influence of these factors that impact

child’s education and test scores. To eliminate such confounding in the regressions we

control for all available parent attributes, including income, occupation and education.

     To formally investigate whether Dragon parents and other parents differ from each

other in observable dimensions, we run parent attributes on a dummy to indicate if their

child was born in Dragon year. We do this in all data sets used in the paper. The results

are reported in Table 8. Panel A displays the results from the CGSS sample, which shows

that the probability of the father having at least a bachelor’s degree is not different between

the father of Dragon children and other fathers. The coefficient of the Dragon dummy is

0.005 and highly insignificant. The same is true about mothers’ education. Mothers of

Dragon children are no more likely to have a college education or higher. Panels B and C

of Table 8 demonstrate the same picture in other data sets. In no case do we see a difference

between the parents of Dragon children and other parents regarding their education, income

or the probability of having a white-collar occupation.




                                              32
It is all about Parents’ Beliefs and Investment in Children

     The middle school data set also includes questions about how parents perceive their

kids’ future and how they expect their children’s future to look like. The questions that

were asked of parents include whether parents believe their child will obtain at least a high

school diploma, whether they believe that their child will obtain at least a bachelor’s degree,

whether they expect the child to become a leader or officer in national/government

institutions, a scientist, an engineer or an executive in a company, and whether they have

faith in their child’s future. 25 Table 9 presents the results of these regressions. The models

include attributes of the children, as well as parent characteristics including parent

education and family income status. In all cases the Dragon dummy is positive, and in four

of the five models it is highly significant. This indicates that all else the same, parents have

higher expectations of their child if their child is born in the year of the Dragon. Because

we investigate multiple outcomes in Table 9 that gauge different but related parent

expectations, we adjust the p-values of the Dragon dummy for multiple hypothesis testing

(Newson 2010, Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001). The adjusted p-values, presented in the

footnote of Table 9, reveal that the inference is not altered.

     Parents’ high expectations about their child’s current success in school as well as

his/her future success can translate into devoting resources to the child. For example,

parents may spend more time consulting teachers about their child, or they may be less

likely to require their children to help with the chores around the house. Furthermore, if



25
  No parents expect their children to get a college diploma without getting a high school diploma.
There 64 parents in the data who expect their children’s education to stop before regular high school
but still wish their children to find a job as a leader or employer in government or national
institutions.

                                                 33
parents’ expectations about their child’s future are related to the investment made in the

child (the effort and the resources parents spend on their child), parent expectations would

be positively related to the child’s test scores. To investigate this hypothesis, we modified

the midterm test score regressions (displayed in Table 6) by including the variables that

gauge parent expectations. Any change in the estimated value of the coefficient of the

Dragon dummy in these regressions reveal information about the mechanism through

which the Dragon dummy impact test scores. Specifically, given that parents of Dragon

children have higher expectations of their children (see Table 9), to the extent that the

Dragon dummy acts as a proxy for these expectations, including both the Dragon dummy

and parent expectations as explanatory variables to the model to explain test scores should

provide a coefficient of the dragon dummy that is smaller in magnitude in comparison to

the models that excludes parent expectations.

     We add parents’ expectations into the models reported in Table 6. The new results are

reported in Table 10. Compared to those reported in Table 6, the coefficients of the Dragon

dummy variable are about half as large in the Chinese midterm score regression (column

2), 80 percent smaller in English midterm score regression (column 3) and it becomes

negative in the Math score regression (column 1), and they are not different from zero in

any three columns. This indicates that after controlling for parents’ expectations, the

Dragon zodiac no longer explains higher test scores of the Dragon kids. On the other hand,

all five variables measuring parent expectations have positive and significant coefficients.

     It can be argued that higher test scores of the student prompt his/parents to raise their

expectations; i.e. test scores may shape parent expectations. To investigate the validity of

such reverse causality between students’ test scores and parental expectations, we replicate


                                             34
the analyses in Table 6 and Table 10 by employing data from the 2014-2015 wave of CEPS.

The CEPS conducted a follow-up survey one year later for all students who were in the 7th

grade in the previous wave (2013-2014). Thus, we regress 8th grade test scores on parent

expectation in the 7th grade. Because the 8th grade test scores cannot impact parents’

expectations formed one year earlier, any potential baise due to reverse causality is not

relevant in this specification. The results, reported in the Appendix Table A3, are consistent

with those reported in Tables 6 and 10. Thus, they confirm the finding that parental

expectations is the channel through which the “Dragon effect” works. 26

     Table 11 presents the regression results that test whether parents of Dragon children

in fact invest more in their children in comparison to other parents. The results reported in

column (1) of Table 11 suggest that parents of Dragon kids are 1.4 percentage points more

likely to take the initiative to actively contact their child’s teachers 5 or more times in the

current semester in comparison to other parents. The results in columns (2) and (3) indicate

that parents of Dragon kids have a higher propensity to enroll their children in kindergarten

and that they give more pocket money to their children. The dependent variables in

columns (4) and (5) measure whether the child often spends time on house chores. The

estimates suggest that Dragon kids are less likely to help parents on housework. Thus, the

results of Table 11 reveal that parents of Dragon children invest more time and money in

their offspring in comparison to other parents.

                                              35
Child Height

     Parents may also invest in their children in terms of nutrition. The data set contains

no information about the food intake of children but there is information on the height of

middle school students. Given the evidence that height in adolescence is strongly correlated

with nutrition intake during childhood (see Case and Paxson 2008 and the literature they

cite) we ran regressions of height of middle school students on the Dragon dummy,

controlling for the same set of explanatory variables as before, including the age of the

student. The results are displayed in Table 12. Column (1) shows that female students are

about 6.4 cm shorter than males, but that being a female Dragon child has a positive impact

on height. Specifically, having been born in the year of the Dragon helps reduce the female

height gap by 2.7 centimeters. Columns (2) and (3) present the results by students’ location

of residence. The average height of rural students is 160.8 cm, whereas students in urban

areas are 163.2 cm tall on average. Columns (2) and (3) reveal that the impact on height

of being a female dragon child is larger in rural areas (3.3 cm vs. 1.9 cm), which is

confirmed by the results presented in column (4). Thus, the results in Table 12 indicate that

even though girls are six centimeters shorter than boys this height disadvantage is mitigated

by having a Dragon zodiac. Specifically, if a female middle school student is born in the

year of the Dragon she is 2.7 cm taller than another female student of the same age. This

is consistent with the hypothesis of allocation of additional nutritional resources to girls if

they are born in the year of the Dragon. That this effect is larger in rural areas is also

consistent with the hypothesis that food and nutrition may be driving this finding because

investment in children in terms of food and nutrition should be more prevalent in rural, as

opposed to urban areas.


                                              36
VII.    Analyses of Narrow Birthday Windows

        As discussed in Section IV, we are able to implement a sharp RD approach, taking

advantage of the information on the exact birthdates of the individuals in the CGSS sample.

We tested the discontinuity of the running variable following Cattaneo et al. (2018). 27 The

results are presented in Figure 6. The figure displays continuity of the running variable at

the cutoff dates of the Dragon year. 28 We implement two methods to test for the

smoothness of the covariates used in the analyses. The results are displayed in Figure 7 and

Table A4. In Figure 7 we show the fitted value of the outcome predicted by all the

covariates utilized in the main analyses. The fitted values are averaged by every 30 days.

The figure shows that the fitted values are continuous around the cutoff point. Alternatively,

we present the local linear regression estimates of all the covariates in the Appendix Table

A4. No estimate is different from zero. Taken together, these results indicate that the

assumptions for implementing a RD approach are fulfilled.

        Figure 8 displays the average probability of having at least a college degree of

Dragons in comparison to those born earlier or later (i.e. Rabbits and Snakes). The outcome

is averaged by 30-day bins, i.e. each dot represents the average propensity for holding a

bachelor’s or higher degree for individuals born within a given month. Dragons are

presented on the right side of the cutoff and to the left of the cutoff are those who are born

in both the Rabbit and the Snake years. The figure displays a sharp and clear jump in the


27
   This test is an improved version of the McCrary (2008). The advantage of this procedure is that
it does not require pre-screen of the data, and it auto-determines the bandwidth. A recent
application is in Cabrera and Webbink (forthcoming).
28
  Consistent with the figure, we cannot reject the continuity of the running variable at the cutoff
point with a p-value of 0.591.

level of educational attainment between the Dragon cohort and the adjacent cohorts. The

RD estimates obtained using the optimal bandwidths are reported in the first column of

Table 13. The coefficient indicates that those in the Dragon cohort are 9 percentage points

more likely to receive a bachelor’s degree or higher. This result is consistent with the

baseline results using the CGSS data (Table 4). As a robustness check we repeat the

analysis using 0.85, 1.25, 1.5 and 2 times of the optimal bandwidths, reported in columns

(2)-(4) of Table 13. The results do not change. We also employ a model using the first or

second order polynomials as further robustness checks. The results, reported in the

Appendix Table A5, are very similar to those obtained from the non-parametric model.

Finally, we estimate the models using a triangular kernel with different bandwidths. As

displayed in panel B of Table A5, the results remain the same.

       Ninety-five percent of the middle school students who are analyzed in regressions,

reported in Tables 6-11, were born between 1998 and 2001. In this section we focus on

students who were born in narrower time intervals. Because the Dragon year covered the

period from February 5, 2000 to January 23, 2001 (see Figure 5), we focus on 7th grade

students who were born during the last full month of the Dragon year (December 2000) or

during the first full month of year of the Snake (February 2001). This sample contains 847

students, with Dragon kids constituting 55 percent of the sample. Under the assumption

that some parents were trying to give birth to a Dragon baby, these two groups of students

consist of those who barely made the cutoff of the Dragon year and those who missed being

born in the Dragon year by a few weeks. We drop those who are born in January 2001

because in this middle school data set, although we know the birth month of the students,

don’t know their birth day. Figures 9, 10, and 11 display the average test scores of these


                                            38
two groups of students, net of the impact of co-variates. Panel A of Table 14 presents the

regressions of test scores in this narrow sample. 29 The results are consistent with those

reported in Table 6. Having been born in a Dragon year, as opposed to the year of the Snake,

is associated with higher test scores. Panel B of Table 14 shows that doing the same

exercise for the same group of students but controlling for parents’ expectations (as was

done in Table 10) cuts the magnitude of the Dragon dummy in half in English and Chinese

test score regressions and turns the coefficient of the Dragon dummy to negative in the

math regression; and none of these effects is different from zero. This is the same result

reported in Table 10. In summary, accounting for parent expectations eliminates the

Dragon impact in this narrow sample as it was the case in the large sample of middle school

students.

       We repeat the exercise of focusing on narrow samples in the BCSS sample that

consists of college students. Recall that this sample contains the Dragon cohort of 1988,

which spanned February 17, 1988 to February 5, 1989. Thus, we extract the students born

in the beginning and at the end of the Dragon year (those born in March 1988 and in January

1989) as well as those just missed the Dragon year (those born a bit early, in January 1988,

before the Dragon year started, and those who are born and a bit late in March 1989 after

the Dragon year ended). Average university entrance exam scores of these groups are

displayed in Figure 12, and Panel C of Table 14 shows that 137 Dragon students of this

sample of 250 (the rest being Rabbit or Snake), have higher university entrance exam

scores, controlling for other covariates as was done in the regressions of Table 5. In



29
   The test scores are purged of all other determinants shown in Table 6 by first regression the
scores on all covariates other than the Dragon dummy in the whole sample and then running the
residuals on the Dragon dummy in the sample of 847 students.
                                              39
summary, the analyses in this section reveal that the results presented in the paper are robust

to doing the same analyses in narrower samples which contain people with Dragon zodiac

and those who are born in adjacent months.



Do Dragon Parents Invest in their Kids because of the Fear of Competition?

         As Table 11 demonstrates, parents of middle school Dragon children invest more

heavily in their kids in comparison to other parents. The assumption behind this finding is

that the parents of Dragon children believe that their children are inherently more

productive as suggested by the superstition. Thus, an investment in these kids would

produce higher returns in comparison to investment in other kids (by other parents). In

other words, Dragon parents would invest more heavily in their kids as opposed to other

parents because the return of their investment is higher. It can be argued, however, that

parents do not believe that Dragon children are superior. That is, they prefer their kids to

be born in a Dragon year for some other reason, but they don’t actually think that Dragon

kids are destined for greatness. 30 Yet, everyone recognizes that the Dragon cohorts are

larger and therefore these Dragon children would be at a disadvantage unless additional

resources are allocated to them to compensate for the intensity of competition they would

face due to the large cohort size. In this scenario, Dragon parents invest in their children

to counteract the drawback of their kids being a member or a large cohort. To investigate

the validity of this conjecture, we focus exclusively on 7th grade students who are

classmates. This subsample of middle school students consists of only those who were born

in a Dragon year or in a Snake year. This cohort of the 7th graders is large because of the


30
   As discussed earlier, we show in the paper that Dragon parents have higher expectations of their children
in comparison to other parents, refuting this claim.
                                                    40
Dragon children; and the parents of the Snake children should also be aware of this fact.

Thus, 7th grade parents whose children were born in the year of the Snake should be worried

about the increased competition due to the large cohort size generated by the Dragon kids

in the 7th grade, and these Snake parents are expected to invest in their kids as heavily as

do the parents of the “competing” Dragon kids. This argument suggests that there should

not be a significant difference between these two groups of parents in terms of investment

in their offspring.

        Appendix Table A6 presents the summary results of the analyses done in this

sample of 7th graders. Specifically, analyzing the test scores of the 7th graders who are in

the same classrooms, Panel A of Table A6 (which is the counterpart to Table 6) shows that

Dragon children receive higher test scores in comparison to Snake children.

        It could be argued that the Dragon students outperform the students who are born

in the year of the Snake (although both types are in the same classroom) because Dragon

students in the 7th grade are a few months older than their classmates who are Snakes. If

this were the case, however, one would observe the same age impact on test scores among

other cohorts as well. Thus, we analyze the sample of 9th grade students which consists of

only the Tiger and Rabbit cohorts. We regress the test scores on a dummy that indicates a

student being born in the Tiger year. Although all of these students in this sample are in

the 9th grade, those who were born in the year of the Tiger are a few months older than

those who are Rabbits (see Figure 1). As shown in the Appendix Table A7, however, the

Tiger dummy is not different from zero, indicating that test scores are not different between

classmates who are either Rabbit or Tiger. This suggests that the results reported in Table




                                             41
A6 are not attributable to Dragon students being a few months older than their classmates

in the 7th grade.

        Similarly, we examine if the parents of the Tiger students have higher expectations

than the parents of the Rabbit students. As shown in Table A8, we again find no difference

in parental expectations between the Tigers and Rabbits.

        Consistent with Table 7, Panel B of Table A6 shows that 7th grade Dragon children

are not different from 7th grade Snake children in terms of their self-esteem, and

expectations for their own future. Panel C of Table A6, which is the counterpart of Table

9, demonstrates that parents of Dragon children have higher expectations of their children

in comparison to the parents of Snake children who are classmates of Dragon kids. The

point estimates and statistical significance between Tables 9 and Table A6-Panel C are

almost identical despite the reduction in the sample size by half in the latter table.

        Panel D of Table A6 reveals that holding constant parent expectations eliminations

the “Dragon” effect from the test score regressions of the 7th graders (as was the case in the

big sample of 7th and 9th graders—see Table 10). Finally, panel E of Table A6 shows that

parents of Dragon kids in 7th grade classrooms invest more heavily in their kids in

comparison to parents of the Snake kids in the same classrooms. This finding is inconsistent

with the hypothesis that Dragon parents invest more in their kids because they want to

compensate for the large cohort size in which their kids operate. This is because, the same

argument applies to the Snake parents: the kids of the Snake parents too face intensified

competition because of the large cohort size, inflated by Dragon kids. But panel E of Table

A6 shows that Dragon parents invest more in their kids, and that the point estimates are

very similar to those obtained from the big sample (of 7th and 9th grades) displayed in Table


                                              42
11. Unless one is prepared to argue that parents of Snake children do not care about the

success of their offspring, this finding refutes the conjecture that Dragon parents invest in

their kids because they are worried about the competition with a large number of students

in the cohort.



VIII. Conclusion

       In Chinese culture those who are born in a Dragon year are believed to be destined

for good fortune and greatness. Because there is no biological reason for people who are

born in a certain time period be more successful economically in comparison to those who

are born in adjacent time periods, it is surprising that this superstition has persisted for

many centuries.

       If the cohort size of Dragon children is larger, this would intensify competition

among children of that cohort in terms of educational resources. For example, class sizes

in schools would be larger for kids born in Dragon years, which may reduce the quality of

education they receive. Similarly, competition for a slot in a high-quality college could be

more intense. If this is the case, and if children born in a Dragon year have worse

educational outcomes in comparison to their peers who are similar in age and in other

attributes, this would beg the question of how this particular belief about Dragon children

being destined for good fortune greatness could persist.

     Using three recently collected micro data sets from China we show that those born in

a Dragon year have better, rather than worse, educational outcomes in comparison to

similar individuals who are of the same age, or who are very similar in age, but who have

different zodiac year designations. Those born in a Dragon year are more likely to have a

                                             43
college education, and they obtain higher scores at the university entrance exam. Similarly,

Chinese middle school students have higher test scores if they are born in Dragon year. We

show that these results are not because of family background, self-esteem or student’s

expectations about their own future. We find, however, that the “Dragon” effect on test

scores is eliminated when we account for parents’ expectations about their children’s

educational and professional success.

      In all three data sets analyzed we find that parents of Dragon children are not different

from other parents in terms of education of occupation, We find, however, that parents of

Dragon children have higher expectations for their children’s education success and their

professional future in comparison to other parents, and that Dragon parents invest more

heavily in their children in terms of time and money (the amount of pocket money parents

give to the child, how many times parents talk to the child’s teachers during the semester,

whether the child is protected from doing chores at home, and so on). We also find that

although female middle school students are about six centimeters shorter than male

students of the same age, this height disadvantage is cut by about half by having a Dragon

zodiac for females, and that this effect is larger in rural areas. This may suggest that parents

may be allocating more food and nutrition to female Dragon children, especially in rural

(and poorer) areas as a form of investment.

     An alternative hypothesis that may be consistent with these results is that some parents

care much more about their children’s success, that these parents have high expectations

of their children and that they invest heavily in their children. These parents are not

superstitious but they nevertheless time their pregnancy so that their children are born in

the year of the Dragon. In this scenario children are born in a Dragon year not because of


                                              44
parents’ superstition but because their parents are investor and planners, (including

planning the timing of the birth in a Dragon year). But, if parents time their pregnancy so

that their children are born in the year of the Dragon, this is superstitious behavior by

definition. Furthermore, if this is the dominant behavior of parents, their expectations of

children’s achievements and the outcomes of their children should be similar in a narrow

window on both sides of Dragon zodiac cut-off. That is, parents who make slight timing

errors in pregnancy should be similar to parents who time their pregnancy accurately. The

same should be true for the children of both types of parents. Analyzing narrow windows

around Dragon year cutoff dates we show that this is not the case. There are significant

differences in parent expectations and student outcomes between those who are born in the

last month of the Dragon year and those who are born just one month later. Similarly,

using a sharp Regression Discontinuity Design around Dragon year cutoff dates we show

that the probability of having at least a college degree is higher for the Dragon children.

     It is possible that Dragon parents who believe in the superstition not only invest in

their kids in the ways we measure in this paper (e.g. talking to the classroom teachers more

frequently in the middle school, protecting their kids from doing house chores, etc.), but

they also invest in other ways, such as by buying books and computers for their children,

hiring tutors for them, and so on. 31 These potential additional investment avenues that may

have also been utilized by parents do not alter the message of this paper: Even though



31
   Dragon parent could have invested in their kids even before they were born, by consuming more
health inputs during pregnancy (nutritious foods, prenatal care, etc.). While we cannot test whether
birth weight is different between Dragon children and others, research indicates that the impact of
birth weight on test scores and on educational attainment is modest (Figlio et al. 2014,Royer 2009,
Rosenzweig and Zhang (2013). Furthermore, our middle school data set, which contains
information on cognitive test scores, shows that there is no difference between Dragon kids and
other kids in cognition, measured by this test.
                                                45
children born in a Dragon year are no different from other children in the dimensions we

observe in our data, ranging from family background to self-esteem, and expectations and

aspirations about their future, Dragon students are more successful in school. This is

because the parents of Dragon children have higher expectations of their children and they

invest in their children more intensely. In the end, these higher expectations yield better

educational outcomes. Put differently, these expectations and the ensuing investment create

this self-fulfilling prophecy.

The dependent variables are dummies indicating whether parents expect their children to get at least a high school diploma, at least a bachelor degree, whether
parents have strong career ambition for their child, and whether parents have faith in their children for the future. The age of the students ranges from 11
to 18. The sample only includes biological parents of the students. Student’s type of hukou (certificate of residency) are controlled for. Adjusted p-values of
the Dragon dummies for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Simes adjustment are 0.01, 0.03, 0.01, 0.39, and 0.03 for column 1 through 5, respectively.
Standard errors are clustered at classroom level and reported in the parentheses. *significant at 10%, ** significant at 5%, *** significant at 1%.

In columns 1 and 2 the outcome is the number of marriages approved by the government
annually per 10,000 population. Data in columns 1 and 2 span the years 1979 to 2013. The data
used in regressions reported in columns 3 and 4 span the years 2003 to 2013. The mean value
of log live births is 12.67. All regressions include provincial GDP. In column 3 and 4, the
number of newly approved marriages are also included as a covariate. P-values are reported in
the parentheses. Standard errors are obtained using the Wild-cluster bootstrap procedure.

educational level and employment status, wave fixed effects and province fixed effects.
Panel A reports the parametric RD estimates. The sample includes all individuals born
between 1987 and 1989, with a Dragon cohort of 1988. Panel B reports the RD estimates
obtained from estimating local linear regressions with a triangular kernel. In Panel B, the
optimal bandwidths were selected for each side of the cutoff separately using the MSE-
bandwidth introduced by Calonico et al. (2017, 2018) using a triangular kernel. The
optimal bandwidths are 569 and 162 for the left and right sides of the cutoff, respectively,
(represented by the acronym CCFT). Standard errors are clustered at the running variable
