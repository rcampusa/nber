Brand Loyalty, Generic Entry and Price Competition in Pharmaceuticals in the Quarter Century
After the 1984 Waxman-Hatch Legislation

                                              ABSTRACT

The landmark Waxman-Hatch Act of 1984 represented a “grand compromise” legislation that sought
to balance incentives for innovation by establishing finite periods of market exclusivity yet simultaneously
providing access to lower cost generics expeditiously following patent expiration. Here we examine
trends in the first quarter century since passage of the legislation, building on earlier work by Grabowski
and Vernon [1992,1996] and Cook [1998]. The generic share of retail prescriptions in the U.S. has
grown from 18.6% in 1984 to 74.5% in 2009, with a notable acceleration in recent years. This increase
reflects increases in both the share of the total market potentially accessible by generics, and the generic
efficiency rate – the latter frequently approaching 100%. Whereas in 1994, the generic price index
fell from 100 to 80 in the 12 months following initial generic entry and by 24 months to 65, in 2009
the comparable generic price indexes are 68 and 27, respectively. Recent studies sponsored by the
American Association of Retired Persons focus only on brand prices and ignore substitution to lower
priced options following loss of patent protection. For the prescription drugs most commonly used
by beneficiaries in Medicare Part D, the average price per prescription declined by 21.3% from 2006
to 2009, rather than increasing by 25-28% as reported by the AARP. Finally, we quantify changes
over time in the average daily cost of pharmaceutical treatment in nine major therapy areas, encompassing
the entire set of molecules within each therapy class, not simply the molecule whose patent has expired.
Across all nine therapeutic areas, at 24 months post-generic entry, the weighted mean reduction in
pharmaceutical treatment cost per patient is 35.1%.

        I.      INTRODUCTION

         Over the four‐plus decades since receiving his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in
1967, Henry Grabowski, along with numerous distinguished collaborators, has made wide‐ranging
contributions in industrial organization, the economics of R&D and innovation, and regulatory
economics, each having significant influence within the academy, among public policy makers, and on
decision making within industry. Although he is best known for his research on the pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and vaccine industries, Henry Grabowski has also published in various other areas, such
as cost‐effectiveness analyses, automobile insurance and safety regulation, the economics of education,
and on price and non‐price competition in the cigarette industry. It is an honor and a privilege for us to
offer this paper on the occasion of Henry’s 70th birthday, and at this conference commemorating his
numerous achievements.

          The wide range of Henry Grabowski’s research contributions over the years allows authors such
as us the luxury of choosing a focus for our paper, and for that we are grateful. But how is one to
choose? One way of classifying Henry’s wide range of research contributions and achievements is to
break them down into pre‐ and post‐launch, the former including the economics of R&D and innovation
(e.g., costs of bringing new products to market, incentives to do R&D), and the latter economic issues
during the product life cycle of biopharmaceuticals after launch (e.g., effective patent lives, revenues
and costs over the product life cycle, skewed revenues and returns, the effects of the 1984 Drug Price
Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act ‐‐hereafter, the Waxman‐Hatch Act ‐‐ on the extent and
speed of generic entry, and its impacts on price competition among and between brands and generics).
In this paper we will focus on post‐launch economics, and in particular on the impacts of the Waxman‐
Hatch Act, taking advantage of the quarter century of data that has accumulated since 1984 passage of
that landmark legislation. Notable previous retrospective analyses of the impacts of the Waxman‐Hatch
Act include two by Henry Grabowski joint with John Vernon, Sr., a 1992 Journal of Law and Economics
article, “Brand Loyalty, Entry, and Price Competition in Pharmaceuticals After the 1984 Drug Act”, and a
1996 PharmacoEconomics article, “Longer Patents for Increased Generic Competition in the US: The
Waxman‐Hatch Act after One Decade”.

         The 1992 and 1996 Grabowski‐Vernon analyses of the impacts of the Waxman‐Hatch Act
identified a number of very important issues and empirical findings, and have had a lasting and
influential impact on subsequent research. For example, these classics characterized the typical pattern
of generic entry and prices over the early years post‐entry, the pricing responses by pioneers (and
influenced a subsequent literature on brand loyalty and market segmentation), the resulting brand‐
generic market shares, highlighted distinctive paths taken by oral and injectable products, examined the
role of manufacturer industry structure on the retail margins of generics and brands, and on the extent
to which manufacturer price reductions flowed through to retail prices to cash‐paying and third party
payers.

       An important empirical finding reported by Grabowski and Vernon [1992, 1996] was that,
although other factors such as growth of managed care also had impacts on generic utilization, the
Waxman‐Hatch Act increased generic entry dramatically, intensifying price competition among generics
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                    Page 2


and resulting in brand pioneers losing market share much more rapidly and deeply than before 1984. In
their 1996 summary, for example, they conclude: “The level of generic competition is very different one
decade after, compared with before, the Act. In the early 1980s, the level of generic dispensing in the
US was around 10%. By contrast, in the mid‐1990s, the level of generic prescribing approached 40%.”1
Other provisions of Waxman‐Hatch, however, had the effect of slightly extending effective patent life.

         These findings on pioneer innovators’ increased and more rapid loss of market share post‐
generic entry, offset to some extent by increased effective patent life, raised the issue of the net impact
of the Waxman‐Hatch Act on pioneer innovators’ returns on R&D investments. In an influential study
undertaken at the Congressional Budget Office, Anna Cook [1998] examined the present discounted
value of the total stream of future profits expected from an average brand‐name drug, after deducting
costs of manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and other activities not related to R&D, before and after
passage of the Waxman‐Hatch Act. Cook acknowledged it would not be feasible to isolate the impact of
the legislation, for other factors, such as repeal of state anti‐substitution laws being replaced by state
mandatory generic substitution provisions, and efforts by managed care to incent generic for brand
substitution through use of tiered formularies with varying copayments, also likely had a non‐trivial
impact on generic entry and pricing pre‐ and post‐1984. Cook concluded that although total discounted
returns post‐1984 were on average $27 million less in 1990 dollars than pre‐1984, the combined effect
of the various factors was modest: “For all drugs, on average, the increase in generic sales since 1984
has probably not reduced expected returns below the average capitalized costs of R&D. On the margin,
however, it is possible that a few drugs that were barely profitable to develop before may no longer be
so now.”2

          These classic and influential retrospective analyses of the impact of the Waxman‐Hatch
legislation were all based on data from the first decade following 1984 passage of the legislation. What
trends have emerged since then? Has the nature of brand‐generic and generic‐generic competition
changed, and if so, in what ways? With the benefit of a quarter century of data, what light can be shed
on whether the “grand compromise” of Waxman‐Hatch has struck the right balance between incentives
to innovate and ensure access by consumers? While a number of other studies have been published in
the intervening years, our differentiated focus here is to compare selected recent trends with those
initially reported in the Grabowski‐Vernon [1992, 1996] and Cook [1998] studies, and to identify other
salient market developments.

         Among the latter, three long‐term developments that provide historical context for analyzing
generic penetration are worth highlighting briefly. The first significant development is the growth of
prescription drug insurance coverage. As seen in Figure 1, in 1995, a decade after implementation of
Waxman‐Hatch, about 38% of prescriptions were paid for by cash (without insurance), and 62% were
covered by insurance (third party private 49%, and Medicaid 13%). Ten years later, in 2005 just before
implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the cash share of prescriptions had
fallen to 12.1%, while 87.9% of dispensed prescriptions were covered by insurance, 71.9% by private
third party payers, and 16.0% by Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2010, four years after implementation
of the Medicare Part D benefit, the cash share had fallen to single digits – 8.3%, surpassed by Medicaid
at 9.4%, Medicare Part D at 20.6%, and private third party payers, 61.7%. Whereas by one government
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                                                                   Page 3


estimate the cash share of prescription drug spending share was 66% in 1980 and 55% in 19853, by 2010
the share of prescriptions paid for out‐of‐pocket had fallen to just 8%, and private plus public insurance
covered 92% of dispensed prescriptions. To the extent competition among private prescription drug
insurance plans involves providing consumers access to low cost drugs, we would expect greater drug
insurance coverage to have placed increased demand on generic drug utilization and strong downward
pressures on drug prices, particularly generic drugs.

        A second major development concerns recent changes in the number and relative importance of
“blockbuster” drugs. As discussed in Aitken, Berndt and Cutler [2008], when defined as branded drugs
having in excess of $1 billion ( in year 2000 deflated dollars) in U.S. annual sales, the number of
blockbuster drugs increased steadily from six to 52 between 1997 and 2006, and then fell in 2007 to 48;
our updated calculations reveal relative stability in this number for 2008‐2009. Over the same time
period, the share of total U.S. pharmaceutical sales accounted for by blockbusters increased from 12 to
42% between 1997‐2006, fell to 38% in 2007, and has remained relatively stable since then. Hence,
whether measured by numbers or dollar share of sales, as early cohorts of blockbusters have gone off‐
patent and experienced sharp drops in sales due to competition from generics, in recent years they have
not been fully replaced by new cohorts of recently launched new drugs achieving blockbuster status.

        The third major development involves the growth in importance of biologic human therapeutic
products. While biologic products remain concentrated in a relatively small number of therapeutic
areas, as noted by Trusheim, Aitken and Berndt [2010] they can now be found at least in small numbers
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                      Page 4


in nearly every therapeutic class. In the discussion below of developments in the last quarter century
involving brand‐generic completion we focus on small molecules, for as of this point in time, none of the
biologics in the U.S. has faced competition similar to that typically experienced by branded small
molecule manufacturers following loss of patent expiration and extensive generic competition. While
we expect passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which establishes an
abbreviated regulatory process for approval of “biosimilars”, will lead to significant future changes, we
do not address those issues here.

         Our outline is as follows. In Section II we provide a discussion of changes in rates of generic
penetration since passage of the Waxman‐Hatch legislation. We decompose generic penetration into
share accessible to generics and generic efficiency rate components, both overall and for selected
therapeutic areas. In Section III we consider the impact of generic penetration on consumer prices. We
document that the approach commonly cited in the popular media, as represented by a highly
publicized series of reports by the American Association of Retired Persons, incorrectly focuses only on
price growth of leading brands, ignoring larger changes in marketplace dynamics. We offer alternative
estimates incorporating generic substitution and changing market shares. In Section IV we expand the
analysis and report on changes over time in the daily cost of treatment in nine aggregate therapeutic
classes following recent patent expiration and generic entry. In Section V we offer discussion and
conclusions.

        II .    LONG‐TERM AND RECENT TRENDS: GENERIC PENETRATION AND PRICES

          Generic penetration can be measured in a number of different ways – share of extended units
dispensed as generic (tablets, capsules, vials – earlier called countable units), and share of prescriptions
dispensed as generic. The total generic share of prescriptions dispensed is by convention the sum of
traditional unbranded generic and branded generic shares. Branded generics are defined by IMS Health
as non‐originator products that are either: (i) novel dosage forms of off‐patent products; (ii) on patent
with a trade name, but a molecule copy of an originator product; (iii) off‐patent with a trade name; or
(iv) off‐patent without a trade name and from a single source or co‐licensed.4 IMS Health data
separating out branded generic from unbranded generic prescriptions is only available beginning in
1998. We note in passing that in the future as “biosimilars” come to market, they will introduce an
important new category of product that will make it more challenging to maintain clear brand‐generic
distinctions and interpret historical trends.

          Figure 2 presents the trend in the generic and share of total prescriptions from 1984 to 2009, at
five‐year intervals. At the time of passage of the 1984 Waxman‐Hatch Act, the generic share of
prescriptions was 18.6%. A decade later in 1994, the generic share had almost doubled to 36%. After
initially increasing sharply and then falling slightly (reflecting successful new branded product
introductions in the mid‐1990s), by 1999, fifteen years after passage of Waxman‐Hatch, the generic
prescription share was 49.7%, at almost 14 percentage points considerably greater than five years
earlier. Between 1999 and 2004 the generic share increased modestly, by almost seven percentage
points from 49.7% to 56.4%, but in the subsequent five years the generic share grew dramatically, by
more than 18 percentage points, from 56.4% in 2004 to 74.5% in 2009. Hence, in very recent years
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                     Page 5


growth in generic share has accelerated substantially. Notably, this sharp acceleration in growth of
generic share occurred not only as several important “blockbuster” branded drugs lost patent
protection, but also during the time period in which the 2006 Medicare Part D benefit was
implemented. We discuss Medicare Part D utilization of generic drugs in further detail in Section III
below.

         In summary, not only is the long‐term trend in generic prescription shares an increasing one, it
has also been accelerating recently, and is now increasing much more rapidly than what Grabowski and
Vernon [1992, 1996] observed in the early years following passage of Waxman‐Hatch. This acceleration
raises a number of questions, such as: What are the factors underlying this rapid growth in generic
prescription share? How much longer can the generic share continue to grow so rapidly? What are the
factors potentially limiting growth in the generic prescription share?

         A useful way to envisage changes underlying growth in the generic share is to view the latter as
the product of two shares: (i) the market share accessible to generic substitution – generic volume plus
brand volume for only those molecules for which generics are available in the time period of interest,
divided by total prescriptions in the market (including brands for which no generic was available and
generics for which no brand was available), multiplied by (ii) the generic efficiency rate – for only those
molecules for which generics are available in the time period of interest, the share of generic volume in
total brand plus generic volume. Results of this decomposition of generic (branded plus unbranded)
market share growth since 2003 are presented in columns (1) – (3) of Table 2.
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                    Page 6


         Both of the underlying components of the total generic market share have been increasing over
the 2003‐9 time period.. First, as the large number of brands approved in the “golden age” of the mid‐
1990s came off patent in the 2000s, and as fewer new molecular entities (“NMEs”) mostly having
smaller sales volume were launched, the market share of molecules susceptible to generics increased 16
percentage points from 65% in 2003 to 81% in 2009, approximately 2.5 percentage points a year, or on a
proportional basis, by a cumulative 25%. Note that had manufacturers received FDA approval for a
substantial number of new molecules that then achieved “blockbuster” status in the last decade, this
market share susceptible to generic substitution could have declined even as older drugs went off
patent. However, because of the relatively small number of NMEs approved by the FDA and the modest
sales volumes they typically garnered, in fact this share susceptible to generic substitution has increased
steadily. Second, due likely to a combination of greater proportion insured, formulary management,
state mandatory generic substitution laws, and competition among private prescription drug plans
offering low priced policies to Medicare Part D beneficiaries, the generic efficiency rate has also
increased, from 77% in 2003 to 92% in 2009, 2.5 percentage points a year to a cumulative 15 percentage
points, or on a proportional basis, by a cumulative 19%.

        Since the generic efficiency rate is approaching its 100% ceiling, future growth in the total
generic market share will depend critically on movements in the share generic accessible. With major
brands among the statins, antidepressants, antipsychotics and proton pump inhibitors expected to lose
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                             Page 7


patent protection in the coming near future, it is reasonable to expect continued growth in the share
generic accessible, and therefore in the total generic market share, albeit perhaps at slightly lower rates
than in the recent past.

        Variation in the roles played by the two components underlying total generic prescription share
growth is particularly evident when looking across several distinct therapeutic classes. As seen in the
top panel of Table 3, the calcium channel blockers class has attained very high rates of generic efficiency
(almost 100%), so that when one leading brand (Norvasc™) began to face generic entrants in 2007, the

generic market share increased from 47% in 2006 to 96% in 2009. With no remaining protected calcium
channel blockers currently in the market, this therapy area is now essentially entirely generic.

         Another therapeutic area where the generic efficiency rate is almost 100% but generic market
share has considerable future potential growth is the lipid regulators class. As seen in the middle panel
of Table 3, when one leading brand (Zocor™) lost patent protection in 2006, the generic market share
for the class increased from 8% in 2005 to 43% in 2006. Although the share of market accessible to
generics was only 60% in 2006, when the current leading branded statin (Lipitor™) loses exclusivity as
expected in 2001, one can expect a very substantial increase in both the share of market accessible by
generics and the total generic market share for the lipid regulators. A rather different underlying
dynamic is illustrated by anti‐epileptic drugs, as shown in the bottom panel of Table 3. Generic
efficiency rates in this therapeutic class have not been as high as with the lipid regulators and calcium
channel blockers, but the share of market accessible by generics has increased dramatically, from 36% in
2004 to 81% in 2009, resulting in total generic market share growth from 26% in 2004 to 68% in 2009.
The lower efficiency rate in this class may reflect clinical concerns among some prescribers, since
retrospective claims analyses and case reports have associated generic substitution with well‐controlled
patients with epilepsy relapsing and experiencing breakthrough seizures.5 Because the generic
efficiency rate is only 84% for anti‐epileptic drugs in 2009, there is further potential growth in the
generic market share, but 100% efficiency may not be reached within this therapeutic class at this time.
Additionally, IMS Health does not expect any additional major brands to lose patent protection in the
next few years

A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                    Page 9


         Before moving on to a discussion of generic price trends following passage of the Waxman‐
Hatch legislation, we digress briefly to assess the impact of rising generic use on changes in prescription
drug spending. Annual 2000‐9 levels and growth rates in the total number of retail (including mail
order) prescriptions, and (constant year 2000) dollar ex‐manufacturer revenues are given in Table 4. It is
striking to note that duriing this decade, the number of prescriptions initially grew rapidly between 2000
and 2002, and then increased more slowly, averaging 2.5% annually, with a cumulative 2002‐9 increase
of about 19%. The slow growth in number of prescriptions was temporarily interrupted by the
implementation of Medicare Part D in 2006, resulting in a growth rate of 4.5% that year. In contrast,
since 2005 and particularly in 2007‐9, inflation‐adjusted revenues grew at very low rates relative to
historical double‐digit growth rates observed earlier in the 2000 decade, as has been noted by Aitken,
Berndt and Cutler [2008]. This lower revenue growth rate towards the end of the decade reflects in part
the substantial growth in the generic share of all prescriptions, which from Table 2 we see increased
nine percentage points from 54% in 2003 to 63% in 2006, but then accelerated, increasing eleven
percentage points to 74% in 2009. As noted elsewhere in a study undertaken by IMS Health, “For the
decade 2000 through 2009, the use of generic prescription drugs in place of their brand‐name
counterparts saved the nation’s health care system more than $824 billion dollars. In 2009 alone the
use of FDA‐approved generics saved $139.6 billion – a 15% growth over the prior year’s savings – or
about $382 million every day.”6

          In their 1996 study, Grabowski and Vernon reported significant generic price declines following
initial generic launch, based on 1984‐1991 data on the initial generic launches of 25 major molecules.
They reported that after one year following initial generic entry, the average generic price index fell
from 100 to 80, and after two years, to 65. To explore whether this trend has continued or accelerated
in more recent years, in Figure 2 below we plot the monthly average generic price (indexed to 100 for
the launch price of the first generic launched) and the number of generic entrants, with up to 40 months
following initial generic launch on the horizontal axis, for the top 25 generic molecules launched
between 2005 and 2009. Since not all generic molecules have been on the market for the full 40
quarters, for each month since launch the average is computed over the number of molecules having
been on the market at least that length of time. The generic price index falls to a level of about 78 at
month six, with an average number of generic entrants at seven. At months 12 and 24, the average
generic price index falls to about 50 and 23, respectively, and then stabilizes at about 6 after month 25,
even as the average number of generic manufacturers gradually increases to about 10, 11 and 12,
respectively. Clearly, in the last five years rapid and extensive generic entry following initial loss of
patent protection has led to correspondingly deep and rapid generic price declines.

         Comparing the Grabowski‐Vernon annual values to our monthly 2005‐2009 initial generic launch
prices in Figure 6 is not straightforward, given their differing periodicity. One reasonably simple way to
approximate a one year generic price index using the 2005‐2009 initial launch monthly data is to take
the arithmetic mean of months 1‐12, and for the two year generic price index, the arithmetic mean of
months 13‐24. This yields 2005‐2009 one and two year price indexes of 68 and 28, respectively, which
are much lower than the comparable annual 80 and 65 price index values based on 1984‐1991 initial
generic launches. Specifically, after one year the 2005‐2009 launches have a price index 12 percentage
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                                         Page 10


points (or on a proportional basis, 15%) lower than the 1984‐1991 launches, and after two years, the
2005‐2009 launches have a 37 percentage point (or, on a proportional basis, 57%) lower price index
than the 1984‐1991 launches. Thus the evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that generic price
declines are much deeper and more rapid now than 25 years ago following initial implementation of the
Waxman‐Hatch legislation.7

         One other major development involving brand‐generic substitution more generally is the
emergence of intermolecular (not just intramolecular) substitution following a brand’s loss of patent
protection. A very notable, consistent finding and conventional wisdom until recently was that unit
sales of the molecule (over its brand and generic formulations) typically fall following patent expiration.

        For the first time in recent history, however, this conventional wisdom has been overturned by
the cholesterol‐lowering statin drugs. As reported in Aitken, Berndt and Cutler [2008], following limited
generic authorized generic entry in the first six months following Zocor’s™ loss of patent expiration8,
unfettered generic entry occurred in late December 2006. Since brand‐name Lipitor™ was still patent‐
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                      Page 11


protected in early 2007, whereas less costly generic versions of Pravachol™ (pravastatin) and Zocor™
(simvastatin) were now on the market, payers, insurers and PBMs were highly incented to switch
patients on Lipitor™ to pravastatin or simvastatin. This typically took the form of moving Lipitor™ to the
highest copayment tier, and placing the two generics on the lowest tier. For Pravachol™ and generic
pravastatin, the total brand plus generic number of prescriptions since loss of patent protection
increased only slightly. After Zocor™ lost patent protection, however, total monthly Zocor™ plus generic
simvastatin prescriptions increased dramatically, from 2.8 million in June 2006 to 4.8 million in
December 2007. A substantial portion of the new simvastatin sales came directly from previous Lipitor™
users or from patients who would have begun statin treatment with Lipitor™. In 2007, the number of
prescriptions of Lipitor™ fell 12%, including 26% in new starts, and domestic sales of Lipitor™ measured
in dollars fell 6.5% below 2006 levels. As best we can tell, the Lipitor™‐simvastatin experience is the first
major product instance in which generic versions of one molecule have substituted so significantly for
brand‐name versions of a different molecule; it certainly was not observed in the various Grabowsk‐
Vernon or Cook studies. Note that were such intermolecular substitution to become more common in
the future, the impact would be to reduce not only the branded manufacturer’s revenues whose
innovator drug lost patent protection, but would also affect other branded manufacturers whose
branded drug is therapeutically substitutable with the molecule now off‐patent.

       We return to a discussion of recent trends in prescription prices more broadly within a
therapeutic class following generic entry in Section IV below.

        III.    DRUG PRICES ‐ ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGING SHARES AND GENERICS

        A much publicized and highly cited analyses of changes in drug prices has been a series of
reports published over the last decade, coauthored by Leigh Purvis and Stephen Schondelmeyer for the
American Association of Retired Persons (“AARP”).9 This series of reports, together with others focused
on changes in brand prices, have contributed to the widespread perception that drug costs are “out of
control”. The headlines from these studies typically focus on the brand price index growth, e.g., “Brand
Name Drug Prices Continue to Climb Despite Low General Inflation Rate”, which is then contrasted with
trends in generic prices, e.g., “In contrast, average manufacturer prices for widely used generic drugs fell
during the same time period.”10 Some reports in the series, including one of the most recent, are
devoted exclusively to brand price increases.11 These reports have generated significant media
attention and are frequently cited by policymakers. But do they address the relevant issue, and is the
methodology they employ appropriate?

         Using 2006 sales as fixed expenditure weights, the AARP authors construct an aggregate brand
price index, an aggregate generic price index, an aggregate specialty price index, and an aggregate
combined price index (over the leading 219 brands, 185 leading generics and 144 leading specialty drug
products, based on number of prescriptions dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries), annually for
2006 to 2009. In appendices, they also identify the top 25 brand, 25 generic and 25 specialty drug form‐
strengths (ranked by payment to manufacturer) The majority of the reports in the series use wholesale
acquisition cost (“WAC”) data, which AARP characterizes as the “manufacturer’s price”, to measure
price per prescription, but beginning in August 2010, the series began using retail prices based on claims
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                       Page 12


data.12 The AARP reports suffer from a number of conceptual and methodological flaws. Most
problematic is the use of fixed 2006 expenditure weights for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, which
results in the AARP price indexes failing to reflect the impact of generic entry for branded products
coming off patent after 2006, as well as any other changes in the mix of drugs (whether brand or
generic) used by Medicare patients over the 2006‐2009 time period.13 Moreover, even in the combined
brand‐generic price index reported in the May 2010 AARP report (Purvis and Schondelmeyer [2010]),
brand and generic versions of the same molecule are treated as separate distinct products rather than
as bioequivalent, thereby generating a well‐documented upward bias in their aggregate price index
calculations. 14
         Regarding this latter point, already in 1995, fifteen years ago, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
recognized the bias in its prescription drug Consumer Price Index (“CPI‐Rx”) induced by failing to link
prices of newly entering lower priced generic drugs bioequivalent to higher priced branded molecules
losing patent protection, and implemented procedures that explicitly linked these price decreases
realized by consumers as they switched from brand to generic drug. Analogous links between prices of
the same molecule branded and generic products in the BLS’s Producer Price Index (“PPI‐Rx”) were
implemented in January 1996.15 The AARP study authors have not implemented such changes, and thus
their reported price indexes suffer from an upwards bias. The magnitude of this upward bias depends
on the extent of new generic entry and generic utilization, and on the relative price paths of brands and
generics over time following patent expiration.
         To gain information on the extent of the upward bias in these two 2010 AARP aggregate brand
price index studies, we take the same 25 leading brand form‐strengths identified by AARP, utilize their
WAC list prices (while recognizing that use of actual transactions prices would be preferable), but for
those brands going off patent, we link generic prices to their predecessor brand products by treating
brand and generic versions of the same form‐strength as bioequivalent (consistent with procedures
adopted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI‐Rx and PPI‐Rx programs in 1995‐6), and allow for changing
annual weights as brand‐generic and other compositional changes have occurred since 2006. We derive
IMS Medicare Part D prescription data from the IMS PlanTrak data base; as of January 2010, the IMS
payer/plan universe contained 4,622 Medicare Part D benefit level plans.16 For those brand form‐
strengths experiencing generic entry during 2006‐9, brand and generic prescriptions are tracked
separately, and then aggregated, with brand, generic and combined weights changing annually.17
Rather than employing a fixed 2006 lens as is done in the AARP studies, this alternative methodology
more accurately captures and portrays the dynamics of a rapidly changing pharmaceutical marketplace
between 2006 and 2009, particularly with the dramatic changes brought about by the implementation
of the Medicare Part D benefit in January 2006.
         In this context, it is useful to note that by the end of 2009, nine of the 25 leading form‐strengths
identified by AARP had faced competition from generic entry (but Plavix™ only temporarily in 2006‐7).
Three of these had limited generic competition already in 2006 (Zocor™ in 20 mg and 40 mg form‐
strengths, and Plavix™ 75 mg – an at risk generic entry, subsequently ordered withdrawn), four form‐
strengths experienced initial generic entry in 2007 (Ambien™ 10 mg, Norvasc™ in 5 mg and 10 mg
strengths, and Protonix™ 40 mg), and one faced initial generic entry in 2008 (Fosamax™ 70 mg) and in
2009 (Prevacid™ 30 mg). Figure 3 documents the extent of generic entry between 2006 and 2009,
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                                   Page 13


measured alternatively by the share of the leading 25 brand form‐strengths experiencing generic entry,
and by the share of total leading 25 form‐strength prescriptions dispensed to Medicare Part D
beneficiaries as generics. Generic entry has been extensive with the share of form‐strengths facing
generic competition increasing four‐fold from 8% in 2006 to 32% in 2009. Moreover, in part because of
the growth in uptake by Medicare Part D beneficiaries over time and the aggressive generic penetration
achieved by the prescription drug plans administering Medicare Part D benefits, the share of total brand
plus generic prescriptions dispensed as generic for these leading 25 form‐strengths to Medicare Part D
beneficiaries increased more than six‐fold, from 7.2% in 2006 to 45.1% in 2009. By 2009, almost half of
the leading 25 form‐strength prescriptions were dispensed as generics to Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

         FIGURE 3: SHARE GENERIC NUMBER AND UTILIZATION OF FORM‐STRENGTH DRUGS

         Figure 4 portrays the dramatically different experiences of brands and generics among these
leading 25 form‐strengths. Medicare Part D has indeed increased access to these medicines – the total
number of prescriptions dispensed for these 25 form‐strengths increased from 72 million in 2006 to 101
million in 2009 (an average annual growth rate of 11.8%), but this overall growth is entirely due to
increased generic penetration. Specifically, while the number of top 25 form‐strength prescriptions
dispensed to Part D beneficiaries as brands fell from 65 million in 2006 to 55 million in 2009 (an annual
average change of ‐5.3%), the number dispensed as generics rose dramatically, from 7 million in 2006 to
46 million in 2009, an annual average growth of 84.7%.
         With almost half of all the Medicare Part D prescriptions in the sample of 25 leading selling
drugs dispensed in generic form (and with almost three‐quarters of all Part D prescriptions now
dispensed as generics), one would reasonably expect that average prices facing Medicare Part D
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                                   Page 14


beneficiaries through their private prescription drug plans fell substantially, making the Part D benefits
more valuable to plan participants. These price declines are entirely overlooked by analyses that focus
solely on brands, such as the AARP reports, which paint an ever less accurate picture of the Medicare
Part D marketplace dynamics. Note, however, that in the current context in which we, like the AARP
study authors, use the WAC list price rather than either manufacturers’, retailers’ or consumers’ actual
transactions prices, these price calculations are best interpreted as only approximating wholesalers’ and
retail chains’ purchase prices from manufacturers, with the generic price trends being particularly
problematic.

         Although utilization of price index procedures as carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics is clearly preferable and represents best practice aggregate price measurement procedures,
the simplest manner by which initially to depict the overall impact of market developments involving the
leading selling 25 form‐strengths identified by AARP is, for each year between 2006 and 2009, to divide
                 A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                              Page 15


                 total revenues received by brand and generic manufacturers involving these 25 form‐strengths
                 (assuming average price received by manufacturers was equal to WAC, as was assumed in the AARP
                 reports) by the total number of prescriptions dispensed, yielding an average overall price per
                 prescription. As we shall discuss, this initial measure has a number of problems, but it is simple and
                 easily understood, and we will augment it with price indexes computed by more preferable procedures.
                          Figure 5 indicates that between 2006 and 2009, the overall average price per prescription
                 declined by 21.3%, a compounded average yearly change of ‐7.7% ‐‐ with 2007, 2008 and 2009 price
                 declines of ‐2.9%, ‐12.9% and ‐7.0%, respectively. Over the same time period, because they both
                 completely ignore generic entry as brands lost patent protection, the AARP studies report very different,
                 incomplete and distorted price growth. For their price index based on manufacturer WAC prices
                 (“AARP‐W”) they report a cumulative 2006‐9 price increase of 27.6%, which corresponds to an average
                 annual price increase of 8.5% ‐‐ with 2007, 2008 and 2009 price increases being 7.4%, 8.7% and 9.3%,
                 respectively; for their aggregate price index based on retail claims data (“AARP‐R”), they report a slightly
                 smaller cumulative price increase of 25.0%, with 2007, 2008 and 2009 price increases being 7.0%, 7.9%
                 and 8.3%, respectively.18 The reason for the overall price per prescription decline in our more complete
                 analysis is that any increases in brand prices have been more than offset by the marketplace
                 dramatically shifting to lower priced generics – shifts that are entirely ignored in the two AARP studies.
                 The shift to generics underlying the overall price declines likely reflects increased access by seniors to
                 prescription drug benefits brought about by Medicare Part D, growth in market buying power of the Part
                 D private prescription drug plans, and competition among chain pharmacies and mass merchandisers,
                 such as WalMart offering 30 day prescriptions for numerous generic drugs for $4, and 90 day
                 prescriptions for $10.19

        In this context, it is illuminating to document just how extraordinary has been the shift by
Medicare Part D consumers to generics as brands lose patent protection, and how massive has the loss
of market share by brands become when bioequivalent generic versions of the same form‐strength
became available, relative to what Grabowski and Vernon reported based on the early post‐Waxman
Hatch experience. Consider, for example, the three first form‐strengths experiencing generic entry:
Ambien™ 10 mg (initial generic entry in 2007), and the 40 mg and 20 mg formulations of Zocor™ (initial
generic entry in 2006). In 2009, the brand shares in total brand plus generic prescriptions dispensed for
these three form‐strengths to Medicare Part D beneficiaries were 1.25%, 0.14% and 0.17%, respectively,
implying that the manufacturers of these products lost 98.75%, 99.86% and 99.83% of their prescription
market share between 2006 and 2009.20 The Medicare Part D marketplace response in substituting to
generic versions has been so strong in recent years that the resulting impact of brands’ price increases
on Part D participants’ budgets is miniscule. By focusing only on brands and their price increases, the
AARP price calculations and perspective entirely ignore these dominating market place developments.

         One well‐known problem with this simple overall average price per prescription set of
calculations reported in the previous paragraphs is that it confounds changes in the price of a fixed
basket of prescription form‐strengths with changes over time in the share mix of products within the
market basket. Hence, in the price index calculations we report below, consistent with professional best
practice procedures, to portray the dynamic marketplace more accurately, we update weights annually
(analogous to Bureau of Economic Analysis practices), and like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we treat
branded and bioequivalent generic products within the same form‐strength as identical and
bioequivalent (i.e., as perfect substitutes). By comparison, in both their 2010 studies the AARP authors
employ a fixed weight (Laspeyres) methodology using 2006 fixed weights, and limit their analysis solely
to brand name form‐strength products, even when the brand is subject to FDA‐designated bioequivalent
same molecule generic competition. As best we can determine, the AARP methodology is unique unto
itself. As we shall see, use of 2006 fixed weights when analyzing aggregate price trends through 2009 is
particularly problematic, for as we have seen earlier, generic for brand substitution trends have been
large and accelerating in recent years.

         The construction and publication of price indexes based on professional best practice typically is
based on one or more of three common alternative aggregate price indexes that differ depending on
how they weight the price relatives – the price of a given product in period 1 divided by its price in
period 0. If the price relatives are weighted by their time 0 (“base period”) expenditure shares, the
resulting price index is known as the aggregate Laspeyres price index; when the price relatives are
weighted by their time 1 (“current period”) expenditure shares, the resulting price index is known as the
aggregate Paasche price index. Since it is unclear a priori whether using base period or current
periodweights is preferable, many blend the two. The Fisher price index is simply the square root (also
called the geometric mean) of the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes; because it is a blend, it is
frequently called the “Fisher ideal” price index.

          When there are more than two time periods, one can maintain the time 0 expenditure weights
in all future time periods (called fixed base weight indexes), or one can continually and sequentially
update them, so that in say, time period 2 the “base period” weights are those of time 1 (not time 0),
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                   Page 17


and the “current period” weights are those of time 2 (not time 1); when sequentially updated in this
manner the indexes are called chained price indexes. Currently the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
uses the chained Fisher price index when computing quarterly real gross domestic product and implicit
price deflators, whereas when measuring monthly inflation the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”)
publishes a Laspeyres fixed weight price index, although the BLS updates the fixed weights every five to
seven years. In the various price index results reported below, we employ chained weight price index
procedures.

         As seen in Figure 6, based on the “blended” Fisher price index formula (the green line), prices
for the 25 form‐strengths have increased 2.3% between 2006 and 2009, implying an average annual
growth rate (“AAGR”) of 0.8%. This blended index formula, utilized by the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
reflects the net impact of differing trends when price relatives are weighted by base year (Laspeyres) or
current year (Paasche) expenditure weights. Specifically, whereas the Laspeyres aggregate price index
(purple line, at bottom) reveals a very slight decrease of 3.6% between 2006 and 2009 (an AAGR of ‐
1.2%), the Paasche (orange line) generates an aggregate three year price increase of 8.6% (an AAGR of

Note to Figure 6: The Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher price index calculations are based on the WAC
prices of the 25 leading form‐strength products identified in the AARP branded samples. AARP‐W and
AARP‐R are price indexes based on wholesale and retail prices, reported in Purvis‐Schondelmeyer [2010]
and Schondelmeyer‐Purvis [2010], respectively.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                     Page 18


         2.8%). The reason the Laspeyres and Paasche generate different price trends involves the fact
that in these data the expenditure shares of the various brand and generic form‐strengths move very
substantially between years, thereby weighting the price relatives differentially, i.e., the same price
changes are weighted differently depending on which time period’s shares are used as weights.
Specifically, for those form‐strengths having generic entry, expenditure shares are falling rapidly, and so
use of lagged weights (Laspeyres) gives greater weight to the price declines than does use of the smaller
current period (Paasche) weights. Other things equal, when shares are not changing as rapidly and as
massively as is the case here, the various index number formulae typically yield results that are more
similar to each other. The sensitivity of these aggregate price indexes to choice of base period, current
period or blended periods highlights the inaccurate and distorted price index trends one obtains when
one instead employs the fixed 2000 expenditure weights, as is done by the authors of the AARP studies.

         However, in the current context, regardless of which of these three aggregate price index
formulae is employed, the conclusion based on including both brands and generics in the sample
consistently differs decisively from that reached by the AARP authors, whose AARP‐W (blue) and AARP‐R
(purple) price indexes at the top of Figure 10 both increase much more rapidly than the various price
indexes including both brands and generics (bottom three lines). In their wholesale price AARP‐W
calculations, the cumulative 2006‐2009 price increase for widely used brand name prescription drugs
was 27.6%, implying an AAGR of 8.5%, whereas in their retail price AARP‐R calculations, the cumulative
2006‐2009 corresponding price increase was 25.0%, implying an AAGR of 7.7%.21 Clearly, relative to all
the other price index measures, the AARP estimates are outliers and are upward biased estimates of
price developments in the leading‐25 form‐strengths molecules.

        IV.     AVERAGE DAILY COST OF TREATMENT BY MAJOR THERAPEUTIC AREA

         The construction of aggregate price indexes encompassing brands, branded generics and
generics is one way in which the effects of brand‐generic and other compositional changes can be
documented. A more general approach involves quantifying changes over time in average
pharmaceutical treatment cost per day for entire major therapeutic areas in which there have been
both new product introductions and generic entry following patent expiration. Even more generally,
rather than focusing just on pharmaceutical costs, one could compute total medical (and even non‐
medical) costs of treating an episode of an illness, as has been advocated elsewhere.22 Here we
summarize changes over time in pharmaceutical costs of treatment across nine major therapeutic areas
that in 2005 accounted for about 25% of U.S. dollar sales and 18% of U.S. total prescription extended
units and, and that have subsequently experienced initial generic entry at least once since 2006.

         For each of nine major therapeutic areas, we compute average daily cost of therapy as follows:
At each form‐strength level, we multiply cost per extended unit (e.g., tablet, capsule, vial, etc.) times
extended unit consumption per day times extended unit share of class, and then sum this up over all
form‐strengths of all products in the particular USC therapeutic class. Cost per extended unit is based
on ex‐manufacturer transactions into the wholesale and retail trade channels, projected to national
totals. This calculation is done on a monthly basis just prior to generic entry, and with a focus on 12
months and 24 months post‐generic entry. The nine therapeutic classes are (with their USC

classification code; their brand or brands going off patent; and date of initial generic entry): ace
inhibitors (31110; Altace™; ramipril entry December 2007); antinauseants (17310; Zofran™;
ondansetron entry December 2006); bisphosphonates (59210; Fosamax™; alendronate sodium entry
January 2008); proton pump inhibitors (23420; Protonix™; pantroprazole entry December 2007); lipid
regulators (32110 plus Vytorin™ and Zetia™; Zocor™ simvastatin entry June 2006); alpha‐beta blockers
(31410 plus 31420; Coreg™; carvedilol entry September 2007); antidepressants (64340; Zoloft™;
sertraline entry June 2006)23; non‐barbiturates and others (67290; Ambien™; zolpidem tartrate entry
April 2007), and calcium channel blockers (31300; Norvasc™; amlodipine besylate entry March 2007).

         At 12 months post‐generic entry, the percent reduction in average daily cost of treatment
among the major therapy areas ranges from 5.1% for the proton pump inhibitors to 75.5% for the alpha‐
beta blockers; the unweighted mean is 37.1%, and the weighted (by number extended units) mean is
27.5%. At 24 months post‐generic entry, the percent reduction across major therapy areas in average
daily treatment cost ranges from 7.8% for proton pump inhibitors to 84.1% for the bisphosphonates24;
the unweighted mean reduction is 50.1%, while the weighted mean reduction is 35.1%. Note that this
percent reduction is for the entire set of molecules in the therapeutic class following initial recent
patent expirations, not for just that molecule going off‐patent. As is seen in Table 5, these reductions in
average daily costs following loss of patent protection are substantial, and in a number of cases, very
large. We can expect that comparable savings in these and other classes will be realized in the next few
years as well, as patents on major brands expire and generic entry occurs. Specifically, IMS Health
reports that Flomax™ lost patent protection in April 2010 and it expects Aricept™ to face generic
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                     Page 20


entrants by November 2010. Market exclusivity is also expected to be lost in 2011 by Advair Diskus™
(September) as well as Lipitor™ and Plavix™ (November).25

        V.      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

         What have been the net effects of the “grand compromise” – maintaining a balance between
ensuring finite patent protection to innovators and simultaneously providing access to lower cost
generics following patent expiration ‐‐ in the last decade for consumers and manufacturers? Many of
the initial trends identified by Grabowski and Vernon [1992, 1996] as having taken place in the first
decade following implementation of the 1984 Waxman‐Hatch Act have not only continued, but have
intensified and occurred more rapidly in the last fifteen years. In particular, in recent years generic
entry has been extensive, and consumer costs have declined dramatically.

        Our analysis documents that for prescription drugs most commonly used by beneficiaries in
Medicare Part D, the overall average price per prescription declined by 21.3% from 2006 to 2009, rather
than increasing as reported by the AARP. By entirely ignoring generic entry and changing market shares,
the AARP methodology generates a distorted and inaccurate portrait of the dynamics experienced by
Medicare Part D beneficiaries and manufacturers of prescription drugs. Specifically, our analysis
documents that any price increases by off‐patent brands have been more than offset by massive shifts
to generics.

        A more comprehensive approach to measuring the effect of brand‐generic and other
compositional changes is to quantify changes over time in the average cost of biopharmaceutical
treatment within various therapeutic areas. Our analysis finds that in each of nine major therapy areas
average pharmaceutical treatment costs have declined, in some cases very dramatically (in one
therapeutic class, 84.1%) following generic entry. These cost declines encompass the entire set of
molecules within each therapeutic class, not simply the molecule whose patent has expired. Across all
nine therapeutic areas, at 24 months post‐generic entry, the weighted mean reduction in
pharmaceutical treatment cost is 35.1%.

         These declines in cost have had particularly significant impacts for Medicare Part D beneficiaries,
and for the public sector funding of the Medicare Part D benefit. Indeed, the massive uptake of generic
drugs by Medicare Part D beneficiaries has been one of the major contributors to actual Medicare Part D
expenditures by the federal government in 2009 being only $60.8 billion, or 45% less than the $111.2
billion projected five years ago, shortly after the legislation was enacted.26

         What do recent trends imply concerning the likelihood of achieving the right balance between
innovators and consumers in the coming decade? In this year, 2011 and 2012, six of the ten leading
selling products will encounter loss of market exclusivity, and a substantial number of branded
franchises will be essentially eliminated. Updating the Cook [1998] Congressional Budget Office study to
take into account numerous developments involving changes in brand loyalty, generic entry, price
competition and regulatory oversight over the last fifteen years, along with their impacts on rates of
return on biopharmaceutical R&D, would constitute a useful contribution to informing current and likely
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                                    Page 21


future policy controversies. Looking beyond small molecules, it will be important to asses the longer
term effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 on entry and pricing of
biosimilars, and on striking an appropriate balance between access to therapies and incentives for
innovation (including supplemental indications)? More generally, there are many facets of the post‐
launch product life cycle, identified and quantified by Henry Grabowski’s and his collaborators’ research,
on which we have not been able to devote attention here. Among those meriting updated and more
detailed investigation are the effects of paragraph IV challenges and authorized generic entry27, the
impacts of more rapid and extensive loss of market share post‐patent expiration, the appearance of
significant cross‐molecule substitution as brands lose patent protection, implementation of greater
post‐marketing requirements and risk evaluation and mitigation strategy commitments, increases in
FDA submission user fees, and the relative lack of successful recent “blockbuster” drug launches, on the
present values of R&D achieved by pioneer biopharmaceutical manufacturers over the last fifteen years,
as well as changes in effective patent life. Comparisons across small molecule pharmaceuticals,
biologics and vaccines are also of considerable importance to public and private sector decision‐
makers,28 as are comparisons of biopharmaceuticals with medical devices.

         The “grand compromise” of the 1984 Waxman‐Hatch Act sought to maintain a balance between
promoting and rewarding innovation while providing lower cost options following a finite patent
protection period. As best we know, no other branded consumer market experiences such a dramatic
predictable elimination of its brand franchise as does prescription biopharmaceuticals – even though the
unchanged branded product remains safe and effective. In the last quarter century since passage of the
Waxman‐Hatch legislation we have witnessed a prototypical biopharmaceutical product life cycle with
rapidly changing market dynamics, providing both manufacturers and consumers with benefits and
challenges as the Schumpeterian process of “creative destruction” endures. 29

  Prior to August 2010, the AARP reports used the wholesale acquisition (“WAC”) price
published by Medi‐Span as a measure of price per prescription. It is worth noting that the
manufacturers’ WAC price has no stable reliable relationship to prices paid by Medicare Part D
beneficiaries for prescriptions dispensed at their pharmacies, for the latter include the effects
of wholesaler, distributor, prescription drug plan and retail margins, as well as Medicare Part D
subsidies to the prescriptions drug plans; for further details, see Berndt and Newhouse [2010].
Moreover, as pointed out by one of these authors previously, for generic drugs there is
generally no stable or consistent relationship between the generic manufacturer’s WAC and the
acquisition costs of wholesalers and retail chains; see, for example, Schondelmeyer and Wrobel
[2004, pp. 14, 17‐18]. Despite these interpretive problems, he AARP authors have designated
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                              Page 25



this as the “manufacturer’s” price. In their second 2010 study (Schondelmeyer and Purvis
[2010]), the coauthors change the source of their pricing data from manufacturer to retailer,
using prescription drug claims data from large medical claims data bases (Thomson Reuters
MarketScan™ Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Research Databases).
13
  Notably, this use of fixed weights (along with the utilization of the fixed weight Laspeyres
price index formula) represents a departure in methodology from Schondelmeyer’s previous
research published in peer‐reviewed journals; see, for example, Suh, Schondelmeyer, Manning
et al. [1998], in which changing weight Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher aggregate price index
procedures are employed.

  There are several other problems with the AARP methodology, and while not as egregious as
the practice of ignoring generics, using list rather than transactions prices, and keeping 2006
expenditure weights fixed, they are worth noting. First, while the AARP WAC price is for a
hypothetical prescription, say a pack of 30 tablets/capsules each taken once daily,
manufacturers frequently sell wholesalers presentations containing a much larger numbers of
tablets/capsules – bottles of 100, 500 or even 1000. Whether AARP uses a 30‐day pack or a
1000 bottle formulation to compute a 30‐day price for a medicine taken once daily is
important, for typically the per tablet/capsule price is considerably smaller for the 1000 per
bottle than with the 30 day pack presentation. Analogous issues arise for medicines taken once
weekly, or several times per day. The AARP authors do not address the issue of how this biases
upward their expenditure and price calculations. Second, as more prescriptions are dispensed
for 90 days, it becomes increasingly important to measure the length of a prescription, rather
than assuming it based on pack sizes. In the case of a package of 4 mg Avandia, for example,
according to IMS data, the average number of pills in a prescription was 43.6, suggesting a
significant number of patients had larger prescriptions than the pack size of 30 assumed in the
AARP report. Ignoring consumers’ shift to mail order and the increased share of 90 day
prescriptions at retail pharmacies are each likely to understate the savings achieved by
consumers, or alternatively, will bias upward estimates of price increases realized by
consumers. Finally, although the set of brands “widely used by Medicare beneficiaries” on
which the AARP bases its price growth calculations includes 219 form‐strengths, AARP only
publishes annual data for the leading 25 form‐strengths.

  Since clopidogrel (the generic version of Plavix) was launched at risk by Canadian generic
manufacturer Apotex, and then ordered withdrawn from the market shortly thereafter by
Judge Sidney Stein, it never achieved a dominant portion of the clopidogrel plus Plavix market,
and thus in the calculations reported here we treat all brand plus clopidogrel prescriptions as
A Quarter Century After Passage of Waxman‐Hatch Legislation                             Page 26



branded throughout the 2006‐9 time period. Notably, since the generic clopidogrel price was
about 87% that of the brand, quantitative findings change only very slightly, and all qualitative
findings are robust to how one treats those clopidogrel sales. For details on the Apotex entry
and judicial decisions, see Aaron Smith [2007].

  Note that the average price growth over these leading 25 form‐strengths is not strictly
comparable to the AARP reported brand price growth, for the latter are based on 219 “widely
used” brands; the AARP document does not report an average price growth for the leading 25
branded form‐strengths, although it does identify the 25 products.

  Specifically, only about 62,000 of the 4.9 million zolipidem plus Ambien prescriptions were
dispensed in brand form in 2009, while for simvastatin 20 mg plus Zocor 20 only 14,000 of 8.3
million prescriptions were dispensed as brands, and for simvastatin 40 mg plus Zocor 40 mg
only 13,000 of 9.6 million were dispensed as brands.

  Schondelmeyer, Purvis and Gross [2009a], p.1; the 2009 value was annualized during the 12
months ending in September 2009, but is the same as that reported in Purvis and
Schondelmeyer [2010], p. 1. Over the same 2006‐9 time period, the corresponding AARP
aggregate price index over the combined product sample consisting of 219 brand products, 185
generics and 144 specialty products increased 14.2%, an AAGR of 4.53%.

  Although Effexor (venlaxafine) went off patent in June 2008, we do not report 24 months
beyond that date here.

  We note that the proton pump inhibitors class is one where the availability of over‐the‐
counter therapeutic options is widespread and may be partially responsible for the relatively
low level of reduction in average prescription‐only treatment cost following the introduction of
generic prescription‐only pantoprazole.

  We note that BMS has applied for a six month pediatric exclusivity extension for Plavix™. If
this application is approved by the FDA, the date at which Plavix™ would lose market exclusivity
would move to mid‐2012.
