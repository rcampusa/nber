                                          ABSTRACT

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced a mandate requiring
chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus and menu boards. This paper investigates
whether and why calorie posting laws work. To do so, we develop a model of calories consumed
that highlights two potential channels through which mandates influence choice and outlines an
empirical strategy to disentangle these alternatives. We test the predictions of our model using
data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to compare changes in body mass
index (BMI), obesity, and consumer well-being in locations that implemented calorie-posting
laws between 2008 and 2011 to those in neighboring locations without such laws. We find that
calorie mandates lead to a small but statistically significant reduction in average BMI of 0.2 kg/
m2 (1.5 pounds) and reductions in self-reported measures of life satisfaction. Quantile regressions
provide evidence that reductions in BMI and life satisfaction are concentrated among those with
healthy weight. Viewed in its totality, the pattern of results is consistent with an economic model
in which calorie labels influence consumers both by providing information and by imposing a
welfare-reducing moral cost on unhealthy eating.

I. Introduction

         The concurrent increases in restaurant meals, caloric intake, and obesity have spurred a

literature exploring the causal link between the consumption of meals at restaurants and increases

in obesity (e.g., Currie et al., 2010; Dunn, 2010; Anderson and Matsa, 2011; Courtemanche et al.,

2016). 2 From a policy perspective, this connection raises the question of whether market failures

are at work – a concern that is enhanced by evidence that consumers underestimate the calories

contained in restaurant meals (e.g., Kozup et al., 2003; Burton and Creyer, 2004; CCPHA, 2007;

Wisdom et al., 2010; Block et al., 2013). Attempting to address such internalities and reverse

trends in obesity, policymakers have introduced mandates that require chain restaurants to post

calorie counts on menus and menu boards. Such mandates are designed to “nudge” healthier food

choice by making calories more salient at the point of purchase.

         Despite the increased prevalence of such mandates, the existing literature has focused on

estimating their impacts on either calories consumed (e.g., Elbel et al., 2009 and 2011; Bollinger

et al., 2011; Finkelstein et al., 2011; Auchincloss et al., 2013; Krieger et al., 2013) or BMI (e.g.,

Yelowitz, 2016; Deb and Vargas, 2016; Restrepo, 2017). Given this focus, the existing literature

provides little to no guidance as to the channels through which “nudges”, such as calorie mandates,

influence choice or the associated welfare effects. It is this gap in the literature that our study aims

to fill. In doing so, we seek to move the literature from studies designed to evaluate whether a

given “nudge” works to studies designed to understand why the “nudge” works.

         We begin by developing a model of calories consumed and how this choice is impacted by

calorie mandates. Our model assumes that calorie choice is influenced by three considerations; (i)



2
 For example, Currie et al. (2010) find that having a fast food restaurant within 0.1 miles of a school results in an
approximate 5.2 percent increase in obesity rates amongst ninth grade students. However, Anderson and Matsa
(2011) find that such effects are less pronounced in rural areas.

                                                                                                                        2
consumption (or experienced) utility, which depends on both calories consumed and an

individual’s weight, (ii) an “internality” or bias that influences choice but not subsequent

consumption utility, and (iii) psychic (or moral) costs that influences both decision and

consumption utility. In our model, internalities could reflect imperfect information about calorie

counts or other sources of “bias” such as inattention, “cognitive bandwidth”, or time inconsistency

that lead to the overconsumption of calories (e.g., Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013; Courtemanche

et al., 2015a; Allcott et al., 2019; Sadoff et al., forthcoming).                Psychological (or moral) costs

depend on the environment, i.e., whether one is aware of the relative calories for different menu

items, and reflects the notion that individuals may feel guilty when selecting high calorie items.

         Our model shows that calorie mandates can influence choice through two distinct channels.

First, by providing information on caloric content on menus and increasing the salience of healthy

food options at the time of purchase, calorie mandates might reduce internalities and lead to

improved choice for “biased” agents. Second, such labels may impose a “shadow tax” on higher

calorie items and hence distort the relative “price” of such items vis-à-vis lower calorie

alternatives. 3 Our model thus predicts that calorie mandates should cause a decrease in calories

consumed but that the subsequent effects on the decision-maker’s welfare depend on the relative

size of the internality foregone and the psychic costs (guilt) triggered by the presence of calorie

labels. Further, our model provides a way to distinguish between these channels by examining

heterogeneity in the effects on BMI and changes in stated wellbeing.

         We use data from the 1994-2012 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

(BRFSS) to test the predictions of our model and uncover the channels through which calorie



3
  Intuitively, individuals can avoid the “shadow tax” by selecting lower calorie items. However, if such items are
less preferred than higher calorie alternative, the presence of calorie labels can lead to lower levels of consumption
utility.

                                                                                                                         3
mandates impact choice. Rather than relying on a single test to identify the channels, we analyze

the effects of calorie mandates on multiple outcomes using the BRFSS and other secondary

datasets, examine different subsets of the population based on our theoretical predictions, and

weigh the totality of the evidence. 4 To do so, we investigate the impacts of local and state chain

restaurant calorie labeling mandates on BMI and overall consumer well-being, as measured by life

satisfaction. As the BRFSS data do not include information on calories consumed, we also

investigate the impact of the calorie mandates on other factors that could influence BMI – smoking,

alcohol consumption, and exercise. Such analysis provides indirect evidence that any observed

changes in BMI reflect changes in calories consumed and allows us to better link our theory and

empirical findings.

         Identifying variation comes from differences in calorie-labeling mandate implementation

and enforcement across geographic areas and over time. We provide two pieces of evidence

highlighting the validity of our identification strategy: differences in the prevalence and awareness

of calorie labels across treated areas with different levels of enforcement and control areas. First,

we summarize data from phone calls to chain restaurants showing that restaurants in treated areas

were more likely to report listing calories on menus and menu boards than counterparts in control

areas. Second, we summarize survey data showing a substantial difference in the likelihood

individuals in treated areas notice calorie labels at chain restaurants than counterparts in control

areas.

         Turning to our econometric results, we find that calorie mandates lead to small but

significant reductions in BMI of 0.19 kg/m2 (corresponding to about 1.5 pounds and 0.7% of the

sample mean). Interestingly, we find that the effects on BMI are driven entirely by those locations


4
  In this regard, our strategy is similar to Porter and Zona (1993), who rely upon multiple tests rather than a single
test to detect bid rigging in procurement auctions.

                                                                                                                         4
who actively enforced the local mandates throughout our sample period. In fact, we find no effects

in locations where enforcement was “weak”. Such heterogeneity is consistent with differences in

the likelihood that restaurants across these different locations report posting calories on menus and

consumers living in these locations report having noticed calories on menus when eating out.

          We next explore the impact of the calorie mandates on compensating behaviors that could

influence BMI independent of any change in calories consumed. Specifically, we explore if the

enactment of the local mandates had any impact on three compensating behaviors: (i) the

likelihood an individual smokes, (ii) the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per month, and (iii)

the likelihood an individual exercises along with the time spent exercising each month. We find

that the enactment of the local mandates had no effect on any of these metrics. Viewed in

conjunction with the effects on BMI, such patterns suggest that the observed changes in BMI are

driven by the presence of calorie counts and subsequent changes in calories consumed as opposed

to other factors.

          Our theoretical model suggests that calorie labels could reduce BMI because of the

provision of information and the presence of moral costs. Evidence on the importance of moral

costs comes from our analysis of life satisfaction. Specifically, we find that the presence of calorie

labeling mandates leads to a reduction in self-reported life satisfaction that is concentrated among

people in the healthy weight category, as opposed to those who are overweight or obese. These

findings are consistent with our model and suggest that calorie labels impact consumers both by

providing information and by inflicting a welfare-reducing moral cost on unhealthy eating for

consumers with relatively accurate information on caloric content prior to the introduction of the

labels.




                                                                                                    5
         To further understand the importance of moral costs as a channel through which calorie

labels influence choice, we estimate quantile regressions that allow heterogeneous response to

local mandates across the BMI distribution. Results from this exercise show that the calorie

labeling laws have statistically significant effects in quantiles that correspond to BMIs in the

healthy weight category. That we find effects for healthy weight individuals who are unlikely

affected by internalities provides evidence consistent with the notion of moral costs. Even in the

absence of new information, consumers would reduce calories consumed when faced with calorie

labels as a way to avoid the psychic costs (or guilt) triggered by the purchase of high calorie items.

This is a theoretical channel introduced by Jimenez-Gomez’s (2019) model of nudges that we are

the first to explore empirically in a relevant context.

         Our paper contributes to several literatures. First, our paper contributes to a vast body of

work exploring how simple messages that provide consumer information about misperceived or

shrouded attributes of a product or service impact subsequent choices. For example, there is a

growing body of work exploring how simple messages that educate individuals about non-linear

tax incentives such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (Chetty and Saez, 2013) or Social Security

benefits (Liebman and Luttmer, 2011) impact subsequent labor supply. 5 A related body of work

examines the impact of providing information on misperceived or shrouded attributes such as fuel

efficiency (Allcott and Knittel, 2019), energy savings (Allcott and Taubinksy, 2015; Davis and

Metcalf, 2016; Allcott and Sweeney, 2017), the benefits of school choice or post-secondary

education (Hastings and Weinstein, 2008; Jensen, 2010; Barr and Turner, 2018), the returns to job

search or retirement savings plans (Duflo et al., 2016; Saez, 2009; Altmann et al., 2019), restaurant



5
  There is similar work in the context of environmental economics showing that educating consumers about non-
linear tariffs for electricity and the prevailing marginal prices impact subsequent patterns of consumption (Kahn and
Wolak, 2013).

                                                                                                                    6
hygiene grades (Jin and Leslie, 2003), and truth-in-lending styles disclosures (Seira et al., 2017)

on subsequent choice. Amongst this body of work, our study is most closely related to explorations

of the impact of calorie labels on subsequent calories purchased and BMI (e.g., Bollinger et al.,

2011; Deb and Vargas, 2016; Restrepo, 2017). However, our paper extends this earlier work on

calorie mandates by developing a theoretical model and using it to identify the channels through

which calorie labels impact choice behavior.

       Second, our paper contributes to a growing body of literature using measures of subjective

well-being to measure the effects of government policies or other economic shocks. For example,

recent work has used measures of subjective well-being to place monetary value on public goods

(or public bads) such as airport noise (Van Praag and Baarsma, 2005), flood disasters (Luechinger

and Raschky, 2009), terrorism (Frey et al., 2009; Metcalfe et al., 2011), traffic congestion

(Anderson et al., 2016), the Chernobyl disaster (Danzer and Danzer, 2016), and air pollution

(Luechinger, 2009; Levinson, 2012). A related body of work has used subjective well-being to

evaluate the impacts of policies or economic shocks such as inflation targeting (Di Tella et al.,

2001), German re-unification (Frijters et al., 2004), creative destruction (Aghion et al., 2016),

cigarette taxes (Gruber and Mullainathan, 2005), and the provision of improved housing for the

poor (Galiani et al., 2018). Our paper extends this line of inquiry by using measures of subjective

well-being to test theory and identify the channels through which a policy impacts choice.

       The literature on behavioral welfare economics has emphasized the importance of

heterogeneity in the population (Allcott and Taubinsky, 2015; Taubinsky and Rees-Jones, 2018;

Allcott and Kessler, 2019) but has largely ignored the potential psychological costs (and

heterogeneity therein) of the nudge. One exception is Thunström (2019), who measured

hypothetical willingness-to-pay (WTP) and emotional reactions to a calorie information nudge in



                                                                                                 7
an online experiment, and found a heterogeneous effect: those with higher self-control reacted

more to the nudge and felt positive emotions, while those with lower self-control reacted less and

had negative emotions. We also find that those we identify with higher self-control (i.e., those

with BMI in the healthy weight range) react to the nudge; however those individuals exhibit lower

life satisfaction, implying that they suffer psychological costs (rather than having positive

emotions from the nudge). Our paper thus contributes by measuring the heterogeneity of the effect

of the nudge and its psychological costs in the field. 6

         Finally, our research contributes to a growing literature exploring how best to use insights

from behavioral economics to achieve policy goals. To date, such work has focused on areas such

as educational attainment (Levitt et al., 2016), female labor force participation rates (Bursztyn et

al., 2018), electricity and water conservation (Allcott, 2011; Costa and Kahn, 2013; Ferraro and

Price, 2013; Allcott and Rogers, 2014), tax compliance (Fellner et al., 2013; Dwenger et al., 2016;

Hallsworth et al., 2017), traffic violations (Chen et al., 2017), or the use of credit cards (Seira et

al., 2017). 7 Unlike this prior work, however, our paper goes beyond simply evaluating whether or

not the given policy works. We set forth to understand why the policy works and determine if the

reason why the policy works differs across segments of the population. In this regard, our paper

shares similarity with work on the design of “sin” taxes (Gruber and Koszegi, 2004; Taubinsky

and Rees-Jones, 2018; Allcott et al., 2019) and efforts to “nudge” the repayment of credit card debt

(Bursztyn et al., 2019).




6
  In particular, we show that once calorie-information interventions are implemented in the field, psychological costs
might exist even for those who had a positive WTP for the nudge in the lab, suggesting the importance of evaluating
policies after implementation in the field.

  For an overview of work in this area, we refer the interested reader to survey articles such as Amir (2005);
Loewenstein et al., (2007); Downs et al. (2009); Volpp et al., (2011); Matjasko et al., (2015); or Chetty (2015).

                                                                                                                    8
II. Background on Calorie Labeling Laws

         New York City became the first location in the United States to pass a chain restaurant

calorie labeling law in 2006, which was implemented in April 2008. Other areas across the country

(King County, WA; Philadelphia County, PA; Albany and Schenectady County, NY; Montgomery

County, MD; and the state of Vermont) implemented similar laws between 2009 and 2011, as

documented in Table 1. 8 The enforcement of laws passed in other locations, such as California,

was tabled due to the passage of the ACA, as local jurisdictions anticipated the implementation

and enforcement of the federal mandate. Further, enforcement varied across locations with pre-

ACA mandates. For example, while New York City, Philadelphia County, Schenectady County,

and Montgomery County actively enforced the local mandate throughout our sample period,

enforcement in King County, Vermont, and Albany County was either weak or varied throughout

the sample period. 9

         The first wave of studies exploring the impacts of these laws utilized receipt data and

difference-in-difference designs to estimate the effect of calorie labels on calories ordered. 10

Treatment groups in these early studies were comprised of customers at restaurants exposed to a

law and control groups constructed using customers eating at the same restaurant chains in

neighboring areas. Results from this body of work are mixed. For example, Elbel et al. (2009,

2011) find no evidence that the New York City mandate influenced calories ordered among adults,



8
  The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced a national mandate requiring chain
restaurants and retail food establishments with 20 or more locations to post calories on menus and menu boards.
The start date of this mandate was originally set for December 2015 but was delayed until May 2018.
9
  Based on correspondence with local officials, King County actively enforced the mandate between January 2009
and May 2010, Vermont did not actively enforce the mandate through inspection but instead reacted to customer
complaints about a lack of calories on the menu, and Albany County stopped enforcement six months after the law
was implemented.
10
   A related literature, using laboratory and field experiments, suggests that providing nutritional information can
affect meal decisions (e.g., Burton et al., 2006; Roberto et al., 2010; Wisdom et al., 2010; Ellison et al., 2013;
Bedard and Kuhn, 2015; VanEpps et al., 2016; Cawley et al., 2018).

                                                                                                                       9
adolescents, or children in low-income neighborhoods. However, Bollinger et al. (2011) found

that the New York City law reduced calories ordered at Starbucks restaurants by 6%. The evidence

on the effects of the mandates using data from restaurants in and around King County, WA is also

mixed – Finkelstein et al. (2011) report no effect on calories ordered at Taco Time Northwest

restaurants and Krieger et al. (2013) estimate a reduction in calories ordered at taco and coffee

restaurants but not burger and sandwich restaurants. 11

         The mixed results from this first wave of studies points to limitations inherent to focusing

on a small number of restaurants in a particular geographic area. Consumer preferences and

knowledge vary across locations, and the extent of misinformation about calories could differ

across different types of restaurants. The ambiguity could also reflect sorting, as calorie labeling

could influence the types of people who eat at particular types of restaurants. Additionally,

inconsistent enforcement could lead to unobserved heterogeneity in the likelihood any given

establishment posted calorie counts. Finally, such analyses are susceptible to the concerns about

common trends and understated standard errors in comparative case studies with a small number

of treated units (Abadie et al., 2010).

         A more recent set of studies has used data from the BRFSS to shift the focus of this work

from estimating the impacts of calorie mandates on calories ordered to BMI. For example,

Restrepo (2017) compared changes in BMI in the counties in New York State that implemented

calorie labeling laws to changes in other counties in the state and found that the local laws reduced

both average BMI by 0.4 kg/m2 (or approximately 1.5 percent) and the probability of being obese

by 3 percentage points. Yelowitz (2016) uses a sample consisting of respondents from the thirty



11
  Auchincloss et al. (2013) is the only paper to estimate the effect of the mandate in Philadelphia and finds that the
customers eating in treated restaurants consume 151 fewer calories than do counterparts eating at the same chain in
surrounding areas.

                                                                                                                    10
largest U.S. cities, which includes several that had passed a calorie mandate, and finds that such

mandates caused small and statistically insignificant reductions in both average BMI and the

probability of being obese. 12 Deb and Vargas (2016) were the first to utilize data from every

location that passed a calorie mandate to estimate the effect of such policies. 13 To do so, they

implement a data-driven entropy balancing procedure to reweight the control group in a way that

best matches the treatment group’s pre-treatment BMI trajectory and find small reductions in

average BMI for both men and women.

        Our approach differs from this prior work along multiple important dimensions. First, we

worked with a health policy legal expert to develop a more rigorous classification of treatment and

control groups. Prior work identified treatment groups utilizing information on the passage and

intended effective dates of local calorie labeling laws. Such a strategy does not account for the

fact that many of these local laws were either repealed or never actually enforced due to expected

preemption from the ACA’s national mandate. Our strategy for identifying treated areas was to

separately classify each law using a combination of legal statutes, media articles, and direct

correspondence with state and local health departments. In doing so, we conclude that many of

the “treated” areas of Yelowitz (2016) and Deb and Vargas (2016) were either never actually

treated (e.g., Oregon) or only temporarily treated (e.g., California, whose law was repealed). We

use as treated areas only those for which we were able to document that the law was actually

implemented as intended and was never repealed. As shown in Table 1, these include the five

counties of New York City; King County, WA; Philadelphia County, PA; Albany, Schenectady,



12
   Cities that passed a local mandate and were thus considered treated include New York, Philadelphia, Seattle,
Portland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, and Boston.
13
   Their treated areas include New York City; the counties of King (WA), Multnomah (OR), Albany (NY),
Schenectady (NY), Suffolk (NY), Philadelphia (PA); and the states of California, Maine, Massachusetts, and
Oregon. The control areas included Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Arizona, Idaho, and Nevada.

                                                                                                             11
Suffolk, and Westchester County, NY; Montgomery County, MD; and the state of Vermont. We

further validate these choices by using phone calls to restaurants and consumer surveys to

document clear differences in the prevalence of calorie labeling between these treatment sites and

neighboring areas, as described below.

         A second difference between our approach and the prior literature is that we evaluate

calorie-labeling laws through the lens of a theoretical framework, which highlights that changes

in consumer behavior need not lead to increased consumer welfare. This differs from the standard

economic model whereby calorie provision can only influence choices by rectifying imperfect

information.      Since calorie-labeling laws do not (directly) impose a monetary cost on the

consumer, prior work has assumed that any resulting changes in food selections are unambiguously

welfare improving. 14 In contrast, our framework allows for calorie labels to trigger moral costs

that are akin to a tax on high calorie meals. The net effect of labeling laws on consumer welfare

is thus theoretically ambiguous but can be inferred using available data. To evaluate this

possibility, we go beyond prior work and look not only at changes in average BMI and across the

BMI distribution but also heterogeneous changes in subjective well-being across treatment and

control areas as a way to understand why calorie labels impact consumer choice.


III. Theoretical Model

         It is well known that the environment (or choice architecture) in which people make

decisions affects their choices (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008). We assume that individuals choose an

element 𝑥𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝑋 (with the interpretation that 𝑥𝑥 represents calories) in a given environment 𝑒𝑒 ∈ 𝐸𝐸

(the environment could be multidimensional).



14
  Such sentiment is highlighted in Bollinger et al. (2011) who write that, “…as far as regulatory policies go, the
costs of calorie posting are very low – so even these small benefits could outweigh the costs.”

                                                                                                                     12
         We adapt the framework in Jimenez-Gomez (2019) to model the calorie nudge. First, we
                                    𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
define “experienced utility” 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖            (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) as the “hedonic experience associated with an outcome”

(Kahneman and Thaler, 2006), that for our purposes also includes the health effects associated

with consumption. 15         People, however, do not always maximize their experienced utility

(Kahneman et al., 1997; Berridge, 2003). Formally, we define “decision utility” 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) as the

utility that individual 𝑖𝑖 maximizes, and the “internality” 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) as the difference between

individual 𝑖𝑖’s decision and experienced utility:
                                                             𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
                                     𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) = 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖        (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) + 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒).

The internality 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) could be due to lack of information about the calorie content of foods, but

it also encompasses other sources of non-utility-maximizing behavior such as lack of attention,

“cognitive bandwidth”, or time inconsistency (Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013; Courtemanche et

al., 2015a). 16 Calorie labels might reduce this internality by providing relevant information to

individuals and/or increasing the saliency of choosing healthy food.

         Critics of nudges have argued that nudges might impose a psychological cost (Glaeser,

2006). As described by Levitt and List (2007), utility depends not only on consumption but also

on a “moral cost” for violating social norms. Nudges can increase this moral cost. For instance,

in the charitable giving literature, Andreoni and Rao (2011) and DellaVigna et al. (2012) have

argued that being asked to give imposes a “shadow tax” of guilt that can only be removed by

giving. It becomes optimal to give conditional on being asked, but people may be left worse off

than if they had never been asked. A parallel process could apply to calorie labels. Seeing a high




              𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
15
   We define 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) formally below, as a function of calories consumed and the weight associated with calorie
consumption.
16
   In particular, the bias could arise from individuals having incorrect expectations about how much they will enjoy
consumption, for example, due to projection bias (Loewenstein et al., 2003).

                                                                                                                  13
calorie count for a preferred item may impose a “shadow tax” of guilt that induces a lower-calorie

choice, but the consumer’s resulting utility may be lower than if she had never seen the information

and had chosen the unhealthy item. In other words, the motivation for the healthier choice may be

guilt rather than health.
                                                                                                                              𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
         We incorporate the idea of a moral cost by assuming that experienced utility 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖                                             , which

is the relevant concept for welfare analysis, is
                                                 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
                                               𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖       (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) = 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) − 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥),

where 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) is the utility from choice 𝑥𝑥, which does not depend on the environment, 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥) is the

price of choice 𝑥𝑥, and 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒), is the psychological/moral cost from consuming highly caloric

foods, which depends on the environment, i.e., whether one is aware of the amount of calories.

Following the literature on the economics of obesity (Philipson and Posner 1999), we assume

𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) = 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥)�, where 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) is the individual’s weight, which is increasing in 𝑥𝑥. Utility

𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 depends on the consumption of 𝑥𝑥 and also the individual’s weight. We assume that 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 is

increasing and concave in 𝑥𝑥. 17 Therefore, the individual’s decision utility, which is the relevant

one for understanding her choices, is
                                     𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
             𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) = 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖        (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) + 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) = 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) − 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥) + 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒). 18

Let 𝑒𝑒0 be the status quo (i.e., no nudge), and 𝑒𝑒1 be an environment where there are calorie labels.

We make the following assumptions:



17
    We assume that 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 is increasing and concave in 𝑥𝑥, concave in 𝑤𝑤. Moreover, we assume for simplicity that weight
𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) increases linearly with calorie consumption. This means that
                                                       𝜕𝜕 2 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖       𝜕𝜕 2 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖   𝜕𝜕 2 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖
                                         𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖′′ (𝑥𝑥) =           + �2            +           � 𝑤𝑤 ′(𝑥𝑥),
                                                       𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥  2        𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝜕𝜕𝑤𝑤 2 𝑖𝑖
and we assume that the former is negative, so 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) is concave. This would be true if, for example, the marginal
increase in weight with respect to calories, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥), is sufficiently small in comparison to the concavity of 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 ,
measured by 𝜕𝜕 2 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 2 .
18
    We assume that the individual’s utility is quasilinear in money. Therefore, as long as the price 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥) is small
compared with the individual’s wealth, we can ignore her budget constraint.

                                                                                                                                           14
       1. Choice 𝑥𝑥 represents a number of calories, so individuals are indifferent between foods with

       the same number of calories.

                                                                                                                         𝜕𝜕𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥 �𝑒𝑒0 �       𝜕𝜕𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥 �𝑒𝑒1 �
       2. Individuals have a larger marginal internality without the nudge,                                                    𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

                                                                                                                                                                     for

       all 𝑥𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝑋, and we assume 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (0|𝑒𝑒) = 0 for 𝑒𝑒 ∈ {𝑒𝑒0 , 𝑒𝑒1 }.

                                                                                                                                       𝜕𝜕𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥 �𝑒𝑒1 �
       3. The nudge has a psychological cost: 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒0 ) = 0 for all 𝑥𝑥, 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒1 ) ≥ 0,                                              𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
                                                                                                                                                           > 0 for

       all 𝑥𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝑋.

         𝑗𝑗
Let 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 be defined as the solution of the problem when the individual uses decision utility in

environment 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 ,

  𝑗𝑗
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 max 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥�𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 � − 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥) + 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥�𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 � .
                  𝑥𝑥∈𝑋𝑋


Observation: 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 < 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 , i.e., the nudge reduces calorie consumed. This is so because, for all 𝑥𝑥, we

have that 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒1 ) ≤ 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒0 ) and 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒1 ) ≥ 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒0 ). Therefore, a higher choice of 𝑥𝑥 yields

less decision utility and has a higher psychological cost under the nudge, so the optimal choice of

𝑥𝑥 must be lower in that case.

              The welfare gain/loss from the nudge for individual 𝑖𝑖 is given by
               𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
∆𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 = 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖            (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 |𝑒𝑒1 ) − 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 |𝑒𝑒0 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 ) − 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 ) − [𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 �𝑒𝑒1) − 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 �𝑒𝑒0 )] − [𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 ) −

𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 )].

Proposition 1 (Jimenez-Gomez, 2019). A sufficient condition for the nudge to increase welfare

for individual 𝑖𝑖 is

𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 �𝑒𝑒1) − 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 �𝑒𝑒1 ) ≥ 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 �𝑒𝑒1 ).                                                                                 (1)

A sufficient condition for the nudge to decrease welfare for individual 𝑖𝑖 is

𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 �𝑒𝑒1) ≥ 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 �𝑒𝑒0 ) − 𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 �𝑒𝑒0).                                                                                  (2)



                                                                                                                                                                     15
           So far, we have described the model using a representative individual.                              However,

heterogeneity in the population is crucial when considering behavioral welfare economics (Allcott

and Taubinsky, 2015; Taubinsky and Rees-Jones, 2018; Allcott and Kessler, 2019). Suppose that

the population can be divided in two groups, H and L (for high and low information). Suppose,

moreover, that individual ℎ ∈ 𝐻𝐻 has no internality in her decision-making, because she has access

to all the information and cognitive resources she needs, so 𝛬𝛬ℎ (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒0 ) = 𝛬𝛬ℎ (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒1 ) = 0 for all

𝑥𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝑋. Then, from Equation (2), we find that the nudge decreases her welfare as long as there is

some psychological cost, since the right-hand side is 0.

           On the other hand, suppose that an individual 𝑙𝑙 ∈ 𝐿𝐿 has a large internality in the absence

of the nudge, but the nudge reduces the internality as well as the consumption of calories, so that

𝛬𝛬𝑙𝑙 (𝑥𝑥𝑙𝑙0 �𝑒𝑒1 ) − 𝛬𝛬𝑙𝑙 (𝑥𝑥𝑙𝑙1 |𝑒𝑒1 ) is large. 19 Then, from Equation (1), we have that the nudge will increase

her welfare as long as the psychological cost is not too large.

           Note that the comparisons between the internality and the cost are relative to 𝑥𝑥. For small

𝑥𝑥 (i.e., foods which are low in calories), we expect both the internality and the psychological cost

to be low; the opposite is true for high-calorie foods. If 𝑥𝑥𝑙𝑙0 , the choice in the absence of the nudge

was a high-calorie food, then from Equation (1), the nudge will increase the welfare of individual

𝑙𝑙 if the psychological cost for eating high calorie foods is smaller than the reduction in the

internality for those high calorie foods.

Predictions. From the previous arguments, we have the following predictions:

           1. Everybody (both in H and L) will decrease calorie consumption;

           2. Those in H will have a welfare loss from the interventions; and




19
     Because the nudge reduces the internality and increases psychological/moral costs, we have that   𝑥𝑥𝑙𝑙0 > 𝑥𝑥𝑙𝑙1 .
                                                                                                                         16
         3. The welfare effect in L is ambiguous, and it depends on the relative size of the internality

         and the psychological cost associated with the nudge.



The model we have described is quite general, and our results are consistent with any situation that

fits the described assumptions. 20 In terms of welfare, the argument for critics of nudges usually

rests in Equation (2): when the psychological cost is high, and people are already informed and

make unbiased decisions, the nudge can only decrease welfare. However, as importantly, Equation

(1) shows that for those who do not make unbiased decisions (because they suffer from

internalities), the nudge can be a source of welfare. The nudge will be more likely to increase

social welfare when the internalities of the L group are larger, when the relative size of the L group

with respect to group H grows, and when there were negative externalities derived from

consumption. It will be more likely to decrease social welfare when the psychological costs (for

either group) are larger (we derive this formally in Appendix A).



IV. Data

Identification of treatment and control areas

         Our identification strategy involves comparing counties that implemented calorie labeling

laws to proximate areas that did not implement such laws. Our main analysis sample therefore

includes the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) of New York City (the “treated” counties are

the five counties of New York City, Suffolk County, and Westchester County; the control counties

are the other counties in the area), Philadelphia (treated county is Philadelphia), Seattle (treated

county is King), Washington DC (treated county is Montgomery), and Albany (treated counties


20
  We provide the analysis of a scenario with the possibility of learning about calories for groups with different
levels of bias in Appendix A.

                                                                                                                    17
are Albany and Schenectady) as well as the entire census division of New England (treated state

is Vermont). 21,22 We excluded observations from localities where menu labeling laws were passed

but, due to anticipated preemption by the ACA, were never implemented or enforced. We do this

because it is unclear that these areas can truly be considered control units since some restaurants

may have started posting calories in anticipation of the laws taking effect. Within our geographic

areas of interest, the dropped areas include Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey as well as

Nassau County in New York.

        While using proximate geographic areas as control groups increases the likelihood that the

treatment and control groups experience similar local economic conditions, one concern with this

identification strategy is that restaurant chains may voluntarily post calories on menus. As a result,

restaurants in the control group areas may display calorie counts on menus even though they are

not required to do so. Thus, individuals in our control group areas may be exposed to calorie labels

when eating at select chains regardless of location. Additionally, customers who reside in the

control group areas may dine at restaurants in treated regions and, thus, be exposed to calorie

counts. Alternatively, customers in the treated and control group regions may be unaware of

calorie counts on menus when selecting their meals.

        To the extent that these concerns are valid, they should serve to minimize differences across

treated and control areas and attenuate the estimated effects. In this regard, our estimates should


21
   Ulster County, NY also passed, implemented, and enforced a menu labeling law. However, we exclude Ulster
County from the sample because it is the only county within its MSA, meaning that there are not similar controls as
the other treated counties. The results are robust to including Ulster County as a treated county, without any
corresponding control counties or also including adjacent Orange County, NY as an additional control county.
22
   The sample spans from 1994 through 2012 for the analysis of BMI and 2005 through 2010 for the analysis of life
satisfaction. The Washington DC MSA and census division of New England are excluded from the life satisfaction
analysis because there are no treated observations in those areas between 2005 and 2010 but are included in the
analysis of BMI because there are treated observations in 2011 and 2012. Specifically, the treated county in the
Washington DC MSA – Montgomery County, MD – implemented its law in July 2010, and its 2010 BRFSS
respondents were all surveyed before then. The treated state in New England – Vermont – implemented its law in
January 2011.

                                                                                                                18
be considered intent-to-treat effects and, hence, a lower bound on the impacts of calorie labels on

food choices. To understand the severity of these concerns, we examine differences in compliance

and awareness using two supplemental data sources.

        To address the first concern, we called approximately 17,000 restaurants in our sample

areas to inquire whether they were currently posting calories on menus. These restaurants

encompassed all locations of the top 500 chains by sales volume with at least 15 locations

nationwide. 23 The calls were made in early spring 2017 prior to the implementation date (May

2018) of the federal calorie mandate. Of the 2800 restaurants in the regions that were actively

enforcing local mandates (New York City, Westchester County, Suffolk County, Philadelphia

County, Schenectady County, and Montgomery County), approximately 82.9% of all

establishments were compliant with the local mandate and posting calories on menus and menu

boards. Of the 1300 restaurants in the regions that had mandates but were not actively enforcing

them (King County, Albany County, and Vermont), approximately 73.4% of all establishments

were posting calories. Finally, of the 13,000 restaurants in the control regions, nearly 57.9% of all

establishments were voluntarily posting calories on menus.

        Viewed in its totality, the call data suggest that, while a substantial fraction of restaurants

are voluntarily providing caloric information on menus, there are significant differences in the

prevalence of calorie posting across regions. This suggests that restaurants are responding to the

stringency of local mandates, which could introduce heterogeneity in the likelihood consumers

observe calorie counts across these different regions. Moreover, these differences likely understate

the differences that were present during our sample period, which ends in 2012. No chain



23
  The top 500 restaurant chains by sales volume are drawn from the 2016 Technomic Top 500 Chain Restaurant
Advance Report. Given that many of the chains outside of the top 400 by sales volume have less than 15 locations,
these 500 chains likely encompass nearly all restaurants required to post calories by the local mandates.

                                                                                                               19
restaurants voluntarily posted calories on menus in all their locations until the very end of our

sample period, whereas several did by the time of our phone calls in 2017.

         To examine whether consumers observe calorie counts on menus, we surveyed

approximately 4000 adults in December 2016 throughout our regions in collaboration with

Qualtrics Panels to construct a representative sample on age, gender, and education. We asked

consumers to describe whether they had noticed calorie counts on the menu or menu board of

every meal they had eaten at a restaurant during the previous 24 hours. In regions that were

actively enforcing local calorie-posting mandates, 44.0% of respondents reported that they had

noticed calorie counts on the menu. In regions that were not actively enforcing local mandates,

39.2% of respondents noticed calorie counts on menus, and in regions that did not have a local

mandate, 35.6% of respondents reported that they had such information. It is important to note

that these percentages are based on the home residence of the respondent, not the location of the

restaurant where they had eaten; hence, it is possible that respondents living in the control group

regions observed calorie counts while eating at a restaurant in the treated region. Despite this

possibility, we still see that individuals residing in areas actively enforcing calorie-posting

requirements were 24% more likely to have observed calorie counts when eating away at a

restaurant than were counterparts residing in control areas.

         These survey results suggest that a substantial fraction of consumers recalled observing

calorie counts when dining at restaurants. While consumers who reside in the control group areas

were exposed to calorie counts, consumers in the treatment regions were more likely to notice

calorie counts on menus when dining at restaurants. 24 Given that heterogeneity in the enforcement


24
  These results likely understate the extent of heterogeneity in our sample period as consumers in the control group
became more likely to observe calorie counts over time. The survey in December 2016 provides an estimate of
consumer awareness of calorie posting during a time period that corresponds to the spring 2017 estimates of
voluntary posting of calories by restaurants. In an earlier wave of the survey in December 2014, 44.1% of

                                                                                                                  20
of local calorie-posting requirements corresponds to differences in the likelihood that restaurants

post calories on menus and heterogeneity in the likelihood that consumers residing in treatment

and control groups observe calories on menus, we estimate both the average impact of calorie-

posting laws and the differential impact of these laws based on the stringency of local enforcement.



BRFSS Data and Outcome Measures

        Our primary data source is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for

the period between 1994 and 2012. The BRFSS is a random-digit-dialing telephone survey

conducted by state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The BRFSS collects information about adults’ health, health-related behaviors, and demographic

characteristics. Importantly for our purposes, the BRFSS also includes state and county identifiers;

however, county identifiers are not publicly available after 2012. In addition, as chain restaurants

began voluntarily posting calorie counts on menus in all their locations in 2012, ending our sample

in 2012 minimizes the likelihood of attenuation bias driven by exposure to calorie counts in

restaurants voluntarily posting such information in control areas.

        We construct our main analysis sample as follows. First, pooling all observations from

1994-2012 yields 5,232,786 respondents. Restricting geography to the treatment and control areas

leaves 614,179 respondents. From this sample, we exclude 5,608 pregnant women and 14,207

individuals with missing information. The final sample consists of 594,364 individuals.




consumers in areas that actively enforced local mandates noticed calorie counts in restaurants, which is the same
percentage as December 2016. However, fewer percentages of respondents noticed calorie counts in other regions.
In December 2014, 36.2% of respondents in areas with local mandates that were not actively enforced noticed
calorie counts, and 30.4% of respondents in areas without a local mandate noticed calorie counts in restaurants.
Further, our BRFSS sample ends in 2012, when chain restaurants first started voluntarily posting calorie counts, so
the percent of consumers in the control group who observed calorie counts in restaurants is likely much lower during
the sample period.

                                                                                                                 21
         The theoretical model from section III predicts impacts on calorie consumption and utility.

While we do not observe these outcomes directly, we use BMI and life satisfaction as proxies for

these outcomes in our empirical analysis. 25 BMI is computed based on self-reported measures of

height and weight, as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. 26

         Given that the BRFSS data do not include food consumption or calories consumed, we use

information on other health-related behaviors – smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise – that

could influence BMI absent changes in calories consumed. Examining these outcomes allows us

to determine whether any observed changes in BMI reflect changes in our unobserved measure of

interest (calories consumed) or a broader array of behavioral change. Smoking is measured as

whether the individual currently smokes cigarettes. Alcohol consumption is measured as the

number of drinks consumed during the past 30 days. The physical activity outcomes are any

exercise in the past thirty days besides a regular job (available in all waves), the average minutes

of moderate exercise per week over the past month (collected only in odd years between 2001 and

2011), and the average minutes of vigorous exercise per week over the past month (odd years

between 2001 and 2011). 27




25
   Empirically, using caloric intake as an outcome is not feasible since the only government survey dataset with a
comprehensive food diary – the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) – is not nearly
large enough and does not have the geographic scope to precisely identify the impact of this intervention. The
predicted effect of calorie labeling on BMI is of the same sign (negative) as the predicted effect on calorie intake as
long as calorie expenditure is unaffected.
26
   Self-reported weight and height admittedly suffer from measurement error, and Cawley (2004) and Courtemanche
et al. (2015b) develop “corrections” that adjust self-reports based on the comparison of actual and self-reported
values in the NHANES. We elect not to implement these corrections in this paper because the sample period does
not correspond in a straightforward way to the NHANES survey periods, and assumptions made about how to
reconcile the difference could potentially induce more error than the correction solves. Further, researchers studying
determinants of obesity have repeatedly found that implementing such corrections does not substantively impact
results (Courtemanche et al., 2015b; Courtemanche et al., 2016). Finally, in our particular context, the nature of
reporting error is not likely to differ across treatment and control areas.
27
   Restrepo (2017) measures physical activity as any exercise in the past 30 days and the number of minutes of any
form of exercise in the past 30 days; he finds no impact of the New York City law on physical activity.

                                                                                                                    22
         The BRFSS data include a question about life satisfaction, which has been used in prior

work to evaluate the effects on consumer well-being of policy changes such as German re-

unification (Frijters et al., 2004), cigarette taxes (Gruber and Mullainathan, 2005), and the

provision of improved housing for the poor (Galiani et al., 2018). While the use of self-reported

life satisfaction is not beyond reproach (Deaton and Stone, 2016), it has been proposed as a useful

proxy for experienced utility (Kahneman and Sugden, 2005) and is negatively correlated with more

objective measures such as demand for antidepressants (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2016). 28,29

         The BRFSS collected information on life satisfaction in the 2005 through 2010 waves.

While we are therefore only able to use those years to examine the impact on life satisfaction, this

period still allows for identifying variation from all the calorie labeling laws except for

Montgomery County, MD (which was implemented in July 2010) and Vermont (which was

implemented in 2011). The life satisfaction question’s choices are very satisfied, satisfied,

dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied. We use the same ordinal definition in our analyses.

         The BRFSS data also include a number of demographic and socioeconomics characteristics

of the respondents, such as race/ethnicity, educational attainment, age, gender, and marital status.

As these variables are correlated with our outcomes of interest, we incorporate them into our

empirical model described below. In addition, as the BRFSS data include county of residence, we

are able to construct county-level socioeconomic characteristics using data from the U.S. Census

Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics that could also be correlated with our outcomes of interest.


28
   There is evidence that self-reported life satisfaction is correlated with experienced utility. For example, Perez-
Truglia (2015) provides evidence from a validation test that expenditure shares predicted by life satisfaction
questions are highly correlated with changes in actual expenditure shares on different categories of food
consumption. Similarly, Benjamin et al. (2012) show that stated measures of subjective well-being on life
satisfaction are a powerful predictor of stated choices, what is to be expected if life satisfaction is a good proxy for
experienced utility.
29
   We would prefer to have a broader set of questions upon which to build our measure of well-being and recover
associated measures of relative marginal utility, as in Benjamin et al. (2014). Unfortunately, our data only include a
single question on life satisfaction, so we are unable to develop a more comprehensive measure.

                                                                                                                     23
V. Effects on Body Mass Index

        Our theoretical model predicts that all consumer types will reduce calories consumed when

exposed to calorie counts on menus. As noted earlier, the BRFSS data do not include information

on the amount of calories consumed. To test this hypothesis, we instead rely on an alternate

measure, BMI, which is directly impacted by calories consumed. Specifically, our model predicts

that we should observe reductions in BMI in treated areas relative to control areas following the

implementation of local mandates. We evaluate this prediction by estimating the average effect

of chain restaurant calorie posting mandates on BMI using a difference-in-differences design.

       In doing so, we estimate the following empirical model:

          𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜷𝜷𝟐𝟐 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 + 𝜷𝜷𝟑𝟑 𝒁𝒁𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 + 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (3)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the outcome variable (BMI) for individual 𝑖𝑖 in county 𝑐𝑐 in time period 𝑡𝑡. Since

survey data are collected monthly and we have the exact month and year when the laws were

implemented, the time unit is “month-year” (e.g., April 2008). The treatment variable is defined

as 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and is a dichotomous variable equal to one whenever a chain restaurant calorie labeling

law is implemented in county 𝑐𝑐 in month-year 𝑡𝑡. The associated coefficient 𝛽𝛽1 measures the

average treatment effect of a menu labeling law on the outcome variable and provides a test of our

first hypothesis that the introduction of calorie labels leads to reductions in BMI.

        We control for a number of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of individuals,

denoted by 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 , including race/ethnicity, educational attainment, age, gender, and marital status.

The race/ethnicity variables are indicators for whether the individual is non-Hispanic white (the

reference), non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other race/ethnicity. Educational attainment is

characterized by four mutually exclusive categories for whether the individual did not obtain a


                                                                                                                     24
high-school degree (the reference), obtained a high-school degree, attended college but did not

graduate, or obtained a college degree. We include dummy variables for each individual year of

age. We also use indicator variables for females and married individuals.

        County level controls (𝒁𝒁𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 ) include continuous variables for annual population density,

monthly unemployment rate, and annual median household income. The population density

measure is constructed as the number of people per square mile using U.S. Census Bureau

information on population estimates for each year and land area estimates from 2000. We obtained

data on median income estimates for each year from the Census Bureau and local area

unemployment rates for each month from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

        Equation (3) also includes county fixed effects 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 , month-year fixed effects 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 , and county-

specific linear time trends 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡. The last term, 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , is an idiosyncratic error term. Standard errors

are clustered at the county level and are adjusted for heteroscedasticity. There are 110 counties in

our sample so concerns about inference with a small number of clusters should not apply in our

case (Cameron and Miller, 2015). We utilize sampling weights in all analyses. The BRFSS did not

start to incorporate cell phones into its sampling frame until 2011, and the sampling weights are

designed to adjust for the resulting changes in the composition of the sample.

        In sum, our identification strategy accounts for an array of observable characteristics as

well as unobservable characteristics that are constant within counties, constant within time periods,

or change linearly within counties. In other words, 𝛽𝛽̂1 gives the causal effect of menu labeling laws

under the relatively weak assumption that the implementation of such laws is uncorrelated with

unobservable county characteristics that change non-linearly.

        To examine the plausibility of this identification strategy, we examine whether the

characteristics of individuals in the treated and control group regions are similar prior to the


                                                                                                           25
implementation of the first calorie-posting requirement and also whether the trends in BMI are

parallel for these two groups during the pre-treatment period. We additionally conduct a series of

robustness checks, including an event study analysis, and falsification tests that provide further

support of the plausibility of this identification strategy; such results are reported in Appendix B.

Table 2 presents summary statistics for the outcome variables and covariates from the pre-

treatment period (1994-2007) for the treated and control groups. The weight outcomes of the

treatment and control groups were very similar prior to the implementation of calorie labeling

mandates: for both groups, average BMI was around 26.1 kg/m2 while 36% were overweight but

not obese (25 ≤ BMI < 30), 12%-13% were Class I obese (30 ≤ BMI < 35), and 6% were Class

II/III obese (BMI ≥ 35). Pre-treatment life satisfaction was somewhat lower in the treatment group

than the control group, though our identification strategy will be able to control for such baseline

differences through the inclusion of county fixed effects and county-specific linear time trends.

The treatment and control groups were broadly similar along the dimensions of education, age,

and gender, but the control group was somewhat wealthier, had a smaller proportion of

racial/ethnic minorities, and lived in less densely populated counties. Again, our identification

strategy will be able to account for these differences through the inclusion of county fixed effects

and county-specific linear time trends.

       Figure 1 presents annual changes in average BMI in the treatment and control locations

during our sample period. The vertical line, drawn between 2007 and 2008, reflects the timing of

the first calorie labeling law, implemented by New York City in 2008. As can be observed in the

figure, the treatment and control groups exhibited very similar levels and trends in average BMI

in the pre-treatment period. Thus, Figure 1 provides visual evidence consistent with the identifying




                                                                                                  26
assumption and suggests that the individuals in the control group provide a valid counterfactual

for the outcomes of individuals in the treatment group.

          Additionally, as shown in Figure 1, BMI in the treatment group drops in 2008 – right after

the implementation of the New York City law – and then stabilizes throughout the rest of the post-

treatment period. In contrast, BMI in the control group continues on its steady upward trajectory

during the post-treatment period. This graph therefore provides evidence that menu labeling laws

may decrease BMI. To more formally assess the impact of the New York City law and subsequent

local mandates, we next report estimates from the difference-in-differences design of equation (3).

          Estimation results for BMI are presented in Table 3. We only report the coefficient

estimates for 𝛽𝛽1. We find that calorie posting laws lead to a decrease in BMI of 0.17 kg/m2 on

average, as shown in column (1). This change in BMI corresponds to a 1.5-pound reduction in

weight at the mean height of the sample and a reduction of 0.7% relative to the mean of the

treatment group prior to the implementation of calorie posting laws.

          We show that these results are robust to utilizing alternate control variables, time periods,

and control group definitions in Appendix B. Finally, in a series of falsification tests, we create a

series of placebo variables as if the laws occurred in years before they were actually implemented

and find that there is no influence of the placebo calorie mandates. Importantly, these falsification

tests provide evidence consistent with the identifying assumption of equation (3), which is that

there is a common counterfactual trend in the dependent variable between the treated and control

groups.

          To better relate the average treatment effects reported in column (1) to the prevalence of

calorie labels on menus reported in chain restaurants, we augment equation (3) to include variables

denoting that the law was passed but not yet implemented and that the law was implemented but



                                                                                                    27
is not actively enforced. The first indicator allows us to examine anticipatory effects from

restaurants posting calories on menus before the local mandates were implemented. 30 The second

indicator allows us to examine whether the influence of calorie posting laws depends on the

stringency with which treated regions enforce local mandates. As noted earlier in section IV, the

likelihood that consumers observed calorie counts on menus was lower in areas that did not

actively enforce local mandates. This later variable is equal to one in the regions of King County

after May 2010, Albany County after September 2010, and Vermont; the coefficient estimate

provides evidence of whether the influence of calorie posting laws depends on the intensity of

enforcement.

        Results from column (2) of Table 3 provide evidence of the importance of controlling for

the stringency of enforcement. While our estimates show that actively enforced laws reduce BMI

by 0.19 kg/m2, the estimated effect for laws in regions that are enacted but not actively enforced

is an increase of 0.13 kg/m2, which is not statistically significant at any meaningful level. The

estimated effect on the indicator for passage of the local law is near zero and positive (0.001 with

a standard error of 0.099), which rules out that the average treatment effect reported in column (1)

reflects anticipatory changes.

        Based on the totality of the findings, the results in column (2) suggest that the average

treatment effect is driven by active enforcement of local mandates and hence likely reflects

exposure to calorie labels on menus in chain restaurants rather than other factors related to the

passage and implementation of local mandates. To further explore this conjecture, we examine

the impact of menu labeling laws on smoking, drinking, and physical activity, as these behaviors

could also influence BMI in the absence of changes in calories consumed. These results are shown


30
  Anticipatory effects could also occur due to public health messaging and information campaigns surrounding the
passage of these mandates (Rees-Jones and Rozema, 2020).

                                                                                                              28
in Table 4. Across all of these outcomes, the estimates of the impact of implementation of the law

are not statistically significant and small in magnitude relative to the sample mean. This reinforces

our interpretation of the estimates in Table 3 that the changes in BMI reflect changes in calories

consumed due to exposure to calorie labels on menus.

         Before proceeding, it is interesting to note that our estimated effects for changes in BMI

are significantly lower than what would be predicted based upon experimental estimates of calorie

labels on calories consumed at restaurants (Wisdom et al., 2010; VanEpps et al., 2016; Cawley et

al., 2018). For comparison, Wisdom et al. (2010) find that including calories and daily calorie

recommendations on menus in a fast-food restaurant decreased the amount of calories ordered in

a meal by 99 calories, which is predicted to decrease BMI by 0.75 kg/m2 within one year. 31

VanEpps et al. (2016) find that including calories on online menus for a large corporate cafeteria

led to a 60 calorie reduction in the number of calories ordered, which is predicted to decrease BMI

by 0.47 kg/m2 within one year. Cawley et al. (2018) find that including calories on the menu in a

full-service restaurant reduced the number of calories ordered by 45 calories, which is predicted

to decrease BMI by 0.35 kg/m2 within one year. 32

         Viewed through the lens of recent work on scalability, however, such divergence is not

particularly surprising (Al-Ubaydli et al., 2017a; Al-Ubaydli et al., 2017b). By design of the local

mandates, individuals have the ability to avoid calorie labels by choosing to eat at restaurants that

are not required to post calories on menus. To the extent that calorie labels trigger guilt/impose a

psychic cost on the consumption of high calorie foods, we would expect some individuals to switch


31
   Menu-labeling laws require both providing calorie information and the daily calorie recommendation on menus.
Providing calorie information only led to a decrease of 61 calories ordered in a meal, which is predicted to decrease
BMI by 0.46 kg/m2 within one year (Wisdom et al., 2010).
32
   The predicted decrease in BMI within one year is based on the estimated decrease in calories ordered in Wisdom
et al. (2010), VanEpps et al. (2016), and Cawley et al. (2018); the baseline height in each sample; and the result in
Hall et al. (2011) that a decrease of 10 calories per day will eventually lead to weight loss of one pound, with half of
the weight change occurring within one year.

                                                                                                                     29
where they eat to avoid exposure to calorie labels. 33 Such sorting would attenuate the effect of the

mandate by limiting the number of meals purchased at restaurants affected by the laws. Moreover,

our data suggests imperfect compliance as many chain restaurants – particularly those in treated

areas that did not actively enforce the local mandate – report that they do not post calories on

menus. Given results in Table 3 that there was no impact on BMI in regions where the local

mandate was not actively enforced, we would expect the average effect of calorie labels in our

sample to be less pronounced than what would be inferred from experimental work that restricts

attention to calories consumed in a restaurant that posts calories on menus.



VI. Understanding Why Calorie Labels Matter

         The prior section shows evidence consistent with our theoretical prediction that calorie

labels reduce BMI and calories consumed for the average consumer. To better ascertain why we

observe this effect, we return to the predictions of our theoretical model, which suggest two

channels through which calorie labels could impact choice: they provide information which

reduces the marginal internality for low information individuals and they may impart

psychological or moral costs on all decision makers.

         As highlighted in our theory, the key to understanding the relative importance of these

different channels is to explore the effects of calorie labels on the well-being of low and high

information types. Specifically, our theory predicts that the effect for high information types is

unambiguously negative provided that calorie labels trigger psychological or moral costs. In




33
   We are not the first to note the role of sorting to avoid social pressures or moral costs. Prior work in charitable
giving and sharing in dictator games has shown how the ability to avoid the ask (or opportunity to share) impacts
subsequent rates of giving and the interpretation of motives for doing so (Andreoni et al., 2017; DellaVigna et al.,
2012; Lazear et al., 2012). Unfortunately, we do not have data on where individuals eat and if they attempt to avoid
chain restaurants that post calories on menus and menu boards.

                                                                                                                    30
contrast, the welfare effect on low information types is ambiguous as it depends on the size of the

reduction in the marginal internality and the psychological costs associated with the calorie nudge.

         These predictions provide a way to establish the existence and importance of moral costs.

If calorie labels work solely through the information channel, we would expect the average effect

on life satisfaction to be unambiguously positive as the labels would have no impact on high

information types and an unambiguously positive impact on low information types by reducing

the marginal internality. In contrast, if calorie labels trigger moral or psychological costs, the

effect for high information types is unambiguously negative while the effect for low information

types is ambiguous. Hence, the prediction for the average effect is ambiguous and depends on the

relative portion of each type and the relative strength of the competing effects for low information

types.

         We do not directly observe any individual’s type; however, we can draw upon prior

literature to infer types of consumers who are more likely to have low levels of information. In

particular, the review article of Wehling and Lusher (2017) documents that individuals with BMI

greater than or equal to 30 (in the obese range) systematically underreport calories consumed in

meals, while there is no such pattern for individuals in healthy weight ranges. 34 We thus use

observed BMI as a proxy for individuals’ types when exploring the effects of calorie labels on life

satisfaction.

         To do this, we estimate ordered probit models since life satisfaction is an ordinal outcome

with responses on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. Since the

sample period for life satisfaction is much shorter than the period for BMI (2005-2010 rather than



34
  While it may be tempting to use additional demographic characteristics to define types, Wehling and Lusher
(2017) document that there is no consistent pattern of differences in beliefs across other demographic characteristics
such as race, age, and gender.

                                                                                                                   31
1994-2012), we omit county-specific time trends in our baseline specification and instead show

the sensitivity of the results to their inclusion in a robustness check, which we show in Appendix

B. The other robustness checks, also in the appendix, are similar to those used for BMI, with the

only exception being that we do not vary the length of the pre-treatment periods since utilizing a

lengthy pre-treatment period is not feasible for life satisfaction.

         In the upper panel of Table 5, we document the estimates from ordered probit model for

each life satisfaction category for the full sample. Results from this exercise provide evidence that

the average consumer is worse off following the implementation of the local calorie mandates. 35

For the full sample, the implementation of the laws decrease the probability of being very satisfied

with one’s life by 2.6 percentage points, which corresponds to 6.3% of the mean. At the other end,

calorie-posting requirements increase the probability of reporting being very dissatisfied by 0.2

percentage points and dissatisfied by 0.6 percentage points.                     For perspective, these effects

correspond to an approximate 17% and 12% increase relative to the means for these categories.

Further, calorie posting-requirements increase the probability of reporting being satisfied by 1.8

percentage points, corresponding to an increase of 3% relative to the baseline means.

         Considering the estimates for all categories jointly, these results suggest that, on average,

individuals are less satisfied with their life following the implementation of calorie mandates, as

the distribution of life satisfaction shifts to the left. To better ascertain the magnitude of these

changes, our estimated effects are equivalent to those estimated for small changes in air pollution

(Levinson, 2012) or cigarette taxes (Gruber and Mullainathan, 2005). However, the estimates are

substantially smaller than the effects of variation in daily traffic congestion in Beijing, China



35
  Because the sample ends in 2010 for life satisfaction, which limits the variation across regions in the stringency of
enforcement, we do not examine the impact of calorie-posting requirements on life satisfaction by the stringency of
the enforcement of the local laws.

                                                                                                                    32
(Anderson et al., 2016) or improved housing for low-income households in South America

(Galiani et al., 2018). The results are again stable across the various specifications, with the

estimates from all robustness checks falling within a standard error of the baseline estimate. 36

         While the effects for the full sample are suggestive of the presence of moral costs, a sharper

test of our theoretical predictions is based upon heterogeneity of the effects across high and low

information types. The bottom two panels of Table 5 provide results for this exercise, where we

proxy for information types using weight status. The estimates for individuals in the healthy

weight category (high information types) are presented in the second panel and reinforce the notion

that calorie labels impart moral costs. For example, we find a 6.4 percentage point reduction in

the likelihood that an individual residing in the treated areas in the post-treatment period reports

being very satisfied with their life. Further, we find a 0.4 percentage point increase and a 1.4

percentage point increase in the likelihood of reporting being very dissatisfied and dissatisfied with

their life due to calorie-posting requirements. Estimates for overweight and obese individuals are

not statistically significant for any life satisfaction category and are uniformly smaller in

magnitude relative to the corresponding estimates for healthy weight individuals.

         A potential concern is that estimates of the impact of calorie-posting laws conditional on

current weight status may be biased if treatment impacts weight status. To assess the plausibility

of this concern, we estimate ordered probit models analogous to equation (3) to determine whether

calorie-posting requirements change the probability that an individual is classified as healthy

weight, overweight, or obese. We find that the estimates for healthy weight, overweight, and




36
  Given the relatively short length of the pre-treatment period in the life satisfaction regressions, we conduct only
one falsification test in which the sample period consists of 2005-2007 and the placebo intervention occurs midway
through this period (July 2006) for all the treated areas. The estimated “effects” of the placebo calorie labeling laws
on the probabilities of being in each of the life satisfaction states are small and statistically insignificant.

                                                                                                                     33
obesity are small in magnitude and not statistically significant, as shown in Appendix Table A6. 37

Hence, it does not appear as if our classification of individuals as high or low information types is

itself a function of exposure to calorie-posting laws.

         Another potential concern with the interpretation of these results is that there may be

differences in the likelihood that overweight and obese individuals observe calorie counts on

restaurant menus relative to healthy weight individuals. If so, our results could reflect differential

exposure to calorie counts rather than differences in the channels through which calorie labels

impact choice across these types. To assess the plausibility of such concern, we return to the

survey data of restaurant consumers initially discussed in section IV. As the survey included

information on height and weight for the respondent, we are able to examine if there are differences

across types in the likelihood that consumers reported noticing calorie counts at restaurant meals

in the previous 24 hours. The data suggest that there are no such differences; calorie counts were

noticed by 38.6% of healthy weight individuals, 37.4% of overweight individuals, and 35.4% of

obese individuals.

         It is thus unlikely that our results reflect endogenous sample selection or differential

exposure to calorie counts across consumer types. Rather, our results suggest that both information

and moral costs are important channels through which calorie labels influence consumer choice

and, hence, BMI. For high information types, we observe reductions in life satisfaction, which is

consistent with the theoretical role of moral costs. For low information types, we observe no

change in life satisfaction, suggesting reductions in the marginal internality and a compensating

increase in moral costs.


37
  The weight loss corresponding to the average decrease in BMI shown in Table 3 is 1.5 pounds. The difference
between the overweight and obesity thresholds of 5 BMI units corresponds to around 30 pounds at the sample mean
height. Thus, it is not surprising that the estimates of the impact of calorie-posting requirements on overweight and
obesity are small in magnitude and not statistically significant.

                                                                                                                   34
         An alternate way to identify the importance of moral costs would be to return to the analysis

of BMI to consider the effects across the distribution of consumer types using quantile regression.

Recall that our theoretical model predicts a reduction in BMI across all consumer types, if calorie

labels trigger moral costs. The key to testing this prediction is to examine changes in BMI for

individuals in the healthy weight region of the distribution of BMI prior to calorie labels (high

information types) for whom reductions in BMI should only be observed if there are moral costs.

In particular, high information types (i.e., individuals with BMI < 25) are contained within the first

five quantiles.

         Results from the quantile regressions shown in Table 6 highlight two important patterns.

First, we observe statistically significant reductions in BMI for high information consumers in

quantiles 0.2 and 0.3, reinforcing the importance of moral costs identified in our estimates on life

satisfaction. Second, we observe the largest point estimates in the 0.9 quantile, corresponding to

low information consumers (i.e., obese individuals with BMI ≥ 30). This suggests that both moral

costs and information channels are likely influential for such types. 38 Further, these results

reinforce the interpretation of our findings for life satisfaction on the importance of moral costs as

a channel through which calorie labels influence choice.



VI. Conclusion

         In an attempt to provide information to consumers at the point of purchase, policymakers

have introduced laws requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus. To date, research

exploring such laws has focused on identifying their impact on calories consumed and/or BMI. In


38
   We note that the estimate in the 0.9 quantile is not statistically significantly different from zero, nor is this
estimate significantly different from the estimates at any other quantile. However, it is important to note that there is
large variability in BMI in this quantile relative to other quantiles; hence, given our estimated effect size, the power
of tests in this quantile is low.

                                                                                                                     35
this paper, we examine a new question – why such laws influence consumer choice. To do so, we

develop a theoretical model through which the information on restaurant menus reduces

internalities and influences choice. Our model demonstrates another channel through which

calorie counts influence choice – by increasing moral costs, which leads consumers to decrease

calories consumed but also reduces welfare for these consumers. Importantly, we use the model

to develop testable predictions that allow us to uncover the presence and importance of each

channel.

       We test these predictions by combining BRFSS data on BMI and life satisfaction with other

secondary data sources. Specifically, we explore the impact of city, county, and state calorie

posting requirements on BMI and life satisfaction by comparing changes in these outcomes over

time in geographic areas that implemented such requirements to changes in the surrounding

geographic areas using a difference-in-differences design. Lending credibility to this design, we

show that the trends in BMI are similar in these areas prior to the enforcement of any law.

Moreover, we present evidence from supplemental survey data showing that restaurants in the

treated areas are more likely to report posting calories on menus and consumers in treated areas

are more likely to report noticing calories on menus.

       We find that calorie-posting laws lead to small reductions in average BMI and that such

effects reflect both moral costs and responses to more salient information. The importance of

moral costs is identified through two pieces of evidence: weight loss and reductions in life

satisfaction for individuals in the healthy weight range of BMI (i.e., the high information types in

our theoretical model). The importance of information comes from the results that we find

reductions in BMI but no change in life satisfaction for individuals in the obese category (i.e., the

low types in our model).



                                                                                                  36
       From a policy perspective, the estimated 0.17 kg/m2 reduction in average BMI, which

corresponds to a decrease of about 1.5 pounds at the mean height of the sample, is unlikely to

impact health conditions related to BMI and obesity. Moreover, our estimated effects are smaller

than what would be predicted if we were to extrapolate evidence from field experiments exploring

the impact of calorie labels on the choices of consumers in restaurants. Yet, insights from the

literature on scalability helps to reconcile these differences. Since calorie labels introduce moral

costs, some consumers may change where they eat to avoid exposure to such labels and restaurants

may choose to not comply with the law. Both effects would serve to attenuate the impact of

calorie-labeling requirements on BMI relative to what would be inferred from field experiments

that do not allow for sorting or imperfect compliance.

       Our results are consistent with the notion that “nudges” may be welfare enhancing for some

individuals but welfare reducing for others. We are not the first to demonstrate such heterogeneous

welfare effects for policies motivated by behavioral insights. Similar welfare effects have been

explored in the context of the introduction of active choice for health insurance plans (Handel,

2013) and the receipt of monthly home energy reports (Allcott and Kessler, 2019). Yet, one should

not use the possibility that calorie labels may have adverse welfare effects for certain types of

individuals to rule out the use of such nudges. Such an approach would be akin to advocating

doctors forgo prescribing any medication that could have adverse side effects for some individuals.

Instead, we would ideally understand the benefits and costs of nudges, and tailor them to the

population that is the most likely to benefit from them.

       Future work should focus on the welfare effects of calorie labels in greater detail. We

envision three avenues for such work. First, we should directly estimate the welfare effects of

calorie labels on individual well-being. Second, we should extend the analysis to incorporate



                                                                                                 37
changes in externalities related to obesity to allow for the estimation of social welfare. Third, just

as physicians have thought of ways to mitigate the side effects of certain medicines, we should

explore ways to mitigate the adverse effects of “nudges” such as calorie labels without

compromising their overall impact on the targeted behaviors.

       An additional direction for future work is to incorporate adaptation. The current paper and

sample frame do not allow us to say anything about adaptation. Our results should therefore be

considered as short run estimates that are necessary for testing our theory, which is a static model.

Further work should extend our theory to allow for dynamics and consider a longer-time horizon

to allow for adaptation and the derivation of long-run welfare effects.

Notes: New York City, Westchester County, Suffolk County, Philadelphia County, Schenectady County, and
Montgomery County actively enforced the local mandate from the date of implementation shown in the table through
the implementation of the federal mandate as part of the ACA in May 2018. Based on correspondence with local
officials, King County enforced the mandate between January 2009 and May 2010, Vermont did not actively enforce
the mandate through inspection but instead reacted to customer complaints about a lack of calories on the menu, and
Albany County stopped enforcement six months after the law was implemented.

APPENDIX A – Theoretical Appendix

         In this Appendix we compute social welfare and provide a specific interpretation of the

model. First, in order to compute social welfare, we need to take into account the relative weights

of both groups. Let the weights be 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 and 𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 that we assign to both groups respectively, and recall

                𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
that ∆𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 = 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖        (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖1 |𝑒𝑒1 ) − 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖0 |𝑒𝑒0 ). Then, the change in social welfare is given by:

                                                 ∆𝑊𝑊 = 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 ∗ ∆𝑊𝑊𝐿𝐿 + 𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 ∗ 𝛥𝛥𝑊𝑊𝐻𝐻 .



Corollary 1A. A sufficient condition for the nudge to increase welfare for society is

                             𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 [𝛬𝛬𝐿𝐿 (𝑒𝑒1 ) − 𝛬𝛬𝐿𝐿 (𝑒𝑒1 )] ≥ 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿 (𝑒𝑒1 ) + 𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 𝑐𝑐𝐻𝐻 (𝑒𝑒1 ).   (1A)

A sufficient condition for the nudge to decrease welfare for society is

                             𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿 (𝑒𝑒1 ) + 𝜇𝜇𝐻𝐻 𝑐𝑐𝐻𝐻 (𝑒𝑒1 ) ≥ 𝜇𝜇𝐿𝐿 [𝛬𝛬𝐿𝐿 (𝑒𝑒0 ) − 𝛬𝛬𝐿𝐿 (𝑒𝑒0 )].   (2A)



         Observe that in Equation (1A), the left-hand side represents the benefit of the nudge, which

is the reduction in the internality for the L types, and the right-hand side represents the cost of the

nudge, which is the sum of moral costs for both groups in society. A sufficient condition for the

nudge to increase welfare is therefore that the reduction in the internality has to be sufficiently

large, as to compensate for the moral costs that are being imposed to all individuals.

         We turn now to one possible interpretation of the model, to make things more specific by

analyzing a scenario with the possibility of learning. Suppose the internality arises because

individuals have different expectations about how much they will enjoy consumption: there is a

set of states of the world 𝑆𝑆, and experienced utility depends on the environment and the state

𝑢𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠). An individual has beliefs 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 (𝑠𝑠) over the states of the of world, and their decision

utility is their expectation of their experienced utility:


                                                                                                                     55
                  𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠)] = ∫𝑆𝑆 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠)𝑑𝑑𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 (𝑠𝑠).

         Therefore, the internality in environment 𝑒𝑒 and state 𝑠𝑠 is
                                                                          𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
                  𝛬𝛬𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠)] − 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖            (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠).

If individuals in 𝐻𝐻 have accurate beliefs (they know 𝑠𝑠 ), then they are unbiased, because

𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢ℎ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠)] = 𝑢𝑢ℎ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠). Individuals in 𝐿𝐿 have inaccurate beliefs: they believe that they
                                                                                                                𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
will enjoy calories more than they actually do, i.e., 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠)] > 𝑢𝑢𝑙𝑙                                 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠), so they are

biased towards overconsumption, since 𝛬𝛬𝑙𝑙 (𝑥𝑥|𝑒𝑒, 𝑠𝑠) > 0. Suppose that individuals update their

beliefs when they receive the nudge. Individuals in 𝐻𝐻 already had accurate beliefs, and hence do

not learn from the nudge; however, they suffer the psychological cost, and are therefore worse off

because of the nudge. Individuals in 𝐿𝐿 update their beliefs, which are now more accurate, and they

will be better off whenever the increased utility from making a better choice is larger than the

psychological cost from the nudge.

APPENDIX B – Sample Composition and Robustness Checks

       Table B1 in this appendix provides detail on the composition of our sample by county. The

rest of the appendix conducts robustness, placebo, and event-study analyses to evaluate the validity

of our baseline estimates, shown in Tables 3 and 5, of the influence of local calorie mandates on

BMI and life satisfaction.

       Table B2 reports the results from robustness checks for BMI. We first include only basic

demographic controls – age, gender, and race/ethnicity – along with the county and time fixed

effects and county-specific time trends. The other controls are potentially endogenous and

endogeneity bias could plausibly spill over to the coefficient of interest. The second robustness

check drops county-specific time trends to increase the amount of identifying variation. Third and

fourth, we restrict the sample period to 2001-2012 and 2005-2012 in order to test the sensitivity of

the results to the length of the pre-treatment period. Fifth and sixth, we use these same shorter

sample periods but drop the county trends. The seventh robustness check excludes counties

adjacent to treated counties due to some of their residents likely working or visiting – and therefore

eating some restaurant meals – in the treated county. If this is a major concern, then excluding

those with the closest proximity to the treated county should affect the estimates. In any case, to

the extent that such cross-county spillovers occur, this would likely mean our baseline results are

conservative. The eighth check clusters standard errors by state rather than county, while

addressing possible concerns about the small number of clusters by following Cameron and

Miller’s (2015) recommendation and conducting inference using the t-distribution rather than

standard normal.

       The last two robustness checks in Table B2 focus on the choice of control units. First, as

an alternate control group, we simply use the top 10% of the population density distribution from



                                                                                                   57
the entire BRFSS sample. This strategy is based on the fact that the most glaring pre-treatment

difference between the proximity-based treatment and control groups is that the individuals in the

treatment group lived in much more densely populated counties. Note again that, since this control

group is not based on geographic proximity to a treated county, this strategy is immune to the

concern about cross-county restaurant eating.

        Finally, we employ the synthetic control method of Abadie et al. (2010) to allow the data

to choose a weighted combination of control counties that best matches the pre-treatment

characteristics of the treatment group. The synthetic control method was originally designed for

aggregate data; we follow the procedure used by Fitzpatrick (2008) and Courtemanche and Zapata

(2014) to apply the method to individual data. We begin by aggregating the data to the county-by-

year level, further combining all the treated counties together into a single cross-sectional unit.

Our “donor pool” consists of all counties in the original proximity-based control group as well as

all those in the top 10% of the population density distribution. The synthetic control procedure

computes the weights for each county in the donor pool that yields the best possible match to the

treatment group along dimensions chosen by the researcher. In the results shown, we match based

on means of the control variables in the pre-treatment period as well as BMI in four pre-treatment

years: 1994, 1998, 2003, and 2007. 39 We then return to the individual-level data and re-run the

regressions using as weights for the control group the product of the BRFSS individual sampling

weight and the county’s synthetic weight.




39
  The resulting synthetic control group is 19.2% Denver, CO; 0.1% Pinellas, FL; 39.4% Cook, IL; 4.8% Baltimore,
MD; 0.8% Arlington, VA; 12.4% Fairfax, VA; 18.3% Norfolk, VA; 5.1% Roanoke, VA. We have also considered
numerous other combinations of matching variables and the results are similar.

                                                                                                             58
       As shown in Table B2, the results are quite robust across these different specifications. The

effect of calorie labeling laws on BMI is always statistically significant at the 10% level or less,

with magnitudes ranging from -0.147 to -0.253 units.

       Table B3 turns to placebo tests using just the pre-treatment portion of the sample period

(1994-2007). In difference-in-difference designs, identification hinges on the assumption that there

is a common counterfactual trend in the dependent variable between the treated and the control

groups. We can test whether this assumption is likely to be valid by running placebo tests to

evaluate whether calorie posting laws have “effects” in periods of time other than those during

which they are implemented (“false” treatments). To implement these tests, we pre-date the laws

to occur over each possible 4-year range during the pre-treatment period and re-estimate the

baseline model for each outcome. As the results show, we find no evidence for differential

counterfactual trends in the pre-treatment period. The estimates are all small and insignificant.

       Table B4 considers a different method to test for problematic pre-treatment trends: event-

study regression. Rather than including a single indicator for whether a calorie labeling law has

been enacted, we include a series of indicators reflecting time until implementation. Specifically,

in addition to the usual “law enacted” dummy variable, we also include dummy variables for

whether the law has not yet been enacted in that particular county but will be in the next 25-48

months, 49-72 months, 73-96 months, 97-120 months, and more than 120 months. The reference

period is therefore the omitted “next 1-24 months” category. Since Wolfers (2006) makes a

compelling case that including treatment-unit-specific time trends is inappropriate in this type of

dynamic specification, we exclude the county trends from the event study model. As the table

shows, there is no evidence that any “effects” emerge in the years leading up to the law’s

implementation. Moreover, the estimates for the “true” treatment effect remain virtually identical



                                                                                                    59
to those from the analogous specification (the one without county trends) in Table B2. 40 The

results from the event-study design and the similarity in the estimates between the event-study

design and difference-in-differences specification suggests that the treatment effect estimates from

the difference-in-differences specification with time-varying treatments are unlikely to be biased

(Goodman-Bacon, 2018).

        The top panel of Table B5 shows the robustness of the estimate of the influence of calorie

mandates on life satisfaction. The robustness checks are similar to those used for BMI, except that,

since life satisfaction is only available starting in 2005, we do not vary the length of the pre-

treatment period. The results remain qualitatively similar across the various specifications, as all

estimates have the same sign and are statistically significant at the 10% level or less. The

magnitudes are somewhat sensitive to specification (e.g., calorie labeling laws reduce the

probability of being very satisfied by between 1.7 and 3.0 percentage points), but all estimates are

within each other’s 95% confidence intervals.

        The bottom two panels of Table B5 evaluate pre-treatment trends in life satisfaction. Given

the relatively short length of the pre-treatment period in the life satisfaction regressions, we

conduct only one placebo test in which the sample period consists of 2005-2007 and the placebo

intervention occurs midway through this period (July 2006) for all the treated areas. 41 Similarly,

the event-study model only includes two treatment indicators: whether the law is law currently

enacted and whether it will be enacted in more than 24 months, with future enactment of 1-23

months as the reference category. In both the placebo and event study regressions, we find no




40
   We also considered an even more flexible event study model with separate indicators for each year. While this
model also revealed no evidence of problematic pre-trends, many of the estimates became quite imprecise, so the
results were not particularly informative.
41
   We exclude county time trends from the placebo regression since it only uses three years of data.

                                                                                                                   60
evidence of problematic pre-trends, as the “effects” of the pre-dated law are very small and

statistically insignificant.

Notes: Sample size is 594,364. The columns give estimated average marginal effects from an ordered probit
regression. Standard errors, heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered by county, are in parentheses. *** indicates
statistically significant at 1% level, ** 5% level, * 10% level. Observations are weighted using the BRFSS sampling
weights. The control group consists of other counties in MSAs with at least one “treated” county, plus New England,
excluding any counties/states in these areas that passed but did not implement a calorie labeling law. The controls
include dummies for the individual’s sex, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, and education level, as well as county-
level population density, median income, and unemployment rate. County and month*year fixed effects are also
included, as well as linear county-specific time trends.
