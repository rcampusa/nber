                Exchange Rates, Money and Relative Prices:
                      The Dollar—Pound in the 1920's

                                ABSTRACT


        This paper applies the analytical framework of the monetary approach

to exchange rate determination to the analysis of the Dollar/Pound exchange

rate during the first part of the 1920's. The analysis uses monthly data up

to the return of Britain to gold in 1925. The equilibrium exchange rate is

shown to be influenced by both real and monetary factors which operate

through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies.

Special attention is given to examination of the relationship between exchange

rates and the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. In the empirical

work the prices of traded goods are proxied by the wholesale price indices

and the prices of non—traded are proxied by wages. One of the key findings

of the paper is the estimate of the elasticity of the exchange rate with

respect to the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. This elasticity

is estimated with high precision and is shown to be .415 which provides an

independent measure of the relative share of spending on non—traded goods.

This estimate is consistent with other estimates obtained in studies of

expenditure shares. The paper concluded with a dynamic simulation which

indicates the satisfactory quality of the predective ability of the model.

        This paper applies the monetary approach to exchange rate determination

to the analysis of the monthly Dollar/Pound exchange rate duingthe period

preceeding the return of Britain to Gold in 1925. The analytical framework

emphasizes that the exchange rate is influenced by real and ntrnetary factors.

Special attention is given to the relationship between the exchange rate and

the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. The estimated elasticity

of the exchange rate with respect to this relative price is shown to be about

0.4 which provides an independent measure of the relative share of spending

on non—traded goods.

     The monetary approach. to the exchange rate emphasizes that, being a

relative price of two monies, the equi1ibrium exchange rate is. attained

when the existing stocks of the two monies are willingly held and that a

theory of exchange rate determination can be stated conveniently in terms

of the supply of and the demand for these monies. The equilibrium exchange

rate is influenced by both real and monetary factors which, according to

the analytical framework that is provided by the monetary approach, operate

through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies.1

Previous work showed that one of the important channels through which real

factors affect the exchange rate is the relative price of (internationally)

traded to non—traded goods ——   the "real exchange rate" [e.g. Dornbusch, l976b

and Calvo and Rodriguez (1977)]. In this paper we extend our earlier

analysis [Frenkel and Clements (1978)] by applying the monetary approach to

an examination of the Dollar/Pound exchange rate during the 1920tS. We

adopt the analytical framework developed by Dornbusch (1976b) with special

emphasis on the role of relative prices. In Section I we outline the basic

elements of the monetary model and in Section II we present the empirical

results. Section III contains some concluding remarks.


I. The

(i) equilibrium in the money markets and (ii) interrelationships between

domestic and foreign prices through the condition of purchasing power parity.

and P denote the nominal quantity of money and the price level, respectively.

Equilibrium in the domestic and the foreign money markets can be written as

             L(              )    = N/P                                                      (1)

             L*(             )    = M*/P*                                                    (2)

where variables which pertain to the foreign economy are denoted by an

asterisk. When money markets clear the ratio of the two price levels can

be expressed as:


                                                                                             (3)

where      and *             denote domestic and foreign expenditure shares on non—traded

goods. From (4)                  and (5) the ratio of traded goods     prices T'    can be
written    as:


                         —                     P   •
                                   *   *                                                     (6)
                 T


Equation    (6) links the relative price of traded goods to the ratio of the

price levels through terms which summarize the price structures in the two

economies.

     The second link between domestic and foreign prices is provided by the

condition of purchasing power paritr. Assuming that purchasing power parity

applies to traded goods, we may express the parity as


                         =   S                                                               (7)




where S denotes the exchange rate ——                   the   price of foreign currency in terms

of domestic curreny.2
                                             3




      Substituting equations (3) and (7) into (6) yields the exchange rate

equation that is familiar from Dornbusch (1976b):


            S—     T N         M L*(   )
                   *    ** M*L(        )                                              (8)


Equation (8) expresses the exchange rate in terms of three basic determinants:

the relative price structure, the relative (nominal) money supplies and the

relative (real) money demands. Embodied in this relationship are the two

basic assumptions of money markets equilibrium and (traded goods) purchasing

power parity. As is evident the determinants of the exchange rate in (8)

include both real and monetary factors.

      The discussion hitherto has not specified the determinants of the

 various demands for real balances. In order to set the stage for the

empirical analysis it is assumed that the demand for money depends on real

income (y) and the rate of interest (i) according to:
                r —ai
            L=aye                                                                     (9)

            L* =   a*y*e1                                                             (10)

Substituting (9) — (10) in (8) and assuming, for expository purposes, that

domestic and foreign parameters are the same, i.e., that r                 0 = ct*,    =

(these   assumptions are tested in Section LI) the exchange rate equation becàmes3

      ZnS   c± n         P/P
                          TN
                                 £n        £n L_ +   c(_i*)                           (11)



The   implications     of equation (11) are straightforward. For example, a rise

in the domestic relative price of traded goods results in a depreciation of

the currency, i.e. , a rise in S. The elasticity of the exchange rate with

respect to the relative price should approximate          ——   the   relative share of

spending on non—traded goods. Likewise, a rise in the supply of domestic

money should depreciate the currency (raise S) with an elasticity of unity;
                                        4




a rise in domestic income should appreciate the currency (lower S) since,

ceteris paribus, the rise in income creates a relative excess demand for

domestic money.   Finally, a rise in the rate of interest should raise S

                                                                 -
since it reduces the quantity demanded of the domestic currency .    Analogous
inferences hold with respect to the effects of changes in the foreign variables.



LI. Empirical Results


     In this section we apply the monetary model to an analysis of the Dollar!

Pound monthly exchange rate over the period February 1921 — May 1925-

during which exchange rates were flexible. The period is the same as in

Frenkel (1978) and in Frenkel and Clements (1978) and it terminates with

the return of Britain to gold. Details on the data and on data sources are

reported in the Appendix. Since there are no available data for the prices

of traded and non—traded goods 6 we proxied the prices of traded goods by the

wholesale price indices and the prices of non—traded goods by wages. For

   (U.S. price) we used actual average hourly earnings of all wage earners7

and for P (U K price) we used an index of average weekly earnings

     The use of these proxies for the relative prices permits an interpretation

of the estimate of the coefficient    in equation (11) in terms of the

elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the relative real wage rates.

Substituting the nominal wage rates w and w* for     and P, and the wholesale

price indices P and P for T and P yields in equation (11) ln[(w*/P*)/(w/P)J

instead of ln[(PT/PN)/(P/P)}. By this interpretation the coefficient 13
measures the elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the ratio of the

real wage rates, and the analytical framework implies that a rise in the domestic

real wage relative to the foreign real wage results in an appreciation of the
                                                           5




     currency, i.e., a decline in S.                This positive association between the real wage

     and the international value of the currency is explained by the fact that a

     higher real wage reflects a higher productivity of domestic labor relative to

     foreign labor.

          In estimating the exchange rate equation our methodology was to estimate

     an equation like ll) without imposing any of the restrictions of equality

     between domestic and foreign parameters. We then proceeded to impose those

     restrictions that, according to the F test, were compatible with the data.

     The result of these tests suggest that the data are consistent with. the

     joint hypotheses that            (i)    the domestic and foreign shares of spending on non—

     traded goo&s are the same, i.e.,                      *,       (ii)   the elasticity of the exchange

     rate with respect to domestic income equals minus the elasticity with respect

     to foreign income, i.e. fl = 1 * and, (iii) the interest (semi) elasticities

     are the same, i.e. c =            a*.    The hypothesis of equality of the absolute values

   of the elasticities with respect                to domestic and foredgn monies is rejected.8

implies that the relative share of expenditures on non—traded goods is about

.42. It is interesting to note that Bilson (1978) estimated this share for

the U.K. and Germany during the 1970's to be .425; this estimate is also similar

to the one in Clements (1979) who, using a very different methodology, estimated

the marginal share of spending on non—traded goods in the U.S. (using recent data)

to be •37•9
       The elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the domestic

money supply is 1.05 and is consistent with the homogeneity postulate that,

 ceteris paribus, a given change in the supply of money results in an

 equiproportionate change in the exchange rate. The elasticity with respect

 to the foreign money supply does not differ significantly from zero and,

 as indicated above, the data reject the restriction of equality between domestic

 andforeign elasticities. IThére are three possible reasonsfor this rejection. First,
                                                                                        —
 it   might   be due to the fact that _the definitions of the U S and the U K money

 supplies     used in our monthly series are not strct1y the same.10 Second, it

 might be due to the fact that the U.K. monetary series have varied much

 less than that of the U.S.; the coefficient of variation of the U.K.

 monetary series is about one—half that of the U.S. series. As a third reason

 one should note the unique reserve currency role which was played by the U.K.

 pound; as a result variations in the supply of the U.K. money might have

 reflected variations in a third country's demand.

        The elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the income ratio is

 positive and significant indicating that, ceteris paribus, a ten percent

  rise in the ratio of domestic to foreign income results in about a 1.9 percent

  depreciation of the home currency. This result is in contrast with the



  implicit assumption that the terms of trade between imports and exports
                                        7




iere given. As a matter of iact, during the period of analysis the U.S.

terms of trade (measured by the ratio of U.K. to U.S. wholesale price

indices) have improved from 2.14 in February 1921 to 1.57 in J4ay 1925. The

correlation between changes in the ratio of incomes and changes in the terms

of trade and their effects on the exchange rate (along the lines suggested

in footnote 2 on page 4 above) might be responsible for the positive

dependence of the exchange rate on income.Another explanation ste       om the

distinction between current and permanent income along the lines developed by

Rodriguez (1976) in his analysis of the short—run interpretation of the

monetary approach to the balance of payments.11

     Finally, the coefficient on the interest rate differential has the

expected (positive) sign but the parameter estimate is imprecise and does not

differ significantly from zero at the 95 percent confidence level. To

allow for a substitution between domestic and foreign currency we have also

included in the estimated equation the forward premium on foreign exchange

(in addition to the interest rate differential) and have experimented with

various restrictions. In all cases (probably due to the collinearity implied

by the interest parity theory) the coefficient on the forward premium did

not differ significantly from zero.

     To examine how well the estimated model tracks the (logarithm of) the

exchange rate we have simulated the model dynamically using the parameter

estimates of equation (12) and taking only the initial value of the:exchange

rate as given. This dynamic simulation is a relatively severe test of the

predictive ability of the model since, in principle, the errors are cumulative.

he results of the simulation are satisfactory. The squared correlation

coefficient between actual and imu1ated exchange rates is .879, the mean

error is .007, the root mean square error is .027, and the mean absolute
                                           8




error is .022. Theil's inequality coefficient12 (which ranges between zero

and one and which assumes the value zero in the case of perfect forecast)

is also extremely low ——   .009,   indicating the satisfactory quality of the

predictive ability of the model.


III. Concluding Remarks


     In this paper we applied the monetary approach to the exchange rate to

an analysis of the monthly Dollar/Pound exchange rate for the period preceding

the return of Britain to gold in 1925. The analytical framework emphasized

the relationship between relative prices and the exchange rate and weview

the precise estimate of this relationship as one of the key results of the

analysis. The estimated elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to

the relative price of traded goods was shown to be .415 which provides an

independent measure of the relative share of spending on non—traded goods.

This estimate is consistent with other estimates obtained in studies of

expenditure shares.

     The basic assumptions which underlie the analysis were the assumption

of money market equilibrium and the assumption of purchasing power parity.

                                                                 A regress ion

of the logarithm of the   exchange ate   on the logarithm of the terms of

trade (proxied by the ratio of wholesale price iudices) yields an elasticity

of .897 with a standard error of .267. Thus the monthly data seems to be

consistent with the assumption that, on average, purchasing power parity

held. The estimated standard error of the regression ——     1.9 percent per
month —— indicates, however, that (as expected in an application of purchasing

power parities to monthly data) this relationship was not precise.13 The main

source for some of the mixed results in the exchange rate equation, however,

seems to lie with the assumption that both money markets have been
                                       9




in continuous equilibria during each month of the sample period. A

useful extension would allow for a distinction between short—run and long—

run equilibria and would examine the dynamics of adjustment. it is note-

worthy, however, that adding a 1aggd dependent variable to the estimated

equation did not improve the estimates ad yieldedn insignificant

coefficient on the-lagged dependent variable; thus, the process of adjust-

ment seems to be much more complex.

exchange rate, and the United States and United Kingdom money supplies and

real incomes are taken directly from Frenkel and Clements (1978, Appendix B,

pp. 35—42).

Traded and Nontraded Prices

    Wage data were used as a proxy for nontraded goods prices in both

countries. For U.S. wages, actual average hourly earnings of all wage

earners were used. This series is from National Industrial Conference

Board (1928, pp. 161—162).

     Data for this series were not available from January 1922—June 1922.

We use the available data to interpolate the missing observations as follows.

First we regress the change in wages on a quadratic time trend. This yields

(standard errors are given in parentheses below each estimated parameter):


                                 =   -.016 + .OOl3t — .00002t2
                                     (.002) (.0002) (.000003)

                              R2 = .55


in which


              tw =
                     w    —
                              w1      the monthly change in the wage rate

               t =   2,   3, 4, ...    12,   20, 21, 22, ..   , 53 a monthly time trend.


This equation was estimated with data from January 1921 through May 1925 with

a gap of six months representing the missing data.

      Using the estimated coefficients we then interpolated values by setting

t = 13, 14, ..   , 19.        Finally, we calculated the predicted wage levels for

 the period as
                                           11




                                  t+i =     +
                                                Aw+1


in which t     runs from December 1921 through May 1922

          tw       is   the estimated monthly change in the wage rate

           w is the estimated wage level.

To initialize this recursive relationship, we use the actual wage in

December 1921.

     For nontraded goods prices in the United Kingdom an index of average

weekly earnings from Tinbergen (1934, pp. 105—6, column 29) was used. An

explanation of the data is available in Bowley (1929).

     The wage series for the U.S. and the U.K. are listed in Table A—i.

     Wholesale price indices were used as proxies for traded goods prices

in both countries. The data on wholesale prices are from Tinbergen (1934).

For the U.K. the wholesale price index is from pp. 105—6, column 21. The

primary source is the Board of Trade General Index. For the U.S. the whole-

sale price index is from pp. 210—11, column 28. The primary source is the

Bureau of Labor Statistics.

     The wholesale price indices for the U.S., denoted by p, and the U.K.,

denoted by p, are listed in Table A—2.


Rates of Interest

     The rates of interest are short term rates from Tinbergen (1934). For

the U.K. the rates are the day to day rate from pp. 105—6 column 17. These

rates are averages for the week ending by the 15th day of the month. For

the U.S. the rates are the call loan renewal from pp. 210—11 column 25.

These rates are averages of daily rates obtained from the New York Sun.

     The rates of interest series for the U.S. (denoted by i) and the U.K.
               *
(denoted by i ) are listed in Table A—3.

assistance and to Rudiger Dornbusch and Hans Genberg for a useful discussion.

                                                     Frenkel (1976), Frenkel and
1. See, for example, Dornbusch (1976a, 1976b),

Clements (1978), Kouri (1976), Nussa (1976), Bilson (1978) and the various

studies in Frenkel and Johnson (1978).


 2. For a discussion of the choice of the proper price index relevant for the

parity condition see Frenkel (1978).        In the presence of tariffs the

 formulation in (7) should be modified in an obvious manner.       If domestic and

 foreign traded goods are not the same, equation (7) would be modified to

              =   AS   where A denotes the terms of trade ——   the relative price
 become

 of imported goods in terms of exported goods; in (7) the implicit value of

 A is unity. In a manner that is familiar from the pure theory of international
                                                           incomes as well as on
 trade the value of A depends on domestic and foreign

 the various measures of commercial policies.


 3. The formulation of the demands for money in (9)—(lO) assumes that

 domestic bonds are the only relevant alternative to domestic money while

  foreign bonds are the only relevant substitute for foreign money and thus

  that the appropriate measures of the alternative cost of holding domestic
                                                     and foreign rates of interest.
  and foreign monies are respectively, domestic
                                                of substitution could be broader
  In principle the spectrum of the margins
                                    16




including the substitution of foreign bonds and foreign exchange for domestic

money. In that case the demand for domestic money would also include the

foreigh rate of interest and the forward premium on foreign exchange.   For

an elaboration see Frenkel and Clements (1978), Frenkel (1979) and Abel,

et.al. (1979).


4. The inference concerning the effect of a rise in income on the exchange

rate does not allow for the possibility that the rise in income may affect

the terms of trade X and thereby affect the exchange rate. The net effect

would depend on whether growth is neutral or biased towards one of the

commodities, as well as on the relationship between the magnitudes of the

various price elasticities (which determine the change in the terms of trade)

and the income elasticity of the demand for money. Another factor that is

ignored in the present formulation is the phenomenon of currency substitution

according to which a rise in income affects the demand for both monies with

the net result depending on the relative intensities of the two monies in

the portfolios of domestic and foreign asset—holders; see Frenkel and

Clements (1978).


 5. This description of the dependence of the exchange rate on the various

 right hand side variables should be interpreted with some care since in a

 fundamental sense these variables are determined jointly with the exchange

 rate. As a practical matter, however, outputs and the relative prices are

 determined to a large extent by real factors that are exogenous with respect

 to the exchange rate. The issue of simultaneity is potentially more serious

 with respect to the relationship between the rates of interest and the exchange

 rate. Likewise, the discussion did not distinguish whether the rise in the

 rate of interest is due to a rise in the real rate or due to a rise in
                                     17




inflationary expectations. It seems that the predicted positive association

between i and S is more likely to occur in cases where changes in the rate

of interest are dominated by changes in inflationary expectations, the

extreme case of which is of course the case of a hyperinflation; see

Frenkel (1976). In the empirical section we deal with the simultaneity

issue by employing in a two—stage least squares estimation procedure. The

exchange rate determinants in equation (11) were derived explicitly from

the previous equations characterizing the monetary model. It should be

noted, however, that the resulting determinants of exchange rate (money

supplies, incomes, relative prices and rates of interest) would also be

included in the typical "final" equation of alternative models of exchange

rate determination.


6. For a recent computation of the relative price of traded to non—traded

goods see Goldstein and Officer (1977).


7. We also tried proxying N by the average hourly earnings of skilled

males and none of the results reported below were materially affected.


8. The values of the various F statistics relevant for testing the

restrictions were all below the critical value at a conventional confidence

level. Testing the restriction that c =      a* yields F = .097.        Given that

  =    we tested whether 8     8* with the resulting F = 2.785.          The joint

 restriction that 8 = 8* and that n =     n* yields   F =   1.564.   For test procedures

 see Theil (1971, Sec. 3.7).

 9. To allow for endogeneity of relative prices and interest rate differential

we have also estimated equation (11) using two—stage least squares estimation

 procedure and employing Fair's method; the instruments were lagged values
                                           18




of the dependent and independent variables and a constant. There was no

significant change in the estimates.


10. For the U.S. we used           while for the U.K. the available monthly series

do not include totaldeposits and thus we used deposits of the London

Clearing Banks. These banks accounted for, on average, 78% of total deposits

in the U.K. during the interwar years; see liowson (1975, p. 146).


11. In addition the results might be due to the poor quality of the income

series which is proxied for the U.S. by an index of volume of manufactured

output and for the U.K. is proxied by an interpolated index of industrial

production.


12. Theilts inequality coefficient U measures the quality of forecasts.

Denoting the series of predictions and outcomes by P. and A1, respectively,

U is

          U =(P. -
                               A.)/i IP           +f   A]
and as can be seen the coefficient is bounded between zero and one and when

A. =     U    =   0;   see Theil (1961).


 13. The estimate of the purchasing power parity used two_stage—least—squares

 estimation following Fair's method. The instruments were lagged values of

 the dependent variables, a constant, time and time squared. For similar

 inferences concerning purchasing power parity see Krugman (1978).
