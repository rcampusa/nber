This paper studies the effect of changes in economic conditions on crime. We exploit the 1990s
trade liberalization in Brazil as a natural experiment generating exogenous shocks to local
economies. We document that regions exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a temporary
increase in crime following liberalization. Next, we investigate through what channels the trade-
induced economic shocks may have affected crime. We show that the shocks had significant
effects on potential determinants of crime, such as labor market conditions, public goods
provision, and income inequality. We propose a novel framework exploiting the distinct dynamic
responses of these variables to obtain bounds on the effect of labor market conditions on crime.
Our results indicate that this channel accounts for 75 to 93 percent of the effect of the trade-
induced shocks on crime.

1 Introduction
   In the wake of the Great Recession, there were renewed concerns that the severe

economic crisis could fuel a resurgence in crime (see Colvi, 2009, for example).      These

concerns echoed ideas dating back to the Great Depression of the 1930s and recent discus-

sions about the relationship between economic crises, more broadly, and crime (Fishback

et al., 2010; UNODC, 2012). The literature on economic cycles, labor market conditions,

and crime has recurrently investigated these issues, but identication challenges remain

open (e.g. Cook and Zarkin, 1985; Raphael and Winter-Ebmer, 2001; Finklea, 2011). De-

spite its relevance in the public debate and important welfare implications, there is no

general agreement regarding the eect of economic shocks on criminal activity, and even

less about the mechanisms through which these eects may play out.

   This paper sheds light on the eect of economic conditions on crime by exploiting local

economic shocks brought about by the Brazilian trade liberalization episode.        Between

1990 and 1995, Brazil implemented a large-scale unilateral trade liberalization that had

heterogeneous eects on local economies across the country. Regions initially specialized

in industries exposed to larger tari  cuts experienced deteriorations in labor market

conditions relative to the national average (Kovak, 2013; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2015b).

Brazil's trade liberalization had a unique feature: it was close to a once-and-for-all event,

with tari s being reduced between 1990 and 1995, and remaining approximately constant

afterwards. This allows us to empirically characterize the dynamic response of crime rates

to the trade-induced regional economic shocks. It also allows us to explore the timing of

the responses of potential mechanisms and to assess their relevance in explaining the

observed response of crime.

   The Brazilian context is particularly appealing because it is characterized by high

incidence of crime. In 2012, the United Nations Oce on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)

ranked Brazil as the number one country worldwide in absolute number of homicides,

with over 50,000 occurrences per year, and 18th in homicide rates, with 25.2 homicides

per 100,000 inhabitants. The Economist magazine recently compiled a list of the world's 50

most violent metropolises (cities with populations of 250,000 or more), and 32 of them are

located in the country.
                          1 Brazil also shares many common features with other countries in

Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the UNODC, among the 20 most violent

countries in the world, 14 are located in the region.     These countries have in common

as well many other socioeconomic characteristics, such as poor labor market conditions,

ineective educational systems, and high levels of inequality. One could therefore expect

economic shocks to have more severe eects on crime, with potentially larger welfare

implications, in such settings.

    Our empirical strategy investigates how crime rates evolved in each local economy as

liberalization took place, tracing out its eects over the medium- and long-run horizons.

In order to do so, we construct a measure of trade-induced shocks to local economies based

on changes in sector-specic taris and on the initial sectoral composition of employment

in each region, using the methodology proposed by Topalova (2010) and rationalized and

rened by Kovak (2013). We refer to these trade-induced shocks as regional tari changes

throughout the rest of the paper.         We measure crime using homicide data compiled by

the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which are the only crime data that can be consistently

compared across regions of the country for extended periods of time.
                                                                                 2

    We start by analyzing the direct eect of regional tari changes on crime. Our reduced-

form results indicate that regions facing larger trade-induced shocks experienced relative

increases in crime rates starting in 1995, immediately after the trade reform was complete,

and continued experiencing relatively higher crime growth for the following eight years.

Before 1995 and after 2003, there is no statistically signicant eect of the trade reform

on crime.    Our placebo exercises show that region-specic trends in crime before the

reform were uncorrelated with the (future) trade-induced shocks. This pattern conrms

that our results are capturing causal eects of the trade-induced shocks on crime. The

baseline specication indicates that a region facing a reduction in taris of 0.1 log point

(corresponding to a movement from the 90th to the 10th percentile of regional tari

changes) experienced a relative increase in its crime rate of 0.38 log point (46 percent)

ve years after liberalization was complete.

    Having established the direct eect of these local economic shocks on crime, we move

to analyze through which mechanisms these eects may have played out.                     We focus on

three sets of factors that have been linked to crime and violence by the existing literature:

(i) labor market conditions such as employment rates and earnings (Raphael and Winter-

Ebmer, 2001; Gould et al., 2002; Lin, 2008; FougÃ¨re et al., 2009); (ii) public goods provision

(Levitt, 1997; Schargrodsky and di Tella, 2004; Jacob and Lefgren, 2003; Lochner and

Moretti, 2004; Foley, 2011); and (iii) mental health (stress or depression) and inequality

(Fajnzylber et al., 2002; Bourguignon et al., 2003; Card and Dahl, 2011; Fazel et al., 2015).

    First, we show that regions specialized in industries exposed to larger reductions in

taris experienced a deterioration in labor market conditions (employment and earnings)

relative to the national average in the medium run (1991-2000), followed by a partial

recovery in the long run (1991-2010). The dynamic prole of this labor market response


   2
     Section 3 and Appendix A provide evidence that homicide rates are a good proxy for the overall
incidence of crime in Brazil. In addition, in the context of developing countries where underreporting is
prevalent and non-random, data on homicides provide less biased measures of the changes in crime and
violence (Soares, 2004).


                                                   2
closely mirrors that observed for crime rates.
                                                     3 Next, we show that the initial deteriora-

tion in labor market conditions was accompanied by other signs of contraction in economic

activity, including plant closure, reduced formal wage bill, and reduced government rev-

enues.   These dimensions are relevant because they directly aect a local government's

tax base and therefore may hinder its ability to provide public goods, which may aect

crime.   Indeed, we nd that regions more exposed to tari reductions also experienced

relative declines in government spending and in public safety personnel, and increases in

share of youth (14 to 18 years old) out of school. However, these impacts persisted and

were amplied in the long run, in contrast with the recovery observed in labor market

conditions as well as in crime rates. Our results also show that there were no signicant

eects on suicide rates, indicating that mental health and depression do not seem to have

played an important role in the response of crime we document.              This is an important

result, given that we measure criminal activity using homicide rates.           Finally, we show

that inequality followed a similar path to that observed for the provision of public goods:

more exposure to foreign competition was associated with increases in inequality in the

medium run, which were amplied in the long run.

    The eect of trade shocks on crime follows the same dynamic pattern as the eect on

labor market conditions, and both are very dierent from the dynamic responses observed

for public goods provision and inequality. This suggests that the labor market channel is

essential to understand how local crime rates responded to this shock. We formalize this

argument using an empirical framework in which we assume a stable long-run relationship

between crime and its determinants, but the response of these determinants to the one-

time trade shock may evolve over time (as it is the case). Next, we argue that, by imposing

theoretical sign restrictions on the eects of these determinants, one cannot reproduce the

observed dynamic eects of trade shocks on crime without attributing a major role to labor

market variables, in particular to the employment rate.

    Based on this framework, we develop a strategy to estimate bounds for the eect of

labor market conditions on crime.        Our methodological innovation shows that one can

exploit the distinct dynamic eects of a single shock to achieve partial identication. The

preferred estimates from our baseline specication lead to lower and upper bounds for

the elasticity of crime with respect to the employment rate of, respectively, -5.6 and -4.5,

both statistically signicant. These imply that if a region experiences a 10-year decline in

its employment rate of one standard deviation (0.07 log point), the crime rate would be

expected to increase between 0.32 and 0.39 log point (37 and 48 percent). This is a large

economic eect: it represents an increase equivalent to half a standard deviation of the


   3
    Consistent with previous ndings of Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015b), the long-run recovery in em-
ployment reects increases in informal employment, while formal employment never recovers.

distribution of changes in crime rates across regions between 1991 and 2000. These bounds

also indicate that labor market conditions account for 75 to 93 percent of the medium-run

eect of the trade-induced economic shocks on crime and constitute the main mechanism

through which liberalization aected crime.

    According to our framework and theoretical restrictions, the long-run recovery in crime

rates in harder hit locations was driven by the recovery in employment rates. In earlier

work, Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015b) nd that the long-run recovery in employment

rates in harder hit locations is entirely driven by an expansion of the informal sector 

employment in the formal sector never recovers. Therefore, informal employment seems to

have been able to keep individuals away from crime. This result suggests that enforcement

of labor regulations that tend to reduce informality but increase unemployment may

exacerbate the response of crime to economic downturns.

    This paper contributes to the literature in three dimensions. First, we provide credible

estimates of the eect of economic shocks on criminal activity and make progress in

understanding the mechanisms behind this eect. Second, we contribute to a recent but

growing literature stressing adjustment costs to trade shocks beyond those associated

with the labor market.
                           4   The fact that crime has an important externality dimension

adds particular interest to this point, since it means that the socioeconomic implications

of trade shocks go beyond the costs and benets incurred by the individuals directly

aected by them. Finally, the paper contributes to the literature on the eects of labor

market conditions on crime (Raphael and Winter-Ebmer, 2001; Gould et al., 2002; Lin,

2008; FougÃ¨re et al., 2009). In contrast to the Bartik shocks typically used as local labor

demand shifters in this literature, we know precisely the source of the shock (changes in

import taris), providing a more transparent source of exogenous variation.
                                                                                        5 Our results

suggest that these Bartik shocks are unlikely to satisfy the exclusion restriction required

by an instrumental variables estimator. The combination of our natural experiment with

our empirical strategy allows us to make progress relative to the previous literature and

to provide bounds on the eect of local labor market conditions on crime. This is only

possible because the shock captures an event that is discrete in time and permanent,

which allows us to exploit the evolution of its eects over time.

    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a background

of the 1990s trade liberalization in Brazil and of its documented eect on local labor

      For example, recent studies have estimated the eects of trade shocks on crime (Iyer and Topalova,
2014; Che and Xu, 2016; Deiana, 2016), the provision of public goods (Feler and Senses, 2016), health
and mortality (McManus and Schaur, 2016; Pierce and Schott, 2016), household structure (Autor et al.,
2015) and political outcomes (Dippel et al., 2015; Autor et al., 2016; Che et al., 2016).

      Bartik (1991) predicts changes in local labor demand based on national changes in industry-specic
employment and wages and on each region's initial industrial structure. This procedure is widely used in
labor economics to construct instruments for shifts in local labor demand.

4 presents our empirical strategy and the results related to the eect of the trade-induced

regional shocks on crime. Section 5 sheds light on the mechanisms behind the relationship

between the trade shocks and crime. Section 6 relates our paper to the literature on labor

market conditions and crime. Finally, Section 7 closes the paper with a broader discussion

2 Trade Liberalization and Local Economic Shocks in Brazil
2.1 The Brazilian Trade Liberalization
    Starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Brazil undertook a major unilateral trade

liberalization process which was fully implemented between 1990 and 1995.                    The trade

reform broke with nearly one hundred years of very high barriers to trade, which were

part of a deliberate import substitution policy. Nominal taris were not only high, but also

did not represent the de facto protection faced by industries, since there was a complex

and non-transparent structure of additional regulations. There were 42 special regimes

allowing tari reductions or exemptions, tari redundancies, and widespread use of non-

tari barriers (quotas, lists of banned products, red tape), as well as various additional

taxes (Kume et al., 2003). During the 1988-1989 period, tari redundancy, special regimes,

and additional taxes were partially eliminated.            This constituted a rst move toward

a more transparent system, where taris actually reected the structure of protection.

However, up to that point, there was no signicant change in the level of protection faced

by Brazilian producers (Kume et al., 2003).

    Trade liberalization eectively started in March 1990, when the newly elected president

unexpectedly eliminated non-tari barriers (e.g.           suspended import licenses and special

customs regime), often immediately replacing them with higher import taris in a process

known as tarication (taricaÃ§Ã£o, see de Carvalho, Jr., 1992). Although this change left

the eective protection system unaltered, it left taris as the main trade policy instrument.

Thus, starting in 1990, taris accurately reected the level of protection faced by Brazilian

rms across industries.      Consequently, the tari reductions observed between 1990 and

1995 provide a good measure of the extent and depth of the trade liberalization episode.
                                                                                                       6

Nominal tari cuts were very large in some industries and the average tari fell from

30.5 percent in 1990 to 12.8 percent in 1995.

      Changes in taris after 1995 were trivial compared to the changes that occurred between 1990 and
1995. See discussion in Appendix B.
    7
      We focus on changes in output taris to construct our measure of trade-induced local labor demand
shocks (or regional tari changes), to be formally dened in the next Section. An alternative would be to
use eective rates of protection, which include information on both input and output taris, measuring


                                                   5
change in sectoral prices induced by changes in taris (we plot the change in the log of one

plus taris in the gure, since this is the measure of tari changes used in our empirical

analysis).
             8 Importantly, there was ample variation in tari cuts across sectors, which will

be essential to our identication strategy. The tari data we use throughout this paper

are provided by Kume et al. (2003), and have been extensively used in the literature on

trade and labor markets in Brazil.

    Finally, tari cuts were almost perfectly correlated with pre-liberalization tari levels

(correlation coecient of -0.90), as sectors with initially higher taris experienced larger

subsequent reductions. This led not only to a reduction in the average tari, but also to

a homogenization of taris: the standard deviation of taris fell from 14.9 percent to 7.4

percent over the period. Baseline taris reected the level of protection dened decades

earlier (in 1957, see Kume et al., 2003), so this pattern lessens concerns regarding the

political economy of tari reduction, as sectoral and regional idiosyncrasies seem to be

almost entirely absent (see Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2003; Pavcnik et al., 2004; Goldberg

and Pavcnik, 2007, for discussions).                                                                                                                    We revisit this point when performing robustness


the eect of the entire tari structure on value added per unit of output in each industry. At the level
of aggregation used in this paper, the nest possible level that makes the industry classication of Kume
et al. (2003)'s taris compatible with the 1991 Demographic Census, 1990-1995 changes in input taris are
almost perfectly correlated with changes in output taris. Consequently, regional tari changes computed
using changes in output taris and using changes in eective rates of protection are also almost perfectly
correlated (the correlation is greater than 0.99 when we use the eective rates of protection calculated
by Kume et al. (2003)). Conducting the analysis using changes in output taris or eective rates of
protection has little to no eect on any of the results of this paper.

2.2 Trade-Induced Local Economic Shocks
   Our measure of local economic shocks follows the empirical literature on regional labor

market eects of foreign competition, which exploits the fact that regions within a country

often specialize in the production of dierent goods. In addition to dierent specialization

patterns of production across space, trade shocks aect industries in varying degrees.

Therefore, the interaction between sector-specic trade shocks and sectoral composition

at the regional level provides a measure of trade-induced shocks to local labor demand.

For example, taris in Apparel fell from 51.1 percent to 19.8 percent between 1990 and

1995, whereas taris in Agriculture increased from 5.9 percent to 7.4 percent over the

same period. In the presence of substantial barriers to mobility across regions, we would

expect that economic conditions would have deteriorated more in regions more specialized

in harder-hit sectors.

   Although the idea above was initially introduced by Topalova (2010), Kovak (2013)

formalized and rened it in the context of a specic-factors model.                        We follow Kovak

(2013) and dene our local economic shock as the Regional Tari Change in region                         r,
which eectively measures by how much trade liberalization aected labor demand in the

region.   RT Cr     is the average tari change faced by region          r,   weighted by the importance

of each sector in regional employment. Formally:


                                           X
                                RT Cr =          Ïri â log (1 + Ïi ) ,   with

                                                        Ïi
                                             Ïri =     P Î»rj   ,
                                                          Ïj
                                                      jâT

where   Ïi   is the tari on industry i,   Î»ri   is the initial share of region    r   workers employed in

industry i,    Ïi   equals one minus the wage bill share of industry i, and            T   denotes the set of

all tradable industries (manufacturing, agriculture and mining). One of the advantages of

the treatment in Kovak (2013) is that it explicitly shows how to incorporate non-tradable

sectors into the analysis.       Because non-tradable output must be consumed within the

region where it is produced, non-tradable prices move together with prices of locally-

produced tradable goods. Therefore, the magnitude of the trade-induced regional shock

depends only on how the local tradable sector is aected (see Kovak, 2013, for further

discussion and details).

3 Data
3.1 Local Economies
    We conduct our analysis at the micro-region level, which is a grouping of economically

integrated contiguous municipalities with similar geographic and productive characteris-

tics. Micro-regions closely parallel the notion of local economies and have been widely used

as the units of analysis in the literature on the local labor market eects of trade liberaliza-

tion in Brazil (Kovak, 2013; Costa et al., 2015; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2015a,b; Hirata

and Soares, 2015).
                     9 Although the Brazilian Statistical Agency IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro

de Geograa e EstatÃ­stica ) periodically constructs mappings between municipalities and

micro-regions, we adapt these mappings given that municipalities change boundaries and

are created and extinguished over time. Therefore, we aggregate municipalities to obtain

minimally comparable areas (Reis et al., 2008) and construct micro-regions that are con-

sistently identiable from 1980 to 2010. This process leads to a set of 411 local economies,

as in Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015a) and Costa et al. (2015).
                                                                             10 Table 1 provides de-

scriptive statistics at the micro-region level for the main variables used in our empirical

analysis. The respective data sources are discussed in the following sections.



3.2 Crime
    We use homicide rates computed from mortality records as a proxy for the overall

incidence of crime. These records come from DATASUS (Departamento de InformÃ¡tica

do Sistema Ãnico de SaÃºde ), an administrative dataset from the Ministry of Health that

contains detailed information on deaths by external causes classied according to the

International Statistical Classication of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).
                                                                                                       11

We use annual data aggregated to the micro-region level from 1980 to 2010.
                                                                                          12

    Both the homicide rate and the total number of homicides have increased substantially


   9
      A potential concern in this context would be commuting across micro-regions. But note that only
3.2 and 4.6 percent of workers lived and worked in dierent micro-regions in, respectively, 2000 and 2010.
   10
      The micro-regions we use in this paper are slightly more aggregated versions than the ones in Kovak
(2013) and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015b) who use minimally comparable areas over shorter periods
(1991 to 2000 and 1991 to 2010, respectively). As in these other papers, we drop the region containing
the free trade zone of Manaus, since it was exempt from taris and unaected by the tari changes that
occurred during the 1990s trade liberalization.
   11
      The ICD is published by the World Health Organization. It changed in 1996, but the series remain
comparable. From 1980 through 1995, we use the ICD-9 (categories E960-E969) and from 1996 through
2010 we use the ICD-10 (categories X85-Y09).
   12
      Since our econometric specications make use of changes in logs of crime rates, we add one to the
number of homicides in each region to avoid sample selection issues that would arise from dropping regions
with no reported homicides in at least one year. We obtain nearly identical results when we do not add
one to the number of homicides in each region. We also obtain very similar results if our measure of
homicides in region r and year t is given by an average of homicides between years t â 1 and t. In that
case, only four regions are excluded from the regressions due to zeros.


                                                    8
over the past 30 years in Brazil, with the homicide rate in 2010 being more than 2.5 times

higher than in 1980, while the total number of homicides increased ve-fold, from around

10,000 to 50,000 deaths per year. These numbers put Brazil in the rst place worldwide

in terms of number of homicides and in 18th place in terms of homicide rates (UNODC,

2013). The dispersion of homicide rates across micro-regions is also high: the 10th and

90th percentiles of the distribution corresponded to, respectively, 2.5 and 30 in 1991, and

2.9 and 34 in 2000.

    In Figure 2, Panel (a), we show how log-changes in crime rates between 1991 and 2000

(â91â00   log (CRr ))   are distributed across local economies. Since we will be contrasting

changes in the log of local crime rates to regional tari changes (RT Cr ), Figure 2 also

presents the distribution of     RT Cr   across micro-regions (Panel (b)). It shows that there

is a large degree of heterogeneity in changes in homicide rates and trade-induced shocks

across regions.

    One potential concern with the use of homicides to represent the overall incidence of

crime is that less extreme forms of violence are typically more prevalent.                 In addition,

economic crimes might seem more adequate categories to analyze the response of crime to

deteriorations in economic conditions. Unfortunately, in the case of Brazil, police records

are not compiled systematically in a comparable way at the municipality (or micro-region)

level. Even for the very few states that do provide statistics at more disaggregate levels,

the available series start only in the early 2000s, many years after the trade liberalization

period and, therefore, are not suitable for our analysis.             For these reasons, homicides

recorded by the health system are the only type of crime that can be followed over extended

periods of time and across all regions of the country. Homicides are also considered more

reliable crime statistics in the context of developing countries, where underreporting of

less serious oenses tends to be non-random and widespread (Soares, 2004).

    Nevertheless, we explicitly address this concern using data from the states of SÃ£o

Paulo and Minas Gerais for the period between 2001 and 2011. These are the two most

populous states in Brazil, comprising 32 percent of the total population, and they provide

disaggregated police compiled statistics since the early 2000s for certain types of crime.

Appendix A presents correlations between levels and changes in crime rates in 5-year

windows between 2001 and 2011 for SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais, for four types of crime:

homicides recorded by the health system (our dependent variable), homicides recorded

by the police, violent crimes against the person (excluding homicides), and violent prop-

erty crimes.
              13   We focus on violent crimes since these are supposed to suer less from


  13
     Violent property crimes refer to robberies in both states. Violent crimes against the person refer to
rape in SÃ£o Paulo and to rape, assaults, and attempted homicides in Minas Gerais. The data are provided
by the statistical agencies of the two states (FundaÃ§Ã£o SEADE for SÃ£o Paulo and FundaÃ§Ã£o JoÃ£o Pinheiro
for Minas Gerais).


                                                    9
underreporting bias. Our measure of homicides is highly correlated, both in levels and in

(5-year) changes, to police-recorded homicides, to property crimes, and to crimes against

the person. This pattern is similar if we consider 1- or 10-year intervals as well (Tables

A.2 and A.3), or if we condition on time and micro-region xed eects (Tables A.4 and

A.5). At the level of micro-regions in Brazil, homicide rates seem indeed to be a good

proxy for the overall incidence of crime.

    The strong correlations between homicides and other types of crime reect the fact that

property crime and drug tracking in Brazil are usually undertaken by armed individuals,

and homicides sometimes arise as collateral damage of these activities. Violence is also

typically used as a way to settle disputes among agents operating in illegal markets and

among common criminals (Chimeli and Soares, 2016). Even though there are no ocial

statistics on the motivations behind homicides in Brazil, available ethnographic evidence

suggest that at least 40 percent of homicides in urban areas  and possibly much more

 are likely to be linked to typical economic crimes (e.g. robberies) and to illegal drug

tracking (Lima, 2000; Sapori et al., 2012).



3.3 Other Variables
    We use four waves of the Brazilian Demographic Census covering thirty years (1980

2010) to compute several variables of interest.           First, we use the Census to construct

the two main labor market outcomes at the individual level, namely, total labor market

earnings and employment status (employed or not employed).                  We also use individual-

level data to estimate per capita household income inequality and socio-demographic

characteristics (education, age, and urban location) when necessary. In addition, we use

the Census data to estimate the number of workers employed in occupations related to

public safety in each region. These consist of jobs in the civil and military police as well

as security guards. Appendix C explains in further detail other treatments we apply to

some variables extracted from the Census.

    We obtain annual spending and revenue for local government from the Ministry of

Finance (MinistÃ©rio da Fazenda  Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional ).
                                                                              14 Finally, we use the

RAIS data set (Registro Anual de InformaÃ§Ãµes Sociais ) to compute the number of formal

establishments and the formal wage bill for each micro-region. RAIS is an administrative

data set collected by the Ministry of Labor covering the universe of formal rms and

workers. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our main variables at the micro-region

level.



  14
      The data goes back to 1985 but it is often unreliable, partly because of measurement error due to
hyperination and frequent missing information. For this reason we focus on data after Brazil stabilized
its currency, that is, from 1994 onwards.

     middle school or less and are 18 years old or more; the share of public safety personnel corresponds to the fraction of the population working
     in public safety jobs (military and civil police, security guards); high school dropouts corresponds to the share of 1418 year old children who
     are not in school; the formal wage bill for each region sums all December formal labor earnings of each year (and annualizes it multiplying by

4 Local Trade Shocks and Crime Rates
    This section investigates if the local economic shocks brought about by the Brazilian

trade liberalization translated into changes in crime rates.           Given that the trade shock

we exploit is discrete in time and permanent, we follow the methodology proposed by

Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015b) and empirically describe the evolution of the response

of crime to regional tari changes. In Section 5, we exploit the dynamic response of crime

to help distinguishing the channels through which these eects propagated.



4.1 Medium- and Long-Run Eects
    A unique feature of Brazil's trade liberalization is that it was close to a once-and-for-all

event: taris were reduced between 1990 and 1995, but remained approximately constant

afterwards.     This allows us to empirically characterize the dynamic response of crime

rates to the trade-induced regional economic shocks. We use the following specication

to compare the evolution of crime rates in regions facing larger tari reductions to those

in regions facing smaller tari declines:



                       log (CRr,t ) â log (CRr,1991 ) = Î¾t + Î¸t RT Cr + r,t ,                     (1)


where   CRr,t   is the crime rate in region     r   at time   t > 1991.15   In all specications we

cluster standard errors at the meso-region level to account for potential spatial correlation

in outcomes across neighboring regions.
                                             16 , 17

    Table 2 presents estimates from equation (1) analyzing the medium-run eect,                Î¸b2000 ,
of the trade-induced local shocks on crime.              We start in column 1 with a specication

that corresponds to a univariate regression relating log-changes in local homicide rates to

regional tari changes, without additional controls and without weighting observations.

There is a signicant negative relationship between changes in homicide rates and regional

tari changes, indicating that regions that faced larger exposure to foreign competition

(more negative    RT Cr )   also experienced increases in crime rates relative to the national

average. In column 2, we follow most of the literature on crime and health and weight

the same specication from column 1 by the average population between 1991 and 2000,

with little noticeable change in the results.
                                                    18

    In column 3, we add state xed eects to the specication from column 2 (27 xed

eects, corresponding to 26 states plus the federal district), to account for state-level

  15
      We use 1991, instead of 1990, as the starting point because the former was a Census year. In the
next section, we use Census data to analyze the response of the potential mechanisms to the trade shock
and we want these two sets of results to be directly comparable. This choice is inconsequential for the
results we report.
   16
      Meso-regions are groupings of micro-regions and are dened by the Brazilian Statistical Agency
IBGE. Note that we also need to aggregate a few IBGE meso-regions to make them consistent over the

                                                                 19 , 20 The magnitude of the coecient

increases by more than 50 percent and remains strongly signicant. This indicates that

some of the states that faced greater exposure to foreign competition following liberaliza-

tion also displayed other time varying characteristics that contributed to reduce crime,

initially biasing the coecient toward zero.

    In columns 4 and 5 we estimate the same specication from column 3, but controlling

for log-changes in local homicide rates between 1980 and 1991. This specication addresses

concerns about pre-existing trends in region-specic crime rates that could be correlated

with (future) trade-induced local shocks.              In column 4 we include this variable as an

additional control and estimate the equation by OLS. A potential problem with this

procedure is that the log of 1991 crime rates appears both in the right and left hand side of

the estimating equation, potentially introducing a mechanical bias and contaminating all

of the remaining coecients. We address this problem in column 5, where we instrument

pre-existing trends    â80â91 log (CRr ) with log           Total Homicidesr,1980 . In either case, there is
very little change in the coecient of interest, indicating that the estimated relationship

       In practice, we estimate equation (1) year by year.

       In the health literature, the realized mortality rate from a certain condition is often seen as an
estimator for the underlying mortality probability. The variance of this estimator is inversely proportional
to population size (see, for example, Deschenes and Moretti, 2009 and Burgess et al., 2014).
    19
       By constitutional mandate, several policies and institutions in Brazil are decentralized to state gov-
ernments (for example, public security, and part of the justice system, and of health and educational
policies). Therefore, controlling for state xed eects accounts for these unobserved policies, which are
likely to be correlated with local economic conditions.
    20
       By adding state xed eects, we exploit variation in RT Cr across micro-regions within states.

between changes in crime rates and regional tari changes is not driven by pre-existing

trends.

   The eect of regional tari changes on crime rates is considerable. Moving a region

from the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile of the distribution of regional tari changes

means a change in       RT Cr   equivalent to -0.1 log point. Column 3 of Table 2 predicts that

this movement would be accompanied by an increase in crime rates of 0.38 log point,

or 46 percent.     To put this eect into perspective, note that the standard deviation of

â91â00 log (CRr ) across regions is of 0.7 log point, so an increase in crime rates of 0.38 log
point is equivalent to an increase of approximately half a standard deviation in decadal

changes in log crime rates.

   Table 3 reproduces the same exercises from Table 2, but focuses on the long-run eect

of regional tari changes,       Î¸b2010 .   As opposed to the results in Table 2, columns 1 and

2 indicate a positive and statistically signicant relationship between the log-changes in

crime rates and regional tari changes. However, once we control for state xed eects

(columns 3 to 5), the coecients become negative, much smaller in magnitude than the

medium-run coecients, and not statistically signicant. As before, this changing pattern

in the long-run coecient indicates that states experiencing more negative shocks also

experienced other changes that tended to reduce crime. Once we control for common state

characteristics, there is no noticeable relationship between log-changes in crime rates and

regional tari changes over the 1991-2010 interval.

   One important concern with our estimates is that the               RT Cr    shocks may be correlated



                                                    15
with pre-existing trends in the outcome of interest.             For this reason, Tables 2 and 3

included pre-existing trends in log crime rates as an additional control to rule out that the

estimated eects were driven by a (coincidental) correlation between pre-existing trends

and (future) regional tari changes. The results show that pre-trends have no eect on our

estimates of interest, indicating that pre-existing trends are not likely to be a challenge to

our identication strategy. Table 4 corroborates this conclusion and shows that regional

tari changes are uncorrelated with pre-trends by directly regressing pre-liberalization

changes in crime on (future) trade shocks. In all specications, the coecients are small

in magnitude, with opposite signs to those from Table 2, and not statistically signicant.

   It is important to emphasize that the estimation of           Î¸t   in equation (1) can only reveal

relative eects of Brazil's trade liberalization on crime. This is a well-known limitation of

reduced-form estimates in the presence of important general equilibrium eects, which is a

common feature of all trade and local labor markets literature. These general equilibrium

eects, common to all units, will be absorbed in the intercept             Î¾t .   Therefore, we cannot

make statements about the total eect of the trade reform on the national crime level

without imposing restrictive theoretical assumptions. A full structural model quantifying

absolute eects of trade on crime is out of the scope of this paper and is suggested as

future work on the topic. Nevertheless, the variation we explore reveals the relationship

between local economic shocks and crime rates by comparing regions with dierent degrees

of exposure to the trade shock.




                                                  16
4.2 Dynamic Eects
       The previous section documented that the trade-induced local shocks had a strong

eect on crime rates, but that the eect was temporary.             Regions that were hit harder

by liberalization experienced relative increases in crime rates in the medium run (1991 to

2000), but these increases vanished in the long run (1991 to 2010). Here, we conrm this

pattern by plotting the yearly evolution of the eect of the trade shocks on crime (Î¸
                                                                                    bt for
t = 1992, ..., 2010)   in Figure 3. Given that we view liberalization approximately as a one-

time permanent shock that unfolded between 1990 and 1995, we interpret the evolution of

Î¸bt   as the empirical dynamic response of crime rates to the local shocks       RT Cr .   The points

in the gure for 2000 and 2010 correspond to the       RT Cr coecients in columns (3) of Tables
2 and 3. The circular blue markers in Figure 3 show that harder-hit regions experienced

gradual increases in crime relative to the national average over the years immediately

following the end of trade liberalization, but these increases eventually receded.               Note

that we present coecient estimates for 1992-94, but these should be interpreted with

care, as liberalization was still an ongoing process during these intermediate years.
                                                                                               21

       Figure 3 also shows a series of pre-liberalization coecients, in which the dependent

variable is the change in log crime rates between 1980 and the year listed on the x-

axis, and the independent variable is        RT Cr .   None of these coecients is statistically

signicant, corroborating the conclusion that pre-existing trends in regional crime rates

were uncorrelated with the shocks induced by trade liberalization.

       Together, the results from this section indicate that the liberalization-induced eco-

nomic shocks had a strong causal eect on crime rates over the short and medium runs,

but that this eect vanished in the long run. We now investigate through what channels

these local economic shocks aected crime.




      21
     However, the tari cuts were almost fully implemented by 1993, so these early coecients are still
informative regarding liberalization's short-run eects. When regressing RT Cr on an alternate version
measuring tari changes from 1990-93, the R2 is 0.93.

Each point reects an individual regression coecient, Î¸bt following (1), where the dependent variable is
the change in regional log crime rates and the independent variable is the regional tari change (RT Cr ).
Note that RT Cr always reects tari changes from 1990-1995. For blue circles, the changes are from
1991 to the year listed on the x-axis. For red triangles, the changes are from 1980 to the year listed. All
regressions include state xed eects. Negative estimates imply larger crime increases in regions facing
larger tari reductions. Vertical bars indicate that liberalization began in 1991 and was complete by 1995.

5 How Did the Trade Shocks Aect Crime?
5.1 Potential Mechanisms
      An established literature shows that regions exposed to increased foreign competi-

tion tend to experience deteriorations in labor market conditions (Autor et al., 2013;

Kovak, 2013; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2015b). The link between labor market conditions

(employment and earnings) and crime has also been extensively explored (Raphael and

Winter-Ebmer, 2001; Gould et al., 2002; Lin, 2008; FougÃ¨re et al., 2009). Therefore, labor

market conditions constitute a natural channel through which increased foreign compe-

tition may have aected crime rates. Nevertheless, local shocks leading to reductions in

labor demand can also aect crime in other ways. Negative shocks to local economic ac-

tivity can reduce government revenues and, consequently, impact the provision of public




                                                              18
goods, which can directly aect crime rates.
                                                    22 Finally, poor labor market conditions can

also aect crime indirectly, through increased inequality or deteriorated mental health due

to stress or depression (Fajnzylber et al., 2002; Bourguignon et al., 2003; Card and Dahl,

2011; Fazel et al., 2015). The latter can be important in our setting because we are using

homicides to measure crime rates.

    In this section, we examine how liberalization aected variables belonging to these

three sets of determinants and discuss their relative importance in explaining the reduced-

form response of crime rates to the local trade shocks. Specically, we estimate equations

similar to (1), but use variables capturing these various channels as dependent variables,

instead of crime rates.      All left hand side variables are transformed using the natural

logarithm, so estimated responses can be interpreted as elasticities with respect to regional

tari changes.
                23

    Panel A in Table 5 presents the results for the eect of regional tari changes on labor

market earnings in columns 1 and 2 and on employment rates in columns 3 and 4, for the

1991-2000 and the 1991-2010 periods, respectively.
                                                           24 The results show that regions facing

greater exposure to foreign competition after the liberalization episode (more negative

RT Cr )   experienced relative reductions in earnings in the medium run (2000), followed by

a timid recovery in the long run (2010). The point estimate of the impact on earnings is

reduced by 10 percent and loses precision between 2000 and 2010, although the coecients

are not statistically dierent. In turn, the eect on employment rates is temporary, being

large and signicant in 2000 but vanishing in 2010.             The point estimates indicate that

a change in regional taris of -0.1 log point would lead to a 0.064 log-point reduction

in the employment rate in 2000, with the eect vanishing in 2010.                  The stronger eect

of liberalization on the labor market in 2000 when compared to 2010 mirrors the prole

found in the previous section for the response of local crime to regional tari changes.

    Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015b) show that the long-run recovery in employment rates

experienced by harder-hit regions reects relative increases in informal employment, while

formal employment keeps falling. They also emphasize that the eects of liberalization on

local formal sector earnings is permanent and gradually magnied over time. However,

overall local earnings (including formal and informal workers) partially recover in the

long run, as we corroborate with the evidence presented here (despite small dierences in

specications).
                 25

    In Panel B of Table 5, we consider other economic consequences of the local tari

  22
      For example, there is ample evidence on the role of police presence, schooling, and welfare payments
in preventing crime (Levitt, 1997; Schargrodsky and di Tella, 2004; Jacob and Lefgren, 2003; Lochner and
Moretti, 2004; Foley, 2011).
   23
      Remember that regional tari changes are measured in terms of log points.
   24
      Changes in our regional employment and earnings variables are net of composition, so that changes
in these variables reect changes in regional labor market conditions for observationally equivalent indi-

      Although results are consistent across papers, note that there are small dierences in specications
between the results shown in Table 5 and the results discussed by Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015b) such
as how observations are weighted or the exact denition of labor earnings.

capita). In the medium run (columns 1, 3, and 5), we observe eects analogous to those

seen in the labor market: regions facing greater exposure to foreign competition experience

relative reductions in government revenue, in the number of formal establishments, and

in the formal wage bill.   However, the long-run eects are very dierent: while overall

labor market eects tend to dissipate, the impacts on these economic activity indicators

are permanent and amplied over time.        For example, a change in regional taris of -

0.1 log point would lead to a reduction of 0.15 log point in government revenues in the

medium run, and 0.23 in the long run. These results are also consistent with Dix-Carneiro

and Kovak (2015b), who document that formal employment and the number of formal

establishments gradually declines in adversely aected regions relative to the national

average.

   These ndings are relevant because they speak to the local government's ability to

provide public goods. Panel C in Table 5 investigates this point and shows that the long-

run contraction in economic activity in the formal sector was followed by a reduction in

the provision of public goods. Government spending (per capita), the number of workers

employed in jobs related to public safety (as a fraction of the population), and the share

of youth aged 14-18 out of school (high-school dropouts) experience relative deteriorations

in regions facing larger tari shocks. As in Panel B, these eects increase substantially

between 2000 and 2010. For example, in response to a change in regional taris of -0.1

log point, the number of public safety personnel (per capita) is reduced by 0.094 log-point

between 1991 and 2000, and by 0.15 between 1991 and 2010.            It is worth noting that

rather than thinking of these three variables as independent factors potentially determin-

ing crime, we consider them as dierent manifestations of a single phenomenon taking

place during this period: the reduced capacity of the state to provide public goods due to

reduced government revenues.

   The last set of variables we analyze is related to other indirect channels through

which deteriorations in labor market conditions (caused by the trade shocks) may have

aected crime.    Panel D in Table 5 looks at the responses of inequality (measured by

the Gini coecient for per capita household income) and suicide rates to the local trade

shocks.    Regarding suicides, results are not statistically signicant and point estimates

do not indicate deteriorations in mental health as a result of adverse economic shocks (if

anything, larger exposure to the shock is associated with a lower suicide rate, although

not signicantly).   However, we nd patterns for the response of inequality similar to

those documented for the economic outcomes in Panels B and C. Regions facing greater

exposure to foreign competition also experience relative increases in inequality, which are

enhanced in the long run: a -0.1 change in   RT Cr   is associated with increases of 0.025 log

point in the Gini coecient in the medium run and 0.075 in the long run.




                                             21
   Taken together, the results from Table 5 suggest that three sets of factors  labor mar-

ket conditions, public goods provision, and inequality  may have intermediated the eect

of trade shocks on crime.      Among these, only labor market conditions display dynamic

responses similar to those documented for crime rates. In harder-hit regions, employment

rates and earnings decline sharply in the medium run, concomitantly with the increase in

crime, and then recover  partially in the case of earnings and fully for employment rates

 as crime also recedes to the national trend. Public goods provision and inequality, quite

dierently, experience deteriorations that are magnied over time. Once these dynamics

are taken into account, it seems dicult to rationalize the response of crime to the regional

tari shocks without resorting to the labor market as a key intervening mechanism. We

formalize this argument in the next section.



5.2 Separating Mechanisms
   The previous section showed that the       RT Cr   shocks are signicantly associated with

a host of potential mechanisms that could have intermediated the eect of trade liberal-

ization on crime. Here, we propose a framework that attempts to shed light on the role

of these mechanisms in explaining the eects we documented in Section 4. We argue that

(1) by assuming a stable long-run relationship between these variables and crime, (2) by

imposing theoretical sign restrictions on their eects on crime, and (3) by exploiting the

distinct dynamic responses of these variables to    RT Cr , we can conclude that a substantial
part of the eect of   RT Cr   on crime must have been materialized through labor market

conditions, especially employment rates.



5.2.1 Empirical Framework
   Informed by the literature on the socio-economic determinants of crime and in light

of the evidence from Table 5, we consider three broad categories of mechanisms through

which liberalization may have aected crime: labor market conditions (earnings and em-

ployment rates), provision of public goods (government spending, public safety personnel,

and high-school dropouts), and inequality. From now on, we assume that the           RT Cr   shock

could have aected local crime rates only through these mechanisms. More precisely, we

assume that there is a stable long-run relationship between crime and these variables,

described by the following equation:




    â log (CRr ) = Î² w â log (wr ) + Î² e â log (Pe,r ) + Î² g â log (GovSpr )                     (2)

                   +     Î² ps â log (P Sr ) + Î² h â log (HSDropr ) + Î² i â log (Ineqr ) + Î·r ,



                                               22
where   â    refers to long changes over time,      w    refers to labor market earnings,         Pe     to em-

ployment rates,         GovSp   to government spending,       PS     to public safety personnel,   HSDrop
to youth (14-18) out of school, which we call high-school dropouts, and                  Ineq   to per capita

household income inequality.           We also assume that           Cov(RT Cr , Î·r ) = 0,   that is,    RT Cr
aects crime only through the variables in the right hand side of equation (2).
                                                                                                  26

    We rely on equation (2) to dissect the mechanisms behind the medium- and long-run

eects of    RT Cr      on crime.    First, note that we can decompose the medium- and long-

run changes in crime into a projection onto             RT Cr   and a residual orthogonal to           RT Cr .27
To save on notation, let period 1 denote 1991-2000 and period 2 denote 1991-2010. By

projecting medium- and long-run changes in crime onto                   RT Cr ,    we can always write:



                                    â1 log (CRr ) = Î¸1 RT Cr + Îµr,1
                                    â2 log (CRr ) = Î¸2 RT Cr + Îµr,2

where   Î¸1   and   Î¸2   are projection coecients, and       Cov(RT Cr , Îµr,1 ) = Cov(RT Cr , Îµr,2 ) = 0
by construction.
                 28 In fact, these are the equations that we estimated in Tables 2 and 3,

when we eectively projected changes in crime onto                RT Cr    using Ordinary Least Squares.

If the eect of the local trade shocks on crime is intermediated by other variables, such

as the ones in the right hand side of equation (2),             Î¸1   and   Î¸2   can be seen as reduced-form

eects of    RT Cr      on changes in crime in the medium and long run.

    Now consider the variables           Xr â {wr , Pe,r , GovSpr , P Sr , HSDropr , Ineqr }            on the

right hand side of equation (2).           Our Ordinary Least Squares regression coecients in

Table 5 are given by the coecients          bX
                                              1   and   bX
                                                         2   in the equations below:



                                    â1 log (Xr ) = bX          X
                                                    1 RT Cr + ur,1

                                    â2 log (Xr ) = bX          X
                                                    2 RT Cr + ur,2


where   Cov(RT Cr , uX                    X
                     r,1 ) = Cov(RT Cr , ur,2 ) = 0          by construction.

    Substituting the relationship for each of the             X      variables of interest in equation (2)




   26
      We can also think of this relationship as a more parsimonious specication relating crime only to the
three broad categories mentioned before: labor market conditions, public good provision, and inequality.
From this perspective, the variables listed in equation (2) would be alternative proxies for these channels
linking economic shocks to crime.
   27
      In general, for any two variables z and x, we can always express z as a function of x and a residual
orthogonal to x: z = Î±x + u, where Î± = E(zx)/E(x2 ) and, by construction, Cov(x, u) = 0 (we omit the
constant for clarity).
   28
      We omit the constant and other controls such as state xed eects for clarity of exposition.

      In words, if we have a stable and linear relationship between crime and its underlying

determinants, the vector               Î¸ giving the medium- and long-run reduced-form eects of RT Cr
on crime must be given by a linear combination of the vectors describing the reduced-form

eects of   RT Cr          on each of the determinants of crime (where the weights are given by the

parameters        Î² j ).    Without additional assumptions, this observation is not of much help

and simply reects that we cannot identify the                           Î² 's    solely based on medium- and long-run

responses to the           RT Cr      shocks. In this case, we can estimate the                              Î¸'s   and the   b's,   but we

cannot identify the           Î² 's.    However, if we are able to impose theoretical restrictions on the

Î²   coecients from equation (2), expression (3) may be valuable in shedding light on the

relevance of some of the factors under consideration. We follow this direction in Section

5.2.2.

      Equation (3) highlights the limits to identication in our setting if we do not resort

to additional assumptions.                 However, it also highlights the power of exploiting distinct

dynamic eects of a single shock to achieve the identication of multiple coecients.

The general message is that with enough observations over time and distinct dynamic

responses of the right hand side variables to the shock, full identication could in principle

be achieved. To be specic, suppose we had seven data points instead of just three (1991,

2000 and 2010). In that case, it might have been possible to achieve full identication

with this method, provided a full rank condition was met (meaning that the dynamic

responses of the right hand side variables in equation (2) were suciently heterogeneous).

We would have a six-dimensional                       Î¸   vector in the left hand side and six- dimensional                             b
vectors in the right hand side, that is, six equations with six unknowns.



                                                                 24
5.2.2 Theoretical Restrictions and Bounds on the Eect of Labor Market
      Conditions on Crime
    The classical theoretical formulation of the decision to participate in illegal activities

developed by Ehrlich (1973) predicts that better opportunities in the legal market, higher

probability of apprehension (police presence), and lower inequality reduce participation

into crime.
              29 An increase in the number of high school drop-outs should increase crime

due to reduced incapacitation and worsened future labor market opportunities, as formally

analyzed by Lochner (2011). Finally, increases in government spending indicate improved

provision of public goods and are likely to be associated with greater police presence and

better schools, and, consequently, to reductions in crime. All of these relationships are

supported by the available empirical evidence on the eects of police (Levitt, 1997; Schar-

grodsky and di Tella, 2004), schooling (Jacob and Lefgren, 2003; Lochner and Moretti,

2004), inequality (Fajnzylber et al., 2002; Bourguignon et al., 2003), and labor market

conditions (Raphael and Winter-Ebmer, 2001; Gould et al., 2002) on crime.

    Therefore, the theoretical and empirical literature suggests that                                          Î²w â¤ 0       (growing

wages do not lead to increases in crime), Î²
                                            e                  â¤0   (growing employment does not lead to

increases in crime), Î²
                       g         â¤ 0   (growing government expenditures do not lead to increases

in crime),   Î² ps â¤ 0     (expanding police forces do not lead to increases in crime),                                        Î²h â¥ 0
(more high school dropouts does not lead to reductions in crime), and                                              Î²i â¥ 0   (growing

inequality does not lead to reductions in crime). Note that these sign restrictions are in

the form of weak inequalities, so that each of these eects are allowed to be zero. Let us

assume that these restrictions are valid and, for ease of exposition, dene                                         Î²ej = |Î² j |,   with

  29
     In this model, the eect of the labor market on the intensive margin of crime is more ambiguous.
Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that there is much more variation in crime at the extensive than at
the intensive margin (Blumstein and Visher, 1986).

    Two immediate conclusions arise from an inspection of Figure 4.                                                            First, note that

according to our theoretical restrictions, the documented dynamic responses of crime

to liberalization cannot be                solely   explained by the eect of liberalization on earnings,

public goods provision and inequality.

restrictions, we must have               Î²ee > 0 or Î² e < 0.       It is also important to note that although our

framework and theoretical sign restrictions predict that

the empirical analysis does not make such an assumption. Consequently, the conguration

shown in Figure 4 is consistent with the theoretical sign restrictions we impose.

    A closer inspection of Figure 4 reveals that we can impose bounds on                                                       Î²ee       by expressing

   Appendix E shows that equation (6) is                         algebraically equivalent              to a Two-Stage

Least Squares (2SLS) estimator relating changes in employment rates and earnings to

changes in crime rates. This 2SLS estimator is obtained stacking medium- and long-run

changes, and instruments are given by                    RT C Ã P eriod91â00              and   RT C Ã P eriod91â10 .30
Similarly, equation (7) is algebraically equivalent to an analogous 2SLS estimator relating

changes in employment rates and the share of high-school dropouts to changes in crime

rates.

   The interpretation of the bounds estimators as 2SLS estimators is informative. Sup-

pose we estimate a regression relating crime rates to employment rates and earnings by

2SLS, using         RT C Ã P eriod91â00       and      RT C Ã P eriod91â10            as instruments and ignoring

the rest of the potential channels in equation (2).                        In that case, according to the sign

restrictions we imposed in Section 5.2.1, we would obtain an                          upward biased estimate for
Î² e , as this 2SLS estimator converges to              Î²Ue   >   Î² e . On the other hand, suppose we estimate
a regression relating crime rates to employment rates and share of high-school dropouts

by 2SLS, using        RT C Ã P eriod91â00          and   RT C Ã P eriod91â10              as instruments and ignoring

would obtain a     downward biased estimate for Î² e ,         as this 2SLS estimator converges to

Î²Le < Î² e .
    Table 6 shows our estimates for the bounds on the eect of employment rates on crime.

According to our baseline specication  obtained using the vectors depicted in Figure

4  we obtain bounds between -5.6 (lower bound) and -3.3 (upper bound 1). Although

the upper bound estimate is economically signicant (we interpret magnitudes at the end

of this section), its standard error is very large so that we cannot reject that it is zero.

singular. This leads to large standard errors for both           Î²bUw   and   Î²bUe .   Essentially, this means

that employment rates and earnings responded very similarly to the trade shocks, so that

there is little room to distinguish whether the liberalization-induced labor market eects

on crime played out through earnings or employment rates.

               Notes: As noted in the text, upper and lower bounds are algebraically equiv-
              alent to 2SLS estimators. Standard errors are outcomes of 2SLS regressions
              relating crime rates to employment and earnings, public safety or high-school
              dropouts. All specications stack 1991-2000 and 1991-2010 changes and con-
              trol for state-period xed eects. Standard errors are clustered at the meso-
              region level.
               Additional notes: Upper bound 1 combines employment with earnings; Upper
              bound 2 combines employment with public safety; Lower bound combines
              employment with high-school dropouts. See text for details.

    In our discussion of Figure 4, we argued that employment rates must have non-zero

weight in explaining the dynamic response of crime to the trade shocks. Therefore, since

we cannot separate the eect of employment rates from the eect of earnings, we measure

labor market conditions (more broadly) solely with employment rates.                            We do so with

the understanding that the employment eects we measure are likely to capture both

employment rate eects as well as earnings eects. If we omit                     â log (wr )      from the right

hand side of equation (2), it is easy to see in Figure 4 that we can obtain a lower bound

a lower bound for             Î²ee   leads to an upper bound for                    Î²e.    Details are found in Appendix D.

In that case, the upper bound estimator for                            Î²e     is given by (upper bound 2):

With the understanding that if we exclude earnings from the right hand side of equation

(2) employment rates measure labor market conditions as a whole, we obtain bounds on

the eect of labor market conditions between -5.6 and -4.5 (see Table 6).

      Our baseline specications in Tables 2, 3 and 5 only use state-period xed eects as

controls. We conduct this same exercise by adding controls such as changes in the share

of young and unskilled males in the population (male individuals who are between 18 and

30 years old, and with less than eight years of education) and changes in the urbanization

rate (share of population living in urban settings). These demographic controls intend to

capture compositional changes in the population that can aect crime (see, for example,

Glaeser et al., 1996 and Levitt, 1999).                         The       Î¸
                                                                          b     and   b
                                                                                      b   estimates arising from these new

exercises are shown in Table F.1 in the Appendix. Figure F.1 shows that the conguration

of vectors that arises from this exercise is similar to the one in Figure 4, so that our method

still applies.

      Panel B of Table 6 shows the resulting bounds. We obtain bounds between -4.8 and

-4.3. Interestingly, in this case, we are able to separate the eect of employment rates from
                                                                              e             w

F.1).
                                             e
            In addition, the upper bound on Î² is very similar if we combine employment

rates with either earnings (upper bound 1) or public safety personnel (upper bound 2)

to compute it.           Nevertheless, we do not want to over emphasize this nding, and keep

measuring labor market conditions more broadly using employment rates, and omitting

earnings from equation (2).

      We now use the estimates of our benchmark specication in Panel A of Table 6 to

interpret the magnitude of the estimated eect of labor market conditions (measured

by employment rates) on crime.                     For example, if                 log (Pe )      is reduced by 0.07 log point

(the standard deviation of               â91â00 log (Pe )         across regions), the crime rate is expected to

increase between              â4.5 Ã â0.07 = 0.32            and       â5.6 Ã â0.07 = 0.39                   log point (37 and 48

percent). Alternatively, consider a region facing a                                RT Cr         shock of -0.1 log point, which

is the 90-10 gap in the distribution of                    RT Cr .        According to Table 5, this would lead to a



                                                                     30
reduction in the employment rate of 0.064 log-point in the medium run, relative to the

national average. In turn, Table 6 indicates that this would be associated with a relative

increase between         â4.5 Ã â0.064 = 0.29         and   â5.6 Ã â0.064 = 0.36    log point (33 to 43

percent) in crime rates ve years following the end of liberalization. Consequently, labor

market conditions account for 75 to 93 percent of the medium-run eect of the trade-

induced economic shocks on crime and constitute the main mechanism through which the

tari-induced shocks aected crime.

6 Relationship with the Literature on Labor Market Condi-
  tions and Crime
     As we mentioned throughout the paper, there is a large literature measuring the eect

of local unemployment rates on crime. This literature typically estimates this eect by

exploiting local labor demand shifters measured with Bartik shocks as instruments for

labor market conditions.          However, this literature has abstracted from other potential

mechanisms through which local labor demand shocks may aect crime  for example,

through changes in government spending, police forces or inequality. It is therefore natural

to ask: if we had assumed employment rates to be the                   sole   mechanism through which

trade shocks aected crime rates and applied a 2SLS estimator using the                   RT C   shocks

as instruments, mimicking the path this literature has followed, how would this estimate

compare with the bounds we obtained in Table 6?

     We perform this exercise adding one innovation.                Given that the   RT Cr   shocks had

distinct dynamic eects on many variables of interest, we can construct two instrumen-

tal variables and confront employment rates against each of the remaining channels in

equation (2), one by one. In other words, we can estimate regressions such as:



                          â log (CRr ) = Î² e â log (Pe,r ) + Î² X â log (Xr ) + Î·rX                  (9)


where    X â {w, GovSp, P S, HSDrop, Ineq}.                 For improved eciency, we stack 1991-2000

and 2000-2010 changes instead of 1991-2000 and 1991-2010 changes, otherwise the                     Î·rX
error terms would be automatically correlated across time as the latter periods overlap.

Since we cluster standard errors at the meso-region level, our standard errors are robust to

the correlation of errors across neighboring regions and over time. We employ 2SLS and



   31
    The total reduced-form eect of a RT Cr shock of -0.1 log point is to increase crime rates by
                                                                                       Î² e Ãbe

     Column 1 in Table 7 shows the 2SLS estimate of the eect of employment rates on

crime if we use       RT Cr Ã I(period = 1991 â 2000)          and    RT Cr Ã I(period = 2000 â 2010)        as

instruments. This specication is similar to what the previous literature on the topic has

adopted, except for the choice of specic instruments. In this case, we obtain an estimate

of -4.5. Therefore, in the context of our study, we obtain an estimate that is similar to the

upper bound for the eect of labor market conditions on crime. However, it goes without

saying that this provides no information on the size of the bias in other studies.

     Columns 2 to 6 in Table 7 sequentially confront employment rates against competing

mechanisms. Although this constitutes a step beyond what the literature on labor markets

and crime has typically considered, these regressions must still be interpreted with caution.

When we confront employment rates with public safety personnel, for example, we do not

impose sign restrictions on      Î²e   and   Î² ps   as we did in Section 5.2.2, but we cannot strictly

rule out that a combination of the remaining variables in equation (2) is an important

determinant of crime, therefore biasing our estimates. Nonetheless, the stability of the                Î²e
estimates in the sequential estimation of (9) for each competing mechanism gives us more

condence that, indeed, labor market conditions constituted an important mechanism

through which the trade shocks aected crime. The only instance where the estimate of

Î²e   is non-signicant is when we confront employment rates with earnings. In that case,

as we discussed, we cannot separate the eect of employment rates from the eect of

earnings, as they are aected by the      RT Cr     shocks in very similar ways over the medium

and long runs.      Table 8 reproduces the same exercises in Table 7, but also controls for

changes in demographic variables. We obtain very similar estimates.

7 Discussion
   This paper exploits the local economic shocks induced by the Brazilian trade liberaliza-

tion episode to provide credible estimates of the eect of economic conditions on criminal

activity. We take advantage of two key features of Brazil's liberalization to make progress

in understanding the mechanisms behind this eect: (i) the discreteness and persistence

of the shock; and (ii) its heterogeneous dynamic eects on the potential mechanisms be-

hind the response of crime rates. We provide a framework that exploits these elements to

argue that it is dicult to rationalize the observed response of crime to the trade shocks

without attributing a key role to labor market variables, in particular to the employment

rate.

   By linking trade-induced shocks to crime, this paper contributes to a growing literature

on the eects of trade beyond the labor market and documents a new dimension of adjust-

ment costs that may follow trade shocks. Analyses of these adjustment costs have typically

focused on frictions impeding or slowing the reallocation of resources needed to generate

production gains from trade (ArtuÃ§ et al., 2010; CoÂ³ar, 2013; Dix-Carneiro, 2014) or on

workers whose labor market trajectories are adversely aected by trade (Menezes-Filho

and Muendler, 2011; Autor et al., 2014; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2015b; Utar, 2015).

Since crime generates substantial externalities, our results add a relevant dimension to

these adjustment costs by showing that the consequences of trade shocks go beyond the

individuals directly aected by them.

   It is worthwhile to stress one important aspect of our approach. Most of the literature

on labor markets and crime resorts to some sort of regional economic shocks  such

as Bartik shocks  as a source of exogenous variation.       The evidence from Section 5

indicates that local economic shocks aecting the labor market are likely to be correlated

with other dimensions that may also be relevant determinants of crime rates (such as

public goods provision and inequality). This suggests that the instruments used in the

previous literature do not satisfy the exclusion restriction required by an IV estimator.

This is precisely why we explore the distinct dynamic responses of the various potential

mechanisms in order to be able to provide bounds for the causal eect of labor market

conditions on crime. In the context of our study, the traditional IV estimates of the eect

of labor market conditions on crime is very similar to what our methodology delivered as

an upper bound (lower bound for the     magnitude of the eect).
   We documented that regions facing greater exposure to foreign competition experi-

enced gradual increases in crime relative to the national average over the years immediately

following the trade liberalization, but that these increases in crime eventually receded.

Our analysis presents evidence that the recovery of the labor market in these harder-hit




                                            34
regions played a key role in reducing crime in the long run. Interestingly, Dix-Carneiro

and Kovak (2015b) show that the long-run recovery in employment rates was entirely due

to an expansion of the informal sector. In this context, informal employment seems to

have been enough to keep individuals away from crime. Enforcement of labor regulations

that tend to reduce informality but increase unemployment could therefore exacerbate the

response of crime to economic downturns. Analogously, the evidence we provide also high-

lights the importance of counter-cyclical policies, by improving labor market prospects,

as instruments to ght crime. The costs of economic downturns  or of low employability

in general  go beyond those faced by the individuals who directly suer from worsened

labor market opportunities. In such circumstances, there is a potential welfare enhancing

role for government interventions that are successful in improving labor market outcomes.

   Finally, we focus on a developing country with high levels of violence and document an

economically large response of homicide rates to local labor market conditions. There are a

few possible explanations for the large response of homicide rates that we estimate, which

contrast to largely zero eects on violent crime found in the previous literature (which

focused exclusively in developed countries with low crime rates). Our natural experiment

and empirical framework combined lead to a more transparent identication of the eect

of labor market conditions on crime than the empirical strategies that have been used

so far. In addition, we explore the context of a developing country with high incidence

of crime and poor labor market conditions, in sharp contrast to the developed country

context that has been the focus of previous research. The rst of these factors probably

allows us to more precisely estimate the response of crime to labor market outcomes, while

the second provides a setting where the response of crime is likely to be stronger. The

evidence suggests that the criminogenic eect of deteriorations in labor market conditions

is indeed more extreme and policy relevant in developing countries with poor labor market

conditions and high levels of violence.

A Homicide Rates as a Proxy for Overall Criminal Activity
   This section investigates to what extent local homicide rates constitute a good proxy
for overall criminal activity. We examine data from Minas Gerais and SÃ£o Paulo, the two
most populous states in Brazil, which account for 32 percent of Brazil's total population.
These constitute the very few Brazilian states publishing disaggregate crime data from
police-compiled statistics since the early 2000s at the municipality level. We have data for
four types of crime: homicides recorded by the health system (our dependent variable),
homicides recorded by the police, violent crimes against the person (excluding homicides),
and violent property crimes.   Violent property crimes refer to robberies in both states.
Violent crimes against the person refer to rape in SÃ£o Paulo and to rape, assaults, and
attempted homicides in Minas Gerais. The data are provided by the statistical agencies
of the two states (FundaÃ§Ã£o SEADE for SÃ£o Paulo and FundaÃ§Ã£o JoÃ£o Pinheiro for Minas
Gerais).
   We start by examining how the rates of dierent types of crime recorded by the police
correlate with the homicide rates used in our empirical analysis for a 5-year interval.
As Table A.1 shows, our measure of homicides is highly correlated, both in levels and
in changes, to police-recorded homicides, to property crimes, and to crimes against the
person.
   Table A.2 shows the results in log-levels for both SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais using
yearly data and 10-year intervals. Table A.3 shows correlations for log-changes for both
states and the same time intervals. Homicide rates measured by the police and the health
system are highly correlated, with a strongly signicant correlation that ranges from 0.84
to 0.92. Both measures of homicides are also strongly and signicantly correlated with
crimes against the person and property crimes, but particularly so with the latter. It is
worth noting that the correlations in Panel B of Table A.3 should be interpreted with
caution given the small number of observations used to generate them.
   Tables A.4 and A.5 relate our measure of homicide rates (from the health system) to
the rates of crimes against the person, property crimes and homicides measured by the
police. These regressions control for micro-region and year xed eects, so we focus on
how changes in our measure of criminal activity, relative to aggregate crime trends, relate
to changes in other measures of crime within regions. The rst three columns show results
in line with those from Tables A.1, A.2 and A.3. Even after we account for micro-region
xed eects and common trends in crime, homicide rates measured by the health system
are strongly correlated with homicides recorded by the police, crimes against the person,
and property crimes. Moreover, these correlations are stronger when we restrict attention
to longer time windows. Columns 4 and 5 progressively include the dierent measures of
crime rates on the right hand side.
   In sum, Table A.1 and the results presented in this section indicate that local homicide
rates measured by the health system (DATASUS) are indeed systematically correlated
with local overall crime rates recorded by the police.

B Tari Changes after 1995
   This paper treats the 1990-1995 changes in taris induced by the trade liberalization
as a once-and-for-all shock. Indeed, changes in taris after 1995 are trivial relative to the
changes that occurred between 1990 and 1995. This section provides evidence supporting
this claim.
   The data on taris used in the paper are from Kume et al. (2003). These data have
been extensively used by previous papers in the literature on trade and labor markets in
Brazil.
          32 However, these data only cover the period 1987-1998. In order to show how post-

liberalization tari changes relate to changes induced by the trade reform, we use data from
UNCTAD TRAINS, which cover the entire period from 1990 to 2010. Equipped with these
data, we compute regional tari changes using sectoral tari changes between 1990 and
1995 (RT Cr,90â95 ), 1990 and 2000 (RT Cr,90â00 ) and 1990 and 2010 (RT Cr,90â10 ). Table
B.1 shows that regional tari changes over longer horizons,           RT Cr,90â00   and     RT Cr,90â10 ,
are almost perfectly correlated with        RT Cr,90â95    (elasticities are all larger than 0.8 and
R-squared's are all larger than 0.92). This implies that changes in taris between 1990
and 1995 can indeed be considered as permanent without substantially aecting any of
our qualitative or quantitative results.

            RT Cr,90â10 uses changes in sectoral taris between 1990 and 2010. UNCTAD
            TRAINS taris at the product level were aggregated into 44 industries compati-
            ble with the 1991 Brazilian Demographic Census. Aggregation was performed using
            simple averages. These industry-level taris were then used in the calculation of
            RT Cr . Standard errors in parentheses.

C Data Procedures
C.1 Regional Employment and Earnings Net of Compositional Eects
      Changes in our regional employment and earnings variables are net of composition,
so that changes in these variables reect changes in regional labor market conditions for
observationally equivalent individuals and do not reect changes in composition.                            This
section describes how we use individual-level Census data to compute region-specic log
earnings and employment rates netting out compositional eects.
      We obtain region- and year-specic log-earnings by estimating the Mincer regression
below and saving the        Ï
                            brs   estimates:


                                         X
                                                w
                  log (wirs ) = Ïrs +          Î·ks I (Educi = k) + Î³sw I (F emalei = 1) +

                                   w
                                  Î´1s                 w
                                      (ageis â 18) + Î´2s (ageis â 18)2 + Îµw
                                                                          irs ,                              (10)


where  wirs represents total monthly labor market earnings for worker i in region r in year s,
I (Educi = k) is a dummy variable corresponding to years of schooling k , I (F emalei = 1)
is a dummy for gender, ageis indicates age, and Ïrs captures the average of the log of
                                                                                     w
monthly earnings net of composition in region r and time period s. Finally, Îµirs is an
error term. We use Ï brs as our measure of log-earnings in region r in year s.
      Region- and year-specic employment rates are obtained in a similar fashion, by esti-
mating the linear probability model below and saving the                     Ï
                                                                             brs   estimates:

                                        X
                                               e
                   Empirs = Ïrs +             Î·ks I (Educi = k) + Î³se I (F emalei = 1) +
                                         k
                                   e
                                  Î´1s                 e
                                      (ageis â 18) + Î´2s (ageis â 18)2 + Îµeirs ,                             (11)


where     Empirs     indicates if individual       i   in region   r   was employed in year     s, Ïrs   captures
the average probability of employment net of composition in region                       r   and time period   s,
and    Îµeirs is   an error term. We use      Ï
                                             brs   as our measure of the employment rate in region              r
in   year s.



C.2 Employment Rates
      The question in the Census questionnaire regarding work status changed between 1991
and 2000, remaining the same in 2010. In 1991 the question was "Have you worked in all or
part of the past 12 months?", while in 2000 and 2010 the question related to the surveys'
reference week. There is no widely used procedure to make these questions comparable,
so we adopt the following strategy to construct a comparable variable across Censuses'
waves.
      In 1991 we dene       Empirt = 1        if the individual answers yes to "Have you worked
in all or part of the previous 12 months?" and zero otherwise.                        For 2000 and 2010, we
dene     Empirt = 1     if: (a) the individual worked for pay in the reference week; or (b) the
individual had a job during the reference week, but for some reason did not work that
week; or (c) the individual helped (without pay) a household member in her job or was
an intern or apprentice; or (d) the individual helped (without pay) a household member
engaged in agricultural activities; or (e) the individual worked in agricultural activities to




                                                          47
supply food to household members; and                 Empirt = 0     otherwise. The answer "yes" to the
1991 question embeds all of the cases above.



D Derivation of Bounds for Î² e
Throughout this section, we will use the notation                Cone(v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n )   to denote the cone
spanned by vectors       v1, v2,   ... ,   vn,   which consists of all    positive linear combinations of
these vectors. In section 5.2.1, we obtained equation (4), which we reproduce below:

Assumption 4        âbw , bh < 0

Assumption 1 guarantees that a solution to equation (4) with                         e â¥ 0
                                                                                     Î²           exists.    Together
with Assumptions 2 and 3, it also guarantees that                  Î²ee > 0.    Given Assumptions 1, 2 and
3, Assumption 4 is not strictily necessary for us to be able to nd bounds for                          Î²ee ,   but it is
satised by the empirical counterparts and facilitates our derivation.

If earnings (â log (wr )) are excluded from equation (2), then we can obtain an alternative

us to make assumptions similar to 1-3, which essentially imply that the conguration of

With Assumptions 5 to 8 replacing Assumptions 1 to 4, we follow the same procedure
above to obtain the following upper bound for                      Î²e:

Which can be estimated with:

E Bounds Î²bUe and Î²bLe as 2SLS Estimators
    This section shows that equation (6) denes an estimator that is algebraically equiva-
lent to a 2SLS estimator where (1) the estimating equation stacks medium- and long-run
changes; and (2) instruments are given by                     RT C Ã P eriod91â00              and         RT C Ã P eriod91â10 .
Without loss of generality, we ignore exogenous covariates to simplify the exposition.
    Suppose we want to estimate the model below, where we stack medium-run changes
(â1 ) and long-run changes (â2 ) and employ 2SLS with                                    RT C Ã P eriod1                  and     RT C Ã
P eriod2   as instruments.         P eriod1       indicates if observations relate to medium-run changes
(1991-2000) and        P eriod2    indicates if observations relate to long-run changes (1991-2010).

similar to the one pictured in Figure 4 once we add demographic controls such as changes
in urbanization rates and changes in the fraction of the population who is young (18 to
30 years old), unskilled (eighth grade completed or less) and male. Table F.1 displays the
regression results, and Figure F.1 shows the conguration of these vectors, conrming that
the conguration of estimated vectors  controlling for demographic changes  is similar
to those in Figure 4.
