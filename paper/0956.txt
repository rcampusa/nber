      Valuing Pensions (Annuities) with Different Types of
     Inflation Protection in Total Compensation Comparisons


                             ABSTRACT




      Pensions   provided in the public sector are often indexed, while

pensions in the private sector typically are not. To conduct the total

compensation comparisons that ostensibly guide government pay policy,

one must value annuities which differ in their degree of inflation pro-

tection. This paper conducts this exercise from the viewpoint of modern

finance theory, and contrasts the results with those of a representative

government, the Government of Canada. The results suggest that govern-

ments may typically understate the value of indexed pensions and overstate

the value of pensions which receive incomplete inflation protection. A

contributing factor is the apparent belief that standardizing actuarial

assumptions is sufficient to ensure comparability, in spite of the fact

that risk is ignored and that interest rate and inflation assumptions are

typically not those of the market.

1. INTRODUCTION

       In both Canada and the United States, governments are ostensibly

guided in their pay policies by the principle that total compensation

in the public sector should be comparable to that in the private sector.

Typically, pensions provided in the public sector receive better inflation

protection. The pensions provided to federal government employees, for

example, are fully indexed to the price level, while full indexing is

quite rare in the private sector. If valid comparisons of total compensa-

tion are to be made, then fully indexed annuities as well as annuities

which receive incomplete inflation protection must be properly valued.

This problem is made difficult by the fact that fully indexed annuities

as well as those which receive incomplete inflation protection are not

sold in — and are thus not explicitly priced by —   the   capital market.

       This paper uses the principles of modern finance theory to value

five annuities which differ in their degree of inflation protection. Each

corresponds in a stylized way to current practice in Canada, and most are

relevant to the United States as well (Table 1). They are:       (1) a fully indexed

annuity; (2) an indexed annuity subject to a cap, either fixed (the maxi-

mum adjustment is limited to x percent per year) or floating (the adjust-

ment equals the inflation rate less     percent);    (3) an annuity which

receives cost—of—living adjustments based on pension fund earnings in

excess of an assumed interest rate;   (4) an annuity which is partially

 indexed and receives adjustments equal to z percent of the inflation rate;

 and (5) a nominal annuity. The paper contrasts the results suggested by

modern finance theory with those of a representative government, the

 Government of Canada. The analysis suggests that governments may typically
                                 2




understate the value of fully indexed annuities and   overstate   the value of

annuities which receive incomplete inflation protection. In part, this

is due to the mistaken belief that standardizing the assumptions used in

actuarial valuations is sufficient to ensure comparability. The fact that

actuarial valuations ignore risk and typically embody interest rate and

inflation assumptions which are not those of the market receives inadequate

attention.

       The paper is organized as follows. In the first section, the choice

of a discount rate for fully indexed annuities is discussed. The analysis

focuses on the problem of estimating the expected real rate of return on

the minimum variance portfolio. The second section reviews the problem

of valuing capped annuities. The third analyzes the problem of valuing

annuities receiving cost—of—living protection equal to pension fund earnings

in excess of an assumed interest rate, or by "excess" earnings. The analysis

focuses on the conditions under which these can be reduced to standard

variable annuities (and thus readily valued), as well as the complications

posed by the possible exclusion of unrealized gains and losses from the

measure of fund earnings. The fourth section analyzes the problem of

valuing partially—indexed annuities which receive adjustments equal to a

designated fraction of the inflation rate. The fifth section briefly reviews

the problem of valuing nominal annuities, and draws attention to the account-

ing veil implicit in most actuarial valuations. The total compensation

comparisons conducted by the Federal government of Canada are then reviewed,

in order to contrast the procedures used by a representative government

with those implied by modern finance theory. A suary section concludes

the paper.

2. FULLY INDEXED ANNUITIES

      The pensions provided to Federal government employees in both

Canada and the United States, and to employees of many other levels of

government as well, are fully indexed to the consumer price index. Since

fully indexed pensions are rare in the private sector,1 the proper valua-

tion of these annuities is essential if the total compensation of public

sector employees is to be properly compared to that of employees in the

private sector.

       In a world of no inflation, a life insurance company could perfectly

hedge an n—period, nominal (and hence real) annuity by holding a

portfolio of insured, n—period mortgages. The expected return on such a

portfolio would be the competitive rate at which such annuities would be

sold. If indexed mortgages were available in a world of uncertain inflation,

an analogous result would obtain since a life company could perfectly hedge

an n—period, fully indexed annuity by holding a porfolio of n—period, indexed

mortgages.
       In North America, (uncertain) inflation does exist and indexed

debt instruments are not available in the capital market. Prior studies

(Bodie (1976), Pesando and Rea (1977)) have shown that the real rate of

return on a diversified portfolio of common stocks is negatively correlated

with unanticipated inflation, as is the real rate of return on fixed—income

securities. To the extent that a life company is constrained by regulation

or by habit to hold a portfolio that consists of stocks and fixed—income

securities, the life company cannot create a portfolio which is devoid of

inflation risk. Thus the life company cannot perfectly hedge a fully indexed
                                 4




annuity. To minimize its underwriting risk, the best the life company
                                             minimum variance and thus the
can do is to hold that portfolio which has

most stable real return. The expected real return on this portfolio

would be the upper bound on the competitive interest rate at which a

fully indexed annuity would be sold, since shareholders of the life

company would have to be compensated for bearing the residual investment

risk.

        Data on the (pretax) real returns to 91—day Treasury bills,

long—term Government of Canada bonds, and common stocks for the period

1953—1980 are presented in Table 2. The annual real return on Treasury

bills averaged 0.82 percent, with a standard deviation of 2.02 percent.

 Common stocks are much riskier, with a mean real return of 7.97 percent

 and a standard deviation of 17.02 percent. The mean real return on long—

 term Canada bonds is actually negative, reflecting the impact of unantici-

 pated (permanent) inflation, and has a standard deviation of 7.60 percent.

 The real returns on bills, bonds and stocks are positively correlated,

 and all are negatively correlated with the rate of inflation. In the

 absence of short selling2, the minimum variance portfolio is a portfolio

 comprised exclusively of Treasury bills. This is the portfolio that a

 life company would hold if it wished to minimize its underwriting risk

 in issuing an n—period, fully indexed annuity.

         The expected real return on bills, or about one percent, is the

 upper bound on the competitive interest rate at which an n—period, indexed

 annuity would be sold in Canada. One percent is an upper bound because

 shareholders of the life company would have to be compensated for bearing
                                 5




the residual investment risk, since the real return on bills is not

constant. Note that this is the upper bound regardless of the portfolio

that the life company actually chooses to hold. If the life company

holds a portfolio of cotnon stocks to hedge the indexed annuity, the

higher expected real return is simply the compensation due shareholders

for assuming the additional investment risk. The fact that one percent

is an upper bound is also apparent if one considers the situation of an

individual who wished to provide his own retirement annuity. If he

wished to construct a variable annuity3 which provided the most stable stream

of real annuity payments, he would construct a variable annuity backed by

Treasury bills. The expected real return on this portfolio would be

about one percent, and the real stream of payments —   unlike   those of a

fully indexed annuity — would still be uncertain. If the individual were

sufficiently risk averse that he wished to purchase a fully indexed

annuity, he would have to compensate shareholders of the life company

for eliminating the residual investment risk. He would do so by accepting

a lower interest rate on the indexed annuity than the expected real

return on Treasury bills.

       Bodie (1980) reviews similar empirical evidence for the United

States and reaches a similar conclusion. The minimum variance portfolio

is a portfolio consisting (almost)4 exclusively of Treasury bills, and

the expected real return on this portfolio is close to zero. He concludes

that the competitive interest rate at which a life company would sell a

fully indexed annuity in the United States would not exceed zero percent.

       The interest rates at which n—period, indexed annuities would

be priced competitively In North American capital markets may appear rather
                                    6




low to many   observers.   In part, this result nay be viewed as a direct

cost of increased price level uncertainty. A life company must hedge

an n—period, indexed annuity by holding a one—period rather than an

n—period debt instrument. Notwithstanding this portfolio response, the

residual investment risk borne by the life company is positive and thus

exceeds that borne by the life company in a world where inflation uncertainty

is absent. Consider, for example, what would happen if indexed debt

instruments were bought and sold in North American capital markets.

Modern finance theory indicates that an n—period, index bond would be

priced to yield a higher expected real return than a one—period, index

bond (or an indexed Treasury bill) if real interest rate risk is non—

diversifiable. If so, a life company could hedge an n—period, indexed

annuity by holding n—period, index bonds (or, more precisely, n—period

index mortgages) and thus earn a higher expected real return than if it

were constrained to hold only indexed Treasury bills. In the absence of

a market for indexed debt instruments, the life company is effectively

forced to hold only bills if it wishes to issue an n—period, indexed

annuity and simultaneously minimize its risk exposure. The opportunity

to bear real interest rate risk by perfectly hedging an n—period indexed

annuity with an n—period, index mortgage is at present denied life companies

in North America, although this opportunity would clearly exist in a

world in which price level uncertainty was absent or in which indexed

debt instruments did exist. Index bonds have recently been issued by

the Government in the United Kingdom. Significantly, their market —

determined yields do rise with their terms to maturity,5 thus providing
evidence that real interest rate risk is indeed non—diversifiable.

3. ANNUITIES WHOSE INFLATION PROTECTION IS "CAPPED"

      There   are two ways that inflation protection may be capped. The

first, termed a fixed cap, limits the inflation adjustment to x percent

even if the change in the consumer price index exceeds that amount.    The

second, termed a floating cap, provides the annuitant with inflation pro-

tection equal to the change in the consumer price index less y percent.

The Province of Ontario, for example, limits the cost—of—living adjustments

to 8 percent even if the inflation rate exceeds that amount. Fixed caps

also exist in some private sector plans in Canada (Tomenson—Alexander

(1978)), and in both private and state retirement systems in the United

States (Myers (1978)). Anecdotal evidence suggests that at least some

firms in Canada follow a policy of allowing their retired workers to

absorb the impact of (say) the first 3 percent of any increase in the

consumer price index, and then make ad hoc adjustments to offset the

impact of inflation above this amount. In effect, they also provide

annuities subject to a floating cap.

       If one assumes that firms whose ad hoc adjustments are based on

the floating cap make such adjustments with certainty, it is easy to value

the annuities so protected. If the floating cap is the inflation rate less

z percent,    then the real value of the annuity will decline with certainty

at y percent per year.6 These payments must be discounted at the risk—

free real rate of interest (if) to yield a net discount rate of if

plus y. At present, there is no asset in the North American capital mar-

kets which provides a risk—free real rate of return. The expected real
                                         S




return on the minimum variance or bills portfolio does, however, place

an upper bound on i. Thus i is not likely to exceed one in Canada

and zero in the United States, so that an upper bound can readily be

placed on the net discount rate.

         If the inflation rate (Ti) were known with certainty, then the

valuation of an annuity subject to a fixed cap would be straightforward.

If the certain inflation rate is less than the cap (i.e. iT C x) ,            then

the real value of the annuity is constant and the relevant discount rate

is simply         If ii > x, then the real value of the annuity declines

with certainty at a rate equal to Tr—x. When this stream of payments is

discounted at the risk—free real rate of interest, the end result is a

net discount rate equal to (rr—x) plus

         If the inflation rate is uncertain, the valuation of an annuity

subject to a fixed cap is far more complicated. Let b0               be the real

value of the annuity payment at the beginning of the current period, let

      be the real value of the annuity payment at the beginning of the next

period, and let l be the realization of the inflation process during the

period. If l C x, then b1 = b0.                    If if1 > x, then b1 = b0
                                                                            *
                                                                                a+        <b0.
                                                                                (1-Hr P
 In   effect, the annuitant has claim to the certain real benefit

 and has sold a call option on the rate of inflation with a striking price

 equal to x. If C(if) is the relevant measure of risk for option pricing,

 then:

                       —              x, ci(if))                                 (1)
             b1 = b0       CALL(b0,

 The value of the call option is an increasing function of            aØf),     and a

 decreasing function of x. The important point of (1) is that the valuation
                                    9




of the capped annuity cannot be reduced to the choice of a single and

(approximately) unchanging discount rate. To value (1), one must know

the risk—free real rate of interest (in order to take the present value

of the certain real component of b1) and one must explicitly value the

indicated call option at the beginning of each period. The value of this

option is likely to exhibit considerable variation over time in view of

the substantial serial correlation in the inflation rate. Less formally,

if today's inflation rate is high, then tomorrow's inflation rate Is also

likely to be high. This result is an important input into any attempt to

value the capped annuity, and provides an intuitive explanation as to why

it cannot be assigned a unique and thus unchanging value.



4.   ANNUITIES WHOSE INFLATION PROTECTION IS FROM "E. F.SS' FUND EARNINGS

        The lack of formal provisions notwithstanding, most large        firms


in   Canada grant cost—of—living adjustments to     retired   plan members.   These

adjustments are apparently financed —     at   least in part — by pension fund

earnings In excess of the interest rate assumed in the plan's valuation.7

Indeed, future government initiatives are likely to formalize this use for

"excess" earnings (Ontario (1982)). Large firms        in the United States
typically   grant cost—of—living adjustments as well, although these are

 less generous and there is less evidence that they are linked to pension

 fund performance (Bankers Trust Company (1980)). Many observers, inc'uding

 Munnell (1982), have recommended that excess earnings be used by private

 pension   plans   in the United States to provide inflation protection.

         The   valuation of an annuity whose inflation protection is delivered
 through excess earnings is straightforward if the annuity can be shown to
 be equivalent to a standard variable annuity. Assume that the plan sponsor
 will lower the nominal value of the annuity payment if pension fund earnings
                                  10




fall short of the assumed interest rate, so that there is no nominal floor

on the annuity payment. Assume also that the plan sponsor will apply all

fund earnings in excess of the assumed interest rate to escalate the

annuity payment, even if this means that the real value of the payment

increases. If so, one can proceed as if two separate transactions occur.

First, the plan member receives a lump sum payment at the date of his

retirement equal to the promised pension benefit capitalized at the

plan's assumed interest rate. This first step establishes the assumed

interest rate as the correct discount rate to value the promised stream

of pension payments. Secondly, the plan member uses the lump sum pay-

ment to purchase a standard variable annuity, and the assumed interest

rate is used to set the initial annuity payment. This initial annuity

payment is then equal to the promised pension benefit, and rises or falls

as the nominal return on the supporting assets exceeds or falls short of

the assumed interest rate.8 Note that the assumed interest rate is the

correct discount rate independent of the assets actually held in the

pension fund.

         There are, however, two potential complications. The first occurs

if there is a floor and/or ceiling on the use of excess earnings. The

second occurs if a non—market measure of pension fund performance is

used   to define excess earnings.
         Consider, for simplicity, only the case in which there exists a
nominal floor on the annuity   payments.   This possibility is motivated by

the    stylized fact that the ad hoc adjustments provided by most firms tend
to   be permanent. Once a nominal pension has been increased, it is never

 reduced. If these enrichments are financed by excess earnings, the implica-

tion is that the plan sponsor absorbs the shortfall when pension fund
                                      11




earnings are less than the assumed interest rate. In effect, the plan

sponsor guarantees that the pension fund will never earn less than the

assumed interest rate in the excess earnings scheme. This is explicitly the

case in the widely—cited Rockefeller Foundation Plan in the United States,

which grants permanent cost—of—living increases equal to the average

prime interest rate for the year less 3 percent (Heaton (1980)).

       If the annuitant is provided with a variable annuity subject to a

nominal floor, the use of the assumed interest rate in the excess earnings

scheme to value the annuity will in general understate its value. In

effect, the pensioner receives a standard variable annuity plus a put

option on the nominal investment earnings of the pension fund with a

striking price equal to the assumed interest rate. If A0 is the lump

sum necessary to buy a standard variable annuity, RV is the plan's

assumed interest rate and a(R) the measure of the risk of the nominal

return that is relevant to option pricing, then the lump sum necessary

to buy this same annuity subject to a nominal floor is A such that:


                =        +                                         (2)
                    A0       PUT(A0, RV, 0(R))


If the assumed interest rate increases, then the put option becomes more

valuable since the probability increases that pension fund earnings will

fall short of this guaranteed rate. A similar result obtains if the

risk of the assets in the pension fund increases. The latter implies,

unlike the case of a standard variable annuity, that the value of the

annuity depends upon the assets in the pension fund. Unless the value

of the put option is zero, the use of the assumed interest rate in the

excess earnings scheme to value the annuities so protected will understate
                                12




their value. If the annuity provides for a single payment at the end of

the first period, then the value of this option will be zero if the pen-

sion fund holds only the risk—free nominal asset (bills) and if the bill

rate exceeds the plan's assumed interest rate. In the more relevant

multiperiod setting, the put option will have zero value only if there is

no probability in some future period that the bill rate will fall beneath

the assumed rate.

       If unrealized capital gains or losses are not included in the

measure of fund earnings, as is the explicit practice of the Teachers

Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) in the United States, then

intergenerational risk sharing is imposed on plan members. Suppose the

pension fund holds only long—term bonds. If long—term rates rise in

anticipation of future inflation, the resulting capital losses go

unrecorded. Excess earnings remain relatively stable, implying that the

real value of the annuity payments will decline in subsequent periods

when the inflation rate is higher. If it is known that unrecognized

capital losses exist on the date that an individual retires, then the

value of the annuity to him will be overstated, and conversely if unrecog-

nized capital gains are inherited. On average, however, the assumed

interest rate in the excess earnings scheme remains the correct dis-

count rate to be used in total compensation comparisons. So long as

participation is mandatory, so that retired plan members cannot game

againt the non—market measure of fund performance, the exclusion of

unrealized capital gains and losses does not complicate the valuation

problem.9

5. VALUING ANNUITIES WHICH ARE PARTIALLY INDEXED TO THE INFLATION RATE

      Private surveys often focus on the average degree of cost—of—

living protection provided by ad hoc adjustments as a summary measure

to be used in total compensation comparisons (Tomenson—Alexander (1978)).

For simplicity, it is useful to consider the problem of valuing an

annuity which receives adjustments equal to z percent of the inflation

rate)° The special cases where z equals zero (i.e. the annuity is

purely nominal) and where z equals 100 (i.e. the annuity is real) are

ruled out by assumption.

       If these adjustments are made with certainty, then the valuation

procedure is conceptually straightforward. First, one forecasts the

inflation rate (it*)   expected to prevail over the life of the annuity,
as well as specifying its risk characteristics. The real stream of

annuity payments is expected to decline at a rate equal to   (l_z)#iT*


percent per year. The appropriate interest rate to calculate the pre-

sent value of this stream of payments is the expected real return on that

efficient portfolio which generates a real income stream with the same

risk characteristics. This expected real return, plus (l_z)TT*, is

then the net discount rate to be used to value the indicated annuity.

       In practice, it is likely to prove difficult to obtain a precise

estimate of this net discount rate. In large part, this is due to the

necessity of specifying in advance the distribution of future rates of

inflation. In addition, the procedure as outlined invokes the strong

assumption that adjustments equal to z percent of the inflation rate

are made with certainty.    In view of the fact that firms have elected

not to incorporate this provision into their formal pension contracts,

but to proceed on an ad hoc basis, this assumption is clearly suspect.

6.   VALUING NOMINAL ANNUITIES WHICH RECEIVE NO INFLATION PROTECTION

       At   present, life companies in Canada sell life annuities to

individuals aged 65 at an interest rate of 14 percent. This is obviously

the correct discount rate to value a purely nominal stream of promised

pension benefits. In spite of the fact that pension benefits may be

purely nominal (i.e. the sponsoring firm may have no intention of provid-

ing cost—of—living adjustments), annuities due under the terms of pen-

sion plans in Canada are typically valued at interest rates which do not

exceed 7 percent (Pesando (1981)). If workers are rational, they pre-

sumably see through this accounting veil and value their accruing pension

benefits at prevailing annuity rates in order to make the appropriate wage

concessions. As discussed in the next section of this paper, however,

it appears likely that government officials use interest rates closer

to those assumed by actuaries than those prevailing in the capital market

to value nominal pension benefits.



7.   INFLATION PROTECTION ACCORDED PENSIONS AS AN INPUT INTO TOTAL COMPENSA-
     TION COMPARISONS: THEORY VERSUS PRACTICE

        It is instructive to contrast the valuations conducted by the

Government of Canada, which are probably typical, with those implied by

modern finance theory. To conduct total compensation comparisons, the

Government must value its fully indexed annuities relative to a composite

of those provided in the private sector.

        By combining a nominal interest rate assumption of 6½ percent with

an inflation rate assumption of 3 percent, the Government effectively uses

a discount rate of (approximately) 3½   percent   to value the fully indexed
                                 15




annuities due under the terms of its pension plan. As noted, the risk—free

real rate of interest in Canada is likely to be bounded above by one percent.

Abstracting from the possible political risk that indexing provisions might

be cut back or eliminated at some future date, the Government is clearly

understating the value of its fully indexed annuities.

       To value annuities which receive no inflation protection, the Govern—

merit uses its assumed nominal interest rate of 6½ percent. This is far

beneath the 14 percent at which life companies in Canada now sell life

annuities to those aged 65.

       To value annuities which receive inflation protection through excess

earnings, the Government uses the interest rate used to define excess earn-

ings. In the absence of floors or ceilings in the excess earnings scheme,

this is the correct procedure.

       To value annuities which are partially indexed, the Government first

postulates that adjustments in the private sector typically equal 50 per-

 cent of the inflation rate, and proceeds as if each firm made such adjust-

 ments with certainty. The Government then uses its assumed inflation rate

 of 3 percent to imply that inflation adjustments will equal 1½ percent per

 year. This annual rate of escalation of the annuity payments is then sub-

 tracted from the assumed nominal interest rate of 6½ percent to yield a

 net discount rate of 5 percent. At present, the nominal yield on long—

 term Canada bonds exceeds 15 percent, suggesting an implicit inflation

 forecast of at least 10 percent. This implies that the expected rate of

 decline in the real value of the partially indexed annuity is at least

 5 percent per year. Because the real value of these payments is uncertain,

 they must be discounted at a rate in excess of the risk—free rate. If
                                 16




a real interest rate of (say) 3 percent is appropriate, this would imply

a net discount rate of 8 percent, which considerably exceeds the 5 percent

used by the Government.

       Because the most visible plans in Canada which contain capped index-

ing provisions are in the public sector, the Federal government does not

appear to explicitly value them. The Province of Ontario, in what may be

a representative response, uses an assumed inflation rate which is less

than its 8 percent fixed cap to project its nominal annuity payments, and

then discounts them by an assumed nominal interest rate. In the 1976 valu-

ation (Ontario (1978)), the Province uses a nominal interest rate of 7.25

percent in conjunction with an inflation assumption of 5½ percent. By

implicitly treating these assumptions as certain, the Province implies

that its real annuity payments will be constant. If true, this would

require that they be discounted at the risk—free real rate of interest,

which is less than the real rate of (approximately) lz percent implied

by the inflation and nominal interest rate assumptions. Because

the inflation rate is uncertain, and thus the call option in (1)

has a positive value, it is not possible without more formal enquiry to

establish whether or not the capped annuities are indeed being undervalued.2

        To sum up, the Government of Canada employs procedures which under—

 state the value of indexed annuities and typically overstate the value of

 annuities which receive incomplete inflation protection. In part, this is

 due to excessive reliance on standard actuarial valuations, which ignore

 risk and typically use non—market interest rate and inflation assumptions.

 The fact that the same actuarial assumptions are used to value public and

 private sector plans, although touted by practitioners (Martel et. al.
                                 17




(1980), Carow (1981)), is largely irrelevant. Whatever their merits,

standard actuarial valuations do not provide a satisfactory basis for

calculating the value to employees of annuities which differ sharply in

their degree of inflation protection.

       Uncritical dependence on standard actuarial valuations is certainly

not unique to the Government of Canada. The Civil Service Retirement System

in the United States was valued in 1979 with an interest rate assumption

of 7 percent and an inflation rate assumption of 6 percent. These assump-

tions, which the Office of Personnel Management (1981) then used in its

total compensation comparisons, suggest that fully indexed annuities are

valued at a real interest rate of one percent.13 Although Bodie (1980)

argues that a real interest rate of zero may be more appropriate, this

discrepancy is clearly less important than its Canadian counterpart. Of

perhaps more consequence is the apparent use by the Office of Personnel

Management of the nominal interest rate assumption of 7 percent — based

on the assumed inflation rate of 6 percent —   to   value the nominal annuities

provided by most private sector plans. This 7 percent is considerably less

than the then prevailing 9 to 10 percent yield on long—term U.S. Govern-

ment bonds, and suggests that the value of these nominal annuities was

overstated. As in Canada, there is no evidence that the issue of infla-

tion uncertainty and its ramifications was addressed.

       Finally, because pension costs as a percent of payroll are signi—

ficant,14the potential scope for errors in these total compensation compari-

Sons Is large. The Government of Canada uses a real rate of 3½ percent to

value its fully indexed annuities, so that the present value of each dollar

of a 15—year annuity is calculated to be $11.52 .      At an interest rate of
                                  18



one percent, an upper bound on the risk—free real rate, this annuity would

cost $13.86 or 20.3 percent more. The present value of this annuity, when

treated as nominal and valued at the assumed interest rate of 6½ percent,

is $9.40.       At a market interest rate of 14 percent, this annuity would

sell for $6.14 or 53.1 percent less. Thus the Government understates the

value of the indexed annuity that it provides by 20 percent) while over-

stating the value of the nominal annuity provided in the private sector

by 53 percent.



8. CONCLUSIONS

       The procedures suggested by modern finance theory for valuing annuities

which differ in their degree of inflation protection are summarized in

Table 1. These are not the procedures used by the Federal government in

Canada, which are probably representative of those used by governments in

general. In Canada as well as in the United States, inflation protection

is typically far better in public than in private sector pension plans.

The analysis in this paper suggests that governments may typically under-

value pensions provided in the public sector, while overvaluing those

provided in the private sector. The net result is that total compensation

comparisons are seriously flawed. To the extent that these comparisons

guide pay policy in the public sector, and to the extent that total com-

pensation paid in the public sector is not disciplined by competitive

forces,15 total compensation in the public sector may be too high on

this account.

                                 FOOTNOTES




1.   In Canada in 1980, 98.3 percent of pension plans in the private

     sector (covering 95.1 percent of plan members) had no formal pro-

     visions to provide cost—of—living adjustments (Statistics Canada

     (1982)). Myers (1978) reports that automatic—adjustment provisions

     are also rare among private sector plans in the United States.

     The discussion in the text presumes, as appears to be the case, that

     nominal annuity payments will be reduced if the inflation rate is

     negative. If this is not the case, then the procedures discussed in

     the text will understate the value of "indexed" annuities so long

     as there is a non—zero probability of deflation in some subsequent

     period.

2. If short selling is permitted, the minimum variance portfolio is long

     on bills (108 percent), and short on both bonds (minus 7 percent) and

     stocks (minus one percent). The mean bond return reported in Table 2

     cannot be viewed as an equilibrium return, and a corresponding caveat

     is in order. In a portfolio consisting only of bills and stocks,

     minimum variance is obtained with a long position in bills (101 per-

     cent) and a short position in stocks (minus one percent).

 3. Let A0 be his initial capital. Let RV be the assumed interest

     rate. Then the base payment B0 of the N—period variable annuity is:


                   B0 =   RV[l   —   (l+RV)N]l   *
                                                     A0
                                                                        (Fl)


      If Rt is the realized nominal return in period t    on the under—

      lying portfolio, then the nominal benefit B paid in period t
                                       20




   (tl to N) is:

                   (l+R)
               =
                   (l+RV)
                            *
                                Eti                                  (F2)




4. Bodie (1980) argues that the minimum variance portfolio in the

   United States, although comprised mostly of Treasury bills, would

   include a small (long) position in a diversified set of commodity

    futures.

5. As of 31 March 1982, the 2's of '96 were priced at par to yield

    2 percent; the 2's of '06 were priced at 96 to yield 2.32 percent;

    and the 2½'s of '11 were priced at 98 to yield 2.58 percent.

6. For convenience, continuous time results are cited here and elsewhere

    in the text, unless explicitly noted to the contrary.


7. The pension plans provided by most large firms in Canada and the

    United States are defined benefit plans. These are plans in which the

    employee receives a benefit equal to a given fraction of his average

    or of his final earnings for each year of service, or a fixed dollar

    amount for each year of service. If the pension fund earns more than

    the interest rate used to value the plan, which range from 4 to 7 percent

    in Canada, the plan experiences an actuarial surplus.

8. Let B0 now represent the base pension payment defined by the terms

    of the plan. Using the notation of footnote 3, it is as if the retiring

    plan member receives the lump sum payment A0:


                    A0 = B0       RV[l —   (l+Rv)]1                    (F3)


    He then uses A0 to purchase a standard variable annuity, in which
                                 21




    RV is the assumed interest rate. His base pension payment is thus

         as required by the plan, and the actual payments are those

    indicated by (P2). Note that under excess earnings, the defined

    benefit plan is effectively transformed into a defined contribution

    plan at the date of the plan member's retirement. This appears to

    be an additional innovation in response to the apparent increase in

    price level uncertainty, as discussed by Pesando (1982).


9. Since investment opportunities have not changed, this intergenerational

    risk sharing does not improve the overall efficiency of risk bearing

    in the economy. A potential disadvantage is that retired workers may

    fail to realize the implication of (say) a rise in long—term interest

    rates which produces capital losses on the bond portfolio. These losses,

    although unrealized, require an immediate reduction in real consumption

    if expected real consumption is to be stabilized over the remaining

    lifetimes of the annuitants (Rea (1981)).

10. In their study of inflation protection in the U.K., Brealey and Hodges

     (1980) address the problem of valuing fully indexed annuities provided

     to government employees against private sector pensions which are pre-

    sumed to receive cost—of—living adjustments equal to 62 percent of the

     inflation rate.


11. After the first draft of this paper was complete, the Government of

     Canada announced as part of its austerity measures in its (June)

     1982 budget that the cost—of—living adjustments to the indexed pen-

     sions of civil servants would be limited to 6 percent and 5 percent,

     respectively, in 1982 and 1983. Subsequent discussion in the text
                                 22




    continues to abstract from political risk, although this caveat is

    clearly important. There is no apparent way to quantify political risk,

    other than to note that it would cause the risk—free real rate to

    overstate the value of the ostensibly indexed annuities.   It should be

    noted that the possibility of capping, either temporarily or permanently,

    the inflation adjustments due retired Federal government employees has

    also been raised in the United States.


12. The procedure used by either level of government to value annuities

    subject to a floating cap is not known. Parallel treatment, however,

    would be to escalate the projected annuity payments by the assumed

    inflation rate less x   percent,   and then discount this stream of pay-

    ments by the assumed nominal interest rate.


13. Nunnell(l982) discusses a proposal which would permit individuals,

     at the time of their retirement, to purchase a limited quantity of

     index bonds from the U.S. Guvernment. These bonds would provide a

     guaranteed real return of one percent. This guaranteed rate, which

     implies that the bonds would be the equivalent of index Treasury

     bills, is clearly an above market rate based on the analysis of Bodie

     (1980). Although real Treasury bill yields in both Canada and the

     United States are currently well above their historical means of one

     and zero percent, there is as yet no persuasive case for arguing that

     the expected real return on bills has permanently increased.

14. The Government of Canada estimates that its share of pension costs

     for current service is 9.5 percent of salary, compared to 4.5 to 5.5

     percent of salary for private sector firms (Nartel et. al. (1980)).
                                23




    As reported by Cajda (1981), employer contribution rates (which

    appear to blend current and past service costs) for municipal employees

    in the United States may exceed 70 percent of payroll! Note also that

    these contribution rates are as conventionally measured and do not

    take into account the limitations analyzed in the text.


15. Carow (1981) acknowledges the possibility that there may be longer

    queues of workers for federal government jobs in the United States

    than for nonfederal jobs, and lower quit rates for civil service

    employees. The fact that governments in both Canada and the United

    States appear to underprice their fully indexed annuities suggests

    that it is not possible to infer that these workers are sufficiently risk

    averse to demand fully indexed pensions. This issue is discussed by

    Feldstein (1981) and Pesando (1981).

           "Canadian Investment Returns and Other Economic Statistics,
           1926—1980", where details regarding the calculation of the
           individual series may be found. The annual return on Treasury
           Bills is obtained by the successive purchase of 91—day Treasury
           Bills at the end of each quarter.
