                                           ABSTRACT

This paper studies U.S. overseas assembly imports to identify whether factors related to information

or search costs appear to condition outsourcing decisions. The data for 1991-2000 show that U.S.

overseas assembly imports were characterized by incomplete pass-through of production and trade

costs to import prices, though products assembled in more highly educated countries passed-through

a much larger portion of their cost changes. In addition, the price of outsourcing imports responded

to competing suppliers' prices, with the largest responses occurring for products in capital-intense

industries. These differential price responses suggest that information issues play an important role

in the mediation of outsourcing relationships.

Introduction


        A growing body of work in international trade focuses on the institutions and

economic conditions that facilitate the formation of international trading relationships.

For example, information is now recognized as a pivotal element in the globalization

process. Nonetheless, the benefits of informational improvements, such as reduced costs

of telephone calls or increasingly sophisticated bar code transmission and management

tools, are not likely to affect all producers uniformly. Rauch and Trindade (2003) show

that product differentiation in consumption or production produces a degree of “natural

protection”. As a result, improvements in information technology are likely to render the

greatest increases in the global integration for those markets where the matching of

differentiated partners is critical to the formation of successful international partnerships.

        Overseas outsourcing is a component of the globalization process that has

attracted particular concern as the public has become familiar with the idea that

improvements in information technologies enable companies to reduce costs by

outsourcing inputs and assembly from lower cost overseas locations.1 Indeed, the growth

in overseas outsourcing has contributed significantly to the growth of trade volumes.2

        It is certainly true that internationally fragmented production processes allow

producers to take advantage of factor price differences, and may even facilitate factor

   Popular attention is especially focused on the domestic employment impacts of overseas outsourcing.
However, Amiti and Wei (2004) provide evidence showing that the presumption of outsourcing job loss
may be reversed if one also accounts for the simultaneous job gains associated with international
“insourcing”.
2
  Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) present evidence from 10 OECD and four emerging markets which
indicates that increases in vertical specialization accounts for 30% of export growth between 1970 and
1990. By 1990 vertical specialization accounted for 21% of these countries' exports. A broad review of the
trends is contained in Feenstra (1998). In related work Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2003) document
that U.S. multinationals increased their vertical activities in the 1990’s, while Gorg (2000) and Swenson
(2004) study the empirical determinants of outsourcing location choices.


                                                    1
price equalization.3 However, Grossman and Helpman (2004) show that country cost

differences are not sufficient in of themselves to generate overseas fragmentation. Search

and customization costs, in conjunction with incomplete contracting issues, also influence

the outsourcing location choice. This is because the magnitude of search and adaptation

costs ultimately influences the market thickness of potential partners, which helps

determine whether Northern firms search for partners at home or in the lower-cost South.

           A key goal of this paper is to examine whether outsourcing relationships exhibit

characteristics that are consistent with international trade theories based on information

search and matching issues. To set the stage, this paper documents pricing regularities

that characterize the pricing decisions for U.S. outsourcing imports that arrived via the

9802 overseas assembly program, which assists firms that use U.S.-origin parts, materials

or components in their overseas assembly operations.

           The empirical estimates of pricing decisions are based on a simple Bertrand

model with differentiated goods which is modified to account for the cost structure and

tariff treatment facing outsourcing producers who participated in the 9802 program. This

framework allows one to pay particular attention to the pass-through of production costs

and the degree to which producers emulate their competitors’ price changes. A major

benefit of studying the 9802 program is that heterogeneity in producer input choices

provides rich variation in the production and trade cost measures which can be exploited

to identify the price responses for these outsourcing imports.

           Use of these cost measures enables me to verify that U.S. 9802 assembly imports

between 1991 to 2000 exhibited a number of pricing regularities. First, only twenty to

forty percent of the changes in production costs were passed through to product prices.

    See Jones and Kierkowski (1990), Arndt (2001) and Deardorff (2001).

                                                     2
More notably, the degree of production cost pass-through differed across country

suppliers. The pass-through was highest for products assembled in countries that had

more highly, and likely more diversely, educated workforces. There was also a weak

positive relationship between the capital-intensity of the industry, and the degree of

production cost pass-through. Finally trade costs were generally passed-through at a

higher rate than assembly costs, suggesting that firms can pass through costs that are

commonly borne by all producers to a greater degree than they pass through idiosyncratic

cost increases.

         The prices chosen by producers of U.S. 9802 imports also responded to the prices

selected by competing assemblers in other countries. A ten percent increase in prices

chosen by competitors resulted in a two to four percent increase in prices chosen. In

addition, the responsiveness to competitor prices differed across industries in a manner

related to industry differences in capital-intensity: prices were strongly correlated with

competitors’ prices in capital-intense industries, while there was little correlation for

industries that were not capital-intense. Making the reasonable assumption that industry

capital-intensity is correlated with matching costs and information uncertainty, this

evidence suppports theories in which matching and information gathering problems lead

to differential trade elasticities. Furthermore, to the extent that capital-intensity drives

firms to choose intra-firm rather than arm’s length transactions, it suggests that the

identity of traders in international transactions has implications for trade prices.4




4
  Antras(2003) provides a model based on difficulties in contracting to explain the prevalence of intra-firm
trade in capital-intense industries, and for capital abundant countries. However, while Antras shows how
capital will affect the mode of trade relationships, he does not explore whether the methods selected
influence other transaction characteristics that may affect country welfare.


                                                      3
        These findings contribute to the growing empirical literature in international

trade, which shows how the identity of traders and the features of trading relationships

affect trade outcomes. Other work in this vein includes Feenstra and Hanson’s (2001)

examination Hong Kong entrepot trader markups.           Feenstra and Hanson find that

variation in mark-ups, both across products and across countries, is consistent with an

economic story in which entrepot traders add value, by providing quality sorting services

for Chinese-origin products. Another example is the work of Besedes and Prusa (2004)

which shows that heterogeneity in the duration of trading relationships is consistent with

the predictions from Rauch and Watson’s (2003) model of trading relationships. In

particular, most trade relationships appear to start small, suggesting that search costs

cause traders to test      suppliers first, only expanding their order volume once the

supplier’s reliability is ascertained.

        The rest of this paper is structured as follows.          Section two describes

characteristics of 9802 outsourcing activities to help provide an overview of the

outsourcing relationships that are examined in this paper. Section 3 provides a model of

pricing, and the associated regression framework. It also develops detailed measures of

cost which are based on the procedural features of the 9802 program. The empirical

analysis in section four quantifies how production costs, trade costs and competitor prices

affected the prices of 9802 imports. It also examines the importance industry and country

characteristics for these responses and discusses their economic implications. The paper

ends with a brief conclusion.

2. Overseas Assembly and the 9802 program

            To gain insight into outsourcing relationships I use data from the US program

often referred to as the Overseas Assembly Provision, which is codified in section 9802

of the current harmonized system (HS) of tariffs. The 9802 program is designed to assist

firms that use U.S.-origin parts or materials in their overseas assembly operations, by

providing a tariff exemption for the U.S.-origin parts and materials contained in the final

products.5 While the Overseas Assembly Provision, or 9802, comprises only one strand

of outsourcing activities – it does not capture U.S. assembly of foreign parts, or overseas

contract manufacturing that is based on U.S. designs and specifications – it represents a

non-negligible portion of U.S. trade. Almost 8.5 percent of all U.S. imports during the

sample period, 1991-2000, entered through the 9802 program. In comparison with the

broad outsourcing measures presented in Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) or Yi (2003),

9802 outsourcing did not grow more rapidly than overall trade. However, the general

decline in U.S. manufacturing activity may explain why this form of outsourcing, which

is based on the use of U.S. parts and materials, did not grow faster than U.S. trade.

           The major benefit of examining 9802 activities, is that the import data enable one

to observe outsourcing relationships at the product level. During the sample period, the

U.S. imported 4,676 distinct 8-digit HS (HS8) products through the 9802 program. Table

1 displays the country composition for these import transactions. Geographical proximity

appears to have played an important role in determining 9802 participation. While U.S.

9802 imports arrived from 182 different countries, many countries had only a slight

participation in the program. In contrast, Canada and Mexico were the most frequent



5
    See Hanson (1997) to see a description of the program’s evolution.


                                                       5
participants, registering 3,518 and 7,940 unique (HS8-product)-year transactions,

respectively.

         Measured by frequency, the majority of 9802 transactions involved assembly in a

developing country. If development is defined by membership in the OECD, only 19%

of the positive HS8-year pairs involved developed country activity. If development is

defined instead by country educational attainment averaging six or more years, 37% of

the positive HS8-year import observations were shipped from developed countries.

         To provide a snapshot of the industry composition of overseas assembly, Table 2

displays 9802 activity for 2-digit HS industries (HS2). When the data are sorted by the

value of U.S. inputs in the 9802 products, the top three 9802 outsourcing industries were

electrical machinery (85), transportation equipment (87), and apparel and clothing, not

knitted or crocheted (62).6 For each of the HS2 categories, the table also lists the identity

of the primary country supplier, where the primary supplier is defined as the country that

shipped the largest total value of 9802 products in that HS2 category. This cut of the data

also suggests that the location of 9802 activities is greatly influenced by geographical

proximity. Of the thirty largest 9802 industries, either Mexico or Canada was the prime

location for nineteen. However, more distant country sources do top the list for some

industries. The fact that the biggest supplier for footwear (64) was Malaysia, imitation

jewelry (71) was Hong Kong, and clocks and watches (91) was Switzerland, suggests that

production decisions are also influenced by traditional notions of comparative advantage.




6
   These are followed by, non-electrical machinery (84), apparel and clothing, knitted or crocheted (61),
Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments
and apparatus (90), Aircraft and spacecraft (88), and footwear (64). Table 2 is based on activity in 1993 to
prevent the possibility that the composition was affected by Mexico’s joining the NAFTA.


                                                     6
           Finally, to characterize input usage Table 2 reports the U.S. percentage, which is

defined as the percentage of total product value attributable to U.S. parts and materials.

In order to reap the tariff benefits of the 9802 program, firms are required to record the

portion of product value that derives from dutiable 9802 import as opposed to non-

dutiable U.S. components and parts. The benefit of using these declarations is that one

can observe the relative reliance on foreign inputs at a product-country level, rather than

making an estimate that relies on input-output tables, and the undesirable assumption that

imported inputs are used in production in a proportion that is exactly equal to ratio of

imports relative to domestic consumption. The average U.S. percentage for products in

the sample of 9802 imports was 36%.                         A cross-industry comparison of the U.S.

percentage shows that industries varied dramatically in their relative reliance on U.S.

inputs. This variation could be driven by a number of factors, including cross-industry

differences in U.S. comparative advantage, in organizational form, or in the relative

importance of parts and assembly. Cross product tariff differences should also influence

the incentive to use U.S.-origin parts and materials. However, while the U.S. percentage

of product value and MFN tariffs have the expected positive correlation, it is only 0.075.

           Because the value of U.S. percentage varies greatly across products and countries,

it is possible to construct detailed cost measures at the product-country level that are

based on variation in production, tariff and transportation costs. For example, consider a

range of products produced in Mexico through the 9802 program. Each product i is

characterized by the percentage U.S. content associated with its production, or αus,ic.7 If

Mexican wages rise, production cost increases will be especially pronounced for those



7
    The subscript c refers generally to the country of assembly, which in this case is Mexico.


                                                        7
products with the highest percentage (1- αus,ic) of their production activities located in

Mexico. A high percentage of activity in Mexico is also costly for those products that

face the highest U.S. import duties. In contrast, products characterized by a high value of

(1- αus,ic) benefit from lower transportation costs since there is less back and forth

shipment of U.S.-origin parts and material.



3. A model of pricing decisions

       In this section I provide a model of outsourcing prices that I modify to examine

issues related to the roles of information and search in outsourcing relationships. I begin

by introducing measures of outsourcing costs that account for the unique input and tariff

structure of imports shipped through the 9802 program. I then modify a Bertrand model

of competition in internationally differentiated goods to relate the pricing of 9802 imports

to a producer’s outsourcing costs as well as the pricing decisions of its competitors.

Finally, I add interaction terms to the common pass-through framework to test whether

price responses are related to country or industry characteristics, and more importantly

whether such interactions are related to theories based on information and matching.



3.1 Production

       Following Mendez (1993), 9802 assembly is modeled as a Leontieff production

process. To produce product i in country c, 9802 producers combine a fixed bundle of

U.S. inputs with a fixed bundle of foreign inputs and assembly. To characterize input

bundles, I assume that 9802 assembly involves a set of tasks on the unit interval that must

be completed in sequence.     A firm’s decision to participate in 9802 indicates that the




                                              8
U.S. has comparative advantage in the early stage tasks, while the foreign country has

comparative advantage in the later tasks and assembly. If the point on the unit interval at

which U.S. processing ends and foreign production begins is denoted by βic, and each

task requires physical labor input Li, then U.S. input requirements are given by βic*Li

while the foreign input requirement is (1- βic)* Li.              Assume the price of U.S. inputs is

given by wus, while the U.S. dollar price of foreign inputs is wc. If U.S. inputs are

transported to the foreign assembler at ad valorem cost gic, the resulting production cost

when product i is assembled in country c is:

(1) Cic = [βic*wus* (1+gic) + (1- βic)*wc]*Li.

Since assembly countries differ in their abilities and distance from the U.S., the value of

βic will not be the same for all countries involved in the assembly of good i.8

         When 9802 products are shipped from the assembly country to the U.S. two

further costs arise. First, the appropriate U.S. import tariff τi is applied to the foreign

contribution to product value, (1- βic)*wc*Li. In addition, the return of the completed

product to the U.S. incurs the ad valorem shipping cost gic.

         As the description of production indicates, the underlying cost of 9802 imports

will differ across assembly locations for a number of reasons, including cross-country

differences in factor and transportation costs for the movement of parts and materials.

Cross-country variation is also generated by differences in production techniques that

cause the Leontieff input choices to vary by location as dictated by skills, endowments

and production costs. Finally, while time subscripts have been excluded for notational



8
 Distance matters not only due to transportation costs, which are directly included in the measure of costs,
but also due to time costs associated with distance, as highlighted by Hummels (2001) and Evans and
Harrigan (2003).


                                                      9
simplicity, the costs related to overseas assembly will also change over time as wages,

transportation costs and tariffs change.



3.2 Demand

         To model pricing decisions, I assume that product market competition is Bertrand.

Each country produces a unique variety of the outsourced good, which is an imperfect

substitute for the products arriving from other country locations. This implies that the

producer of any particular good faces product demand qic = d(PicC, PicC*, Ei), where the

demand for each product is negatively related to the producer’s own choice of consumer

price PicC, and positively related to the price vector of its competitors’ consumer prices

PicC* and to overall expenditure Ei on product i.

         Although firm profit depends the producer price, product demand depends on the

consumer price. If we now define αus,ic as the U.S. share of product value that is exempt

from tariff, the relationship between the consumer and producer (PicP) price is given by:9



(3) PicC = [PicP *(1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* PicP * τi].



This can be rearranged to yield,



(3’) PicP = PicC * [ (1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi ]-1.



Firms now choose PicP to maximize profits:


9
 The U.S.-origin contribution to product value is given by: αus,ic = [βic*wus* (1+gic)]/[βic*wus* (1+gic) + (1-
βic)*wc].


                                                      10
(4) π = PicC * [ (1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi]-1* d(PicC, PicC*, Ei) - Cic*d(PicC, PicC*, Ei).



This generates the familiar first order condition:



(5) PicC (1+ 1/ η) = [ (1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi ]*Cic.



        Prices are determined by a markup over marginal cost. The marginal cost has two

components: trade costs are given by [(1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi ], while marginal production

costs are represented by Cic. The markup is determined by the elasticity of demand (η)

for product i. For purposes of estimation, we can follow Feenstra (1989) and arrive at the

reduced form relationship (6).



(6) PicC = Г [ {(1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi }*Cic ), Pic*, Ei ]



Restoring time subscripts and adopting a log-linear form generates the familiar pass-

through regression framework:



(7) lnPictC = α + β1ln([ (1+gict) + (1-αus,ic)* τit]) + β2ln(Cict) + γln(Pict*) + δlnEit + εict



However, this equation needs to be modified since recent work on import price data

demonstrates that cross country differences in quality are present even when trade data




                                                 11
are disaggregated to the fine product level.10 To account for unobserved differences in

product quality that are correlated with country development I add a measure of

development Dc to the basic specification. This yields the primary estimating equation

that is to analyze the prices of outsourcing imports.



(7’) lnPictC = α + β1ln([(1+gict)+ (1-αus,ic)* τit])+ β2ln(Cict) +γln(Pict*) +δlnEit +λlnDc + εict


As in the pass-through literature, the coefficients β1 and β2 are both expected to be in the

interval [0,1], which run the gamut from no pass-through of cost changes to complete

pass-through of any changes in cost. 11 In addition, the coefficients on competitor prices

γ and country development λ are both expected to be positive.



3.3 Heterogeneous Product Responses

        The primary estimating equation assumes that pass-through and market reactions

are the same for all products in the sample. However, these assumptions fail if market

characteristics condition the degree of competition in product markets. Such differential

product elasticities are a feature of Rauch and Trindade’s (2003) model of matching in

which improved information increases the elasticity of substitution between

internationally differentiated product varieties, since improved information enables firms

to rule out unacceptably poor matches before conducting international partner searches.


10
   See Hummels & Skiba (2002), Hummels and Irwin (2002) and Schott (2003).
11
   Blonigen and Haynes (2002) predict and discover pass-through rates exceeding one in magnitude for
products that are subject to anti-dumping treatment. However this exception is caused by the incentives
created by the administration of anti-dumping cases.
    See Goldberg and Knetter (1997) for a thorough discussion of the literature on pass-through. While I
examine the pass-through of costs converted to dollars, rather than the separate exchange rate and cost
terms, this is motivated by the idea that the majority of cost changes are driven by currency movements
rather than underlying changes in country production costs denominated in national currency.


                                                    12
While Rauch and Trindade explore the implications of informational improvements for

the evolution of trade relationships, their ideas can be applied to comparisons of trading

relationships across products. In particular, the effect of informational uncertainty in

reducing product trade elasticities should be greatest for those products where

informational uncertainty is the greatest. While Rauch and Trindade provide a model of

international joint ventures, it seems reasonable to expect that informationally-based

matching frictions will be every bit as critical to the formation of overseas outsourcing

relationships.

       Grossman and Helpman’s (2004) work provides further reasons to expect

different pricing responses for different product outsourcing relationships. When search

costs are sufficiently high, Northern firms may seek partners in the high-wage North, if

the costs of search and adaptation have hindered the entry of potential partners in the

South. In particular, a greater number of Northern firms to attempt a Northern search,

since thinness of potential Southern partners reduces the probability of a successful

match, and consequently expected profits associated with search in the low-wage South.

While Grossman and Helpman (2004) focus on a particular equilibrium in which partner

search occurs in both the North and the South, one can imagine extending their

framework to a multiple country setting with wage shocks. In particular, if the relative

wage of one country’s workers rise, the interest in seeking a replacement country location

for assembly is likely to be greatest for products in industries that involve the lowest

search and modification costs.

       Since there are no straightforward measures of search costs or uncertainty by

industry, I assume that the costs of search and modification, as well as search uncertainty,




                                            13
are highest for technologically sophisticated industries and for partner searches in more

highly skilled countries. Search and adaptation costs are likely to be especially high in

sophisticated industries, for example, since these industries are likely to be characterized

by a large set of search criteria whose presence is difficult to verify. To examine whether

pricing decisions respond in a fashion that is consistent with the notion of costly or

uncertain search, I add interaction terms to examine whether industry capital-intensity Ki

influences the degree of response to competitor price changes or the degree of production

cost pass-through.



(8) lnPictC = α + (β1 + β1K*ln(Ki))*ln([(1+gict)+ (1-αus,ic)* τit])+ (β2 + β2K*ln(Ki))*ln(Cict)

               + (γ + γK*ln(Ki))*ln(Pict*) + δlnEit + θ*ln(Ki) +λlnDc + εict



       The choice of specification (8) is further motivated by work on the organizational

form of international production. A notable contribution in this area is Antras’s (2003)

work demonstrating how greater reliance on intra-firm trade transactions can emerge to

solve contracting problems in settings that involve more capital.           Including capital-

intensity terms in specification (8) allows me to explore whether capital-intensity, which

correlated with differences in the organizational form of trade transactions, is also related

to transaction characteristics that may affect country welfare.

       Of course, industry capital-intensity is only one transaction characteristic that

affects search and modification costs as well as incentives that affect the organizational

form of trade. Another way to proxy matching issues is to use education as a measure of

skill. While lower levels of education generally comprise a common set of skills, higher




                                              14
education levels are likely to result in more heterogeneous skill outcomes in the educated

populace.12 When a firm seeks more highly skilled workers, its managers are likely to

face a more difficult search, since their criteria are no longer based on a minimum

education, but on identifying workers who possess training in particular skills and

methods.     To account for this possibility I also investigate the effects of including

4. Results
          I estimate the pricing relationship using both OLS and panel regression

techniques that control for serial correlation. The findings support the price predictions

emerging from a Bertrand model of competition. In particular, unit import prices for

9802 products are positively related to production and trade costs. They are also

positively related to the prices charged by competitors. In addition, price levels and

responsiveness are found to vary with industry capital-intensity and country education

levels.

   While low grades of education commonly provide students with an ability to read or do calculations,
higher education is more likely to be characterized by differentiation. (E.g., think of college educated
workers who choose not only majors, but subspecialties, or highly skilled technicians who have received
training in particular techniques and procedures.)

4.1 Data

       My primary data for this project follow U.S. 9802 imports between 1991 and

2000. To quantify price responses in an outsourcing context, I use unit import values for

9802 imports as the dependent variable. These data are also used to construct competitor

prices P* which are defined as the average unit import value for competing country

producers in the same HS8 industry in that year. Finally, I use the U.S. and foreign

content declarations to create measures of αus,ic, which are fundamental to construction of

the production and trade cost measures.        The data appendix provides more details

regarding the construction of the data set, including the sources for the other variables

used in the analysis.



4.2 Estimation

       Table 3 presents the benchmark estimates for price equation (7’). The estimated

coefficients uniformly show that 9802 import prices were positively related to

production costs, though the implied degree of pass-through was only ten to forty

percent. The regressions also imply that trade costs were incompletely passed through.

In each of the specifications the pass-through of trade costs was somewhat higher than

the pass-through of production costs.       The difference in estimated pass-through of

producer costs versus trade costs is statistically distinct, though the weakest results which

are displayed in column (3) are only statistically different at the 6% level. The greater




                                             16
pass through of trade costs suggests that firms are able to pass-through common cost

changes to a greater extent than idiosyncratic cost changes.13

        The results in Table 3 also show that there was a strong positive relationship

between prices charged by 9802 assemblers and the prices charged by their competitors.

The OLS regressions imply that assemblers incorporated forty percent of competitor

price changes in their own prices, while the later panel regressions in columns (2), (3)

and (4) imply that 9802 producers mimicked twenty-five percent of their competitors’

price changes.

        Similar to Schott (2003), Hummels and Irwin (2002) and Hummels and Klenow

(2002), 9802 import prices were highly correlated with country development.                       The

positive and significant coefficient on the OECD variable indicates that even within fine

8-digit HS products, those imported from developed countries commanded higher prices.

The most likely interpretation of the development coefficient is that developed countries

produced higher quality varieties of the HS8 goods. To examine whether the correlation

between assembler country development and product import values was robust, I turned

to two alternative development measures - an indicator variable for highly educated

countries, and the log of country per capita income.14 The coefficients on alternative

development measures were always positive and significant, while the remaining

coefficients in the price regression were qualitatively unchanged by the choice of

development measure.



13
   Gron and Swenson (2000) find a similar phenomenon in U.S. car prices, while Besanko, Dranove, and
Shanley (2001) provide empirical evidence showing that firms pass-through common shocks to a greater
degree than they pass through idiosyncratic cost shocks.
14
   Following Riker and Brainard (1997), countries are defined as “highly educated” if the average
education level for the country is six or more years.


                                                  17
       The only coefficient that changed in magnitude as the definition of development

was changed was the coefficient on production cost. The coefficient magnitude rose

when development was measured by country education, and fell when country

development was represented by per capita GDP.           Since per-capita GDP is highly

correlated with wages, and hence, country costs, the coefficient on per-capita GDP may

have picked up some of the effects of production costs, thus causing the estimated

coefficient on production cost to fall in size. In contrast, when country development was

measured by the country education variable, the apparent pass-through of production

costs rose. This result is sensible since accounting for country education helps to control

for differences in country costs that were related to otherwise unmeasured differences in

worker quality.

       Recent work on outsourcing such as Grossman and Helpman (2004) emphasizes

that the initiation and development of outsourcing relationships can be complicated by

issues related to partner search. Firms will only seek outsourcing partners, rather than

completing projects in house, when an outsourcing relationship is expected to yield

higher profits. In this context the relative attractiveness of outsourcing relationships

depends on the difficulty and cost of finding a partner in addition to the relative costs of

outsourcing versus in house production. On the industry dimension, I assume that the

difficulty and cost of finding a partner is highest for products that require complex and

highly specified production skills.

       Before turning to the full capital interaction specification (8), I first examined

how the estimated pass-through changed if controls for capital were included in the

regression. To proxy production skill-intensity and specificity, I added the capital output




                                            18
ratio as a control in the regressions displayed in table 4.15 The results in the first three

columns of table 4 show that industry capital-intensity was highly correlated with the unit

values of 9802 imports. In addition, the results show that magnitude of the effect of

industry capital-intensity on the unit import values differed for developed and developing

countries. The most notable effect of including capital-intensity in the regressions, is that

the estimated production cost pass-through rises somewhat, to roughly 28 percent. In

contrast, the magnitude of the coefficient on competitor prices remains unchanged.

         The one coefficient that becomes unstable when industry capital-intensity is

directly included in the estimating equation is the coefficient measuring the pass-through

of trade costs. The most likely reason for the instability of the trade cost term was the

underlying correlation between industry capital-intensity and the level of tariffs, which

are a component of trade costs. In particular, U.S. tariffs were higher in less capital-

intense industries.16       When capital-intensity is directly included in the estimating

equation, the capital-intensity term may pick up some of the variation that was related to

tariffs, consequently changing the apparent magnitude of the trade cost coefficient.

         To examine whether industry capital-intensity influenced the degree of response

to competitor price changes or the degree of production cost pass-through, I estimated

interaction specification (8).          The estimates reveal a positive coefficient on the

interaction between industry capital-intensity and competitor prices, indicating that the

tendency to mimic competitor country price increases was positively related to industry



15
   The number of observations declines since it is not possible to map all HS 8 codes to a 1987-value SIC
code, which is needed to connect the product data to industry variables.
16
   In this sample, the regression of an industry’s tariff rate on the industry’s capital-intensity and time
yields: Tariff Rateit = .185(.015)-.031(.001)*ln(average KY)i - .0016(.0002)*yr. This regression is based
on the 24,253 unique HS8 product-year combinations.


                                                     19
capital-intensity. If capital-intensity increases search uncertainty, or search costs, then

producers in those industries may have felt confident that they could match their

competitors’ price increases without losing their assembly work to other country

suppliers.

        To examine whether the availability of alternative outsourcing partners was

conditioned by industry capital-intensity, I regressed the count of competitors on

measures of industry capital-intensity.17 The negative coefficient on average industry

capital-intensity shown in specification (1) documents that the number of competing

source countries was negatively related to the capital-intensity of 9802 products.

        To further explore how capital-intensity conditioned the number of competing

9802 country suppliers, I created separate competitor counts for OECD and non-OECD

suppliers. This distinction makes sense if developed countries were better suited for

17
  “Competitors” were measured by the count of countries that provided a particular HS8 product for at
least one of the years between 1991 and 2000.


                                                   20
some assembly tasks, while developing countries were better suited for others. When the

count of competitors was defined by OECD membership status, as in specifications (2)

and (3), the regression results show that capital-intensity exerted a much greater barrier to

the presence of non-OECD suppliers than it did to the presence of competing OECD

suppliers. This could mean that products assembled in non-OECD locations were better

substitutes for each other, than were products assembled in OECD locations.

Alternatively, if OECD countries were more heavily engaged in the most skill-intensive

activities of skill-using capital-intense industries, they may have faced less risk of

displacement based on costs.

       Since the capital-intensity data are only available through 1996 it is not feasible to

track the connection between yearly changes in capital-intensity and changes in

competitor counts for the entire sample period. However, examination of the time-series

data for 1991-1996 in specification (4), shows that the number of countries providing

overseas assembly assistance declined for U.S. industries that became more capital-

intense.

       Each of the auxiliary regressions demonstrates that the presence of competing

country locations was smaller in capital-intense industries. This may explain why firms

in more capital-intense industries were more likely to match their competitor’s price

changes. If these producers raised their prices, the greater difficulties and requirements

involved in successfully switching partners in capital-intense industries may have

insulated them from displacement by competitors from other countries. Alternatively, the

correlation may have arisen from market power, if an industry’s capital-intensity elevates

market power.     This view of competition bears resemblance to Feenstra, Gagnon and




                                             21
Knetter’s (1996) finding that exchange rate pass-through for passenger cars was higher

for producers with higher market share. While it would be attractive to run a comparable

analysis to test whether their market share model explains pricing relationships in 9802

data, the lack of similarly disaggregated U.S. industry production data for each of the

HS8 products precludes the creation of appropriate market share terms.18

         An alternative way to look for evidence that industry matching matters is to

include industry skill requirements rather than capital-intensity in the regressions. Table

5 does this by examining whether industry skill requirements affected product prices or

price sensitivity.      To measure industry skill intensity, I defined the skilled wage

percentage at the industry level as [non-production worker wages]i/[Total wages]i.

Columns (1) and (2) begin the inquiry by examining the direct effects of including skill

measures in the regressions. The coefficients on the skill measures show that the unit

values for 9802 imports were higher in industries that were characterized by a relatively

high skilled wage percentage. In addition, unit import values were higher for products

assembled in countries with more highly educated workforces.

         Grossman and Helpman’s work on outsourcing shows how low search costs

enable firms to conduct more intensive searches, and how in general equilibrium the

expansion of search efforts will create a “thick markets” externality, due to the greater

entry of potential partners. In the 9802 context, we might expect that the search costs for

highly skilled assembly partners would have been the highest in countries that had highly

18
  The data in this sample do reveal a high correlation between capital-intensity and 9802 market share,
defined as a country’s share of 9802 product exports in a given industry. In this sample, OLS regression of
a country’s average market share in an industry on the industry’s average capital-intensity and a set of
country dummies yielded: Average Market Shareic = .216(.006)*ln(average KY)i + ∑CC. When I estimated
the regression using panel techniques and random effects for country-industry pairs , or Market Shareict =
177(.006)*ln(KY)it + εict, the results show that for the years of available data to 1996, that country market
shares grew as the capital-intensity of the U.S. rose.



                                                     22
educated workforces, since the types of skills matter as much as the level of education. If

this is the source of the “thick markets” externalities, then country education should

matter the most for those industries that most heavily utilized skilled workers. To test

this idea, columns (3) and (4) added an interaction term multiplying the industry skilled

wage percentage by an indicator variable denoting whether the country’s population was

highly educated. In support of the “thick markets” idea, the strong positive coefficient on

the interaction term suggests that unit values were particularly high when a skilled

industry product was produced in a more highly educated country.

       Finally, I estimated interaction equation (9) to determine whether country

education levels affected the pricing responses. The results show that country education

levels influenced the ability of assemblers to pass-through production costs to prices.

Column (6) of Table 5 suggests that assemblers located in low education countries could

only pass-through thirty percent of their production costs changes. In contrast, producers

located in highly educated countries were able to pass-through 97 percent of their

production cost changes.

       To further investigate the effects of education, I replaced the indicator variable for

highly educated countries with the actual educational attainment for each country’s adult

population aged 25 or over. Overall, the results reported in Table 6 echo the findings

from Table 5. However, the use of a direct schooling measure allows one to ask whether

an additional year of education had a uniform effect on low and high education countries.

In particular, did an additional year of schooling provide a greater boost to the product

value of high or low education countries? To look at this issue, column (4) adds an

interaction term to measure the benefits of extra education for those countries that had 6




                                            23
years or greater education. The results show that extra education proved especially

valuable to producers in more educated locations. While a 10% increase in educational

attainment for countries whose attainment was less than 6 years, implied a 3.5% increase

in product prices, a 10% increase in educational attainment was correlated with a 7.5%

increase in product prices for products imported from countries whose residents averaged

6 or more years of education.

         As before, I tested for evidence consistent with Grossman and Helpman style

“thick market” externalities by adding an interaction term to the regression reported in

column (3), which multiplied the industry skilled wage measure with country educational

attainment.19 The strong positive coefficient on the new interaction term, indicates that

product prices were especially high when a skill-intensive product was assembled in a

country with a highly educated workforce.

         Finally, I tested whether the level of education affected the pass through of

production costs. As column (6) of Table 6 shows, the ability to pass through production

cost changes to import prices was strongly related to the education level of the assembly

location. The coefficients imply that the median country was able to pass through 25% of

its cost changes. In contrast, a country in the top 25%, by education, was able pass

through 94% of its cost changes, while a country in the top 10% was able to pass through

99%.




19
    I assume here that the supply of high skilled assemblers is greater in countries that have highly educated
workers, and that the cost of locating a match is highest for industries that require skilled workers. The
effect may be more complicated if, as in Grossman and Helpman (2003), the compensation paid to the
foreign assembler depends on the assemblers’ outside options, which are themselves correlated with
education levels. The indicator variables HEc in equation (9) are now replaced with HEc*ln(Education)c.


                                                     24
4.3 Robustness Checks

       To check the stability of the pass-through results, I ran a number of robustness

checks. In each case, I employed the same estimating equation, as that reported in

column (2) of Table 3.

         I began by running individual regressions for each of the HS2 industries rather

than the pooled sample, to learn whether there was significant heterogeneity in pass-

through across industries. However, while estimation at the HS2 industry level does

reveals heterogeneity in the value of the production cost pass-through coefficient the

median value for the HS2 production cost coefficients was 0.229, which was very similar

to the result in the pooled sample. In addition, since textiles and footwear are believed to

be among the most footloose industries, I also estimated the pass-through equation for

this group of products (HS2 chapters 61 to 64).          It is interesting to note that the

production cost pass-through for those sectors was a bit lower, with a coefficient of

0.158. However, this degree of pass-through was not statistically distinct from the full

sample value of 0.200.

       A second question is whether the production cost measures, which were based on

country price deflators, rather than country-industry deflators, provided too little variation

in the production cost to get good identification. While it would have been desirable to

use industrial production indices for each country-industry pair, no such comprehensive

and internationally comparable measure exists.         However, to get an idea whether

measurement error in the cost term affected the results, I replaced the general U.S. price

measure used in the creation of the production cost measure with 4-digit SIC U.S. price

deflators from Bartlesman, Becker and Gray. Since their data end with 1996, estimation




                                             25
is limited to the years 1991-1996. However, when I run the regression for those years

with the old cost measure, and the modified cost measure, the coefficients on the

production cost terms are 0.253(.048) and 0.339(.047), respectively. While the degree of

measured pass-through is a bit higher with the new cost measure, the similarity of the

results seems to suggest that measurement error did not dramatically affect the results.

         It may be noted that both regressions based on 1991-1996 prices yielded

production cost coefficients that were slightly higher than those arriving from estimation

covering the full sample period, 1991-2000.                 This may indicate that the degree of

production cost pass-through declined over time. However, when I added interaction

terms to equation (8) which replaced the capital-intensity interactions with interactions

based on a time trend, the interaction terms failed to reveal any time trend in the pass

through of production costs.

         Another question is whether the availability of alternative trade programs, such as

the NAFTA, affected the results.20 The phase-in of alternative trade programs is only

problematic if there was a correlation between pricing behavior, and the identity of those

producers who decided to enter their U.S. imports through NAFTA rather than 9802. To

provide a crude indication whether NAFTA participation affected the results, I estimated

the pricing equation without Mexico or Canada.                     In their absence, the estimated

production cost pass-through coefficient is 0.259(.003), which is again very similar to the

estimate in the full sample. This suggests that there were no systematic differences

between the pricing behavior of firms that left the 9802 program in lieu of NAFTA trade



20
   Provisions regarding the general custom’s user’s fee continued to provide benefits to 9802 participants,
even after NAFTA was in force. In addition, U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports were generally non-zero
during the sample period, since they were undergoing the phase-in process.


                                                    26
provisions and the pricing behavior of firms that continued to participate in 9802.

       Finally, I experimented with changes in the expenditure term in the regressions.

While the regressions are run with HS8 expenditures as a control, it may be preferable to

use more aggregated measures of expenditure. However, when I ran the regressions with

HS6 or HS4 expenditure instead, the primary coefficients of interest were hardly

changed, suggesting that the choice of expenditure measure had no effect on the

estimated pass-through or emulation effects.




5. Conclusion

       I document pricing regularities in U.S. 9802 imports to provide stylized facts

related to outsourcing decisions, and to examine whether the pricing responses are

consistent with economic theories of international trade that feature search and

modification costs or search uncertainty.

       Pricing decisions for U.S. 9802 outsourcing imports show that changes in

production costs were only partially passed through to import prices; the full sample

results imply that a country assembling 9802 products was only able to pass-through 20

to 40 percent of any production cost shock it faced. However, assemblers located in

countries with highly educated workforces were able to pass-through a much larger

percentage of production cost changes than were assemblers located in countries whose

workers were less educated. The results also show that the degree of price response to

competitor price changes was magnified for products produced by capital-intense

industries. If search costs and search uncertainty are increasing in industry capital-




                                            27
intensity, then the greater emulation of competitor price changes is consistent with

informational theories in which the elasticity of substitutions between internationally

differentiated products is diminished by search costs and difficulties. In additions, since

auxiliary regressions show that there were fewer competing country suppliers in capital-

intense industries, it appears that capital-intensity was negatively related to Grossman and

Helpman (2004) style market thickness externalities, in the market for 9802 sourcing

locations.

       There are a number of reasons to be cautious in applying the lessons from 9802

imports to the full range of overseas outsourcing relationships. Since 9802 is designed to

promote the use of U.S.-origin parts in foreign assembly, assembly represents a large

portion of many foreign countries’ contributions. If 9802 assembly tasks are well defined

and simpler to match and conduct than other forms of overseas outsourcing, then the

effects of search costs or search uncertainty are likely to be much larger in other

outsourcing contexts.

Data Appendix

Trade data
Data on U.S. 9802 imports for 1991-2000 were taken from United States International Trade
Commission (USITC) trade data as reported in the December editions of the IM146A. While the
data are recorded at the 10-digit HS level, the 10-digit data were first aggregated to the 8-digit
level. The dependent variable for the analysis is the CIF unit value of imports, based on the 8-
digit aggregates. Unit values were defined for each country-product year observation and
calculated as, Unit Valuecit = [Import value]cit /[Import quantity]cit. The subscripts refer to country
(c), product (i) and year (t), respectively.

Competitor prices P* were given by the average price of similar 8-digit HS products imported
from all other countries in that year through the 9802 program. Expenditure was defined by
overall spending for 9802 imports from all countries within an HS 8 grouping in the year, though
other higher industry levels of aggregation were also tested for robustness.

The 9802 data were also used to construct the U.S percentage of product value, αus,ic, which is
defined in footnote 9. The U.S. percentage αus,ic was used in the creation of the production and
trade cost measures. To avoid endogeneity problems, the sample average of αus,ic for each county-
product pair was used when I applied the cost formulas.

To facilitate the use of industry data, the connection between HS product codes and 4-digit SIC
industry identifiers was made feasible by Peter Schott’s “HTS10 to SIC4 Concordance, 1989 to
2001” available on his web site: http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/pks4/sub_international.htm.
Tariff rates and transportation costs used to create the trade cost measure, [(1+gict) + (1-αus,ic)* τit],
were also collected from Schott’s website. A detailed description of Schott’s data is contained in
Feenstra, Romalis and Schott (2002).

Industry Characteristics
Data on 4-digit SIC industry capital-intensity, and skill requirements were collected from the
NBER Manufacturing Database, which is available from the National Bureau of Economic
Research data site, at http://www.nber.org/data_index.html, as constructed by Bartlesman, Becker
and Gray. Capital-intensity was measured as the ratio of Capital to output, while worker skill
requirements were measured by the ratio of non-production worker wages to total wages.

Macroeconomic Variables
Macroeconomic Variables were collected from the Penn World Tables: Alan Heston, Robert
Summers and Bettina Aten, Penn World Table Version 6.1, Center for International Comparisons
at the University of Pennsylvania (CICUP), October 2002. The variable p, the price level of
GDP, was used to measure country input costs when I used cost equation (1) to calculate
production costs.

Education
Data on educational attainment were taken from Barro and Lee’s data, which are maintained at
the, National Bureau of Economic Research, at http://www.nber.org/data_index.html. Following
Riker and Brainard (1997), the high education indicator variable was set to one for all countries
whose education level for adults 25 and older averaged 6 or more years in 1990.
