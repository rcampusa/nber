Do superpower interventions to install and prop up political leaders in other countries subsequently
result in more or less democracy, and does this effect vary depending on whether the intervening superpower
is democratic or authoritarian? While democracy may be expected to decline contemporaneously
with superpower interference, the effect on democracy after a few years is far from obvious. The absence
of reliable information on covert interventions has hitherto served as an obstacle to seriously addressing
these questions. The recent declassification of Cold War CIA and KGB documents now makes it possible
to systematically address these questions in the Cold War context. We thus develop a new panel dataset
of superpower interventions during the Cold War. We find that superpower interventions are followed
by significant declines in democracy, and that the substantive effects are large. Perhaps surprisingly,
once endogeneity is addressed, US and Soviet interventions have equally detrimental effects on the
subsequent level of democracy; both decrease democracy by about 33%. Our findings thus suggest
that one should not expect significant differences in the adverse institutional consequences of superpower
interventions based on whether the intervening superpower is a democracy or a dictatorship.

1) Introduction-


Do superpower interventions to install and prop up political leaders in other countries

subsequently result in more or less democracy, and does this effect vary depending on

whether the intervening superpower is democratic or authoritarian? While democracy

may be expected to decline contemporaneously with superpower interference, the effect

on democracy after a few years is far from obvious. The absence of reliable information

on covert interventions has hitherto served as an obstacle to seriously addressing these

questions. The recent declassification of Cold War CIA and KGB documents now makes

it possible to systematically address these questions in the Cold War context, which is

what we do. Aside from being of considerable historical importance in its own right, a

study of Cold War interventions is of great interest because it speaks directly to whether

and how outside forces may alter the path of institutional evolution, in contrast to the

usual focus on domestic actors. This, of course, is an issue of special policy relevance to

our time.



As implied in the questions above, our interest is not in the contemporaneous effect of

superpower interventions but rather on the effects after the passage of a few years.1 Our

ex ante theoretical expectations on this issue are far from clear. From one theoretical

perspective one may reasonably expect the effects of superpower interventions to differ

depending on whether the intervening superpower is a democracy or not. For instance,

superpower governments might have a preference for spreading their own form of

government. If the benefits of establishing democracies overseas exceed the costs for a

1
    Unsurprisingly democracy does decline contemporaneously with superpower interventions.


                                                                                             2
democratic but not for an authoritarian superpower, interventions by a democratic

superpower could subsequently result in more democratic environments than

interventions by a non-democratic superpower. However, one may also reasonably adopt

the theoretical perspective that interventions by democratic and authoritarian

superpowers alike are primarily driven by considerations of repressing opponents

overseas. Crony authoritarian regimes overseas offer less checks and balances against

repression of opponents, which may cause democratic and non-democratic superpowers

alike to favor the presence of crony dictators overseas. If so we may expect interventions

by a democratic and an authoritarian superpower to have similar adverse consequences

for democracy in intervened countries. The goal of this paper is to check which of these

perspectives finds greater support in the Cold War data.



In order to answer this question we develop a new panel dataset of superpower

interventions during the Cold War. Our goal is to examine the effects of a superpower

intervention in a given five year period on the average level of democracy in the

following five year period. We find that superpower interventions are followed by

significant declines in democracy and that the substantive effects are large. Perhaps

surprisingly US and Soviet interventions have equally detrimental effects on democracy;

both decrease democracy in the subsequent five year period by about 33%. Our findings

thus indicate that one should not expect significant differences in the adverse institutional

consequences of superpower interventions based on whether the intervening superpower

is a democracy or a dictatorship.




                                                                                            3
This paper relates to literatures in both political science and economics. In political

science, our paper builds on recent work by Bueno de Mesquita and Downs (2006) on the

effects of interventions in wars and other militarized disputes. Our paper extends this

work in three ways. First, we do not focus exclusively on military interventions, but

extend our examination to behind the scenes efforts by the secret services of the

superpowers to install and prop up leaders in office. Second, we do not limit ourselves to

studying countries which are experiencing violent conflict, but also consider

interventions with limited and no casualties. This difference is significant because wars

and militarized disputes are relatively rare events. Third, we offer instruments for

addressing questions of endogeneity, which is a serious concern because interventions

may be driven by the anticipated state of the institutional environment.



As far as economics is concerned, a large literature on the effect of institutions on

economic development has begun to explore the first-stage determinants of institutions,

including variables such as inequality, ethnic fractionalization, and colonizing strategies.

Our paper differs from these in focusing on a relatively time varying determinant of

institutions.



In the next section of the paper we offer a brief review of the previous literature on

interventions. In Section 3 we describe our hypotheses relating interventions to

institutions. In Section 4 we describe our new panel data set of interventions and outline

the rationale and sources for our control variables. Section 5 describes how we address

issues of identification. In Section 6 we present our results, while Section 7 concludes.




                                                                                               4
2) Literature review-



The literature that specifically focuses on the institutional effects of interventions is

concentrated in political science. Bueno de Mesquita and Downs (2006) have recently

provided an excellent survey of this literature and we summarize some of the highlights

below. One group of studies focuses on military interventions and finds that

interventions by democratic countries have a positive effect on democratic reform in the

short term, but generate political instability in the long term. (Kegley and Hermann,

1997 and Gleditsch et al., 2004). Another group of political scientists focuses more

narrowly on cases of interventions by the US. Some of the case study literature finds that

US interventions are not associated with democratization and attributes this to US

military and economic interests (Karl, 1990 and Rueschmeyer et al., 1992). Other studies

focus on the difficulty of imposing democracy from above. (Herman and Broadhead,

1984, O’Donnell et al., 1986, Whitehead, 1991.) Yet another group of scholars finds

that US interventions have a positive effect on democracy under some limited

circumstances. (Meernik, 1996, Wantchekon and Nickerson, 1999, Enterline and Greig,

2003.)



Bueno de Mesquita and Downs’ paper is the latest contribution to the interventions

literature. Their paper focuses on military interventions in wars and militarized interstate

disputes and finds that this genre of interventions “lead to little if any improvement, and

all too often erosion in the trajectory of democratic development.2” They argue that this

is because democratic and authoritarian leaders alike share a common interest in




                                                                                              5
preferring to deal with non-democratic target states. In the case of authoritarian regimes,

which they are argue are primarily concerned with providing private goods to

government insiders, non-democratic target regimes facilitate the transfer of resources to

insiders. In the case of democratic regimes, which they argue are primarily concerned

with providing public goods to their country’s citizens, non-democratic regimes in the

target state facilitate policy concessions that benefit the intervener’s citizens.



This paper advances the above literature in two ways. First, the widespread availability

of datasets on war and military interventions has led previous econometric studies to

focus almost exclusively on interventions in the context of wars, to the neglect of behind

the scenes interventions that were conducted by the secret services of the superpowers.

Second, while undeniably insightful, the literature on interventions has hitherto not

seriously addressed issues of reverse causality. This paper seeks to advance our

understanding of interventions by filling these gaps in the literature.



This paper also attempts to advance the literature on institutions in economics. This

literature is growing rapidly, partly of interest in its own right and partly as a side effect

of searching for instruments for institutions to use in empirical exercises assessing the

effects of institutions on other variables. Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) in a seminal

paper stress inequality as a key (negative) factor in the evolution of institutions in North

and South America; Easterly (2007), Easterly and Levine (2003), and Satyanath and

Subramanian (2007) confirm this for the worldwide sample. The famous work by

Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2005) stresses colonizing strategies as a historical determinant of

                                                                                                 6
institutions, using settler health conditions as a determinant of whether the colonizer

followed a settler colony strategy or an exploitative strategy. Mauro (1995), Easterly and

Levine (1997, 2003), and Alesina et al. (2003) focus on ethnic fractionalization as an

adverse factor inhibiting institutional development; Alesina et al. (2007) suggest that

colonial partitioning of ethnic groups and other forms of artificial boundary drawing

made things even worse. Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) also stress long run factors like

inequality, share of agriculture in production, and natural resource endowments in their

magisterial work on determinants of democracy. Our paper extends this literature by

focusing on a recent set of political shocks that influenced democracy – Cold War

interventions by the superpowers.



Our paper has a much more distant relation to the extensive branch of the literature which

looks at the success of foreign “peacekeeping” forces in ending wars (Doyle and

Sambanis, 2000, Gilligan and Stedman 2004, Weinstein 2005), which is in turn related to

the literature on the determinants of civil war (Collier and Hoeffler, 1998, 2001, and

2002, World Bank 2003, Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti, 2004) and the literature on

what to do about “failed states” (Collier 2007, Birdsall et al (2006), Weinstein et al.

(2004), Council on Foreign Relations (2005), and Brainard (2007)). Although we share

the interest in foreign intervention, our paper deals with a different subject than these

papers do -- we are looking at foreign interventions that are explicitly concerned with

leadership selection and maintenance rather than “peacekeeping”or fixing “failed states”.

Our results still may have some indirect relevance for this very different debate, however,

since both focus on the effects of foreign intervention.




                                                                                            7
3) Hypothesis on the relationship between superpower interventions and

democracy-



This paper attempts to sort out which of two theoretical perspectives finds greater support

in the Cold War data. To take the first, one may expect superpower governments to have

a preference for spreading their own form of government. The benefits of establishing

democracies overseas may then exceed the costs for a democratic but not for an

authoritarian superpower. From such a perspective interventions by a democratic

superpower could result in more democratic (less authoritarian) environments than

interventions by a non-democratic superpower.



However, it is also plausible that an inclination favoring the spread of democracy on the

part of a democratic superpower may be swamped by other, realpolitik related,

considerations. Interventions by both superpowers may be primarily aimed at repressing

threats to its security overseas (communist opponents in the case of the US, and non-

communist opponents in the case of the Soviet Union). Under such circumstances, the

survival in office of a superpower-installed chief executive plausibly hinges on providing

the superpower that installed him what it wants by way of repressive policies.

Repression of communists/anti-communists is plausibly easiest for a chief executive to

implement if he is unconstrained from seeking the approval of a large number of

domestic political actors prior to implementing the repressive measures. It is thus in the

interest of a superpower-installed chief executive to attempt to reduce the domestic

checks and balances on his power. It is not in the interest of any superpower (democratic




                                                                                             8
or undemocratic) which has placed a priority on repressing opponents overseas to oppose

such attempts at centralization of power, since checks and balances are likely to make

repression more difficult. Thus, from this perspective we may plausibly expect

interventions by democratic and authoritarian superpowers to lead to similar declines in

democracy.



Which of these perspectives finds more support in the data? The rest of this paper is

devoted to answering this question.



4) Data



The focus of this paper is on superpower interventions to install and prop up the leaders

of other countries during the Cold War. Recently declassified documents reveal that

most such Cold War interventions took the form of operations organized by the covert

services of the superpowers, namely the CIA/KGB. There is no pre-existing dataset that

comprehensively captures such operations. Recent contributions to the Cold War history

literature (much of which is based on recently declassified documents) make it possible

to identify which countries were subject to such interventions. We have thus relied on

this literature, supplemented by our own archival research, to construct a dataset of

superpower interventions to install and prop up leaders of other countries that includes

covert interventions. We offer citations to accompany every case that we have identified

as an intervention.




                                                                                            9
The variables in the dataset are as follows. Each variable has one variant which captures

a US intervention and one which captures a Soviet intervention:



1) ONSET- This variable is coded as one in the period in which a leader is installed in

office with the support of the covert services of a superpower. This may be either via a

coup or by providing slush funds for elections.



2) FAILED- Coded as one for all periods in which a superpower initiates efforts to

install a leader in office, but is unsuccessful in its efforts.



3) COUNTER-Coded as one for periods in which a superpower organizes

counterinsurgency operations for a leader who was not installed in office by the

superpower. (One may think of this as an exclusively counterinsurgency based

intervention.)



4) OFFSET-Coded as one for the first point of time after an onset in which a superpower

explicitly relinquishes its ability to select the leader of a country. This may be by force

(for example in the case of Iran in 1979) or voluntary (as in the case of Gorbachev and

Eastern European satellites in the late 1980s).



5) INTERMED-This variable captures superpower meddling in periods other than onset

and offset periods. It is coded as one for all periods between ONSET and OFFSET as

well as for periods coded as one for COUNTER.




                                                                                              10
6) INVASION-Coded as one for all periods in which a superpower army invades a

country and successfully installs a leader in office. (Covert onsets and invasions are not

necessarily mutually exclusive, since invasions and covert operations may be used

simultaneously to install a leader.)



7) INTERVENTION-This is our omnibus measure of successful superpower meddling in

the domestic affairs of other countries. (Success here refers to successfully installing a

leader via covert service operations, successfully organizing counterinsurgency

operations, successfully installing a leader after invading a country, or successfully

propping up a leader in office.) All country periods coded as one on either ONSET,

COUNTER, INVASION, or INTERMED, plus periods not covered by these variables

when the literature indicates a leader is depending heavily on superpower support for

survival in office (prop ups) are coded as ones. Note that offset periods are coded as prop

up periods (and thus as intervention periods) if the offset does not occur the very

beginning of a period, which is generally the case. This is so because the portion of the

offset period prior to the actual occurrence of the offset is logically a time when the

superpower has not relinquished control over leadership selection.



Our core analysis covers 127 countries (see Data Appendix A), of which 24 were subject

to leaders installed with CIA involvement and 16 to leaders installed with KBG/MGB

involvement. While the sample is very large we note that we are unable to handle a few




                                                                                             11
partitioned/reunified countries such as Pakistan and Yemen due to difficulties in

gathering clean data on controls for different segments of a national unit.



We are aware of the fact that we may be missing some “secret” interventions but we see

no reason why these omissions should be systematically biased in a way that helps our

results. If anything, the incentives for the superpowers to reveal an intervention should

be greatest if the outcome is positive from an institutional standpoint so, if anything, we

are likely to be misclassifying some interventions that had adverse outcomes as non-

interventions. Furthermore, a secret intervention is most likely to be ultimately revealed

in environments that ended up having strong transparent institutional environments.

This, of course, would only make it harder to find support for our hypotheses.



In order to provide time for the institutional effects of interventions to work themselves

out we conduct our main analysis in a panel setting with five year periods. The goal is to

see if an intervention in one five year period is associated with an improvement or

deterioration in democracy in the succeeding five year period. The Cold War may most

plausibly be claimed to have begun in 1947 with the announcement of the Truman

doctrine, and have ended in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, if we use

this entire period we are left with periods of uneven length. To ensure that all periods are

of equal length the first period for which we code interventions is 1950-54. The last

period for which we code interventions is 1985-89. In order to ensure that we do not lose

interventions in the 1947-49 period we classify these as having occurred in Period 1.3

3
 Note that not all interventions began with or ended with the Cold War. There are a small number of cases
of states where there was already superpower influence well before the Cold War began (American


                                                                                                       12
In conducting this analysis we are careful to ensure that we are not simply capturing a

correlation that results from interventions being aimed primarily at authoritarian regimes,

or by an automatic contemporaneous adjustment of the democracy score in response to an

external intervention. We rule out that we are capturing such effects by controlling for

the level of democracy in the period of the intervention, and observing the effect of the

intervention on democracy in the subsequent five year period. In addition we use

instruments to address the endogeneity of interventions to anticipated levels of

democracy. (Our precise strategy to address endogeneity is described in the next

section.)



With regard to our dependent variable, we use the two measures of democracy that are

most widely used in political science. The first, called REG, is from Przeworski and

colleagues and is a dummy variable which takes a value of 1 in the presence of an

authoritarian regime (Alvarez et al. 2000). The measure is behavioral in the sense that a

country is only classified as being democratic if it displays turnover in office following

an election. This procedure acts as a safeguard against counting rigged elections which

perpetuate the tenure of the incumbent as democratic elections. The second measure of

democracy that we use is the continuous measure from Polity.4 This is a subjective

measure that takes values from -10 to 10. Unlike the REG measure this measure is


influence in Liberia, Ethiopia, and gulf oil states), or where it continued after the Cold War ended
(continuing American support to Soeharto in Indonesia and Habre in Chad). In the former cases, we do not
show an ONSET with the beginning of the Cold War, and in the latter cases we do not show an OFFSET
with the end of the Cold War. We require hard evidence of superpower withdrawal to code an OFFSET
during or at the end of the Cold War.

  The data is available at http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/polity/.



                                                                                                      13
increasing in the degree of democracy. Since we are conducting a panel analysis using

five year periods, we use five year averages of these measures. (The REG measure thus

takes values between 0 and 1 depending on the proportion of years spent as an

authoritarian regime in a five year period.)



We use REG as our core measure of democracy and only use Polity for conducting

robustness checks. We do so because we believe that it is especially important to be

wary of subjective measures of democracy in the context of this project. The subjectivity

of Polity is a special concern for this paper given that Polity estimates are subjective

assessments from the perspective of the western bloc, which was of course one of the

participants in the Cold War. There is thus cause for concern that Polity may overstate

the degree of democracy in countries in which the United States intervened. There is no

such concern with respect to REG because it is behaviorally based, hinging on observed

turnover in government following an election, rather than based on subjective

assessments.



In addition to lagged democracy, we control for the main variables that have been

identified in the political science literature as influencing democracy. As Przeworski and

his colleagues have found, democracy is significantly influenced by per capita GDP

(Alvarez et al. 2000). We thus include log GDP per capita as a control variable. The

widest available coverage of GDP comes from the dataset created by Angus Maddison

(2003). This is of special interest to us because Maddison takes great pains to generate

GDP estimates for countries that were part of the Soviet bloc. Missing data from other




                                                                                           14
conventional sources is heavily skewed towards countries that experienced Soviet

interventions, which is obviously a serious problem for the subject of this paper. One

statistic which should reassure readers that our results are not driven by quirks in

Maddison’s approach to assessing GDP is that GDP values in his data set are highly

correlated to those of the widely used GDNGD (Growth Development Network Growth

Data) data set. (The correlation is 98%.) We also conduct robustness checks using GDP

data from GDNGD for reassurance.



While per capita GDP is the primary variable associated with democracy, Haggard and

Kaufmann have argued that bad economic times in general influence the propensity for

democracy (Haggard and Kaufman 1995). We thus also include controls for GDP

growth from Maddison and GDNGD. We additionally include a control variable

capturing the length of time since the last transition from democracy/dictatorship as a

means of addressing duration dependence. Continental dummies are always included,

given the propensity of some regions such as the Middle East for having authoritarian

regimes. In our instrumental variables regressions (described in the next section) we use

data for distance of each country’s capital from Moscow from Gleditsch and Ward

(2001). All regressions include dummies for each time period. Summary statistics are

presented in Appendix Table 1.




                                                                                          15
5) Identification strategy-



Identification is a serious issue for the question at hand. Interventions may be driven by

the institutional environment or by the same factors that contribute to worse institutions.

We adopt two strategies for addressing endogeneity. One captures between country

variation in the effects of interventions, while the second captures within country

variation. We describe these strategies below.



One strategy, which captures between country variation, relies on using instruments that

hinge on an explicit causal logic. As the instrument for US interventions we use the

distance of a country’s capital from Moscow. (We log this value to alleviate the effects

of outliers.) The reasoning behind this first stage regression is straightforward. Efforts

by the US to interfere in the politics of countries that are in the proximity of Moscow are

relatively likely to be perceived by the Soviet leadership as threatening to its security.

The US is thus most likely to anticipate stiff resistance from Moscow to interventions in

such countries, and US interventions are more likely to be located elsewhere. It follows

that the smaller the distance of a country’s capital from Moscow, the lower the likelihood

of a US intervention.5



While it is clear that distance from Moscow is not subject to reverse causality we must

also consider other ways in which this distance may affect democracy, and control for

5
 The above logic implies that an intervention by the US close to Moscow would be perceived as more
threatening than one that is close to Vladivostok. While this is plausible another potential instrument may
be provided by the distance from the nearest Soviet border. Unfortunately there is no reliable measure of




                                                                                                         16
them in order to satisfy the exclusion restriction. For instance, countries that are

extremely distant from Moscow may receive less investment from and trade less with the

Soviet Union, resulting in slower growth. Slower growth may, in turn, be associated with

the collapse of political regimes. We thus control for economic growth and per capita

GDP (in addition to lagged democracy) in all our specifications.



The analogous instrument to use for Soviet interventions would be distance from

Washington D.C. However, geography and history conspire to make this a poor indicator

of which potential Soviet interventions would be perceived as threatening to US security.

Specifically, ever since the Monroe doctrine of 1823 the United States has clearly

communicated that it considers any interventions in the Americas by other powers to be

unacceptable. South America happens to be an exceptionally long continent, which

means that many countries that are far from Washington D.C. are also ruled out as viable

targets for Soviet interventions thanks to the Monroe doctrine. The consequence is that it

is not possible to get a strong first stage for Soviet interventions using distance from

Washington D.C. as an instrument. We thus use an alternative instrumentation strategy

for Soviet interventions.



We use the US security perimeter as of the fall of Nazi Berlin (May 1945) as our

instrument for Soviet interventions. This perimeter is the boundary generated by the

Monroe Doctrine of 1823 (the Americas) and the relatively rapid collapse of the Nazi

eastern front (which subsequently limited the US sphere of influence in Europe), namely


distance from the closest border at this point in time. We ran regressions with a preliminary (as yet
unfinalised) version of a dataset that includes such data and got very similar results.


                                                                                                        17
the Americas and Europe west of Germany. We believe this historically generated

perimeter is not the consequence of reverse causality for the following reasons. This

perimeter clearly emerged as a consequence of factors long in the historical past (the

Monroe doctrine) and short term military considerations (anticipated Axis resistance on

the Western vs. Eastern fronts in World War II), and not as a consequence of the quality

of institutions in the countries included within the perimeter. Historians are in broad

agreement that the extent of the Soviet western advance in World War II was agreed

upon between Stalin and Roosevelt in Teheran (1943) and Yalta (early 1945) on the basis

of considerations of the most efficient means to topple the Nazis. Furthermore, the

perimeter as of May 1945 clearly did not emerge as a consequence of anticipated Soviet

expansionism. As the Cold War historian John Lewis Gaddis puts it:



           Roosevelt had built his whole strategy upon the expectation that the wartime
           alliance would survive the end of the war…Although concerned during the last
           months of his life about the increasing frequency of misunderstandings with the
           Russians, he at no point sought to contest the substantial expansion of Soviet
           influence in Europe and Asia that the end of the war would bring…Despite
           obvious differences in personality and style, Harry S. Truman continued
           Roosevelt’s policy upon coming into office… During his first months in office he
           firmly rejected proposals from Winston Churchill and some of his own advisors
           that would have denied the Russians previously agreed upon occupation zones in
           Central Europe and North East Asia. “I was having as much difficulty with Prime
           Minister Churchill as I was having with Stalin,” the new president noted in May
           of 1945. As late as the fall of that year, both Truman and his new secretary of
           state, James P. Byrnes, were still relying upon the establishment of a personal
           relationship with Stalin as the best way to overcome the difficulties that had
           already begun to emerge in the Soviet-American relationship.6


For our perimeter instrument we code all countries in the Americas and all Western

European countries excluding Greece and Finland as ones. Greece is coded as a zero

                                                                                          18
because it was only included as part of the perimeter with the announcement of the

Truman doctrine in 1947. Finland’s status, of course, remained ambiguous for years after

the end of World War II and was never entirely resolved until the end of the Cold War.

We code Asian countries as being outside the US security perimeter as of May 1945.

This is because there was considerable uncertainty about where the US considered its

perimeter to lie in Asia at this time. (Recall that the Japanese surrender still lay ahead by

several months. Also, a great deal of uncertainty existed even as late as in 1950, forcing

Acheson to make his fateful “clarifying” speech at the National Press Club on January

12.)



The causal logic for the perimeter instrument is also straightforward. We should expect

the Soviets to anticipate relatively high resistance from the United States for intervening

in a country that is inside the US’s historically established security perimeter. This

would make Soviet interventions outside the perimeter more likely, causing us to expect a

negative relationship between being within the US perimeter and Soviet meddling. Once

again we are careful to control for growth and per capita GDP since being within the US

perimeter may be associated with more trade and investment and therefore higher growth

and development (as the Marshall plan suggests), which in turn can help the quality of

institutions.



Do we additionally expect a negative effect of distance from Moscow on Soviet

interventions and a positive effect of the US security perimeter on US interventions? We

are less confident about these relationships for two reasons. A potential positive




                                                                                           19
relationship between Soviet interventions and proximity to Moscow may be washed out

by Soviet interventions in countries that are far from Moscow and also outside the US

perimeter. Likewise, a positive relationship between the US perimeter and US

interventions may be washed out by US interventions in countries outside the perimeter

that are far from Moscow. While not ruling out these alternative causal paths, our

identification strategy thus hinges on the former two proposed causal links rather than on

the latter two links.



The instruments described above are obviously invariant over time, which rules out the

use of country fixed effects. We address concerns about omitted variables bias by

controlling for the lagged value of the dependent variable. Note that by conducting our

analysis in a panel setting we are also improving considerably on a cross country analysis

by explicitly controlling for the effects of economic shocks which, as mentioned earlier,

have been found to affect the level of democracy. (We are effectively allowing the

predicted values of interventions to respond to changes in the values of time varying

control variables as well as to common shocks to the global economy.)

We conclude our description of this instrumentation strategy by noting that our

instruments offer the added strength of not being correlated with the condition of

institutions at the end of World War II since very few countries in the world were

democracies in May 1945.



Our second strategy to address endogeneity is aimed at capturing within country

variation. We instrument for interventions using the GMM estimator developed by




                                                                                          20
Blundell and Bond (1998). The estimator incorporates the lagged value of the dependent

variable on the right hand side. The estimator uses equations in first differences

(instrumented by extended lags of levels) as well as equations in levels (instrumented by

first differences). The Blundell and Bond estimator is thus referred to as the system

GMM estimator. The identification assumptions of this estimator are that transient errors

are serially uncorrelated, that initial conditions are predetermined, and that country

specific effects are uncorrelated with the differenced values of the right hand side

variables. We are careful to conduct tests of AR(2) in differences which must be

surmounted for the identification strategy to be valid. In addition we test for violations of

the exclusion restriction by using the Hansen overidentification test.

6) Results-



We begin in Table 1 by addressing endogeneity using the distance from Moscow and the

U.S security perimeter as of May 1945 as instruments for US and Soviet interventions.

Since we only have two instruments we can only include two endogenous variables for

interventions in this section of our analysis. The regressions in Table 1 thus capture the

effects of our omnibus measures of successful interventions, US INTERVENTION and

SOVIET INTERVENTION. In Table 2, where we use the multiple instruments offered

by the GMM technique, we assess the independent effects of the numerous intervention

variables listed in Section 4.



We begin Table 1 with the results for an OLS specification in which we place our core

measure of democracy (REG) on the left hand side, and control for the lagged dependent




                                                                                             21
variable, per capita GDP, GDP growth, duration dependence, continental dummies, and

time dummies (column 1). We then proceed to our core instrumental variables results.

Our interest is in seeing how an intervention in a given five year period affects

democracy in the subsequent five year period, and to see if this effect differs depending

on whether the intervening superpower is a democracy (the US) or a dictatorship (the

Soviet Union).



Column 1 of Table 1 shows that both US and Soviet interventions result in significantly

lower levels of democracy in the next five year period in an OLS setting. (Recall that the

REG measure is decreasing in democracy.) The point estimates for US and Soviet

interventions are statistically indistinguishable from each other (p=.99). We now check if

these results are robust to addressing endogeneity with the two instruments listed above.

Column 2 presents the second stage result of the same specification as column 1, with the

exception that US and Soviet interventions are instrumented by distance from Moscow

and the US security perimeter in May 1945. Corresponding first stage results are

presented in columns 1 and 2 of Appendix Table 2. The first stage results are in

accordance with our theoretical expectations. Distance from Moscow is positively

associated with US interventions. The US security perimeter and distance from Moscow

are negatively associated with Soviet interventions. The Cragg-Donald F-statistic is 14

(vs. a benchmark of 10), which suggests that the specification does not suffer from weak

instrument problems. The second stage results reveal that both US and Soviet

interventions are negatively associated with democracy in the following five year period

(column 1). US interventions are significant at the 1% level, while Soviet interventions




                                                                                          22
are significant at the 10% level. The substantive effect of a US intervention is to reduce

democracy by 36%, while the effect of a Soviet intervention is to reduce democracy by

33%. The point estimates are statistically indistinguishable from each other. (The p

value for the test for the equality of coefficients is .95). This is the core instrumental

variables result of this paper, which we now submit to various robustness checks.



In column 3 we include failed interventions in our definition of interventions, thereby

capturing the effects of all meddling (successful as well as unsuccessful). The new

intervention variables with this addition are called US INTERVENTION2 and SOVIET

INTERVENTION2. Column 3 shows that both US and Soviet interventions are still

associated with significant declines in democracy and the point estimates are once again

indistinguishable from each other (p=.81.). (The first stage results are very similar to

those observed for the column 2 specification and are displayed in columns 3 and 4 of

Appendix Table 2.)



The regressions presented so far use GDP and GDP growth data from Maddison. As

mentioned, this is the appropriate source for this paper because it is the only one which

offers adequate coverage of countries that lie within the Soviet bloc. (If we were to rely

on one of the other widely disseminated sources most of these countries would be

dropped from the analysis when controlling for the most significant alternative

determinants of democracy, which would leave us unable to accurately estimate the

effects of Soviet interventions.) While using alternative income and growth controls

effectively rules out comprehensively estimating the effects of Soviet interventions, it is




                                                                                             23
still useful to see if the core results for US interventions hold when we use GDP data

from another source. We conduct this robustness check using GDP and GDP growth data

from the Growth Development Network Growth Database (GDNGD). The consequence

of switching from Maddison to this source is that the sample size drops from 878 to 596.

The smaller sample size here is largely a consequence of missing observations for several

countries with Soviet interventions such as Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, North

Korea, Sudan, North Korea, Bulgaria, Poland, Somalia, and Afghanistan. In line with

this pattern of missing observations, we should expect the result for US interventions

alone to be robustly significant in GDNGD based specifications.7



Our results are in accord with this expectation. Columns 4 and 5 in Table 1 present

second stage results for specifications that are the same as those in columns 2 and 3, with

the exception that GDNGD controls replace Maddison. The first stages for US

interventions remain strong in these specifications. (See Appendix Table 2, columns 5-8.)

Unsurprisingly, given the pattern of missing data, the first stages for Soviet interventions

are much weaker with the GDNGD controls. As column 4 in Table 1 shows, US

interventions have a significant negative relationship with democracy in the next five

year period. In column 5 we include failed interventions in our definition of

interventions and the second stage results are substantially unchanged.



In columns 6-9 of Table 1 we conduct the same exercise as in columns 2-5, but using the

Polity measure of democracy. (The column 1 OLS result is robust to replacing REG with

7
  We are entirely unable to estimate the effects of Soviet military interventions and counterinsurgencies in
the GDNGD specifications on account of missing data for Soviet bloc countries.


                                                                                                          24
Polity and is available upon request.) As mentioned in Section 4, we do not use Polity as

our core measure of democracy because this is a subjective measure (unlike REG which

is behavioral). Additionally the subjective assessments are entirely made from one side

of the East-West divide, which generates the possibility of bias which could be

problematic when comparing the effects of Soviet and US interventions. We have special

reasons for concern about the subjectivity of the Polity measure here because we have

several cases where Polity codes countries subjectively as democracies following a

period of US intervention, while REG codes these same countries behaviorally as

dictatorships in the same period.8 In contrast to 22 discrepancies of this type, there are

only two instances of such discrepancies following Soviet interventions. Other

discrepancies between the two variables are limited in scope (there are three cases of

REG coding a democracy and Polity a dictatorship in the wake of a US intervention score

of one, and two instances of the same in the wake of a Soviet intervention score of one).

Overall, we should thus expect the negative results for US interventions to be weaker for

the Polity measure than with the REG measure.



Columns 6 and 7 use the Maddison controls, and use the INTERVENTION and

INTERVENTION2 variables respectively. The strong first stages are displayed in

Appendix Table 3, columns 1-4. The second stage estimate in Column 6 shows that

Soviet interventions are negatively associated with democracy. (Recall that unlike the

REG measure, the Polity measure is increasing in democracy.) US interventions fall

short of significance (p=.13), but the point estimate is statistically indistinguishable from

8
 The countries are Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, South
Africa, Syria, Taiwan, South Korea, Laos, and the Philippines.


                                                                                                      25
that for Soviet interventions (p=.25). Column 7 shows that including failed interventions

in the definition of interventions leaves the results essentially unchanged.



In columns 8 and 9 we repeat the specifications from columns 6 and 7 with the exception

that we replace the Maddison controls with GDNGD. The first stages for US

interventions are once again strong. The first stages for Soviet interventions are weaker,

which is to be expected given the pattern of missing observations in GDNGD. (See

Appendix Table 3, columns 5-8.) The pattern of missing observations in GDNGD should

bias against finding a significant result for the Soviet intervention variables.

Furthermore, the difference between REG and Polity codings in countries with US

interventions should cause us to expect a weaker result for US interventions with Polity

rather than with REG. Both of these expectations are borne out. While US interventions

emerge as significant in both columns 8 and 9, the substantive effects (in terms of the

percentage decline in democracy) are smaller in the Polity based specifications than in

the REG based specifications (columns 4 and 5).9 The coefficient for Soviet

interventions is not significant, but is still statistically indistinguishable from that for US

interventions in both cases (p of .79 and .84 respectively).



In Table 2 we check if our core instrumental variables result, which was presented in

column 2 of Table 1, is robust to addressing endogeneity in a different way, namely via

the Blundell and Bond GMM technique. In column 1 of Table 2 we present the GMM

analogue of our core instrumental variables result. The AR(2) and Hansen tests do not

indicate problems with identification; the null hypothesis of no AR(2) cannot be rejected




                                                                                              26
(p=.64), and the same is the case for the fulfillment of the exclusion restriction (Hansen

test p value of 1.) Similar to what we observed in our core IV regression, both US and

Soviet interventions emerge as having significant negative effects on democracy.



Since the GMM technique is based on using multiple lags of levels and differences as

instruments, we are not limited to only including two endogenous intervention variables

in our GMM analysis. In GMM we can thus separately examine the independent effects

of onsets, offsets, counterinsurgency support, and military invasions. We now thus focus

on estimating the independent effects of these variables.



Column 2 shows that both US and Soviet onsets are negatively associated with

democracy (at the 5% and 10% levels respectively). US and Soviet offsets are positively

associated with democracy (also at the 5% and 10% level respectively). Failed

interventions and counterinsurgency support have no effect on democracy. US military

interventions are positively associated with democracy here, but this latter result turns out

not be robust.10



In column 3 we address the question of whether the negative effects of onsets and the

positive effects of offsets are robust to controlling for the periods between onsets and

offsets in addition to counterinsurgencies. The variables USA INTERMED and SOVIET

INTERMED capture the effects of these periods. The results for US and Soviet onsets

9
 The substantive effects here are approximately 26% with Polity as opposed to 36% with REG.
10
  This result is based on a very small sample of invasions (Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Panama).
As we will see later, this latter result also does not survive our robustness check using the Polity measure of
democracy.



                                                                                                            27
and offsets remain robust to the addition of the INTERMED variables as controls. The

point estimates for onsets are again very similar to those seen earlier. The substantive

effect of the US installing a leader is to reduce the level of democracy in the next five

year period by 18%. The corresponding effect of a Soviet onset is 23%. We are unable

to reject the null hypothesis that the two point estimates are equal to each other (p=.70).

We consider these to be our core GMM results.



As far as the INTERMED variables themselves are concerned, most of the changes in

democracy scores in the case of US interventions appear to be occurring in the immediate

wake of onsets and offsets. When it comes to Soviet interventions the relative sizes of

the point estimates also indicate that onsets and offsets generate larger marginal effects

on democracy than an intermed year, although the SOVIET INTERMED variable does

achieve significance (unlike USA INTERMED).



In column 4 we check if the results for our most expansive specification (the one with the

INTERMED controls) are robust to replacing the REG measure with the Polity measure

of democracy on the left hand side. A decrease in the Polity measure indicates a decline

in democracy. We note that identification here is less robust than with REG. (The null

hypothesis of no AR(2) cannot be rejected at the 95% level, but is on the border of

rejection at the 90% level.) The results for US and Soviet onsets are robust. From a

quantitative perspective a USA onset is associated with a 19% decline in democracy,

while a Soviet onset is associated with a 22% decline in democracy, which is very similar

to what we observed with the REG measure. These point estimates are also statistically




                                                                                             28
indistinguishable from each other. (The p for the test for the equality of coefficients is

.84). (The earlier result for US military invasions does not survive this robustness check

and the sign is in fact reversed.)



The regressions presented so far in Table 2 use data for GDP and GDP growth from

Maddison. As mentioned, this is the appropriate source for this paper because it is the

only one which offers adequate coverage of countries within the Soviet bloc. Just as we

did in Table 1 we now check for the consequences of using GDP and GDP growth data

from the Growth Development Network Growth Database (GDNGD) in place of

Maddison. Recall that we should expect the result for US interventions alone to be

robustly significant in GDNGD based specifications.11



Our findings are once again in accordance with this expectation. Columns 5-8 are

analogous to columns 1-4, with the only difference being that GDNGD controls replace

Maddison controls. Column 5 shows that our omnibus measure of US interventions is

negatively associated with democracy (as per the REG measure). Column 6 shows that

when we consider separately consider onsets, offsets, military invasions, and

counterinsurgency support, US onsets are negatively associated with democracy. Soviet

onsets are insignificant but display the same sign as US onsets, while US offsets, Soviet

offsets, and US military invasions are significantly associated with more democracy.

(Recall the very small number of US military invasions, which should cause us to treat

this latter result with caution.) Once again we are unable to reject the null hypothesis of

11
  We are entirely unable to estimate the effects of Soviet military interventions and counterinsurgencies in
the GDNGD specifications on account of missing data for Soviet bloc countries.


                                                                                                          29
equality between the US and Soviet onset point estimates (p=.74). In column 7 we use

the INTERMED control variable (which includes periods between onsets and offsets in

addition to including counterinsurgencies) and find that the results are similar. In column

8 we replace the REG measure with the Polity measure of democracy. While the

negative effect of US onsets remains significant, Soviet onsets also emerge as significant

in this specification and the point estimates are again statistically indistinguishable from

one another.



Overall, we thus find that US and Soviet interventions during the Cold War had

significant adverse consequences for democracy. We also find that the interventions of

the two superpowers were similar in their effects irrespective of the fact that one was a

democracy and the other was not.



7) Conclusion



In this paper we have demonstrated that superpower interventions in the domestic politics

of other countries during the Cold War had substantial adverse consequences for

democracy in the intervened countries. How far can one extrapolate from the history of

the Cold War to interventions justified by the war on terror? We have no rigorous

empirical basis on which to calibrate the relevance of the past to the present, but to the

extent that commonalities exist some qualified conclusions can be made. To the extent

that US leaders continue to share the Cold War world view that repressing anti-US

groups overseas enhances security, the US government has incentives to install leaders




                                                                                             30
who have powerful incentives to repress anti-US groups in their countries. It is clear that

under these conditions our findings offer a negative prognosis for democracy in

intervened countries.
