1         Introduction
Existing studies of the World income distribution decompose output diÂ®erences across coun-
tries into a component due to diÂ®erences in observed factors of production and a component
due to diÂ®erences in overall eÂ±ciency, or total factor productivity (TFP). These studies tend
to Â¯nd that poor countries have relatively low TFP, i.e. they are ineÂ±cient producers of
goods and services. Since total factor productivity is factor neutral, this means that poor
countries use all of their inputs ineÂ±ciently. Indeed, by construction the eÂ±ciencies of any
two factors, e.g. skilled and unskilled labor, are perfectly positively correlated. Figure 1
depicts the relationship between the eÂ±ciencies of skilled and unskilled labor implied by the
TFP approach to cross-country diÂ®erences in technology.
     This paper investigates an alternative framework where, rather than an overall level of
total factor productivity, countries are characterized by diÂ®erent eÂ±ciencies of three diÂ®erent
factors: skilled labor, unskilled labor, and capital. Far from conÂ¯rming the perfect positive
correlation predicted by the TFP approach, our evidence is strongly suggestive of a negative
correlation between the eÂ±ciencies of skilled and unskilled labor (and between the eÂ±ciencies
of capital and unskilled labor): countries that are the most eÂ±cient users of skilled labor
and capital also tend to be the least eÂ±cient users of unskilled labor. In other words, we Â¯nd
that the cross-country pattern of relative eÂ±ciencies looks more like Figure 2 than Figure 1.
     It also turns out that relative eÂ±ciencies are systematically related to relative factor
endowments: countries that are abundant in unskilled labor are relatively eÂ±cient at using
unskilled labor, while skilled-labor rich countries are relatively eÂ±cient at using skilled labor
and capital. This motivates us to propose and estimate a model of appropriate technol-
ogy, whereby Â¯rms in each country optimally choose their technology from a large menu
of \blueprints." The choice of blueprint maps into a particular realization of the vector of
eÂ±ciencies of the three inputs. Hence, Â¯rms in countries with a relatively large endowment
of skilled workers will tend to choose skilled-labor (and capital) complementary technolo-
gies, while countries with more abundant unskilled labor will tend to operate unskilled-labor
complementary technologies. In selecting the optimal technology, each country's choice set
is bounded by a technological frontier, i.e. a locus of non-dominated technologies. Along this
frontier increases in the eÂ±ciency of skilled labor and capital come at the cost of declines in
the eÂ±ciency of unskilled labor. The observed negative correlations among the eÂ±ciencies of
diÂ®erent factors emerges as diÂ®erent countries choose diÂ®erent points along their frontiers.1
    1
        Note that the TFP approach generally implies that there is a unique best technology: the one used by

                                                       1
       For the World as a whole, the location of this frontier depends on the current state
of technological knowledge. By introducing new blueprints that dominate some of the pre-
exisiting blueprints on the frontier, technological progress shifts this locus out. However, each
country's frontier might diÂ®er from those of other countries for a variety of technological,
institutional, and perhaps even cultural idiosyncracies that lead to diÂ®erences in the set of
blueprints countries can implement. Our model captures these diÂ®erences by allowing for
country-speciÂ¯c barriers to technology adoption. We Â¯nd such barriers to be quantitatively
very important. The technology frontiers of low-income countries are estimated to generally
lie below the technology frontiers of high-income countries, indicating that { as in the TFP
approach { barriers to technology adoption remain an important determinant of diÂ®erences
in per-capita income. Indeed, observed diÂ®erences in endowments can account for an even
smaller share of the cross-country income variance than implied by the TFP approach. The
reason for this seemingly paradoxical result is that the appropriate choice of technology
dampens the eÂ®ects of diÂ®erences in factor endowments.
     A variety of papers have argued that diÂ®erent technologies may display diÂ®erent de-
grees of skill- or unskill- bias. For example, Katz and Murphy (1992), Berman, Bound and
Griliches (1994), Kruger (1993), Acemoglu (1998), Caselli (1999), and several others have
made the skilled-labor bias of recently developed technologies the centerpiece of explanations
for the increase in wage inequality in many countries in the 1980s and 1990s. Also, Bartel
and Lichtenberg (1987), Dunne and Schmitz (1995), Allen (1996), Doms, Dunne and Troske
(1997), Dunne, Haltiwanger and Troske (1997), and others have documented with plant or
Â¯rm level data that relative employment and relative wages of skilled workers vary system-
atically with the type of technology used. The new facts we uncover suggest that something
similar is taking place at the country level.
       The idea that countries with diÂ®erent factor endowments will use diÂ®erent technolo-
gies was Â¯rst formalized by Atkinson and Stiglitz (1969), who thus gave rise to a tradition on
\appropriate technology." This literature has been recently revived by Diwan and Rodrick
(1991), Basu and Weil (1998), and Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1999).2 Our contribution is
especially close to Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1999) in that both papers focus on the role of the
relative endowments of skilled and unskilled labor as the key determinant of each country's
appropriate technology. However, in Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1999) developing countries are
the country with the highest level of TFP. In other words, in the space of eÂ±ciency levels of diÂ®erent inputs,
the technology frontier is a singleton, and all countries but one lie inside the frontier.

forced to use the same technology as the developed ones - as R&D is targeted towards the
needs of the countries with a large endowment of skilled labor. Instead, in our model all
countries choose the technology most appropriate given their factor supplies.
       The debate on the relative importance of factor endowments and productivity in ex-
plaining cross-country income diÂ®erences started with Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992), and
featured contributions by, among others, Islam (1995), Caselli, Esquivel and Lefort (1996),
Klenow and Rodriguez (1997), and Hall and Jones (1997). All these studies augment the
production function by human capital, and use a TFP approach to diÂ®erences in technolo-
gies. The emerging view attributes to (unexplained) TFP diÂ®erences roughly 50% of the
responsibility for GDP diÂ®erences. Besides deviating from the TFP approach, our paper
diÂ®ers from these contributions in that it models the choice of technology as depending on
observable inputs. As mentioned above, it turns out that this approach leads to a deepening
of the puzzle: diÂ®erences in factor endowments explain an even smaller share of diÂ®erences
in output.
       Our paper is also closely related to work by TreÂ°er (1993), who has argued that
country-speciÂ¯c augmentation of factor supplies (which can be interpreted as country-speciÂ¯c
eÂ±ciency levels) helps explain jointly the pattern of trade in factor services and cross-country
diÂ®erences in factor prices. A by-product of his technique is a full set of estimates of eÂ±ciency
levels for each country and each factor, i.e. something analogous to the set of estimates we
obtain. However, TreÂ°er's disaggregation of the labor aggregate is very diÂ®erent from ours,
so the two sets of estimates are not easily compared. The two study, however, share the
basic conclusion that non-factor neutral technology diÂ®erences across countries are critical
to Â¯t international data.3
       In Section 2 we present some initial evidence suggesting that countries are typically
observed to trade oÂ® the eÂ±ciency of one factor against another. In Section 3 we formalize
a model in which countries choose a technology from a technology frontier, and we estimate
this model using cross-country data on per-worker income, physical capital, skill-premia,
and labor endowments. We then discuss the implications of our estimates. In Section 4 we
perform a robustness check, and Section 5 concludes.

      See, however, Repetto and Ventura (1998) for an interesting critique of the TreÂ°er method.

2     Relative EÂ±ciency of Inputs
The goal of this section is to uncover cross-country patterns in the behavior of the eÂ±ciency
of unskilled labor, skilled labor, and capital. Studies based on Cobb-Douglas speciÂ¯cations
of production { for which there is no distinction between the eÂ±ciency of the diÂ®erent inputs
{ tend to show that overall eÂ±ciency is highly positively correlated with per-capita income.
These Â¯ndings are usually interpreted as showing that poorer countries use \backward,"
\inferior," or \inappropriate" technologies. In a more general framework in which diÂ®erent
inputs are allowed to have diÂ®erent eÂ±ciencies, this interpretation would lead us to expect
poor countries to have low levels of eÂ±ciency of all inputs relative to rich countries, or that
these levels of eÂ±ciency are positively correlated across countries. In this section we present
some evidence that just the opposite might be true.


2.1    Measurement of Relative EÂ±ciencies
To compute diÂ®erent levels of eÂ±ciency for diÂ®erent inputs into production, we postulate
a production function of the form proposed by Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante
(2000):
                                                                            Â¾   1
                         Y i = [(Aiu Liu )Â¾ + ((Ais Lis )Â½ + (Aik K i )Â½ ) Â½ ] Â¾ ;         (1)

where Â¾ < 1 and Â½ < 1. In equation (1) Y i is GDP per worker in country i, Liu , Lis , and
K i are per-worker inputs of unskilled labor, skilled labor, and capital, Aiu is the eÂ±ciency
of unskilled labor in country i, Ais is the eÂ±ciency of skilled labor, and Aik is the eÂ±ciency
of capital. The parameters Â¾ and Â½ are assumed to be common across countries, while the
eÂ±ciency levels Aiu , Ais , and Aik can diÂ®er.
      Equation (1) is a fairly general speciÂ¯cation of the production process. It allows
skilled and unskilled labor to be imperfect substitutes, and { even more importantly { it
allows technological change to augment unskilled labor, skilled labor, and capital diÂ®erently.
The imperfect substitutability of the two labor aggregates and the diÂ®erential eÂ®ect of tech-
nologies on them accord well with the wide changes in the skill premum that have recently
been observed in the US and many other countries. The widely popular Cobb-Douglas pro-
duction function is nested in (1) as the special case in which both Â¾ and Â½ tend to 0. Equation
(1) also allows for one of the labor aggregates to be more complementary with capital than
the other. SpeciÂ¯cally, if Â¾ > Â½ then this production function exhibits capital-skill comple-
mentarity, in the sense that a rise in the capital stock raises the marginal productivity of

                                                    4
skilled labor more than it raises the marginal productivity of unskilled labor.4
        Assume that production of output takes place in perfectly competitive markets. Then
in each country the marginal productivity of capital must equal ri , which is the real interest
rate plus the rate of depreciation on physical capital:
                                                          Â¾   1                                 Â¾
       ri = [(Aiu Liu )Â¾ + ((Ais Lis )Â½ + (Aik K i )Â½ ) Â½ ] Â¾ Â¡1 ((Ais Lis )Â½ + (Aik K i )Â½ ) Â½ Â¡1 (Aik K i )Â½Â¡1 Aik :      (2)

Furthermore, from the condition that each of the two wage rates, wsi and wui , equals the
marginal productivity of the corresponding labor aggregate we get:
                                                                       Â¾
                                  wsi   ((Ais Lis )Â½ + (Aik K i )Â½ ) Â½ Â¡1 (Ais Lis )Â½Â¡1 Ais
                                      =                                                     :                               (3)
                                  wui                  (Aiu Liu )Â¾Â¡1 Aiu

Given data on labor endowments, output, and factor prices for a given country, and a choice
of the parameters Â¾ and Â½, equations (1), (2) and (3) constitute a system of 3 equations in
the 3 unknowns Aiu ; Ais and Aik .5 Essentially, then, for a given speciÂ¯cation of the production
function, along with observations for output (GDP), the inputs into production (unskilled
labor, skilled labor, and capital), and prices (the skilled wage premium and the real interest
rate), we determine the eÂ±ciency of each input such that a model with perfectly competitive
markets is consistent with all these observations. Solving this system for each of a sample of
countries allows one to examine the observed cross-country relationship among the relative
eÂ±ciencies of unskilled labor, skilled labor, and capital.6
   4
       Capital-skill complementarity has long been recognized as a potential feature of the production function.
A considerable body of plant- or industry-level evidence exists to support this conjecture. See, e.g., Griliches
(1969), Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994), Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante (2000), Dunne,
Haltiwanger and Troske (1997), Doms, Dunne and Troske (1997), and Caselli (1999). Flug and Hercowitz
(2000) Â¯nd evidence of capital-skill complementarity in cross-country data. We will see below that in our
preferred estimates Â¾ and Â½ are approximately equal, which is inconsistent with capital-skill complementarity.
The diÂ®erent result may be due to the fact that our K is total capital, while these studies focus on equipment.

       Diamond, McFadden, and Rodriguez (1978) show that time-varying (country-varying) elasticities of
substitution cannot be separately identiÂ¯ed from time-varying (country-varying) eÂ±ciency parameters. We

                                                                  5
2.2     The Data
Data for Y i and K i are obtained from Hall and Jones (1999): Y i is GDP per worker in
international dollars (i.e. PPP adjusted) and K i is an estimate of the real per-worker capital
stock obtained through a version of the perpetual-inventory method. The underlying data for
both series come from Summers and Heston (1991). In order to construct Liu and Lis we use
data collected by Barro and Lee (1993). The data break down the population of each country
into seven categories: no education, some primary, completed primary education, some
secondary, completed secondary education, some higher, and completed higher education.
Our baseline experiments construct Liu as an aggregate of workers with no education and
with some primary education, while Lis includes all other groups. Hence, we treat basic
literacy as the key requirement for relatively skilled-labor complementary technologies. This
particular choice does not turn out to be critical. We also perform many of our computations
by including in Liu all workers with less than high-school completed, and we Â¯nd no major
change in results.7 The data for Y i and K i are for the year 1988, while the data for Lis and
Liu are for 1985.
        To construct cross-country data for wsi =wui we use the Mincerian coeÂ±cients collected
by Bils and Klenow (1998). The Bils and Klenow data report the coeÂ±cient from regressing
log-wages on schooling years. This number can be interpreted as the percentage wage gain
associated with an extra year spent in school. Hence, if Â¯ i is the Mincerian rate of return,
and n is the diÂ®erence in schooling years between workers in Lis and Liu , we estimate wsi =wui
as exp(Â¯ i n).8 Finally, there is no reliable cross-country data on ri . We therefore assume that
follow the literature (e.g. Weitzman, 1970, Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Violante, 2000) in getting
around this by assuming that Â¾ and Â½ do not vary across countries. DuÂ®y and Papageorgiou (2000) show
that a CES speciÂ¯cation Â¯ts the cross-country data better than a Cobb-Douglas, but they also present
some evidence that elasticities of substitution vary across countries. However, their speciÂ¯cation diÂ®ers
considerably from ours, as theirs features only two inputs, and factor-neutral technology diÂ®erences.
   7
     In constructing the Liu and Lis aggregates there arises the problem of the weights to be assigned to the
educational achievement sub-categories. How many more units of eÂ±ciency does a worker with a college
education contribute to Lis relative to a worker with a high-school diploma? There is no entirely satisfying
solution to this problem. Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1999) give equal weight to all categories, but this seems
unrealistic. As we describe below we have country-level data on the returns to one extra year of education,
so we weigh education sub-groups by combining these data with unpublished country-level data on length
in years of each schooling level (collected by Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee). This amounts to assuming
that log-wages are linear in years of schooling both within and between the sub-categories constituting Liu
and Lis :
   8
     When we measure Liu by the bottom two educational sub-groups (no education or some primary) we

                                                     6
physical capital is perfectly mobile across countries, so that there is a common world gross
rate of return r. We set this common interest rate to the historically relevant value of 0:12.
We report below on a robustness check using alternative data in which ri sharply declines
as per-capita income rises. There are 52 countries with complete data for Y i , K i , Liu , Lis ,
and wsi =wui ; this dataset is reproduced in Table A1.
        Table 1 reports some basic statistics from the data set. In this sample of countries
output per worker in the richest country is 19 times higher than that in the poorest country.
The ratio of the supply of skilled workers to unskilled workers ranges from 0.32 to 36.11.
Hence, our construction of the two labor aggregates implies a wide variation in the fraction
of skilled vs. unskilled workers around the world. As for the skilled wage premium, in some
countries skilled workers receive only a 10 percent higher wage rate than unskilled workers,
whereas in other countries skilled workers receive over 3 times as much as a typical unskilled
woker. Note also that, as expected, output is strongly positively correlated with both capital
and the relative supply of skilled labor. As Bils and Klenow have documented, output is
negatively correlated with the skilled wage premium. Not surprisingly, then, the relative
supply of skilled labor is negatively correlated with the skilled wage premium. Finally, the
skilled-labor wage bill relative to the unskilled-labor wage bill is positively correlated with
output, an observation we will build upon in the next section.


2.3     Results
Table 2 summarizes the results of computing eÂ±ciency levels for unskilled labor, skilled labor,
and capital with the methodology and data described above. The exercise is repeated for a
wide range of values of Â¾ and Â½, and each row of the table corresponds to a particular choice
of these parameters.
       The second, third, and fourth columns report cross-country correlations among Au ,
As , and Ak . The striking Â¯nding from Table 2 is that for almost all choices of Â¾ and Â½ at
least one of the correlations between the eÂ±ciencies of the diÂ®erent inputs is negative, and
large in absolute value. For moderately high values of Â¾ countries that use unskilled labor
eÂ±ciently also appear to use skilled labor eÂ±ciently. However, they use capital relatively
set n = 4, because this is the shortest duration of primary school across the countries in the sample. This
might seem a small number but keep in mind that { by the aggregation procedure described in the previous
footnote { Liu and Lis are in units of workers with no schooling and with just a primary school diploma,
respectively. When we include all groups with less than a high-school diploma in Liu the two aggregates are
in units of workers with a primary and a secondary school diploma, respectively, and n = 5.
                                                    7
ineÂ±ciently. For anything less than moderately high values of Â¾, instead, countries that are
eÂ±cient at using unskilled labor are ineÂ±cient at using both skilled labor and capital. We
view this overwhelming prevalence of negative correlations as suggestive of the existence of
a Technology Frontier. Along this frontier increases in the eÂ±ciency of one input come at
the cost of losses of eÂ±ciency of another input.9
       In the rest of the paper we develop and estimate a simple model of technology choice
that rationalizes these Â¯ndings. As prelude and motivation for some of our modeling choices,
the last two columns of Table 2 report additional results that highlight important features of
the data. In the sixth column we report the correlation between ln(Ais =Aiu ), and the relative
supplies of the two labor types, ln(Lis =Liu ). For all values of Â¾ > 0 (Â¾ < 0) we Â¯nd a strong
positive (negative) relationship: the relative eÂ±ciency of skilled labor is strongly positively
related to the relative supply of skilled workers if the skilled-unskilled elasticity is less than
1 (Â¾ > 0), and negatively if the elasticity is greater than 1 (Â¾ < 0). Either way, this result
suggests to us that the heterogeneity in technology uncovered in Table 2 is driven by factor
supplies, and supports the choice of an appropriate technology model.
       In the last column (denoted \Frac. Dom.") is the fraction of countries that use a
technology that is dominated by the technology of at least one other country in the sample.
Country i0 s technology is dominated by country j 0 s if Aiz < Ajz for every z (= u; s; k). The
fraction of countries using dominated technologies varies considerably with the values of Â¾
and Â½ (from 14 to 79 percent for the values in Table 2). It is clear that only rarely we observe
the pattern implied by the TFP approach, whereby all countries but one use less-than-best
practice technologies. This further supports an appropriate technology explanation. On the
other hand, it is clear that several countries do use inferior technologies. A simple model of
technology choice where all countries have access to the same set of technologies would fail
to capture this important feature of the data. Hence, the model we propose below features
potential country-speciÂ¯c barriers to technology adoption.
   9
     Are there values of Â¾ and Â½ that seem more relevant than others? The only estimate that we are aware
of is due to Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Violante (2000) who place Â¾ at 0:36 and Â½ at Â¡0:67. With these
numbers we have that Corr(Au ; As ) = Â¡:27, Corr(Au ; Ak ) = Â¡:31, and Corr(As ; Ak ) = :11. These estimates
of Â¾ and Â½, however, are obtained from US time series data, they are based on a college vs. high-school
criterion for construction of Lu and Ls (while our assiÂ¯cation is based on basic literacy), and they include
only equipment as capital (while our Â¯gures incluse equipment and structures). Hence, it is not obvious that
these particular numbers are necessarily relevant for our purposes.

3     Endogenous Choice of Technology
In this section we lay out a simple model in which Â¯rms in a given country choose from
a \menu" of available technologies (blueprints) the one that maximizes their proÂ¯ts given
factor prices. This model is consistent with the facts of Table 2. Estimating this model
allows us to: (i) obtain an estimate of the parameters Â¾ and Â½, so that it is possible to
determine which particular row of Table 2 is the empirically relevant one; (ii) characterize
the set of technologies available to each country in the sample; and (iii) obtain quantitative
measures of the role of barriers to technology adoption in explaining cross-country income
diÂ®erences.


3.1    The Model
We continue to assume that in each country competitive Â¯rms obtain output according to the
production function (1). Capital continues to move freely across countries so that the Â¯rst
order conditions (2) and (3) for optimal choices of capital and labor inputs must still hold.
However, we now add to the model a choice of technology. SpeciÂ¯cally, instead of treating
Ais , Aiu , and Aik as given, each Â¯rm in country i faces a menu of feasible (As ; Au ; Ak ) triples.
We have in mind Â¯rms choosing from a set of available blueprints, where each blueprint
describes a particular method of obtaining output from skilled labor, unskilled labor, and
capital. DiÂ®erent methods imply diÂ®erent values for the triple (As ; Au ; Ak ). For example, a
Â¯rm might produce cars in an assembly line operated by blue-collar workers wielding hand
tools; or in a computer-controlled plant mainly operated by engineers. The former technology
might be expected to imply relatively high Au and low As and Ak ; the latter, low Au and
high As and Ak .
       Because (at a given point in time) scientiÂ¯c and technical knowledge are not unlimited,
the set of available blueprints is bounded. The size of the set is further reduced if a country
faces additional barriers (e.g. institutional or cultural) to technology adoption. Formally, this
means that the set of feasible (As ; Au ; Ak ) combinations is bounded. We therefore describe
the set of feasible technologies for country i by the relationships:
                                                       Â¡ Â¢!
                                   (Ais )! â ai0 Â¡ ai1 Aiu ;                                     (4)
                                                      Â¡ Â¢!
                                   (Aik )! â bi0 Â¡ bi1 Aiu ;                                     (5)

where ! > 0, ai0 > 0, ai1 > 0, bi0 > 0, bi1 > 0. On the boundary of the feasible menu
(the technology frontier) technologies involve a trade-oÂ® between unskilled labor and skilled
                                               9
labor and between unskilled labor and capital. Clearly, no Â¯rm will choose a dominated
technology so combinations of (As ; Au ; Ak ) that are not on the frontier are irrelevant. Notice
that the parameters of the frontier are country-speciÂ¯c (except !): we do this to allow for
country-speciÂ¯c barriers to technology adoption.
       Since equations (4)-(5) describe monotonic relations between As and Au and between
Ak and Au , the optimal choice of technology is found by maximizing proÂ¯ts with respect to
Au ; subject to (4)-(5). The Â¯rst order condition is:

                                       @Y i   @Y i dAis   @Y i dAik
                                            =Â¡ i        Â¡           :                                        (6)
                                       @Aiu   @As dAiu @Aik dAiu

This condition says that at an optimum a unit increase in Aiu has no eÂ®ect on output: the
increase through larger eÂ±ciency of unskilled workers (left hand side) is completely oÂ®set by
the corresponding decline through lower eÂ±ciency of skilled workers and capital.
       Using the Â¯rst order conditions with respect to Liu , Lis , and K i , equation (6) can be
rewritten as:                                                Âµ         Â¶!                  Âµ         Â¶!
                                                                 Aiu                           Aiu
                                 wui Liu   =   wsi Lis ai1                  +   rK i bi1                     (7)
                                                                 Ais                           Aik
To interpret this equation, it helps to think of two special cases. Suppose, Â¯rst, that bi1 = 0.
Recall that ai1 > 0 and ! > 0. This relationship then says that in equilibrium countries with
a relatively large skilled-labor wage bill will tend to choose relatively skill-complementary
technologies. Countries that have a large relative cost of production due to skilled labor
(the skilled labor wage bill) will Â¯nd it advantageous to implement technologies that save on
skilled labor. Recall that, as shown in Table 1, rich countries tend to have a large fraction of
their wage bill going to skilled labor (as measured by ws Ls =wu Lu ) { even though they have a
low skill premium (as measured by ws =wu ). For the other special case, suppose that ai1 = 0.
Recall here that bi1 > 0 and ! > 0. In this case this relationship says that in equilibrium
countries with a relatively large expense due to capital will tend to choose technologies that
raise the relative eÂ±ciency of their capital stock. The intermediate case in which ai1 > 0 and
bi1 > 0 is then some combination of these two cases.10
  10
       The existence of a solution to the Â¯rm's problem, and hence of an equilibrium given a world interest rate,
follows from the continuity of the objective function and compactness of the constraint set. The uniqueness
of a solution may depend on values of the parameters of the model. Indeed, for some parameter values the
objective function as it depends on Aiu (using eqs. (4) and (5) to substitute out Ais and Aik ) may become
convex over some range. We have checked (numerically) that at the estimated parameter values the solution
is indeed a global optimum and is unique.

                                                                  10
3.2        Estimation of the Model
We now turn the theoretical model into a statistical model in order to obtain estimates of
the unknown parameters. We assume that the country-speciÂ¯c parameters of the technology
frontier are realizations from log-normal distributions. In particular, our statistical model
assumes:
                                                    i                        i
                                        ai0 = a0 e"s ;           bi0 = b0 e"k
                                                    i                        i
                                        ai1 = a1 e"u ;           bi1 = b1 eeu

where
                                             ("is ; "ik ; "iu ) s N(0; Â§):

Â§ is unrestricted. Hence, there are \average" values of the parameters of the technology fron-
tier { deÂ¯ning an \average" World Technology Frontier { but individual countries' frontiers
may diÂ®er from the average one because they have diÂ®erential access (or diÂ®erential ability
to implement) the various best practices. Notice that we have assumed that deviations from
the average frontier (i.e. realizations of "'s) are known to Â¯rms at the time of their choice of
technology. However, they are not observed by the econometrician.
       We estimate this model by maximum likelihood. Given values of Â¾ and Â½ equations
(1)-(3) imply values of Aiu , Ais , and Aik (as we have seen in Section 2). These, in turn,
together with choices of the remaining parameters, can be plugged into equations (4) and
(5) (which hold with equality), and (7) to back out the "0 s. With the "0 s at hand, one can
construct the log-likelihood for that particular choice of parameters.11


3.3        Results
Maximum Likelihood estimates for the parameters of interest are reported in Table 3. The
point estimate of Â¾ is :24, and that of Â½ is :25. Hence, at the estimated parameter values
the model does not exhibit capital-skill complementarity. As noted above, we conjecture
that this Â¯nding might reÂ°ect the inclusion of structures in the capital stock. Most of the
parameters are estimated relatively precisely.
  11
       Our approach to modeling the frontier is close in spirit to the literature on frontier production functions
in empirical production economics (see Greene (1997) for an especially useful survey). The diÂ±culties
associated with extending that approach to a setting with non-factor neutral technology diÂ®erences dictates
our focus on an \average" { as opposed to \global" { frontier.

                                                         11
        Figure 3 plots against each other the realized levels of the eÂ±ciency of skilled labor
(Ais ) and unskilled labor (Aiu ), as implied by our estimates of Â¾ and Â½. This reproduces
graphically the negative association already uncovered in (the relevant row of) Table 2. The
Â¯gure also draws the average frontier, as given by equation (4), with Â²is = "iu = 0, given the
estimated values of a0 , a1 , and !. Figure 4 does the same for the relationship between Aik
and Aiu . Here we can see graphically the estimated tradeoÂ® among the eÂ±ciency levels of the
various factors of production. As discussed above, no individual country's technology lies on
the average frontier, as barriers to technology adoption vary from country to country. But
each country's technology lies on that country's frontier. To illustrate, we have also plotted
some sample frontiers for a few representative countries (in Fig. 3 the ordering of the lines,
from bottom to top, is Average, US, Hong Kong; in Fig. 4 the ordering is US, Average,
Italy).
          Having estimated the model allows us to quantitatively investigate the importance
of appropriate technology. In order to do so we perform the following experiments. In the
Â¯rst experiment we ask what would be a country's output (given its labor endowments) if it
had access to the technological menu of the US. SpeciÂ¯cally, we compute the level of GDP
associated with an appropriate choice of technology on the US technology frontier. We then
compare this number with the level of GDP the same country would have if forced to use the
technology of the United States. In other words, for each country we compare two points on
the US technology frontier: the one corresponding to that country's optimal choice, and the
one corresponding to the optimal choice of the US. The result of this experiment is plotted in
Figure 5, where the vertical axis measures the ratio of US-technology GDP to appropriate-
technology (on US frontier) GDP; and the horizontal axis measures actual per-capita output.
As can be seen, the adoption of an inappropriate technology involves very large output
losses { up to 50% of GDP { the more so the more diÂ®erent the levels of development (and
hence factor endowments). A similar experiment, with a similar message, is reported in
Figure 6. Here, instead of comparing points on the US frontier, we compare points on the
average frontier. For country i the vertical axis measures GDP at US-appropriate technology
(on the average frontier) as a ratio of GDP at country i-appropriate technology (on the
average frontier). Again, forcing countries to deviate from their appropriate technology
causes spectacular output losses.
       Our method assumes that each country uses the optimal (appropriate) technology
from the set of technologies that are available to it, i.e. each country is on its own tech-
nology frontier. However, we have allowed for idiosyncratic factors that cause the set of
                                              12
available technologies to diÂ®er across countries. We think of these factors as barriers to tech-
nology adoption. Since we have implicitly estimated each country's own frontier, we can also
investigate the quantitative importance of such barriers. Figure 7 compares each country's
observed level of GDP with the level of GDP that country would obtain if it had access
to the US technology frontier. Hence, we now compare two points on diÂ®erent technology
frontiers: the one corresponding to that country's optimal choice on the US frontier, and the
one corresponding to its optimal choice on its own frontier. Both points are \appropriate,"
but they are conditional on diÂ®erent choice sets. The Figure shows staggering eÂ®ects from
barriers to technology adoption, with output increasing by up to a factor of 7 if such barriers
were removed. Figure 8 shows that the barriers are very severe even just to reach the average
frontier: just by obtaining access to the average frontier countries can obtain output gains
of up to a factor of 4.
       It is clear from the last two Â¯gures that poor countries tend to disproportionately be
the ones that would gain the most by having access to the technological menu of the US,
or indeed the technological menu of the average country. Hence, there is clearly support
for the standard view according to which poor countries are generally inside the \world"
technology frontier. This Â¯nding calls for a more general framework that nests the models
in which some countries are pushed to use less-than-best-practice technologies by barriers to
technology adoption, together with the present framework of appropriate technology. This
is a challenging problem that is beyond the scope of the present paper.
        An additional perspective on the relationship between appropriate technology and
barriers to technology adoption can be obtained by computing the fraction of the cross-
country variation of per-capita income that would be explained by a deterministic model
of appropriate-technology adoption, in which all countries had access to the same set of
potential technologies. For example, if each country could choose the point on the average
frontier that maximizes its output { given its labor endowments { the standard deviation
of the log of per capita GDP would be 0.26. This compares to a value of 0.8 in the data.
Hence, diÂ®erences in inputs explain only little more than a quarter of the observed disparity
of incomes, with the rest explained by barriers to technology adoption { i.e. by the fact that
diÂ®erent countries have diÂ®erent frontiers.
        As discussed in the Introduction, models in which technological choice is factor neu-
tral, such as the Cobb-Douglas model, lead to a roughly 50-50 split of the responsibility
for the variation of income between factor endowments and diÂ®erences in technology. It
may therefore seem paradoxical that a model of appropriate technology attributes an even
                                              13
smaller share of the overall variation to diÂ®erences in endowments. But in fact this result is
not surprising: when countries are allowed to choose optimally from a menu of technologies,
this optimal choice will dampen, and not exacerbate, the eÂ®ect of diÂ®erences in endowment
on diÂ®erences in income. In a way, therefore, our results deepen the puzzle of the great
dispersion of per-capita income around the world, and make it even more important that we
understand deviations from best practice at the country level.
       Before concluding, we return to the properties of the estimated technology frontier.
Figures 9 and 10 present characteristics of countries that chose diÂ®erent technologies. Figure
9 shows that countries with a large labor bill for skilled labor relative to their labor bill for
unskilled labor tend to be those countries that adopted a technology more complementary
to skilled labor (their skilled-labor eÂ±ciency level is relatively high). Figure 10 shows that
countries with a large capital expense (rK) relative to their unskilled wage bill are coun-
tries that adopted a technology more complementary to capital (their capital eÂ±ciency level
is relatively high). Both results are consistent with our model of appropriate-technology
adoption.
       As a Â¯nal check, Figure 11 graphs the relationship between the wage rates for unskilled
and skilled labor implied by our data set. It is surely the case that both skilled and unskilled
wage rates are higher in rich countries than in poor countries, and the Figure shows that our
data are consistent with this fact. This is especially notable for the unskilled wage, since we
have estimated rich countries to have the least eÂ±cient unskilled labor. The explanation is
that this ineÂ±ciency is more than compensated by complementarity with skilled labor and
capital, which are more abundant in rich countries, as well as the relatively low supply of
unskilled workers in rich countries. Figure 11 also shows that there is no problem reconciling
the fact that rich countries have the lowest skilled wage premium but also the highest skilled
wage rate.12
  12
       An alternative interpretation of some of our results is that the eÂ±ciencies Ais and Aiu are exogenous
and factor supplies respond endogenously. In this view high values of ln(Ais =Aiu ) lead to large relative wages
for skilled workers, and hence to greater investment in human capital. However, as shown in Table 1,
ln(Lis =Liu ) and ln(wsi =wui ) are negatively correlated: countries in which skilled workers are relatively eÂ±cient
generally have a low skilled-wage premium. It does not appear that relative labor supplies are driven only
by incentives. This result is also consistent with the related Â¯ndings of Caselli and Coleman (1999) on US
wages and relative labor supplies over the last century.

4        Robustness
One restrictive assumption we have employed is undoubtedly that the cost of acquiring
capital goods in units of consumption goods is equalized across countries (or that the required
rate of return to capital is higher for some countries, which has a similar eÂ®ect). If the cost
of capital goods for country i is pi , then all the equations of the model hold with

                                                  ri = rpi :

We computed pi from the Summers and Heston (1991) dataset as the ratio of the price of
investment goods to the price of consumption goods in 1988. Clearly this price will also be
aÂ®ected by the fact that not all countries purchase the same kinds of capital (or consumption),
but we will nevertheless use it here as an estimate of diÂ®erences in the relative price of the
same capital good. The value of this price generally falls with per-capita income, and ranges
from 2.26 for Kenya to .79 for France (the value for the U.S. is .81).13 When using this price
data, the correlations between the estimated eÂ±ciency levels for various values of Â¾ and Â½
exhibit the same pattern of positive and negative values as does Table 2, and mostly the
numbers are not substantially diÂ®erent. We also re-estimated the model using this relative
price data. All the graphs exhibit the same relationships as the ones that are reported.
The main diÂ®erence is in the value of the estimated parameters. The estimated value of
Â¾ = :31 and Â½ = Â¡1:39, hence the model with these parameter estimates exhibits capital-
skill complementarity. The central message of our paper concerning the properties of a
Technology Frontier, though, are unaltered.


5        Conclusions
The main message of this paper is that there seems to exist a World Technology Frontier.
Points on this frontier represent a menu of best practice technologies. Along the frontier
countries trade oÂ® the eÂ±ciency with which diÂ®erent inputs are used. A model in which
countries optimally choose an appropriate technology from this menu was used to identify
this frontier. In this model, countries with relatively large endowments of skilled labor,
and consequently large skilled-labor wage bills, Â¯nd it optimal to adopt a technology that
makes skilled labor and capital relatively more eÂ±cient. Countries for which unskilled labor
  13
       Hence the implied estimate of r i varies from .27 to .09. This alternative estimate has the intuitive
property that the cost of capital is much higher in poor countries than in rich ones.

represents a large fraction of their workforce Â¯nd it optimal to adopt less sophisticated
technologies (and accumulate less capital). In sum, choice of technology and capital-stock
levels are driven by human capital endowments.
        Yet some features of the results suggest that the appropriate technology view of the
World adopted in this paper is complementary, not alternative, to the standard view of
technological backwardness, in which poor countries are poor because they are aÂ²icted by
barriers to technology adoption. Poor countries do generally choose technologies that are
inside the technology frontier of rich countries. Hence, the challenge for future progress in
this Â¯eld is to develop a framework that nests both mechanisms. A complementary area for
future research is the source of cross-country diÂ®erences in skill levels.
       As virtually all papers in this literature, our work rests on very restrictive aggregation
assumptions. A legitimate question is whether these restrictions are driving some of our
results. Answering this question would involve studying a multi-good version of the model
in this paper, and work out the implications for factor-speciÂ¯c eÂ±ciency levels. This is a
complex task that is beyond the scope of the present paper. A priori, however, we see no
obvious reason why our aggregation assumption would bias our estimates towards Â¯nding a
negative cross-country correlation between the eÂ±ciencies of diÂ®erent factors. On the other
hand, a potentially fruitful way to interpret the frontier we identify is not that countries are
faced with diÂ®erent ways of producing the same good, but rather that goods may diÂ®er in
the relative eÂ±ciency of diÂ®erent factors. Countries abundant in skilled labor may then tend
to specialize in the production of goods that use skilled labor eÂ±ciently, etc. This would
provide our model of appropriate technology with roots in the Heckscher-Ohlin tradition.14
Again, whether or not this is a useful way to interpret our Â¯ndings will have to await results
on computing eÂ±ciency levels of various factors for a variety of goods, and relating this to
cross-country production patterns, but this seems a worthwhile project.
