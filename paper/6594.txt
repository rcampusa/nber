 Low Protection                  Equals one if the index of antidirectors rights is smaller or equal than three (the
                                 sample median). The index of antidirectors rights is formed by adding one when:
                                 (1) the country allows shareholders to mail their proxy vote; (2) shareholders are
                                 not required to deposit their shares prior to the General Shareholders’ Meeting; (3)
                                 cumulative voting or proportional representation of minorities on the board of
                                 directors is allowed; (4) an oppressed minorities mechanism is in place; (5) the
                                 minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to call for an
                                 Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting is less than or equal to ten percent (the sample
                                 median); (6) or when shareholders have preemptive rights that can only be waved
                                 by a shareholders meeting. The range for the index is from zero to six. Source: La

 Dividend-to-Cash-flow           Dividends as a percentage of cash flow in fiscal year 1994. Dividend are defined
                                 as total cash dividend paid to common and preferred shareholders. Cash flow is
                                 measured as the difference between total funds from operations and non-cash items
                                 from discontinued operations. Source: WorldScope Database.

 IA_Dividend-to-Cash-flow        Industry-adjusted dividend-to-cash-flow ratio for a firm.               To calculate
                                 IA_Dividend-to-Cash-flow, we first find for each industry in each country the
                                 median of the Dividend-to-Cash-flow ratio (C_D/CF). Then for each industry in the
                                 sample we define the world median as the median of C_D/CF across countries.
                                 Finally, we calculate IA_Dividend-to-Cash-flow as the difference between the firm’s
                                 Dividend-to-Cash-flow and the world median Dividend-to-Cash-flow for the firm’s
                                 industry. We rely on a firm’s primary SIC to define the following seven broad
                                 industries: (1) agriculture; (2) mining; (3) construction; (4) light manufacturing; (5)

 Dividend-to-Earnings            Dividends as a percentage of Earnings in fiscal year 1994. Dividend are defined as
                                 total cash dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders. Earnings are
                                 measured after taxes and interest but before extraordinary items. Source:

                          sample we define the world median as the median of C_D/E across countries.
                          Finally, we calculate IA_Dividend-to-Earnings as the difference between the firm’s
                          Dividend-to-Earnings and the world median Dividend-to-Earnings for the firm’s
                          industry. We rely on a firm’s primary SIC to define the following seven broad

IA_Dividend-to-Sales      Industry-adjusted dividend-to-sales ratio for a firm. To calculate
                          IA_Dividend-to-Sales, we first find for each industry in each country the median of
                          the Dividend-to-Sales ratio (C_D/S). Then for each industry in the sample we define
                          the world median as the median of C_D/S across countries. Finally, we calculate
                          IA_Dividend-to-Sales as the difference between the firm’s Dividend-to-Sales and
                          the world median Dividend-to-Sales for the firm’s industry. We rely on a firm’s
                          primary SIC to define the following seven broad industries: (1) agriculture; (2)

Dividends Tax Adv.        The ratio of the value, to an outside investor, of US$1 distributed as dividend income
                          to the value of US$1 received in the form of capital gains when kept inside the firm
                          as retained earnings. The computation of this ratio is described in Appendix 1.

This table classifies firms based on both the legal origin of the country in which they are incorporated and on their
growth in sales (GS) relative to the world median growth in sales. Countries are required to have at least five valid
observations (firms) with growth in sales below the world median and five observations with growth in sales above the
world median. The number of countries in the resulting sample is twenty four (fourteen civil law and ten common
law countries). To compute the world median growth in sales we calculate the median growth in sales for each country
and then we take medians again but now over the twenty four resulting country-observations. For each classification,
the table reports the median value of the country-medians for the following three ratios: (1) Dividend-to-Cash-flow in
Panel A; (2) Dividend-to-Earnings in Panel B; and (3) Dividend-to-Sales in Panel C. Finally, Panel D reports Z
statistics for tests of difference in medians.

This table classifies firms based both on the level of investor protection of the country in which they are incorporated
(Low or High Protection) and on their growth in sales (GS) relative to the world median growth in sales. Countries
included are required to have at least five valid observations (firms) with growth in sales below the world median and
five observations with growth in sales above the world median. The number of countries in the resulting sample is
twenty four (eleven with Low Protection equal to one). To compute the world median growth in sales we calculate the
median growth in sales for each country and then we take medians again but now over the twenty four resulting
country-observations. For each classification, the table reports the median value of the country-medians for the
following three ratios: (1) Dividend-to-Cash-flow in Panel A; (2) Dividend-to-Earnings in Panel B; and (3) Dividend-
to-Sales in Panel C. Finally, Panel D reports Z statistics for tests of difference in medians.

                           Appendix 1: Construction of the Tax Advantage of Dividends

The appendix presents the raw data used to calculate the tax preference of dividends for each country. We use the tax
rates faced by local residents who acquire minority stakes in publicly traded securities and hold their investments long
enough to qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates. Furthermore, we assume that the effective tax rate on capital
gains is equivalent to one-fourth of the nominal rate (Poterba, 1987). Finally, we combine federal and local taxes
whenever possible. In order to compute the tax parameter, it is helpful to use the criteria proposed by King (1977)
and group the tax systems of the countries in our sample in three broad categories:

1. The classical system: Personal and corporate taxation are independent of each other and shareholders receive no
compensation for taxes paid at the corporate level. Specifically, the company pays a flat rate of corporate tax on profits
(ie, distributed and undistributed income are taxed at the same rate) and shareholders pay income tax on dividend
receipts. Accordingly, the value to an investor of one dollar in earnings distributed in the form of dividends is equal
to (1-Jcorp)*(1-Jdiv), where Jcorp is the corporate tax rate on income and Jdiv is the personal tax rate on dividend receipts.
Similarly, the value to an investor of one dollar in earnings retained inside the firm is given by (1-Jcorp)*(1-Jcap), where
Jcap is the effective personal tax rate on capital gains. Therefore, the dividend tax preference parameter (defined as the
ratio of the value earnings distributed as dividends versus earnings retained inside the firm) is given by (1-Jdiv)/(1-Jcap).

2. The two-rate system: The corporate tax rate on earnings distributed as dividends is lower than on retained earnings
to mitigate the tax-advantage of retained earnings in the classical system. Accordingly, the value to an investor of one
dollar in earnings distributed in the form of dividends is equal to (1-Jdist)*(1-Jdiv), where Jdist is the corporate tax rate
on distributed income. Similarly, the value to an investor of one dollar in earnings retained inside the firm is given
by (1-Jret)*(1-Jcap), where Jret is the corporate tax rate on retained earnings. Thus, the dividend tax preference
parameter is given by (1-Jdist)*(1-Jdiv)/((1-Jret)*(1-Jcap)). In practice, the pure two-rate system is implemented rarely
in our sample of countries. In fact, only two countries in our sample have different tax rates for retained earnings and
dividends: Germany and South Africa. However, in South Africa taxes on dividends are higher than on retained
earnings contrary to the motivation behind the two-rate system, (Jdiv=49% vs Jret=40%). Interestingly, dividends in
Germany are not only taxed at a lower corporate rate but shareholders are allowed to credit taxes paid by corporations
on distributions to offset personal taxes in the same way as in the imputation system.

3. The Imputation System: Shareholders receive credit for taxes paid by the company on earnings distributed as
dividends. These credits may be used to offset shareholder’s tax liability. Part of the corporate tax liability on
distributed profits is “imputed” to shareholders and regarded as a pre-payment of their personal income tax. In the
most frequent version of the imputation system, dividends are regarded as having borne personal tax at the
“imputation” rate Jimp and shareholders are liable only for the difference between their marginal tax rates on personal
income and the imputation rate (ie, they pay taxes on dividend receipts at the rate Jdiv-Jimp). Accordingly, the value
to an investor of one dollar in earnings distributed in the form of dividends is equal to (1-Jcorp+Jimp)*(1-Jdiv). Hence,
the dividend tax preference parameter is given by (1-Jdist+Jimp)*(1-Jdiv)/((1-Jret)*(1-Jcap)).
           Less frequently, the operation of the system is defined in terms of a tax credit rate Jcred and not an imputation
rate. In countries that rely on tax credits, shareholders are liable for the difference between the personal taxes owed
on dividends-cum-tax-credit received and the tax credit (ie, they pay taxes on dividend receipts at the rate (1+Jcred)*Jdiv-
Jcred.). In such cases, we re-express Jcred in terms of its associated Jimp and use the formula for the imputation system
described previously.
