                         Forecasting the Depression:

                             Harvard Versus Yale




                                   ABSTRACT




   Was the Depression forecastable? After the Crash, how long did it take
   contemporary economic forecasters to realize how severe the downturn was
   going to be? How long should it have taken them to come to this
   realization? These questions are addressed by studying the predictions of
   the Harvard Economic Service and Yale's Irving Fisher during 1929 and the
   early 1930's. The data assembled by the Harvard and Yale forecasters are
   subjected to modern statistical analysis to learn whether their verbal
   pronouncements were consistent with the data. We find that both the Harvard
   and Yale forecasters were systematically too optimistic, yet nothing in the
   data suggests that the optimism was unwarranted.

I. Introduction

     James Tobin relates the following story, which was told to him and

other members of the Harvard graduate economics club by Professor W.L. Crum.

In the 1920's the Harvard Economic Service (HES) issued monthly reports on

the current and. their expected future state of the economy. HES used three

indices, representing speculation, business, and money, to help predict the

future. Crum said that in the summer of 1929 the statistical assistant at

HES became alarmed when she noticed that the charts indicated that a sharp

downturn in economic activity was imminent. Crum did not see in the current

business situation any cause for this adverse forecast. Moreover, he feared

that a pessimistic forecast by the influential service could itself have an

adverse effect on financial markets and economic activity. Therefore, he

suppressed the pessimistic findings of the assistant,1 and the published

report did not speak of a potential downturn.

     The data, in fact, provide only mild support for this account. The

account does, however, raise an interesting and general set of questions.

Was there anything in the data prior to the October 1929 stock market crash

that indicated the economy was about to enter a protracted slowdown? How

should the news of the crash have revised forecasts of economic growth? To

address these questions, we study two sets of data assembled by contemporary

business-conditions forecasters. The first consists of the three HES

indices. The second consists of commodity and stock price indices compiled

and analyzed by Irving Fisher. Fisher, who was at Yale from 1891 until his

wisdom.

death in 1947, was a competitor of HES. He also released periodic reports

on the state of the economy. Moreover, he was a critic of the HES indices.

     In the next section, we discuss the data and procedures of the Harvard

Economic Service and Irving Fisher. We discuss how the data were prepared

and analyzed. We also compare the verbal forecasts about economic

performance in 1929 and in the early 1930's. In the following section, we

analyze the two data sets using modern statistical techniques. This allows

us to address the questions concerning the forecastability of the depression

and the effect of the crash on the statistical forecasts. We can then ask

whether the verbal pronouncements made by the contemporary forecasters match

the pattern we find in the data.



II. Description of the Economic Forecasting Services

    The Harvard forecasting service was from the beginning marketed as a

business tool for executives for short- and long-range planning. By

contrast, the Fisher service was designed originally to serve as an

educational tool for the public betterment. Fisher described his service's

goal as "to accustom the public to the thought that the dollar is not a

constant but a variable" [Fisher (1934, p.385)]. By contrast, the Harvard

brochure introduces its product with the following advertisement:

     As you go about your various tasks today, shaping your plans for the
     coming year's business - plans which will determine largely the profits
     of your concern during the coming months - ask yourself this: Wouldn't
     it be really worth while if you and other members of your organization
     had a tried and dependent means of judging future conditions, thus
     eliminating largely the chances you must otherwise take?    [Harvard
     University Committee on Economic Research (1923a, p.3)]

Later, perhaps realizing the potential profits to be had, Fisher was to

market his own service fully as aggressively as did Harvard. His prose
                                         3

became ultimately at least as purple as that of his Harvard peers, as in

this passage from 1929:

        'Dead reckoning' won't do -- even the man of millions needs the
        guidance of precedent. The Fisher Digest stands between the
        average investor and the loss that may follow the ill-timed or
        ill-advised investment2-- it is the weather-vane, the trustworthy
        barometer of commerce.

Harvard Economic Service

        HES offered businessmen a comprehensive forecasting service beginning

in 1919. A subscription to the service cost $100 per year ($623 in 1986

dollars) and consisted of the Weekly Letter, which contained the Index of

General Business Conditions and an accompanying analysis and forecast, the

Quarterly Review of Economic Statistics, and special statistical

supplements. The Index of General Business Conditions was created by HES's

first editor, Warren Persons. Its three curves were meant to represent

"speculation" (the A-curve), "business" (the B-curve), and "money" (the C-

curve). The Harvard forecasts were then based on the relations determined

to exist among the three curves during any given phase of the business cycle

and on the magnitude of the movement from crest to trough of each curve.

        The Harvard analysts believed that the A-curve was a leading indicator

of the B-curve. They specified a specific lag structure. Declines in the

A-curve (speculation) were interpreted as forecasting that the B-curve

(business) would begin to decline in six to twelve months [Harvard

University Committee on Economic Research (l923b, p.9)]. Although HES is

clear about A leading B, its description of the dynamics of the C-curve

(money) is ambiguous. It notes that troughs in C follow troughs in B. That



             advertisement was printed in the Herald Tribune on February 25,
1929.
                                      4

is, interest rates, which make up C, are low coming out of recessions. At

points, HES describes this as causal relationship [Harvard University

Committee on Economic Research (l923b, p.11)]. At other points in the

discussion of the indices, 1-IES notes that troughs in C precede peaks in

activity [Harvard University Committee on Economic Research (1923b, p.9)].

The problem, which HES never directly addresses, is that a leading indicator

also appears to be a lagging indicator of the previous cycle. This

ambiguity is present in all atheoretical analyses of business cycles. When

we analyze the HES series statistically, either we will assume _nat interest

rates lead activity, which is consistent with a wide range of theories of

the business cycle, or we will make no assumption concerning the ordering of

the lags.

    Although the specific series that made up the three curves changed over

the thirteen years that HES published the indices, the basic index

methodology remained the same. Curve A, representing speculation, included

a series of New York bank clearings and industrial stock prices; curve B,

representing business, included outside bank debits and commodity prices;3

curve C, representing money, was based upon commercial paper rates.

    To construct each of the three indicators, the Harvard methodology was



     3Curve B, as first constructed by Warren Persons in 1919, was a
composite of economic series that reflected business conditions, including
both production of materials and goods (most notably pig iron production)
and transactions in commodities and services. The curve was revised in 1923
to include only bank debits and a ten-commodity price index. The position
of the baseline (Bradstreet's index) used in constructing curve B "was
determined by shifting the curve upward so that the crossing points with the
ten-commodity index would correspond to the dates of crossing given for pig
iron production, the index of trade, and outside debits" [Persons (1923,
p.187)]. Therefore, although a measure of industrial production was not
directly included in the revised B-curve, pig iron production entered into
its construction.
                                             5

as follows. First, the underlying component(s) in the index were adjusted

for seasonality. Then, for each underlying component, a "similar" series

not in the index was isolated, which was thought to represent a secular

trend relative to the cyclical component in question. (For example, for the

"money" series, the baseline was the average yield of ten prime railroad

bonds of distant maturities.) Percentage deviations between each component

of the index and the "baseline" series were taken and then normalized by the

appropriate standard deviation. The resulting groups of adjusted components

were then averaged to form the relevant index curve.

    The resulting indices are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 for,

respectively, the years 1904-1913 and 1919-1931. As can be seen, there

appears to be strong predictive power in the earlier period. A close

inspection of HES's brochure suggests, however, that the remarkable fit was

in fact achieved by an "exhaustive study of business statistics, for the

primary purpose of developing a reliable index of general business

conditions" [Harvard University Committee on Economic Research (1923b, p.8)]

and that this exhaustive study was performed using data from the years 1904-

1913.

    At first glance, the data in Figure 2 do not appear to correspond

closely to Crum's account, namely that the Harvard indices in the summer of

1929 foretold the coming business collapse. All three indices appear to lag

the crash, rather than anticipate it. The brochure states that "the index

(C) also forecasts speculation" and that "a persistent rise in interest

rates was the forerunner of a decline in security prices; after such a

decline in security prices, a decline in business of several months

duration. .   ." [Harvard University   Committee on Economic Research (l923b,
                                       6

p.11)]. In the period 1927-1929 curve Chad reflected exactly such a

persistent rise in interest rates, and while it is not clear from the

service's description exactly when such a rise should ultimately be expected

to imply a stock market downturn, it is entirely possible that by the summer

of 1929 the staff saw a market decline as imminent. More importantly, the

speculation index (A) shows a major decline during the second quarter of

1929. It peaked in March and by June had declined by over ten percent.

This major but transitory decline is almost lost in a graph of curve A

including the crash, but it would have looked substantial to the Harvard

analysts during the second quarter.4

      If the Harvard staff did believe that the data foretold business doom,

this was not apparent in their public pronouncements through the period of

collapse. The service painted a considerably gloomier picture earlier in

1929, only to moderate its view as the stock market continued to boom.

In April 1929, HES issued the following warning about the overheated

economic environment:

    Recent developments - notably the weakness of certain commodity prices,
    as well as the money tension - suggest some recession from the present
    level of business. ... A renewed unsettlement of stock prices, perhaps
    a protracted liquidation, might well result under present conditions of
    money tension.... Business is not in the strained condition which has
    led to real depression in the past; and, while interest rates are now
    higher than at any other time since 1921, the present large resources
    of the reserve system give assurance that no shortagg of credit for
    industrial purposes will develop.  [HES (4/20/1929)]


This view persisted through the summer of 1929. In May, the service


     4mis decline is not present in either Fisher's stock price index or
the Cowles (1939) stock price index. Hence, it may have been spurious.

noted that "The signs pointing to recession continue to pile up" [HES

 (5/18/1929)1

    By mid-September, when the speculation index was rising, the tone

moderated considerably:

     Recent developments (reduced volume of construction projects, below
     average crop prospects, unfavorable international trade balances) have
     tended to emphasize the unfavorable elements in the business (as
     distinguished from the financial) situation.... But no sharp decline
     has appeared in general business, and activity remains high.  [HES
     (9/21/1929)]

The week prior to Black Friday, the assessment was that

     If recession should threaten serious consequences for business (as is
     not indicated at present) there is little doubt that the reserve system
     would take steps to ease the money market and so check the movement.
     [HES (10/19/1929)]

    This tone persisted as calamities mounted over the coming year.

Immediately following the crash, in early November, the appraisal was that

     Doubtless the losses entailed by the decline in stocks will increase
     the extent of the present business recession. On the other hand, money
     rates have declined promptly and considerably ... this is in itself
     evidence of the soundness of the present business situation. Under such
     conditions, we believe that the present recession, both for stocks and
     business, is not the precursor of business depression, but will prove
     intermediate in character. [HES (11/2/1929)]

By late December 1929, the Harvard staff was even forecasting recovery.

     Today a depression seems improbable, and continuance of business
     recession is all that is in prospect. This justifies a forecast of
     recovery of business next spring, with further improvement in the fall,
     so that 1930, as a whole, should prove at least a fairly good year.
     [lIES (12/21/1929)]

Confidence then continued as the downturn worsened.

    Since our monetary and credit structure is not only sound but unusually
    strong, commercial credits are liquid, and production for some months
    has probably been less than current demands, there is every prospect
    that the recovery which we have been expecting will not be long
    delayed, and that the only change that need be made in our forecast is
    that this fall business will not acquire as much impetus as we have
    been expecting. [HES (8/20/1930)]
                                      8

    Except in construction activity, the current depression seems to be
    following much the same course as that of 1920-21, as respects the
    length and severity of decline and the inception of recovery; and we
    conclude that improvement in business volumes, the first step in
    business recovery, is already under way. [HES (6/30/1931)]

A dawning awareness that this economic downturn was not similar in nature to

those preceding it is found in the final months of 1931. In August, the

Service noted that "If financial unsettlement continues in Europe, real

business recovery here may be prevented..." [HES (8/22/1931)]. And by

December of that year, the assessment had finally become quite bleak:

     But though the threatening elements in the situation are wer,
     adequate grounds for forecasting business revival have not yet
     appeared. [HES (12/19/1931)]

The Fisher Index

    Beginning in January 1923 the Fisher Index was published weekly in the

author's syndicated column, The Fisher Business Page, which was widely

carried by leading newspapers. Only in early 1930 did Fisher begin to

market a separate and more detailed financial service. Initially, The

Business Page included the Fisher Commodity Price Index and the Purchasing

Power of the Dollar Index, along with weekly discussions of relevant

economic issues of the time. In 1925, a stock market value index was added.

The later Financial Analysis Service, published by the Index Number

Institute (a company founded by Fisher), also included explicit analyses and

economic forecasts based upon the Fisher indices.6

    Of the two indices published in Fisher's weekly column, the Commodity




     6The Financial Analysis Service was succeeded by a similar service
named Trade and Money Index in late 1931. This service was in turn succeeded
by Market Indicators, which ceased publication in 1934.

 Price index is substantially Fisher's "Ideal" index,7 which "is an

 aggregative formula representing the fluctuations in value of a fixed budget

 or an imaginary cargo consisting of specified quantities of 200 goods. The

 index number for any date is simply the ratio of the value of the cargo, at

 said date, to its base value, multiplied by the base number."8
                                                                  The

 Purchasing Power of the Dollar index is simply the inverse of the Commodity

 Price index -- and
                    thus a duplicative measure. The duplication is, however,

 central to Fisher's missionary ideas for his service. He aimed to educate

 the public and thereby eliminate money illusion. His stated view of the

 Purchasing Power index is that:

     The purchasing power of the dollar is shown separately from the
     commodity price level, although one is the reciprocal of the
     other, to emphasize the importance of the purchasing power of the
     dollar. As the price level goes up, a dollar will buy less; as
     the price leel declines, the dollar will buy more.   [Fisher
     (5/14/1924)

    The stock price index that was later added to the service consisted of a

weighted value index for the market, with stocks picked based on a standard

of "popularity." The index was computed based on averaging the value of the


     7Fisher's book The Making of Index Numbers is a "complete
                                                                survey of all
possible index formulae as any hitherto attempted." It concludes that the
"'ideal' is the best form of index number for
                                               general purposes." In this
book Fisher analyses a number of indices published at the time. In a
footnote, Fisher comments on the Harvard index
                                                methodology: "One of the most
interesting kinds of index number is Prof. Person's new index number for use
as a barometer of trade. In this case the selection of the 10 commodities
included is based, not on any of the usual criteria, but on their previous
behavior in relation to the business
                                     cycle" [Fisher (1927, p.336)].

average of base and current perioa weightea indices [Fisher
                                                            (1923, p.835)].

appeared in Fisher's syndicated Business Page. Copies of all Fisher's
columns are contained in the Fisher collection housed in Yale's Manuscript

previous week's fifty best-selling stocks, based on total market value of

share turnover. The index was linked across weeks by calculating a

composite average based on the subsample of stocks that appeared in both

weeks' indices)0

    Unlike HES's, Fisher's forecasts were simple and straightforward

applications of the classical paradigm, allowing for some rigidities slowing

adjustment. Thus, for example, a falling dollar and rising commodity prices

"shows that the volume of money and credit available is increasing faster

than its utilization in the production and exchange of goods and services.

When more money and credit are applied to the same (or smaller) volume of

goods and services, it results in increased competition by the funds for the

available goods and services."11 Rising commodity prices would thus

engender a forecast of declines in real interest rates, a rising industrial

production rate, and increasing inventories due to increases in the value of

goods.

     The Fisher Service is closer to a modern economic analysis and

forecasting tool. It simply provided businessmen, policy-makers and the

public with an analysis of current macroeconomic data from the perspective

of then-current macroeconomic and financial theory. Fisher's service thus

stands in contrast to the chartist exertions produced by members of the

Harvard Economic Service.

         Although Fisher's economic analysis are on firmer theoretical grounds

than Harvard's, his predictions in the period before and after the crash,


     10See Fisher (1927) for a description of the index methodology.

     11See Newdick (1929, p.2). A brief exposition of Fisher's forecasting
methodology, "How to Use Fisher Indexes" by Newdick, was part of the
Financial Analysis Service subscription package.

 were no closer to the mark than those of his Harvard
                                                        brethren. Indeed, his
 analyses during 1930 and 1931 were, consistently, even more optimistic than

 Harvard's.

     In September 1929, Fisher was bullish about
                                                   future prospects, seeing
 none of the potential warning signs that the Harvard service had noted

 through the summer of that year.'2

      We have witnessed probably the
                                     greatest expansion in history, within
      any similar period of time, of the real income of a people.... The
      alarm over the supposed inflation of security values seems unjustified
      by the recent record of dividend yields, increases which doubtless will
      be followed by much larger increases. [Fisher (9/2/1929)]

 The day before Black Friday, Fisher continued bullish in the face of the

 (relatively) small perturbations that had rocked the market in recent weeks

 and stirred concern on Wall Street.

     The (stock-market) break certainly exhibited signs of a market rendered
     topheavy by the activities of shoals of speculators,
                                                          acting
     unintelligently, who at last became frightened and dumped millions of
     shares in a way temporarily to
                                    swamp the Exchanges.... The only event
     which can bring about a serious decline in stock value is a severe
     business slump, which does not seem likely from present indications.
     [Fisher (10/28/1929)]

Immediately after the crash, the outlook remained optimistic.

     The price of industrial stocks at less than 11 times their earnings
     seems too low a ratio, in view of the expectation of a faster rate of
     earnings in future and of the diminished risks of modern investment
     methods.... The market has, therefore,
                                             good reason for recovering on a
     new plateau. [Fisher (11/4/1929)]

As the recession deepened, Fisher's optimism bordered on advocacy,

inveighing against dire interpretations of the direction of current
indicators.

                optimism, however, is consistent with his data. In contrast
to the Harvard speculation index (A) which shows a ten percent decline from
March to June 1929, the Fisher stock price index shows no decline.
Similarly, the Cowles (1939) stock price index, which has been widely used
in recent studies, has some fluctuations
                                         but is essentially flat over the interval.

     It should be noted that while the stock exchange endured the severest
     panic in history, this did not suffice to shake the price level of
     stocks off a warrantable high new plateau, which had been built up
     since 1922.... The function of the stock market is to reflect the
     discounted value of future increased business, as clearly foreshadowed
     in the increasing rate at which earnings are plowed-back into industry.
     [Fisher (12/30/1929)]

     While prediction is always hazardous in economic statistics, and I wish
     to avoid making any definite prediction, it would not be surprising if
     by next month the worst of the recession will have been felt and
     improvement looked for. [Fisher (1/20/1930)]

In the early summer of 1930, Fisher remained unwilling to read calamity into

the current economic situation. Comparisons with the 1920-21 recession

predominated in his analysis -- as they did in Harvard's --   but   Fisher's

brand of optimism remained both stronger and more colorful.

     It seems maiifest that thus far the difference between the present
     comparatively mild business recession and the severe depression of
     1920-21 is like that between a thunder-shower and a tornado. [Fisher
     (5/19/1930)]

By winter of that year, Fisher finally acknowledged the seriousness of the

economic situation; yet like members of the Harvard group, he continued to

see the potential for an imminent upturn and expressed his hopes with

mounting drama.

     Doubtless, to many, this will be the winter of our discontent, and to
     all of us it is as gloomy as the darkness that precedes dawn.... One
     would expect the bottom to be reached in the stock market prior to the
     upturn in commodity prices. Since the middle of November this seems to
     have been the case.  [Fisher (12/1/1930)]

     In attempting to review and estimate the business situation, it is
     sometimes necessary, during a business depression such as this, to find
     hopeful signs in negative figures. Such a peculiar state of affairs
     holds true just now.  [Fisher (2/2/1931)]

     The industrial giant has become conscious again. He is beginning to
     move around slowly in an effort to regain his feet, as the cobwebs from
     a knockout blow gradually clear from his brain. [Fisher (2/23/1931)]

By the end of 1931, when the Harvard team had begun to admit to the reality

contained in the steady flow of bleak economic data, Fisher maintained his
                                      13

 optimism.

     Business showed further gain last week, and if improvement continues at
     the present rate, September should mark the low of the depression.
     Particular attention is called to the fact that commodity prices for
     both raw materials and agricultural products were strong. No single
     factor would be as helpful to business as a cessation in the commodity
     price decline that has been continued for the past two years. [Fisher
     (10/17/1931)]



III. Statistical Analysis

     The above excerpts from the Harvard and Yale services make it clear

that the services neither explicitly predicted a downturn in their written

analyses nor, following the crash, predicted correctly its dire implications

for future macroeconomic activity. Harvard's C-curve might have warranted a

pessimistic forecast before the crash, but this evidence is not very strong.

The question considered in this section is whether the use of modern

statistical procedures reveals any evidence in the data of a forthcoming

depression. The data examined are Harvard's A, B, and C indices and

Fisher's commodity price and stock price indices.13

     In the first statistical exercise, we attempt to formalize the timing

relationships among the A, B, and C indices posed by HES. The B series is a

contemporaneous measure of business activity. In this first exercise, we

take the B series as the object to be forecast. The B series did turn down

sharply at the time of the crash. According to HES, the B series was lead 6



      130ne way to analyze the question of whether the depression was
forecastab].e would be to construct a structural econometric model based on
the data prior to the depression and then see if the model predicts the
depression based on predictions of the future exogenous variable values that
seems likely to have existed at the time. Our aim in this paper is much
more modest. We simply want to examine the monthly Harvard and Fisher data
for signs of an impending slowdown. Hence, we estimate reduced forms that
would be consistent with a wide range of models.

to 12 months by the A series, which was largely determined by movements in

stock prices. The conventional valuation model for asset prices also

suggests that the stock market should be a leading indicator of activity.

Asset prices should react instantaneously to events that take time to affect

real activity. As discussed earlier, the Harvard analysts are less clear

about the relation of the B and C series. At points they suggest that C

should lag B, but elsewhere they suggest that it, like A, should be a

leading indictor.14 Of course, absent a theory, the question of whether a

series leads or lags in the cycle is wholely arbitrary. In the following

analysis, we treat both A and C as leading indicators of B.

     To capture the timing relationships posited by the Harvard analysts, we

estimate the following regressions. The analysts sometimes suggested that

the A series (speculation) was forecastable by other series, which is, of

course, inconsistent with the martingale model for asset prices. We

estimate a univariate, second-order autoregression for A)5 In the equation

for series B, we include lags 6 through 12 of both series A and C to capture

the timing relationships discussed above. We also include the first two

lags of B itself. Without them, errors remain strongly serially correlated.

Because of the ambiguities in the analysts' discussion of series C, we treat

series C symmetrically with series A, that is, as a univariate, second-order

autoregression.


     14See Harvard University Committee on Economic Research (l923b, p.9-li).

     151f series A were point-in-time data just for stock prices, we would
expect a random walk model to be the best approximation. The data, however,
are averaged and include information on bank clearings, and so we include
the extra lag. If required returns are predictably time-varying, perhaps C
should forecast A. This possibility is allowed in subsequent
specifications.
                                                               15

     These and all the subsequent equations include constant terms and are

estimated using the data as published, which are corrected for trend and

seasonal factors.'6 All data used in this paper are presented in the

Appendix. The equations are estimated by ordinary least squares.

     To evaluate whether the A, B, and C series were useful in forecasting

the depression, we estimate the system just described and then compute

dynamic forecasts based on the estimates. Estimation is carried out through

the month prior to the beginning of the forecast period. The first month of

the estimation period is January 1920. The forecasts are computed over a 24

month horizon. The first forecast period considered begins in July 1929,

and so the first estimation period ends in June 1929. The three estimated

equations for this first estimation period are (standard errors are in

parentheses):

     16We expect that the Harvard Economic Service's detrending procedure
induces spurious cyclicality in the published series. See Nelson and Kang
(1981) and Mankiw and Shapiro (1985). Because we are trying to mimic the
contemporary procedures, we do not wish to attempt to correct for any
spurious cycles.
                                         16

Equation (1) reveals that A is nearly a random walk. C in equation (2) is a

second order autoregressive process with approximately a unit root. In

equation (3) none of the A and C variables is individually significant,

although the hypotheses that the coefficients of the A series are jointly

zero and those of the C series are jointly zero are both rejected with more

than 95 percent confidence.17

     Table 1 presents the actual and predicted values of the B series.

Column 1 contains the actual values, and column 2 contains the predicted

values from equations (1) -   (3)   above. The forecast in column "   contains no
evidence confirming the statistical assistant's fear that a collapse in

business activity was imminent in the summer of 1929. If anything, the

A,B,C series indicated a strong economy over the next six months. Although

there is a slight downturn forecast at the beginning of 1930, the predicted

fall is very mild. Hence, this forecast implies that Crum appears to have

been correct in his view that the data did not bear out the alarm raised by

the assistant.

     Seven more forecasts are presented in Table 1. Starting dates for

these forecasts are October, November, and December 1929; January, May, and

September 1930; and January 1931. For each of these forecasts the above

three equations were reestimated through the month prior to the beginning

month of the forecast. The beginning month for all estimation periods was

January 1920.

     The forecast in column 3, which is the forecast immediately before the

crash, shows very robust economic activity. This forecast is driven by the

huge increase in the value of stock prices, which continued through early


     17The F(7,6l) statistics are 2.34 and 2.20 for the respective tests.

 autumn. The first forecast that reflects the news of the decline of the

 stock market (column 4) does not have the very favorable outlook of the

previous forecast. Yet, it shows a continued strong medium run outlook with

only a small downturn in the first half-year. The next forecast (column 5)

is, however, much more pessimistic because the decline in stock prices is

fully reflected in the lagged values in the equation for A. Subsequent

forecasts show temporary downturns over the forecast horizons, but fail to

capture the continuing decline in activity into 1931. The pessimistic

forecast in the last column reflects the continuing decline in the B series

throughout 1931. In summary, our analysis of the HES data using the lag

structure suggested by the Harvard analysts does not show that the

depression was forecastable. It also indicates that the slow adjustment of

the forecasts to the bad news of the crash was consistent with the data.

     For the rest of the statistical work we use an alternative measure of

economic activity from the B series. The series we consider is the Federal

Reserve Board's monthly, seasonally adjusted industrial production index,

denoted IF.18 This index is available beginning in 1919. The industrial

production index, of course, was never in the information set of the

contemporary forecasters. Yet, it is one of the best indicators of economic

activity available to modern researchers. Insofar as the contemporary

forecasters were interested in predicting the level of activity, it is of

interest to see how well they could predict the IF series.

     For a basis of comparison, we first estimate second order

                               production is a modern time series
constructed by the Federal Reserve Board on the same basis as postwar data.
It, as far as we know, does not suffer from the problems raised by Romer
(1986).

autoregressive equations for IP and use these equations to forecast. The

equations are specified in log form. The estimation periods are the same as

those used above except that the beginning month for all periods was March

1919 rather than January 1920. The estimated equation for the period

through June 1929 is:


(4) log IP = .0374 + l.399.log 1P1 - .4l3.log
                                              1P2
            (.0322) (.081)          (.082)

                DW =   1.97, R2 = .980,   SE = .0253

     Sample period: March 1919 - June 1929.

The coefficients on the two lags of IP suni almost exactly to one. Hence,

shocks to IP are estimated to be permanent, yet will lead to some short run

fluctuations.

     The actual values of IP are presented in column 1 of Table 2, and the

predicted values from equation (4) are presented in column 2.   (The results

in Table 2 are reported in terms of the level of IP even though the

estimated equations are in terms of logs.) The sum of the coefficient

estimates of the two lagged values in equation (4) is close to one.

Therefore, the shocks to IF are essentially permanent; the forecast in

column 2 exhibits little short-run dynamics. This is also true of the other

forecasts in Table 2. All the sums of the two coefficient estimates in the

reestimated equations are close to one. The predicted levels in columns 3

through 9 thus follow the decline in the initial conditions as the

depression unfolds, but they do not anticipate the continuing negative
          19
growth.


     191fl analyzing these forecasts (as well as the ones to come), it is
worthwhile to keep in mind the period over which the underlying equations
are estimated. Except for a sharp downturn in 1920 and 1921, the sample

         The next exercise is to see how accurately the Harvard indices predict

 IP. We already have forecasting equations for A, B, and C, namely equations
 (1) -    (3),   and so we merely need to add an equation relating IP to these

 indices. It seems consistent with the thinking of the Harvard analysts to

 include the values of the B variable in the IP equation but not the values

of the A and C variables. As noted above, the B variable is meant to be the

measure of current economic activity, whereas the A and C variables are

leading indicators. The IP equation that we estimate includes B, B lagged

once, and the first two lags of IF. We included the two lags of IF to

eliminate serial correlation of the error term and to nest the previous

experiment in this one. We used the same estimation periods as we used for

the first experiment, where the beginning month is January 1920. The

equation estimated through June 1929 is:

(5) log IF — .0051 + .019.B
                                          .022.B1 + l.354.log
                                     -
                                                                IF       -
                                                                               355.log 1P2
                                                                     1
                  (.0548) (.009)         (.008)        (.086)                (.090)
                   DW —   2.02,   R2 — .982, SE — .0249

     Sample period: January 1920 - June 1929.

The B variables are significant, and the standard error has dropped from

0.0253 in equation (4) to 0.0249. There is thus a slight improvement in

explanatory power. The coefficient estimate for B is positive and that for

B1 is negative, as expected. The sum of the two coefficients is negative,

which is not as expected, although the sum is small and not significant.2°

     Table 3 presents forecasts using equations (1) -            (3) and (5) and the
rolling reestimated versions of these equations. As in Table 1, which


period witnessed steady growth.

     20The sum is - .003 with a t-statistic of -0.6.

reports the forecasts of B for the same system, the mid-summer forecast

(column 2) shows no evidence of an imminent collapse of the economy.

Interestingly, the October forecast in column 3, which is the last one

before the crash, does show a moderate decline in output (6.4 percent over

two years). About the same rate of decline is predicted in the next month's

forecast (column 4), which is based on initial conditions that include the

crash. In subsequent months, however, the forecasted levels remain flat.

      We have so far been following the six to twelve month timing

relationships seen in the data by the Harvard analysts. For the next

exercise we drop these relationships and instead estimate a second order

vector autoregressive (VAR) model for the A, B, and C indices. We use this

model to forecast A, B, and C. We also estimate an IP equation, where log

IP is regressed on a constant, log IF lagged once and twice, and A, B, and C

unlagged and lagged once. The beginning month for all the estimation

periods is March 1919. The estimated equations for the period ending in

June 1929 are:

Series A, which is dominated by the stock market, is, not surprisingly,

approximately a random walk. Shocks to series B are also very persistent,

although the financial series A and C do enter with the appropriate signs.

Again, series C is close to having a unit root. Series B does, however,

enter the equation significantly (on a joint test), and so the HES view that

causality runs only from C to B can be rejected. In the IF equation both B

and C are significant.

     The forecasts from equations (6) -              (9)   and the rolling reestimated

versions are presented in Table 4. The July 1929 forecast (column 2)

provides some support for the view that the A, B, and C indices contained

evidence for an adverse outlook in the summer of 1929. For this forecast IP

falls almost 15 percent over two years. As it turned out, such a forecast

was optimistic in light of the events, but it is very pessimistic when

viewed from the prospective of the strong performance of the 1920's. The

pessimism of the statistical forecast is driven by the decline in the

speculation index during the second quarter of 1929 from its peak in March.

The index had lost over ten percent of its value from March to June. This

decline was also probably the source of the pessimism in the HES's verbal

discussion at this time. The outlook had, however, turned optimistic by the

October forecast (column 3). The optimism is driven by the increases in the

speculation index. Even the crash was not enough to make the November
                                     22

forecast (column 4) show a decline in IP, although subsequent forecasts

become more and more pessimistic. The burst of optimism in mid 1930 is due

to a transitory, sharp increase in the speculation index.

    The mid-summer 1929 forecast based on the HES VAR does provide some weak

support for the account that the HES data signalled the coming downturn.

This forecast is driven by the decline in the speculation index in the

spring. That decline was not present in other stock price indices and may

be spurious. Consequently, Cruxn may have been justified in suppressing its

implications in the verbal pronouncements. His action was justified by the

upturn in the summer and fall of the speculation index, and hence, the

general outlook.

    To summarize, our statistical analysis of the HES data produces the

same, persistently negative forecast errors as found in the HES's verbal

pronouncements.

     Irving Fisher did not publish an indicator of business activity. His

service was more immediately concerned with financial markets. Nonetheless,

his articles made clear statements about the performance of the economy.

The real indicators should be linked to the financial ones in Fisher's view.

"Every enlargement of the dollar tends to hurt business shortly afterward

and every shrinkage of the dollar tends temporarily to boost business. Thus

the dollar's changes forecast, so far as any one factor can do, the volume

of trade and unemployment" [Fisher (1934, p.386)]. For our last exercise we

consider a VAR model using Fisher's stock and commodity price indices,

denoted S and P. We estimate a second order VAR model for log S and log P

and an IP equation with log IP regressed on a constant, log IP lagged once

and twice, and log S and log P currently and lagged once. The beginning

could get all the data. The estimated equations for the period ending in

The stock market equation has a significant second own lag, although the sum

of the two coefficients is almost exactly one. These higher order dynamics

may be accounted for by Fisher's procedure for changing the series in the

index. Recall that Fisher's stock price index was calculated using each

week's fifty best-selling stocks. Including stocks that do well might

account for the acceleration of the series during the weeks before the

crash. The commodity price index appears essentially unrelated to stock

prices. In the IP equation the stock price variable is weak.

       The forecasts from equations (10) -                   (12) and the rolling reestimated
versions are presented in Table 5. Unlike the results in Table 4 for the

Harvard system, the Fisher forecasts show strong growth during the summer

and early fall of 1929, The implied growth rates of over 10 percent at
                                           24

annual rate were very optimistic. As news of the crash is incorporated into

the system, forecast growth remains positive, but much less strongly so.

These results are consistent with Fisher's continued optimism in late 1929

and early 1930 despite the recent, rapid declines in output and asset

prices.



IV. Conclusion

     We have presented two types of evidence concerning the ability of the

two forecasters to predict the depression. First, we have exwAned their

verbal pronouncements over the months preceding and following the stock

market crash. Both Fisher's and the Harvard Economic Services's forecasts

were optimistic before the crash. After the crash, each saw the unfolding

events as transitory setbacks that did not diminish prospects for growth in

the future. Hence, as the economy continued to decline, the forecasters

appeared to be systematically too optimistic. Second, we have used the

series published by the forecasters to construct statistical forecasts of

economic activity. In doing so, we have taken advantage of our superior

ability to measure economic activity by using the Federal Reserve Board's

index on industrial production. Thus, we have asked what the forecasters

would have predicted based on their data had they been equipped with a

modern indicator of economic activity and modern statistical techniques.

The statistical findings -   - except   for the one forecast that provides mild

support for Crum's account - -   are   broadly consistent with the verbal

pronouncements. The statistical findings mirror the verbal pronouncements'

systematic overprediction of economic activity. Hence, the verbal

pronouncements are consistent with the underlying correlations in the data.
                                      25

      Examination of the estimated equations,
                                                or equivalently of the tables
of forecasts, reveals why it would be incorrect to criticize the forecasters

for their persistent optimism about the prospects for recovery. The

dynamics of the equations for the real variables are dominated by unit

roots. The levels of the forecasts are driven almost
                                                        exclusively by the
initial conditions; they display negligible short run fluctuations.

Consequently, the view embodied in the verbal pronouncements that the

economy had sustained a serious shock, but could be expected henceforth to

grow much as it did in the past, is exactly what
                                                   a practitioner of modern
time series would read from the estimates.   Neither the onset nor the
persistence of the decline in the economy in the 1930's was predictable from

the data for the l920's. One might thus conclude that Harvard and Yale

tied. They were both justified in holding to what turned out ex post to be

an incorrect view.

     Manuscript and Archive Collection) and Index Number Institute releases
     1928-1930.

The Industrial Production Index is
                                   a revised seasonally adjusted series
     published by the Federal Reserve Board in Statistical Release Gl2.3,
