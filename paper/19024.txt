This paper analyzes the effects of the reforms initiated in India following the balance of payments
(BOP) crisis of 1991 on economic performance. We do not find persuasive the contention of many
analysts that growth accelerated after the mid-1980s when reforms were initiated. Nor does statistical
analysis support the contention that reforms in the mid-1980s resulted in a growth acceleration. We
show that there is an accelerating rate of growth of GDP after the mid 1970s and it is difficult to relate
this gradual acceleration to specific policy changes. The changed policies in the 1980s did not mean
a basic change in the policy framework. Furthermore, since corporate investment as a share of GDP
did not increase in the 1980s it is difficult to identify the mechanism by which the more pro-business
policies of the government were translated to higher growth.

We also find that the differences with East Asia and particularly China depend on the basis of the comparison.
We compare changes in performance since the reforms, which started in China in 1979 and in India
in 1991. Such a comparison shows more similarities than differences. We finally examine social progress.
We find that South Asia lags behind other regions in making progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) and India lags behind other South Asian countries. The responsiveness of the improvement
in the MDGs to increases in per capita income is usually low in Asia and particularly in India.

Section I Introduction



         This paper analyzes the effects of the reforms initiated in India following the balance of

payments (BOP) crisis of 1991 on the development strategy adopted by the government, its

policies and the actual economic performance. We first discuss in Section II the significance of

the 1991 reforms as there is a debate on when reforms started, as a number of analysts claim that

reforms started in the mid-eighties and that is why growth started accelerating in the 1980s. We

next examine the features of India’s growth. India’s growth experience is often contrasted with

that of East Asia and more particularly China. It is claimed that savings rates though increasing

are considerably lower than in East Asia; growth in India is based on the services sector rather

than manufacturing which was the leading sector in East Asia; and again unlike East Asia India

has not attracted much foreign direct investment (FDI) (Kotwal, Ramaswami and Wadhwa,

2011).

         We argue below in Section II that while there were certain changes in policies in the

1980s as there had been in earlier years, these did not mean a basic change in the policy

framework. The resilience of the economy as it recovered quickly from economic crises

encouraged the government to persist with the import substituting industrialization strategy it had

adopted. However, research conclusions of various committees set up by the government to

study the effects of licensing and import controls and the experience of other countries especially

China resulted in policy makers believing that a change in the growth model was needed and the

1991 crisis provided the opportunity to carry out such a chnage. We show that there is an

accelerating rate of growth of GDP after the mid 1970s and it is difficult to relate this gradual

acceleration to specific policy changes. Furthermore, since corporate investment as a share of

                                                                                                  4
GDP did not increase in the 1980s it is difficult to identify the mechanism by which the more

pro-business policies of the government were translated into higher growth as claimed by Rodrik

and Subramaniam (2005).

        In Section III we examine the claims that growth in India was more fuelled by domestic

demand and less outwardly oriented than say in China, and, also, that it is more service oriented.

We show that increasing exports of goods, non-factor services, and labour services, through

remittances, have played an important role. Furthermore, the share of exports of goods and

services grew as rapidly in India as in China. Also, there is no significant difference between the

growth rates of value-added in the manufacturing and services sectors except for the period of

the Ninth Plan (1997-2001). The increased value of exports of manufactures was important as

their value grew from about 16 percent of the manufacturing sector’s value added in the early

1980s to about 60 percent currently.

        In Section IV we examine the behavior of 12 economic indicators and find that most

show improved performance in the decade 2001-10 relative to the earlier decade 1981-1990. The

better performance consisted both in the level and lower variability. Furthermore, we find that

the reforms had a gradual effect; the change in the period 1992-2000 was smaller and statistically

less significant. While exports of goods increased, imports increased even faster so the deficit on

the balance of trade in goods became larger;1 but was usually covered by an increasing surplus

on service trade and the rise in remittances. However, since the financial crisis this has not been

the case and the current account deficit has increased considerably. For most of the period

private capital inflows were larger than the current account deficit leading to reserve

rapidly relative to its income than China’s leading to India usually running a deficit on
merchandise trade while China ran a surplus.

accumulation. Increasing trade along with rising private capital flows, both inward and outward,

reflects the increasing integration of India with the world economy.

         We also find in section IV that the differences with East Asia and particularly China

depend on the basis of the comparison. This can be seen if we take into account that the reforms

in China started in 1979 and in India in 1991 and that the staring points in these two years were

very different for the two countries. Such a comparison shows more similarities than differences.

For instance, the share of services in GDP increased between 1974-82 and 2001-10 by more than

85 percent in China and only 32 percent in India (Agarwal and Whalley, 2013). However, the

share of services was much higher in India in 1992 than in China in 1979. If we examine the

change in the share of services in GDP for about the first twenty years of reform, the share

increased by 24.2 percent in China and 21.2 percent in India.

         We finally examine social progress in Section V. We find that South Asia lags behind

other regions n making progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)and India

lags behind other South Asian countries. The responsiveness of the improvement in the MDGs to

increases in per capita income is usually low in Asia and particularly in India.

Section II The 1991 Indian Policy Reform



        The 1991 reforms which followed a balance of payment crisis resulted in a fundamental

re-orientation of Indian policy unlike what had usually happened in previous crises. Policy

adjustments had been made after previous crises but the broad strategy had remained the same.

The basic objectives of policy had remained constant since independence: rapid growth, poverty

removal, a more equitable income distribution and self-sufficiency1 though the relative weights

of the different objectives varied over time. These objectives were to be reached through the

adoption of an import substituting industrialization strategy in which the state would play a

prominent part through its almost total monopoly of production of capital goods and important

intermediate goods.2 Policy changed as the relative importance of the different objectives varied

and when the constraints facing the economy changed.3 One of the consequences of the crisis

was usually a drop in the investment ratio which recovered only after a considerable lag. For

instance, after gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) as a percentage of gross domestic product

(GDP) reached a peak of 15.9 per cent in 1957-58 it fell after the 1957-58 BOP crisis and did not

recover to the earlier ratio till 1963--64 (RBI 2012). The fall in the GFCF ratio after the 1965-67




1 The meaning of self-sufficiency itself has varied over time. Usually it meant ability to resist
external pressures to change policies, particularly foreign policies. In the preparation for the
Fifth Plan, because of experience since the mid-sixties when aid was sought to be used to
pressurize India to change its policies on Vietnam and later on Bangladesh, self-sufficiency was
taken to mean reaching a stage where there was no need for aid.
2 Most development analysts in the 1950s e.g. Rosenstein-Rodan (1943), Prebisch (1950),

Nurkse (1953), Arthur Lewis (1954), argued for an import substituting industrialization
strategy For a discussion of their views see Agarwal (1991). One of the reasons for the state to
control these important sectors was to establish a more equitable income distribution.
3 For instance, self-sufficiency became more important after the cut off of aid because of

disagreements over India’s policy over Viet Nam (Bowles, 1971) and over the events leading to
the creation of Bangladesh. For a discussion of the varying constraints and their effect on policy
see Agarwal, 1997.
                                                                                                  7
crisis was particularly severe ---from 20.4 per cent to 16.7 per cent---and it did not recover till

1977-78.

        One of the consequences of the many travails the economy faced after the mid-1960s,

droughts in 1965-1967, cut-off of aid by the US and the World Bank in 1968, the influx of

refugees in 1971 from then East Pakistan and the ensuing war and later the oil and food price

increases in 1973, was lower public sector investment resulting in considerable excess capacity

in the capital goods sector and very high capital output ratios.1 Many policy analysts analyzed

this imbalance between the structure of demand and the structure of production and saw

increased government investment as a solution (Chakravarty, 1979). Once structural adjustment

was complete, the savings rate of both households and the government rose, the government

raised its investments. It also stopped running a conservative fiscal policy to raise expenditures

and started running deficits and since then budget deficits have been the rule and usually have

been large.

           Rodrik and Subramaniam (2005) do not believe that these higher government

expenditures can explain the improved economic performance in the 1980s. They argue while

they may raise GDP they would not have resulted in the higher growth of TFP which is observed

in this period. But if the higher growth is because of better capacity utilization then one can

expect higher TFP growth unless capacity utilization is taken into account in the measurement of

capital. The incremental capital output ratio which was over 6 during the period 1966-73, a

period of low growth and considerable excess capacity, dropped to 4 in the 1980s, a figure

similar to that in the East Asian region. Also one would expect that in a country with fixed

implied a low growth over the period 1951-and the mid 1970s and has been dubbed as the
‘Hindu rate of growth’ despite higher growth in the period from the early 1950s to the mid 1960s.
                                                                                                  8
exchange rates and no capital flows increased government expenditures would raise income,

however, at the expense of increased current account deficits and higher interest rates (Kenen,

2000). The adverse effect of higher interest rates on private investment was sought to be

neutralized by fiscal incentives such as accelerated depreciation. Also, development of the

capital market meant that much of investments by the large companies were financed by the

capital markets rather than banks. The government was able to prevent a sharp drop in corporate

investment as a share of GDP; but there was no increase in the 1980s. The increase in investment

was almost entirely in the public sector. Also, despite providing a number of incentives to

exporters it was not able to prevent the stagnation in the share of exports to GDP and the

emergence of an increasing current account deficit which ultimately resulted in the 1991 BOP

crisis.

          Some analysts believe that liberalization in the 1980s contributed to the improved

performance of that period. There was some easing of import licensing for capital goods and

some intermediate goods and also for expansion of capacity by large enterprises (Bhagwati,

1993, Panagariya, 2008). But the overall trade regime remained severely protectionist. Tariffs

remained high and the effective rates of protection did not fall in the 1980s (Kotwal, Ramaswami

and Wadhwa, 2011). Also there was no drop in the percent of manufactured imports subject to

non-tariff barriers (Kotwal, Ramaswami and Wadhwa, 2011). There undoubtedly was some

liberalization. The open general license (OGL) list which was begun in 1976 with only 79 capital

goods in the list covered almost 30 percent imports by 1990 (Panagariya, 2008). But we believe

that this liberalization was modest and more in the nature of policy adjustments that are often

undertaken by governments. Tariff revenues as a percent of imports remained high. Furthermore,

the almost constant share of corporate investment in GDP casts doubt on the effect of loosening

                                                                                               9
capacity expansion restrictions on raising growth rates. Rodrik and Subramaniam (2005) ascribe

the improvement in the 1980s not to specific policy changes but to the adoption by the

government of a more pro-business attitude which encouraged private sector growth. But since

corporate investment did not rise as a share of GDP, which it has since 1991, it is difficult to

identify the mechanism through which the government’s pro-business policy resulted in higher

growth.

          Statistical analysis to identify a structural break in GDP growth do not find a break in

the mid 1980s. Wallack (2003) finds a break in 1980, Rodrik and Subramaniam (2004) in 1979,

Balakrishnan and Parameswaran (2007) in 1979-80, Basu (2008) and Sen (2007) find it in 1975-

76. All show a break before the liberalization of the 1980s. There has been gradual acceleration

in growth since the mid 1970s after the adjustment to the various crises beginning in 1965 was

completed. The growth of GDP which had fallen to 3.4 percent a year during the Fourth Plan,

1969-73, rose to 5 percent in the Fifth Plan (1974-78) and further to 5.5 percent in the Sixth Plan

(1980-84) and 5.6 percent in the Seventh (1985-89) and has continued to accelerate. It is

difficult to identify this acceleration with specific policies.

          The development strategy was retained till 1991 despite mounting evidence of its

harmful effects. Research abroad (Little, Scitovsky and Scott, 1970, Bhagwati, 1978, Krueger,

1978) had shown import substitution policies to be inefficient. Commissions (Abid Hussain,

Narasimham) set up by the Government of              India had also documented the inefficiencies

engendered by the high tariff regime and by the system of licensing that went with it.1 Policy

makers were convinced that the basic model of import substitution needed a change. 2 The

Bhagwati and Srinivasan, 1975)

rationale for a large public sector producing capital goods no longer held since in an open

economy there was no equivalence between the size of the capital goods sector and the

investment rate.1 But the economy had been resilient. The effect of the BOP crises on growth

was usually short-lived, despite the slowdown in investment as noted above. The growth rate of

GDP fell to -1.2 per cent in 1957--58 before it recovered to 7.6 per cent in the following year.

Similarly, the growth rate declined from 4.7 per cent in 1973-74 to 1.3 per cent in 1974-75

before recovering to 9.1 per cent in 1975--76, and declined from 5.5 per cent in 1978--79 to -5

per cent in 1979--80 before increasing to 7.2 per cent in 1980--81.2 The exception was the crisis

during the years 1965--67 when the interruption in growth was much more substantial, and had

resulted in a much greater adjustment of policies than was usually the case.

         But policy makers had come to believe that the prevailing model was no longer

sustainable and needed to be changed. The 1991 crisis provided the opportunity to bring about a

fundamental change in development strategy, an abandonment of the import substitution model,

reducing sharply the role of the public sector and much less importance being given to the

objective of reducing income disparities. Reliance on the public sector lessened and more

importance was accorded to the private sector. This shift coincided with a change in the concern

about income distribution. Concern shifted from income distribution as such to reducing poverty



aside than the success of smaller countries such as Kore, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.
1 The Second Plan’s analytical basis was the Mahalanobis model which was of a closed economy

and where therefore the savings and investment rate equaled the share of the capital goods
sector in total output. The greater the investment in the capital goods sector the larger its share
in total output and the higher the savings and investment ratios and higher the growth rate.
For a discussion of the Mahalanobis model see Bhagwati and Chakravarty (1969). Also there is
a difference depending on whether one assumes that capital is shiftable namely can be used at
any time in either the consumer goods sector or the capital goods sector or that it is non-
shiftable, namely, once it is alloCated to the consumer goods or the capital goods sector it cannot
be shifted to the other sector. see Chakravarty (1969).
2 The large variation in growth rates was due to the effects of the BOP position as well as

fluctuations in agricultural output caused by variations in rainfall.
                                                                                                 11
and improving the condition of the poor. Consequently, the Rural Employment Guarantee

Scheme that provided 100 days of employment to each poor rural family was implemented; the

Right to Education Act was passed. In 2011, the National Food Security Act 2011, which

guarantees subsidised food to 50 % of the urban population and 75 % of the rural population, was

proposed. Disputes about its provisions have prevented its enactment as yet.

            Tariffs on manufactures were reduced from an average of about 100 percent and a peak

    of almost 400 percent first to an average of about 30 percent. Currently, the average is under 10

      percent (World Bank, 2011). Peaks have also been reduced. Furthermore, QRs which were

    ubiquitous have been almost eliminated. On agriculture they were converted to tariffs as part of

    the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture; the remaining QRs had to be eliminated when

India lost the dispute brought by the US to the WTO. Licensing has been eliminated; the number

      of industries reserved for the small scale sector which prevented the setting up of plants of

    optimal size has been reduced and large enterprises can enter even those reserved for the small

       scale if at least 50 percent of the output is exported. FDI and portfolio inflows have been

liberalized; outward FDI had also been liberalized leading to large outflows by private industry.1

Section III Growth in the Indian Economy



        The Indian economy has been on an accelerating growth path since the mid 1970s for

over three decades (Table 1). The financial crisis of 2008 has resulted in the growth rate

becoming more variable. While the crisis lowered the growth rate from 9.7 % in 2007-08 to 6.5

% in 2008-09, the economy recovered quickly to grow at 7.9 % in 2009-10 and 8.3 % in 2010-

11. But the high rate of growth has not been sustained and declined to 7 percent in 2011-12.

        The acceleration in the rate of growth is partly because of the greater weight that faster

growing sectors achieved over the years because of their faster growth. For instance if we apply

the growth rates for the sectors during the 11th Plan to the sector shares during the 6th Plan the

overall growth rate would be 6.7%. But if we apply the same growth rates to the sector shares in

the 11th Plan the overall growth rate is 8.2% a full 1.5% greater. The share of the slow growing

agricultural sector has been declining (Table 3). But another important feature of the growth


                                                                                                13
acceleration is the higher growth rate of the services sector. There has been a sharp acceleration

in the rate of growth of value added in services from the eighties to the nineties and further in

this century (Table 1).


         Is this acceleration in growth of GDP and the faster growth of the services sector

significant? The annual rates of growth of output in the agriculture, manufacturing and services

sectors and the mean growth rates and the standard deviation in growth rates for the periods

1981-90, 1992-2000 and 2001-10 have been calculated. A comparison of the sector growth rates

for the periods 1981-90 and 1992-2000 shows that the difference in average growth rates over

the two periods is significant only for services at the 10 % level when a two-tailed t-test is

applied. A comparison of sector growth between 1992-2000 and 2000-2010 shows no

differences in sector growth rates that were significant, the difference in the growth rates for

services was just under the 10% significance level. When, however, the difference in mean

growth rates between the 1981-1990 and 2001-10 periods is tested the difference in the growth

rates for services is significant at the 1% level; the other sector growth rates are not significantly

different. So there is an acceleration in the rate of growth of services though this does not happen

for the other sectors.


         What about the growth rates of the manufacturing and service sectors? The average

growth rate for services during the period 1980-1996 is 6.4 percent, not statistically different

from the 6.3 percent growth rate for manufacturing during that period. Again the average growth

rates for the two sectors are not significantly different for the period 2002-10, except for the year

2008 (Table 2). The significant difference is during the Ninth Plan (Table 1). The large reduction

in tariff rates for imports of manufactures could have resulted in a shrinking of the sector as

happened in many Latin American countries where the share of manufactures in GDP has
                                                                                                   14
declined. In India, seemingly the devaluation of the rupee has compensated for the reduction in

protection. The importance of exports has increased for the manufacturing sector. The percent of

value of exports to value added in manufacturing has increase from 16.4 percent in the 6th Plan

(1980-84) to almost 60 percent in the period 2007-10. This devaluation of the rupee has had an

even stronger effect on exports of services and this has contributed to a higher rate of growth for

the services sector.

         Despite this acceleration, the share of services in GDP in India, defined as a low middle

income country by the World Bank, while higher than the average is not exceptional. The

average for low income countries is 50 percent and for low middle income countries is 48

percent. Where India deviates significantly from other low middle income countries is in the

share of manufacturing which averages 26 percent for low middle income countries as against

India’s 15 percent, and this share has come down in the past decade in India. Furthermore, the

share of services in GDP increased between 1974-82 and 2001-10 by 85.3 percent in China

whereas it increased by only 32 percent in India. In Korea it increased by over 33 percent in this

period. In Malaysia and Indonesia in South East Asia it hardly increased and in Thailand it fell.1

Also, the share of manufacturing in GDP fell from 38.0 percent to 32.1 percent in China during

this period and in India it fell from 16 percent to 15.2 percent.

        The growth acceleration has been accompanied by a shift in the pattern of demand from

household consumption to capital formation, which has increased as a share of GDP by about 50

percent since the 1991 crisis and to exports of goods and services (Table 4).1Correspondingly,

the share of household consumption in GDP has decreased.


        The big change has been in the share of exports in GDP; exports of goods, non-factor

services and of labour services have all increased significantly (Table 5). The share of

merchandise exports in GDP which had stagnated in the 1980s2 increased rapidly since 1991,

more than tripling. Remittances from migrant workers, which usually comes under the heading

of private transfers, and therefore export of labour services have quadrupled between the 7th and

services (NFS) in GDP and this has more than quintupled. Most of this export has been of phone

and internet related services.

         However, the share of imports of goods as a share of GDP has risen even more, so the

deficit in the balance on merchandise trade has increased considerably (Table 6). The deficit in

merchandise trade has been increasing since the Eighth Plan and has increased particularly

rapidly in the 11th Plan, namely since mainly the financial crisis. But the huge increase in

remittances since the Eighth Plan and later the surplus in trade in non-factor services had resulted

in a declining current account deficit and even a surplus during some years in the 9th Plan. But

the sharp deterioration in the balance on merchandise trade in the Eleventh Plan has resulted in

the current account deficit reaching levels it had reached just before the crisis in 1991. The

liberalization has not resulted in an improvement in the balance on goods trade; it has, however,

resulted in an increasing surplus on trade in non-factor services and in remittances.

         The size of capital flows has also been increasing. Capital flows were negligible before

the 1991 crisis. Since then, FDI inflows have increased from 0.35 percent of GDP in the 8th Plan

(1992-96) to 2.41 percent in the 11th Plan (2007-10) and portfolio flows increased from .75

percent of GDP to 1.76 percent during this period. FDI flows have been increasing faster than

portfolio flows; however, the latter have important implications for policy as discussed below.

What is also important is that FDI flows are not a one-way street. Outward FDI has increased

from a negligible amount in the 1990s to 1.23 percent in the 11th Plan. Increasing capital flows

are an indication of the ongoing overall integration of the Indian economy with the world

economy.


         Since the mid-1990s when the exchange rate became market determined the economy

has gone through a number of phases. Initially a flexible exchange rate was combined with

limited capital mobility. Then capital mobility increased. In the first phase of limited capital

                                                                                               19
mobility a high fiscal deficit still resulted in higher interest rates and a higher current account

deficit. But since there was limited capital mobility the higher current account deficit translated

into a higher balance of payments (BOP) deficit and an exchange rate depreciation which

increased exports and so resulted in a still further increase in GDP and growth accelerated. But in

the second phase the increase in capital inflows because of the higher interest rates1 actually

resulted in an appreciation of the exchange rate which slowed the growth of exports and of GDP.

Portfolio flows which respond to interest rates are the relevant flows in the above analysis. We

see below how portfolio flows separate India from many other developing countries and makes

its links more similar to those among developed economies. More recently doubts raised by the

large fiscal and current account deficits2 have slowed the inflow of portfolio capital and have

resulted in a large depreciation of the exchange rate.


         An expansionary monetary policy in the US operates on other countries through two

channels, the real and financial ones. For the real effect, expansionary monetary policy raises

income in the US and increases imports so that exports of partner countries increase, leading to

an appreciation of the foreign currency. The financial effect is that the expansionary monetary

policy lowers the interest rate in the US leading to capital outflows and an appreciation of the

foreign currency which negatively affects exports. The inflow into the other country also lowers

its interest rate. So overall there is an appreciation of the currency, a lower interest rate, but the

effect on exports is uncertain.




1 The inflows was on account of portfolio investments by foreign investors as well as foreign
borrowings by Indian companies as foreign rates of interest rates were lower.
2 The needs of institutional investors for funds in their home markets may have limited their

investments in India.
                                                                                                    20
         Interrelations among the G7 are dominated by the financial effect so interest rates in

other G7 countries fall and their exchange rates appreciate following an expansionary US

monetary policy. But the response of developing country members is different (Agarwal and

Essid, 2012). In the case of emerging economies such as China, Korea and Mexico the exchange

rate usually depreciated and there was a weak tendency for the interest rate and for exports to

rise. This is because financial linkages are weak in the case of these developing countries and the

real effect dominates. Also developing countries are generally adopting an export oriented

growth model and so seek to prevent an exchange rate appreciation and actually bring about a

depreciation. The depreciation and the increased GDP seem to raise inflation and the interest rate

is raised to control the inflation; there is apparently no fear that the higher interest rate would

lead to capital inflows. The Indian economy behaves more like the developed economies and not

these developing economies, in that the currency appreciates, and the interest rate and exports do

not change. The different result is most probably because of the importance of interest sensitive

portfolio flows.


         The increase in exports raises GDP and with a fixed money supply this would tend to

raise the interest rate. In current circumstances policy makers face a difficult choice because of

the circularity of processes. Successful economic management results in confidence in the

economy and an inflow of capital. This leads to an appreciation of the rupee and a slowdown in

exports. This reduces the rate of growth of GDP and increases the current account deficit. These

erode confidence and lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate. Policy makers struggle to

provide a more stable growth process.


         The current account balance (CAB) reflects the changing savings investment balance of

the economy. In general the household sector has a surplus of savings over investment while the
                                                                                                 21
corporate sector and the government have deficits (Table 7). The surplus of household savings

had been increasing till the 9th Plan and since has declined. The decline during the 10th Plan was

due to a sharp increase in household investment (Table 8); but in the 11tth Plan period the rate of

savings declined marginally.

        Whereas the crisis in 1991 had been preceded by a large deterioration of the

government’s saving investment balance because of a combination of higher investment (Table

7) and lower savings, the worsening overall savings investment balance in more recent years has

been because of the worsening imbalance of the corporate sector (Table7), and because of a

sharp increase in investment by the corporate sector (Table 8) which has outpaced the increase in

corporate savings. The picture may not look as bleak from the prospect of longer term growth

despite the slowdown since the middle of 2011. The higher rates of investment might lead to

high rates of growth in the future. But this would require that the CAB be successfully managed

                                                                                                 22

sectors.

           It is also important to note that the share of corporate investment in GDP did not

increase in the 1980s, so even if government attitude was more pro-business in the 1980s as

claimed by Rodrik and Subramaniam, 2005, it is not reflected in higher investment by the

corporate sector. It is therefore difficult to isolate the mechanism by which the pro-business

policy raised the growth rate.1




1At that time there was discussion that Mrs Gandhi’s government was favouring the new
business groups such as Ambanis as against the traditional groups such as the Tatas and the
Birlas so Rodrik and Subramaniam’s claim that existing large businesses were favoured and
benefitted may not be true.

         When we compare economic performance over the three decades we find that the

behavior of the indicators is in line with the government’s objectives (Table 9). The rate of

growth of per capita GDP was higher in the decade of the 1990s as compared to that in the 1980s,

and further increased in the first decade of the 2000s. This growth acceleration was accompanied

by a higher investment rate financed to a large extent by a higher rate of domestic saving as the

current account deficit (CAD), except more recently, decreased as a percent of GDP. The

improvement in the current account balance (CAB) was because of a rapid increase in exports of

goods and services and in remittances. Furthermore, the smaller CAD was financed more by

private capital inflows, including FDI, rather than aid. The importance of aid declined so if self-

sufficiency was an objective of the government it was successful in achieving its goal.


         The standard deviation of most of the series increased (Table 9); but this was mainly

because these indicators had an increasing trend. The coefficient of variation decreased for most

of the indicators except for the current account balance as a percentage of GDP and for ODA as a

percentage of gross capital formation (Table 10).




                                                                                                    25

         The decrease in the latter case was because of a sharp fall in the average of gross capital

financed by aid as the standard deviation actually decreased. The means of most of the variables

show an increase from the period 1981-90 to 1992-2000 and a further increase in the period

2001-2010. We next examine whether these increases in the means are significant. When the

period 1992-2000 is compared to the period 1981-90 we find that for 6 of the indicators the

difference in means is significant at the 5% level using a two-tailed t-test, in one case the

difference is significant at the 10 % level and in 5 cases it is not significant (Table 9). When we

examine the difference in means between 1992-2000 and 2001-10, the difference is significant

for 8 of the indicators at the 5 % level, and for 4 it is not significant. Surprisingly, the difference

                                                                                                    26
in growth rates of per capita GDP is not significant either for the period 1992-200 when

compared to 1981-90 or when compared to 2001-10. We also find that the improvement in the

CAB was significant between the 1980s and the 1990s but when the 1990s are compared to the

2000s. So the improvement in the CAB was short lived.


        We can then compare the means for the period 1981-90 to the means in the period 2001-

10. The difference in means is now significant at the 5 % level for almost all the variables except

the current account balance which is significant at the 10 % level. The only variable which

shows no significant difference in means is the rate of growth in gross fixed capital formation.

This suggests that in many cases the effect of the policy change was slow acting so that there is

less change between consecutive decades than over a longer period. Also since there seemed to

be change in more variables in the second decade after the reforms than in the first decade there

may be an accelerating effect of policy change.

Section V Social Progress




            A major objective of policy making in India has been to reduce poverty. Though

poverty has been decreasing and there is an improvement in many other social indicators,

included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), progress has lagged in South Asia as

compared to other regions and within South Asia India has lagged (Table 11).

        The decline in malnourishment is for the period 2000-08. Also for South Asia the individual

         country numbers seem to be at variance with the figure for the region.

            The elasticity of reduction with respect to growth of per capita GDP has been low in Asia,

Section V Concluding Remarks




         We find that the Indian economy has been increasingly integrated with the world

economy since the reforms started in 1991. The importance of exports of goods, non-factor

services and labour services has increased. There are increasing capital inflows as well as

outward FDI. Closer integration of financial markets has important implications for the conduct

of economic policy in India.


         The behaviour of 12 economic indicators shows that the economy has done better after

the reforms, in terms of the level of these indicators and also their reduced variability so that the

economy seems to have become stable. While the growth rate of the services sector has increased

after the reforms the growth rates of the manufacturing and service sectors are very similar

except for the period of the 9th Plan (1997-2001).


         The behaviour of exports, growth of manufacturing and services sectors, FDI, all point

to greater similarity in economic performance between China and India than difference, if the

performance is judged with respect to the year of the reform, 1979 for China and 1991 for India.


         South Asia has lagged behind other regions in the extent of social improvement.

Furthermore, India has lagged within South Asia. The elasticity of improvement in social

indicators with respect to growth of per capita GDP has been low in India.
