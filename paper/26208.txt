                                         ABSTRACT

The Green Revolution bolstered agricultural yields and rural well-being in Asia and Latin
America, but bypassed sub-Saharan Africa. We study the first randomized controlled trial of a
government-implemented input subsidy program (ISP) in Africa. A temporary subsidy for
Mozambican maize farmers stimulates Green Revolution technology adoption and leads to
increased maize yields. Effects of the subsidy persist in later unsubsidized years. In addition,
social networks of subsidized farmers benefit from spillovers, experiencing increases in
technology adoption, yields, and beliefs about the returns to the technologies. Spillovers account
for the vast majority of subsidy-induced gains. ISPs alleviate informational market failures,
stimulating learning about new technologies by subsidy recipients and their social networks

1. Introduction

        The "Green Revolution" reshaped agriculture across Asia and Latin America during the

last four decades of the 20th century, but largely bypassed sub-Saharan Africa. Adoption of high-

yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers led to rapid growth of agricultural yields in Asia and Latin

America. In contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, the modest growth in agricultural production that

did occur was driven by land expansion, with little technological change, nor yield growth

(Evenson and Gollin, 2003). While Green Revolution technology adoption allowed the rest of

the developing world to take off economically, sub-Saharan Africa has become the repository of

an ever-larger share of the world's severely poor people. Twenty-five years ago, 17% of the

world's absolutely poor lived in sub-Saharan Africa. Since that time, that figure has risen to

51% (World Bank, 2018).

        In response to the Green Revolution that wasn't, African nations signed the Maputo

Declaration in 2003, pledging to invest 10% of their national budgets in agriculture to achieve a

6% rate of annual agricultural growth. The aptly named Alliance for a Green Revolution in

Africa (AGRA) was launched in 2006, led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. To

promote the adoption of the Green Revolution technologies that drove the economic take-off of

other regions, a number of countries recently introduced (or revived) input subsidy programs

(ISPs), which provide Green Revolution technologies (mainly fertilizer and improved seeds) at

below-market prices.4 These "second-generation" input subsidy programs are intended to be

"smart" in the sense that they (i) complement development of private input markets; (ii) target

beneficiaries with high potential gains from input adoption; and (iii) are temporary rather than



4
  Input subsidy programs were widespread in sub-Saharan Africa in prior decades, mainly involving input
distribution by state-owned enterprises. These earlier ISPs were discontinued in the context of 1980s and 1990s
structural adjustment programs.

permanent. Input subsidy programs are now consuming substantial resources across the continent

(Morris et al., 2007). While not all African nations have reached the Maputo Declaration budget

targets, ten countries currently implement "second-generation" input subsidy programs, devoting

20-25% of public spending on agriculture (nearly US$1 billion annually) to such programs.

Contrary to the third guiding principle behind "smart" subsidies, these programs appear to be

relatively permanent fixtures of implementing governments' agricultural policies, with no

apparent phase-out plans (Jayne et al., 2018).

       In the context of this recent wave of African ISPs, fundamental questions remain

unresolved. What are the impacts of ISPs on adoption of subsidized technologies, agricultural

output, and household well-being? Conclusions of existing observational studies are mixed, and

have difficulty establishing causal impacts: no prior research on ISPs has used a randomized

control methodology. Other questions have been barely addressed, if at all, in prior studies. If

subsidies are only temporary, would impacts persist in later, unsubsidized periods? Do ISP

impacts extend to social networks of subsidy recipients? What market failures, if any, are ISPs

helping to address?

       Answers to these questions are key to credibly estimating the full societal benefits of

ISPs, and for optimal policy design. It is important to understand persistence of impacts beyond

the subsidized period, to fully assess gains of temporary programs and to understand whether

governments can phase out ISPs over time. Relatedly, estimates of spillover impacts to social

networks allow a full accounting of societal gains.

       In addition, an understanding of market failures helps identify optimal policy responses.

For some market failures, subsidies are not the obvious remedy. For example, if farmers cannot

finance the technology or bear the additional risk technology adoption implies, then policy



                                                 3
should facilitate markets for financial services (e.g., credit, insurance, or savings) rather than

providing subsidies (Karlan et al., 2014). By contrast, informational market failures (say,

imperfect information on the returns to the technology) may call for subsidies that overcome

individuals' reluctance to learn-by-doing. Because information is non-rival, it may readily spill

over to social network connections of subsidy recipients, raising others' adoption and

magnifying societal gains from the subsidy (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995). Information market

failures may only justify temporary subsidies that can be removed once induced adopters learn

about the technology. On the other hand, if persistent behavioral biases such as present-bias

inhibit adoption, permanent interventions may be needed (Duflo et al., 2011).

       To contribute to these open questions, we conducted the first and (so far) only

randomized controlled trial of a "second-generation" ISP. We study the Farmer Support Program

(Programa de Suporte aos Produtores), a European Union-funded program for Mozambican

farmers managed by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and implemented by

Mozambique's Ministry of Agriculture with technical advice from the International Fertilizer

Development Center. The program is representative of ISPs that have recently spread in Sub-

Saharan Africa. Our results therefore have direct bearing on understanding the impact of ISPs in

the region more generally.

       We find that a temporary subsidy for Mozambican maize farmers promotes Green

Revolution technology adoption and increases maize yields. While the subsidy was provided for

just a single input package in one agricultural season, effects of the subsidy are persistent in later

unsubsidized years. Magnitudes of impacts are substantial, but comfortably within the range of

potential yield impacts of Green Revolution technologies (as detailed below in Section 5.2). We

also observe spillovers from subsidized farmers to their social networks: agricultural contacts of



                                                  4
subsidized farmers also see increases in technology adoption and yields. Spillovers account for

the vast majority of subsidy-induced gains. Both subsidized farmers and their social networks

report higher beliefs about expected returns to the technologies. We interpret these results as

revealing that ISPs help to reduce market failures related to information, stimulating learning

about new technologies by subsidy recipients and their social networks.

       Our main contribution is providing the first causal estimates based on a randomized

controlled trial of the new generation of input subsidy programs in Africa. In addition, we

contribute a new combination of findings to the literature on technology adoption in developing

countries. In this context, ours is the first paper to show that a temporary subsidy for agricultural

production technology has lasting impacts on adoption after the subsidy ends. In non-agricultural

technology contexts, persistent impacts of a temporary technology subsidy on adoption have

been found for health goods (Dupas, 2014) and for labor migration (Bryan et al., 2014). One

prior non-experimental study failed to find that ISPs lead to persistent adoption post-subsidy

(Ricker-Gilbert and Jayne, 2017). Recent randomized studies of Green Revolution agricultural

inputs in Africa do not investigate post-subsidy persistence (Duflo et al. 2008, Beaman et al.

2013, Abate et al. , 2018). Social learning about technologies has been documented previously in

prior studies, using both observational approaches (e.g., Bandeira and Rasul 2006, Munshi 2004)

and randomized study designs (e.g., Magnan et al. 2015, Laajaj and Macours 2016, Beaman and

Dillon 2018, Beaman et al. 2018 and BenYishay and Mobarak forthcoming), but none of these

have been in the context of input subsidy programs.

       In addition, prior randomized studies showing social learning have been researcher-

implemented interventions, not government-implemented programs. Muralidhran and Niehaus

(2017) argue that more randomized evaluations of government-implemented programs are



                                                  5
needed, to enhance external validity of findings. Similar to the findings of Baird et al. (2016) in

the context of a deworming program, we find that the benefit-cost ratio of the program increases

sustantially when spillovers are taken into account, highlighting the importance of incorporating

long-term and spillover effects in program evaluation.

        This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide further detail about the

subsidy program. In Section 3, we describe the randomized research design and the study

sample. Section 4 details the empirical regression specification. We present the empirical results

in Section 5. In Section 6, we provide a cost-effectiveness calculation. We provide concluding

thoughts in Section 7. An Online Appendix provides additional analyses and robustness tests, to

which we refer throughout the main text.



2. Mozambique's Input Subsidy Program

        Mozambique's Farmer Support Program provided once-off input subsidies to 25,000

smallholder farmers in five provinces. The program embodied key "smart" features considered

ISP best practices: it supported development of input markets by providing the subsidies via

vouchers to be redeemed at private agricultural dealers, targeted farmers thought to have high

potential gains from the inputs, and provided only temporary subsidies. The technology package

we study was designed for maize production.5 The subsidy provided a 73% discount on a

package of chemical fertilizer (50 kg of urea and kg of NPK 12-24-12) and improved maize

seeds (12.5 kg of either a hybrid or an open pollinated improved variety), valid for one use in the

2010-11 agricultural season. Subsidy users had to make the 27% co-pay (863 MZN or about

$US32) when redeeming the voucher at an agricultural dealer.


5
 Nationally, the program provided 15,000 subsidy vouchers for maize and 10,000 for rice production. Our study
occurred in a maize-growing area.

                                                       6
        While program design benefited from international technical advice, the Mozambican

government had sole responsibility for implementation. The agricultural extension agency

identified the beneficiary farmers and distributed the subsidy vouchers. We therefore estimate

impacts of an actual government-implemented program, rather than a potentially

unrepresentative researcher-implemented intervention (Muralidhran and Niehaus, 2017).

        The randomized controlled trial of the input subsidy program was designed by the

research team in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and IFDC. Lists of eligible farmers

were created by government agricultural extension officers, with input from local leaders and

agro-input retailers. Individuals were eligible for a voucher coupon if they met the following

program criteria: 1) farming between 0.5 hectare and 5 hectares of maize; 2) being a "progressive

farmer," defined as a producer interested in modernization of their production methods and

commercial farming; 3) having access to agricultural extension and to input and output markets;

and 4) being able and willing to pay for the remaining 27% of the package cost. Only one person

per household was allowed to register. Extension officers informed participants that a lottery

would be held and only half of those on the list would win a voucher. Vouchers were then

randomly assigned to 50% of the households on the list in each locality. In other words, localities

served as treatment stratification cells.

        Randomization was conducted by the research team on the computer of one of the PIs,

and the list of voucher winners was provided to agricultural extension officers. Extension

officers were responsible for voucher distribution to beneficiaries. Voucher distribution occurred

at a meeting to which only farmers who won the lottery were invited. Random assignment and

distribution of vouchers occurred in September to December 2010. Vouchers were intended to be

used for inputs for the 2010-11 season. The annual agricultural season in Mozambique runs from



                                                 7
November (when planting starts) through end of the harvest period the following June. Vouchers

expired on January 31, 2011, and this expiration date was strictly enforced. The vouchers were

assigned to specific individuals, and names were verified by the input retailer when redeemed.



3. Research Design and Sample

           To estimate causal effects, the government collaborated with us to randomly assign

subsidies among eligible farmers in 32 villages in Manica province. Within each village, the

agricultural extension agency identified farmers eligible for subsidy vouchers (using the same

criteria used in the over-arching program). The research team randomly selected half of farmers

in each study village to receive subsidy vouchers. These farmers comprise the treatment group,

and the remainder comprise the control group.6

           The sample consists of 514 farmers (247 and 267 in the treatment and control groups,

respectively). Agricultural extension officials informed study participants that vouchers would be

assigned via random lottery in study villages, announced lottery winners, and distributed

vouchers accordingly. We implemented surveys of treatment and control participant households,

tracking outcomes in the subsidized 2010-11 season and two annual agricultural seasons

afterwards, 2011-12 and 2012-13 (Online Appendix B gives further detail on the sampling and

tracking of respondents). We collected data on social network connections, asking each

participant to identify others in the village with whom they discuss agriculture (Conley and

Udry, 2010). The subsidy was assigned randomly, so controlling for the size of one's social

network, the extent to which members of one's social network received the subsidy was also

random. We are therefore able to establish the causal impact of the subsidies on a beneficiary's

own technology adoption over time, and on adoption by social network contacts of beneficiaries.

We also examine direct and spillover impacts on agricultural production, consumption and

learning about returns to the subsidized inputs.

         Table 1 presents key baseline summary statistics. Less than a quarter of households used

any chemical fertilizers in the season that preceded the subsidy, and slightly more than a half

planted improved maize seeds. Farmers' experience with chemical fertilizer prior to the study

appears to be quite limited. We also asked farmers how many years they used fertilizer out of the

last 10 years (prior to the beginning of the study). 67% of farmers reported zero years, and 87%

reported two years or less (panel C). Based on these reports about prior use of the technologies,

there appears to be room for learning about chemical fertilizer, and perhaps less about improved

seeds.

         Average (median) maize yields are 975 (600) kilograms/hectare, indicating a large yield

gap relative to yield expectations from agronomic trials of three to four times that level. Median

per-capita consumption (measured using a standard LSMS instrument) is just above the World

Bank's standard $1.95 a day poverty line. Finally, we can see in panel C of the table that our

network survey instrument registers substantial variation in the extent to which study

respondents were connected to other voucher winners, with 44% registering no connections, and

another 23% registering three or more network members who received the voucher.

         As is common in studies of real-world programs, we have imperfect compliance with

treatment assignment. Only 40.8% of farmers in the treatment group used their vouchers. Most

such non-compliance was due to inability to make the input package co-payment (even though

claimed ability to pay was a participant selection criterion). Moreover, 12.4% of control group

farmers reported using subsidy vouchers for the input package, due to imperfect compliance by



                                                   9
extension agents distributing vouchers (see Online Appendix D). Imperfect compliance with

treatment assignment reduces statistical power, but does not threaten internal validity of

estimates. The intervention is therefore an "encouragement design" that affects the probability of

using a subsidy voucher. The difference in voucher use rates in the treatment and control groups

(28.8 percentage points) is statistically significantly different from zero (p-value < 0.001,

Appendix Table A3). This treatment-control difference in subsidy voucher use drives all

treatment effect estimates.



4. Empirical Specification

       Our study focuses on three key outcome variables: use of Green Revolution inputs,

learning about returns to those inputs, and living standards. We estimate "intent to treat" (ITT)

effects, for the season in which the subsidy was offered, as well as for subsequent unsubsidized

seasons (to study post-subsidy persistence of impacts). We also seek to measure spillover effects

to social network contacts of treated farmers, over the same time periods. We estimate the

following regression equation for outcome variable "#$ of household i in locality c in time

period t:

(1)    "#$ = '() "# $ + 23$ "# $ + '() "# $

                       +23$ "# $ +   + # + "#$

       Outcome variables include measures of input use, yield, consumption and beliefs about

the returns of the input package (see Online Appendix E for detailed variable definitions). Time

periods are the 2010-11 subsidized season, and two subsequent seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13)

when no subsidy was offered. Right-hand-side variables are all indicators (equal to 1 if so; 0

otherwise).

         "# indicates treatment group households. $ indicates the observation is in the

subsidized ("during") time period, and $ the subsequent ("after") time periods. "#

indicates the household has above-median (two or more) social network contacts who were

randomized into the treatment group (we discuss below the rationale for this specification).

Social network contacts are defined as those with whom the participant discussed agriculture in

the season prior to the subsidized 2010-11 season.7 Households with "# = 1 have 3.63

treatment group contacts on average; for households with "# = 0, the average is 0.29.

         The vector of controls  includes indicators for having one, two, three, four, or five or

more social network contacts who are study participants (omitted category zero), to control for

effects of social network size. Social network size is not exogenously determined, and is

mechanically positively correlated with "# (households with more contacts will also have

more treatment group contacts). When controlling for social network size, the regression

coefficients on the terms including "# can be interpreted as the causal effect of having two or

more social network contacts who were offered the input subsidy. To capture common time

effects,  includes an indicator for each time period, and interactions between the time period

indicators and the social network size indicators (allowing social network size effects to vary

over time). # are locality fixed effects (treatment is randomized within locality). "#$ is a mean-

zero error term. We employ robust (heteroscedasticity-consistent) standard errors.

5. Empirical Results

          This section presents intention to treat estimates for equation (1) above. Given the

statistical and especially significance of the estimated social network effects, we also examine

alternative network specifications and test for alternative mechanisms that might underlie our

findings.

          5.1 Regression results

          Regression results are presented graphically in Figure 1, and regression coefficients are

reported in Appendix Table A4. Outcome variables in the regressions are expressed in

logarithms (findings are robust to alternate dependent variable specifications, such as indicators,

kilograms, or Mozambican meticais as shown in Online Appendix F and Appendix Table A5).

In the left-hand column of Figure 1, coefficients represent ITT effects of subsidy assignment on

households in the treatment group, during and after the subsidized season ('() and 23$ ,

respectively). The right-hand column of Fig. 1 presents '() and 23$ , spillover impacts on study

participants "more connected" to the treatment group (with above-median treatment group

contacts), during and after the subsidy, respectively. We will first discuss direct impacts before

turning our attention to the spillover impacts.

       The direct effect of the subsidies on treatment group members is an increase in

technology adoption and maize yields (coefficients in the left-hand side of the figure). Direct

effects during the subsidized period ('() ) are large and positive for adoption of fertilizer and

improved seeds, as well as for maize yields. In the after-period (23$ ), treated households show

some persistence in use of fertilizer, but not seeds, which can be due to the fact that improved

seeds were more widely used and known than fertilizer before the program. Direct impacts on

fertilizer use after the subsidy become smaller in magnitude, which is to be expected after the

end of the subsidy, but they remain substantial and statistically significant at the 1% level. Direct

impacts on yields remain almost as high in the period following the subsidy, which can be due to

the farmers re-using the inputs when not subsidized, and also to persistence in the benefits of

fertilizer used in the subsidized season though nutrients remaining in soils. Returns to fertilizer

can also increase because of learning about how to use fertilizer, or a selection effect, where only

farmers who observed high yields purchase the inputs after the subsidy period.

       We also show impacts on living standards, measured by per capita daily consumption in

the household (Figure 1, fourth row). Consumption is useful to examine as a summary measure

of household well-being. It is additionally useful because we do not have a measure of

agricultural profits, which would require data on all agricultural inputs used (in particular

difficult-to-measure labor inputs). Examining impacts on consumption can therefore indirectly

reveal whether agricultural profits rose. Direct impacts on the treatment group are close to zero

in the "during" period, but large and positive in the "after" period. Spillover impacts are large




                                                  14
and positive, with magnitudes that are relatively stable across periods. These results provide an

indirect indication that unobserved agricultural profits did rise and benefit households.

       Finally, to examine learning, we estimate impacts on beliefs about expected yields with

the technology package. To do this, for each study participant, after identifying their main maize

plot, we asked what production the farmer would expect in this plot if they used the technology

package on this parcel in 1) a normal year, 2) a very good year, and 3) a very bad year. We then

asked the farmer to say, on average, out of 10 years, how many are very good years, very bad

years, and normal years. This set of simple questions allows us to calculate the expected yield

when using the technology package. The last row of Figure 1 shows that being a direct recipient

of the subsidy significantly increased the yield expected by the farmer when using the

technology package. The positive effects on expected returns are stable in the "during" and

"after" periods (in terms of magnitudes and statistical significance).

       In addition to positive direct effects on treated households, there are substantial spillover

effects from treated households to their social network contacts. We find no statistically

significant spillover impacts during the subsidy season ('() coefficients). However, in

subsequent seasons (as represented by 23$ coefficients) households who have above-median

connections to treated households saw increases in fertilizer use, improved seed use, maize

yields, and beliefs about the returns to the technology package. Impacts on all these outcomes in

the after period are statistically significantly different from zero at conventional levels.

         5.2 Magnitudes of Effects

         Our estimated intent-to-treat (ITT) impacts are large and economically consequential.

Given 28.8% compliance with treatment assignment, our ITT estimate of a 0.21 increase in log

yields (a 19% yield increase) for subsidy-recipient households implies an undiluted treatment-

on-the-treated (TOT) impact of a 66% yield gain. Recent efforts to estimate the yield gap for

eastern and southern African maize farmers find the gap to be between 2.5 and 3.5 tons/hectare

(Sadras et al., 2015).10 Hence farmers in our study area, who produced a bit less than 1 ton per

hectare before the program, could have tripled their yields if they closed the gap. From this

perspective, our results are well within the bounds of what is believed to be technologically

feasible.

         We find that in the post-subsidy period, network effects often exceed the direct impact of

the subsidy. Since farmers with above median number of neighbors treated have on average 3.34

more farmers in their network who are treated, it is possible that the spillover impact exceeds the

direct impact if farmers learn sufficiently from discussing agriculture with their neighbors. Even

when summing the estimates of the direct and spillover impacts, we find a yield increment of

143%, which is high, but remains within the possible effects of closing the gap, estimated by

Sadras et al. (2015).11 Section 6.1 shows that the yield response to input use is very much within

expectations from an agronomic perspective.

         Finally, given that about 60% of household income comes from maize, the estimated

consumption impacts are also in line with what is possible and what would be expected from

Asian experience with Green Revolution technologies (Otsuka and Larson, 2016).


10
   The yield gap is the difference between the yields farmers obtain and what is technologically possible using
improved seeds and fertilizers given farmers' soils and the weather conditions they face.
11
   An increase of 0.51 in the log is equivalent to a 41% increase as the ITT, and a 143% increase in the average
treatment effect.

       5.3 Alternate specification of network effects

       While the presence of social network effects is consistent with what we might expect if

subsidies help resolve underlying information failures, this section provides additional analyses

of the role of the social network. It explores alternative specifications and tests for mechanisms

beyond information spillovers that might drive the findings.

       5.3.1 Effects of number of subsidy beneficiaries in social network

       Spillover effects are specified in our main regressions (Figure 1 and Table A4) as the

effects of having above-median (two or more) social network members in the treatment group.

This provides a reasonable approximation of the spillover effects observed when estimating a

more flexible specification. Table 2 estimates spillover effects in such a specification, with five

separate indicators for the number of one's social network contacts in the treatment group

(indicators for one, two, three, four, and "five or more").

       The general pattern in Table 2 is that the estimated coefficients on the social network

variables tend to be positive and significant in the "after" period, but mostly not in the "during"

period. In the after period, coefficient magnitudes rise as one moves from one social network

contact to two social network contacts in the treatment group, with the effect remaining roughly

stable thereafter. These patterns roughly approximate a step-function at two or more social

network contacts in the treatment group. Figure 2 displays the spillover effect coefficients for the

after period (23$ ), using the same flexible specification, for fertilizer use and maize yields.

       5.3.2 Separate social network effects for subsidy recipients and non-recipients

       Spillovers are often thought of as impacts on those who did not receive the treatment

themselves (the control group, subsidy non-recipients). But spillovers can affect treatment group

members (subsidy recipients) as well (Baird et al., 2014), and so the spillover effect coefficients

in our analysis ('() and 23$ ) incorporate spillovers to both treatment and control group

members. In Table 3, we estimate these spillover effects to farmers in the control group and in

the treatment group separately. We allow these spillover effects to differ by treatment group by



                                                 20
modifying equation (1) so that "# $ and "# $ are each interacted with the indicator

for the treatment group ("# ), and separately with an indicator for the control group

       Spillover effects for treatment and control group members are quite similar, as it turns

out, with some nuanced differences. The main difference is that for the treatment group only,

spillovers lead to higher maize yield in the subsidized ("during") period, not only in the post-




                                                   21
subsidy "after" period, suggesting that treatment group members may have helped each other

learn to use the novel technologies more productively in the initial subsidized year.



           5.4 Learning versus alternate mechanisms

           Our results are consistent with the benefits of the input subsidy programs being driven, at

least in part, by learning about the Green Revolution technologies. First, we directly observe that

study participants report higher expected returns to the technology package when they are treated

or have more than two treated social network contacts. Second, the increase in technology

adoption, yield and consumption persists in periods after the end of the subsidy. Third, the

greater effect on fertilizer than on improved seeds is consistent with the fact that fertilizer was

less used and known than improved seeds prior to the program. Finally, the fact that the spillover

effects mostly occur with a lag (only appearing in the "after" period) is reasonable, as farmers

may wait to fully observe outcomes of neighbors' experimentation before experimenting

themselves (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995). Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that the

subsidy alleviates information imperfections related to subsidized technologies.

           That said, social network spillovers are also consistent with mechanisms other than

learning. A first possibility is that farmers simply kept some fertilizer for the following season,

shared it with neighbors, or sold it to neighbors. We ask about fertilizer saving or sharing in our

surveys, and find that it is quite rare: immediately following the subsidized 2010-11 season, the

vast majority of respondents (88.8%) reported they had already used all the inputs for

agriculture, 2.8% reported that they had not used it, and only 1.4% reported that they sold the

inputs.12 Even though it was an option, exactly zero farmers reported that they had given away



12
     Also, 1.4% declared that they used the inputs in some other way and 5.6% did not respond to this question

any of the inputs. Based on these data, there appears to be little scope for farmers to have shared

their inputs with others. This is consistent with our qualitative observations during our presence

in the field. Sharing may have also been limited by the fact that the vouchers could only be

redeemed by the intended beneficiary named on the voucher certificate. In addition, we also

estimate whether the likelihood of using the voucher for one's own agriculture was affected by

the indicator for having two or more social network members in the treatment group. If sharing

was happening, one would expect that having more neighbors treated should reduce one's own

use of the voucher, but the effect is small in magnitude and not significant (Appendix Table A6).

       Another possible channel that can generate the spillovers is resource transfers from

treated farmers to their social network contacts (Maertens and Barrett, 2013). However, we find

that the treatment, and social network connections to the treatment group, are not significantly

related with the likelihood of providing assistance to others (Appendix Table A7 and Online

Appendix G). Resource transfers are therefore unlikely to explain the large spillovers that we

observe.



6. Cost-Effectiveness

       How cost-effective was the subsidy program, and what fraction of the benefits occurs in

subsequent (post-subsidy) periods and via spillovers? We calculate benefit-cost ratios of the

subsidy program, in total and then separately for direct subsidy beneficiaries and their social

network contacts. We also distinguish between the subsidized and post-subsidy periods. In this

calculation, benefits are taken as the increase in maize output net of increases in the costs of




                                                 23
fertilizer and improved seeds, while costs include the cost of the subsidies to the government, as

well as all logistical costs (calculated from detailed implementation budgets).13

           The top panel of Table 5 displays the decomposition of benefits. Most studies, without a

post-subsidy-period follow-up and a specific design to capture spillovers, would focus on

estimating benefits accruing to direct subsidy beneficiaries during the subsidized period; we find

that this only accounts for 10% of total benefits. But even when only accounting for this small

minority of total benefits, the benefit-cost ratio would be 2.0. The remaining 90% of benefits

accrues via spillovers from subsidized farmers to their social network contacts, as well as in post-

subsidy periods. 69% of benefits occur through spillovers. 74% of benefits occur in the years

after the subsidy ended. Accounting for both spillovers and post-subsidy effects leads to a

roughly ten-fold increase in the benefit-cost ratio, from 2.0 to 20.5.



7. Conclusion

           In sum, we find that temporary input subsidies can cost-effectively promote learning

about Green Revolution technologies, adoption of those technologies, and improvements in

agricultural output and living standards among both subsidy beneficiaries as well as their social

network contacts. Viewed through the lens of economic theory, input subsidies address two

kinds of market failures. First, they alleviate imperfect information, stimulating learning about

the true productive returns to the technology among farmers who were previously

underestimating those returns. Second, they mitigate the underprovision of goods that generate

positive externalities. Subsidies induce experimentation with the technologies, and information

spills over from subsidy beneficiaries to their social network contacts, who benefit from the

information as well. When goods generate positive information or knowledge externalities,

individuals have incentives to free-ride, avoiding costly experimentation so as to learn from

others' experimentation instead. Subsidies induce some who would have engaged in free-riding

to experiment themselves, moving society closer to socially optimal levels of experimentation.

When information constraints are important, well-designed public policy that successfully

encourages experimentation can generate the sort of spillover-driven highly favorable benefit

cost ratio that we estimate for this program. In short, there is a strong economic case for

temporary input subsidies, understood as a once-off inducement to experiment and learn.

Notes: Benefits are increases in value of additional maize yields, minus costs of additional
fertilizer and improved seeds used for maize. Direct effects accrue from being randomly assigned
to treatment group (being eligible for subsidy voucher oneself). Indirect (spillover) benefits
accrue from having above-median (two or more) social network contacts randomly assigned to
treatment group. Costs include the value of input subsidies and subsidy program management
and distribution costs.


                                                 25
       As with all empirical work, subsequent studies should determine the generalizability of

these results. It is important to note that prior investments in crop research led to the existence of

improved seeds and fertilizers suitable for the conditions in our study area. In addition, a prior

donor-funded effort led to availability of the technologies through a network of private agro-

input dealers (Nagarajan 2015). Future research may find that effects of subsidies are attenuated

in areas where available technologies are less suitable, or that are less accessible to input

markets. Other dimensions along which subsidy effects may be heterogeneous include prior

experience with modern inputs, geographical and climate conditions, crop types, and formal

financial development. Policymakers should be cautious about expanding ISPs before future

studies can measure direct impacts, post-subsidy persistence, and social network spillovers under

different conditions, as guidance for locally-specific benefit-cost analyses.

       Pending further studies to establish external validity, our findings have direct policy

implications. In contexts with strong post-subsidy adoption persistence and social network

learning spillovers, subsidy programs can achieve substantial gains even if scaled back,

compared to current subsidy policies implemented by governments in Africa. Input subsidy

programs need not be permanent nor universal to benefit farmers and their social networks in

substantial ways. Temporary, targeted subsidies can make major progress in bringing the gains

of new technologies to populations previously bypassed by the Green Revolution.
