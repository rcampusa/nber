       An Empirical Test of an Asymmetric Information Model of Strikes




                                  ABSTRACT



     Recent developments in the thoery of strategic bargaining demonstrate how
informational asymmetries can lead to prolonged and costly bargaining. These
models can be applied to contract negotiations between unions and firms
yielding an economic theory of strikes. To date, however, few empirical tests
of these models have been carried out. This paper presents some evidence
supporting this view of strikes. A set of predictions concerning the
incidence and unconditional duration of strikes is derived from a simple
bargaining model where the union is uncertain about the firm's future
profitability. These predictions are then tested on a micro data set of major
U.S. contract negotiations which took place from 1973 to 1977.

       AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF AN ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION MODEL OF STRIKES




I.   INTRODUCTION


     Many theories have been advanced over the years to explain the occurrence

of strikes during contract negotiations (for a survey see Kennan, 1985).

Recently, game-theoretic bargaining models have been developed which offer

potential new insights into why strikes take place (see for example Cramton,

1982, Hayes, 1984, Sobel and Takahashi, 1982, Tirole and Fudenberg, 1984, and

Tracy, 1984). Despite the considerable theoretical work devoted to these

asymmetric information models, no empirical tests of these models have been

published to date. The purpose of this paper is to derive and test some

comparative static results for a simple bargaining model.

     The intuition behind these bargaining models is quite simple. The

function of the negotiation process is to reestablish a division of the rents

accruing to the bargaining pair consisting of the firm(s) and the union(s).

Despite the bilateral monopoly situation which exists, if both are fully

informed then the bargaining should not lead to a strike. From an economic

viewpoint, a critical determinant of strike activity is uncertainty. This

uncertainty can be concerning the size of the rents to be divided and/or the

bargaining costs to either party. In the presence of uncertainty, bargaining

serves as a learning process whereby one party may be able to infer the

other's private information by observing his/her actions during the

negotiations. A strike takes place whenever this process continues beyond the

expiration of the current contract. By raising the costs of extending the
                                      -2-


bargaining, strikes bring about an eventual settlement.

      The following implications will be derived from a simple model in which

the union continues to make wage demands until a settlement is reached.

Increasing the union's uncertainty about the firm's profitability over the

next contract period increases both the probability and the expected duration

of a strike. The larger the average rents to be divided between the firm and

the union, the less likely it is that a strike will occur and the shorter is

its expected duration. Finally, lowering the union's bargaining costs leads

to an increase in overall strike activity.

     The paper presents tests of these implications based of a micro data set

of manufacturing contract negotiations. The uncertainty hypothesis is tested

using measures of investor uncertainty over the firm's future profitability

as a proxy for the union's uncertainty. This investor uncertainty is broken

down into a component resulting from economy-wide events and a component

resulting from firm-specific events. The data indicates that while both

measures of uncertainty are positively related to strike activity, the

firm—specific source has the largest and most significant impact.

     The effect of business cycle shocks on strike activity is also tested.

The impact of cyclic shocks to the industry as well as to the local labor

market are separately controlled for. The model predicts different effects

for each type of shock. Above average conditions in the industry tend to

raise the rents to the match and therefore should reduce the level of strike

activity. On the other hand, above average conditions in the local labor

market lowers both the level of the rents and the relative bargaining costs

to the union by providing part-time job opportunities     Both effects should
                                       -3-


tend to increase strike activity. The data confirms that strikes are

counter—cyclic with respect to industry shocks and pro—cyclic with respect to

local shocks.

     The hypothesis that larger rents to the bargaining pair discourages

strike activity is further tested by controlling for two additional sources of

rents. These rents can Consist of quasi-rents due to specificity -in the

match and monopoly rents due to market restrictions. Quasi-rents are proxied

by both the industry average job tenure and labor market experience for union

workers. The concentration ratio is used to control for monopoly rents.

Increases in either average tenure or experience reduce strike activety with

the latter effect being highly significant. The concentration effect is

opposite to the prediction and weakly significant.

     The outline of the paper is as follows. The second section of the paper

presents background material relevant to the modelling of strikes. The third

section contains a simple N—round bargaining model that illustrates the

implications indicated above. The development of the variables used to test

the model is outlined in the fourth section. The final section discusses the

empirical specification and results.



II. THE CONTRACTING PROBLEM


    Unions are assumed in this study to be wealth maximizing. Firms and

unions are engaged -in a long-term association which will involve numerous

contract negotiations. The implication is that the union will not necessarily

attempt to maximize their return from any given contract; instead, they try to
                                      —4-


maximize the discounted stream of expected returns from the sequence of future

contracts. In this paper, I assume that is is not in the interest of the

union to bankrupt the firm. This constrains the union's wage demands to a

competitive wage plus a share of the rents accruing to the bargaining pair.1

For simplicity, the bargaining model presented in the next section will not

incorporate the repeated nature of contract negotiations.

     Bargaining takes place precisely because of the presence of rents. If no

rents exist, then either both parties accept a competitive return or the firm

goes bankrupt. Consequently, for the contracting problem to be pervasive,

rents must be pervasive. There are two basic sources of these rents. The

first is quasi-rent generated by specificity in the match while the second is

monopoly rent generated by restrictions on output. Quasi-rents exist when the

productivity of the union workers at the firm exceeds their productivity

outside the firm. Similar quasi—rents exist if specialized capital is used by

the firm in its production process.2 A union can attempt to capture a share

of monopoly rents by either organizing into an existing monopoly situation or

trying to form a cartel within a competitive industry.3

    Agreeing to a division of these rents may involve an extended period of

bargaining when informational asymmetries exist. However, when both sides are

fully informed as to the size of the rents and the bargaining costs, neither

can gain by delaying the agreement. Consequently, in order to avoid

additional bargaining costs, both sides would agree on a new contract at the

outset of the negotiations. When private information exists, bargaining can

serve as a means of inferring this information. Bargaining continues as long

as the value of the information that is expected to be learned from an
                                       —5-


additional round of negotiations outweighs the additional bargaining costs.

Strikes tend to limit the length of negotiations by increasing the costs of

continuing this learning process.

     The idea that uncertainty is the central factor behind the dynamics of

bargaining is an implication of the work by Rubenstein (1982). In his paper,

Rubenstein analyzes a bargaining problem in which two individuals must divide

a "pie" of known size. Each individual is fully informed as to the other's

preferences and both prefer consuming the pie now as opposed to later.

However, they must first agree on how the pie is to be divided before they

can eat it. Each individual alternates making suggested splits. Using a

strict form of rationality, Rubenstein demonstrates that the two individuals

will always agree on the first suggested split. No dynamics develop in

the bargaining even though an infinite number of rounds of negotiations are

allowed.

     By making each individual fully informed as to the size of the pie and

the other's preferences, Rubenstein eliminated the need for bargaining to

serve as a learning device. Relaxing this assumption of complete information

will create some dynamics and thus allow for strikes to take place.



III. A BARGAINING MODEL WITH STRIKES


     The purpose of this section is to analyze a simple bargaining model which

illustrates the implications outlined in the introduction. The firm enters

into the negotiations with full information. The union, though, must

negotiate with incomplete information as to the size of the rents to be
                                         -6-


divided. Bargaining can last up to an arbitrary N rounds. At each round, the

union proposes a contract consisting of a wage rate. Production takes place

only after the firm agrees to a contract.4

     Let the present value of the firm's profitability over the next contract

peried net of non-labor costs be denoted by P. The value of P is calculated

assuming that no strike takes place, ie that the firm accepts the union's

first contract offer. At the outset of negotiations the firm knows P while

the union believes that P is uniformly distributed over the interval (!,].

The costs to each side from delaying the agreement are parameterized by

discount factors 6u'6f The payoff to the firm and the union from agreeing to

a wage w after t rounds of negotiation are


                  =



                      =
          F(w;P,t)        (P—w)ö1

     If the union's first contract is accepted by the firm, then no strike

takes place. In this case, t = 1 and no discounting occurs in the payoffs. If

the bargaining continues beyond the first round, then a strike starts and the

payoff to each side from a settlement is discounted to reflect its respective

strike costs. If no agreement can be reached after N rounds, then the

bargaining pair splits up. The union receives the present value of the flow

of competitive wages, R, in the local labor market. The firm receives zero

economic profits in its next best alternative use of its resources. The

union's prior beliefs about P. the discount factors, and the value of R

are assumed to be public information.5
                                              —7—


      At each round of bargaining, the union chooses a wage demand which

maximizes its expected return conditional on the information it has available.

In order to understand how the union infers the firm's private information

during a strike, consider for example what the union learns by observing

whether or not the firm accepts its wage demand in the N_ith round.

      Let 'N-i denote the firm's information set at the start of the Nth round

of negotiations. Denote the firm's conditional expectation of the union's Nth

round wage demand by EWN       1N-1' In addition, let P(WN,) be the level of

profitability for the firm if it is indifferent between accepting
                                                                     wN_l or
continuing the strike one round and accepting the next union wage demand. The

value of P(wN_i) solves




           P(wNl) - WN1= (P(wNl) -        EwN   I
                                                    'Ni6F

                           -
                               EwN   'N-16F
           P(wNl) =
                           (i_ÔF)

      The union learns if the firm's profitability -is greater or less than

P(wN_l) by observing if the firm accepts its wage demand wN_. If the firm

rejects the union's wage demand, then the firm's profitability is less than or

equal to P(wN_l). In this case, the union updates its beliefs by placing a

zero probability on P lying in the interval [P(wN_l), P(wN_2)]. As a

consequence, the union enters into the Nth round of negotiations with posterior

beliefs that P is uniformly distributed over the interval [P.
                                                                P(wN_l)].
      The advantage of working with a bargaining model with a fixed number of

rounds is that its solution can be found by solving recursively from the last
                                                        —8—


round. Assume that the firm has rejected the union's penultimate wage demand.

The union must now select its best final wage demand given its updated beliefs.

In the Nth round, the firm will accept any wage demand that yields it

nonnegative rents. Consequently, the expected value to the union from making a

wage demand of WN is



(2)         Vu(WN) =                                                                  R




The optimal Nth wage demand maximizes the union's expected payoff.

Define ! = P +     (P-R).     Then w >P when P(wN_l) > P.                                 Substituting the

expression for WN back into equation (2) and solving for the union's indirect

payoff gives
                                                                   —

       Following   the methodology in Cramton (1982), the form of the final wage

demand and the union's indirect payoff function suggest the following general

structure. If P(wN_l) > P, then for any j                                  N-2

                  *                           EP(w.) - R]

                                                    3


We    will check this conjecture by induction. Assume that this structure holds

for the j+l' through the Nth rounds. We must demonstrate that it also holds
                                               —9-


 for the jth round.

      At the outset of the th round of bargaining, the union believes that the

firm's profitability is uniformly distributed over the interval
                                                                                 ftP(w_1)].
What is the union's expected payoff from making a wage demand of w? If the

firm's profitability level exceeds the corresponding cutoff level, P(w). then

the firm will accept the wage demand; otherwise, the union receives the one

period flow value from its outside opportunities plus the discounted value from

making its optimal wage demand in the next round of negotiations.

                                                       •j—1


The optimal wage demand maximizes Vu(w) subject to the constraint on how the

firm selects its new cutoff point,
                                         P(w3).

                       w] = EPO'4)       Wj+1F

To solve for w, substitute for w÷1 and Vu(w+i) from (5) into Vu(w). Using

the constraint, we can write w in terms of P(w) and substitute this into

Vu(w). We can now maximize the unconstrained payoff function with respect to

P(w3). This cutoff point is given by


          -    *             (1_ÔF+óFcj÷l)

                         2(lF+5Fcj+1)          öjCj1

Substituting
                   *
               P(w) back into the constraint and solving for w gives
                                                                          *

                       2(1_ÔF+oFcj+1)                 öc+1

Finally, substituting for P(w) and w into equation (6) allows us to solve

for the union's 'indirect payoff function.




                *                                  (1_ÔF+oFcj+l)2        [P(w1) —

       Checking equations (9) and (10) with the general structure given in

equation (5), we see that the induction hypothesis holds. The equation for c.

is given by



                               ÔF+ÔFCJ+l
(11)        c =                                —
                    2(1_ÔF+öFcj+l)

To close the model we note that cN = 1/2 and P0 = P.                     So long as P(wN_l) >

we can use equation (5) to describe the union's optimal "concession" function.6

       Our interest is in the strike probability and expected strike duration

which is implied by the concession function. Recall that a strike begins if

the firm rejects the union's initial wage demand. The probability of a strike,

then, is given by


                           - P
(12)        Pr =    __________


From equation (8) and the fact that P0 = P, we have that

       The first three predictions to check are that the probability of a strike

increases with the UrIiOfl'S uncertainty over the firm's profitability, decreases

with larger total expected rents to the bargaining pair, and increases with the

value of the union workers' outside opportunities. Consider, first, the effect

of a mean preserving spread (MPS) in the union's initial distribution of

beliefs concerning the firm's future profitability. Stretching out the

endpoints P and P by an amount                has the following effect.

Increasing the union's uncertainty raises the probability of a strike.

       Shifting up the entire interval [P,P) by an amount A2 while holding R

uncertainty unchanged. The effect on the strike probability is

The larger the total expected rents to be shared, the smaller the strike

probability.

       Finally, the effect of raising the value of the union workers' outside

opportunities is given by

Improving these opportunities increases the probability of a strike occurring.

       The next set of predictions to check concerns the impact of the above list

of factors on the length of the bargaining that occurs. The expected

unconditional strike duration is given by




(17) E(D) =                                           (1) +.,.              (N—i)




To evaluate this expectation, we need to express the cutoff points, P(w) in

terms of the underlying parameters of the bargaining model. In general we can

write



(18)        P(w.) = R + k.[P(w.1) — R]


where


                  =            (l_ÔF+ôFcj+l)

                                               Uj+1

Using backward substitution we get that


(19)        (w.)=R+K.(P—R]

                      1=1


Substituting for the cutoff terms in (17) and simplifying gives

                           -   N-2
(20)        E(D) =               E   K.(i-k.1)(j) + _          (R + K.(P-R) -   P](N-i)

We can use equation (20) to check the predictions concerning the unconditional

strike duration. The impact of a MPS is given by

              E(D)                          [+P-2R] N-2

The effect of an increase in the total expected rents is

Finally, the effect of a change in the union's outside opportunities is



             8E(D)     =

The three prediction concerning the incidence of strikes extend to the

unconditional durations if the following inequality holds.

             Z K.(1—k.1)(j) +

            J=1
This can be demonstrated using an induction argument.7

       In summary, then, this simple N round bargaining model predicts that the

probability of a strike and its expected unconditional duration are positively

related to the degree of uncertainty facing the union and the value of the

union's outside opportunities. On the other hand, both measures of strike

activity are negatively related to the total expected size of the rents to be

shared by the firm and the union. These results incorporate optimal behavior

by the union and the firm at each round of the bargaining.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIABLES USED TO TEST THE MODEL


    The micro data set used in this study consists of all major contract

negotiations in manufacturing industries between 1973 and 1977 that were

reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.8 Both contract renegotiations and

scheduled reopenings are included in the data. For each negotiation we know

the firm and the union involved in the negotiations, the industry and region

affected by the contract, whether a strike took place, and if so how long the

strike lasted. Details of the construction of this data are presented in

Tracy (1986).

    Viewing contract negotiations as a process of splitting rents presents

difficulties when it comes to empirically testing the model. The predictions

are that strike activity is positively related to the degree of uncertainty

facing the union as well as the union's outside opportunities and inversely

related to the total amount of the rents to be shared. The difficulty is that

we can not directly measure these variables. Instead, we must test the model

by finding proxies for these unobserved parameters of the model.

    Consider the problem of measuring the union's uncertainty over the firm's

future profitability. Assume that on average, the greater the uncertainty

that exists in the financial market as to the firm's profitability, the

greater is the union's uncertainty as well. If this positive correlation

exists, then we can use measures of investor uncertainty as our proxy. The

finance literature suggests several methods for measuring this investor

uncertainty. The efficient market hypothesis stresses that security prices

adjust as new information is capitalized in the market. As a result, the
                                      —15—


current price of a security is taken as an unbiased in dicator of the firm's

profitability conditional on current information. Any news which changes

investor's expectations will show up as price movements.

    A measure of overall investor uncertainty is given by the volatility of

the firm's security returns. Tracy (1986) found that this broad measure of

uncertainty was positively related to both the incidence and the conditional

duration of strikes. While this is viewed as consistent with the asymmetric

information model of strikes, it would be desirable to derive a sharper test

of the model.

    In the bargaining model we assumed that the firm knew the exact demand

conditions f or the upcoming contract period. In reality, firms as well as

unions must forecast future demand conditions. There is no a priori reason to

believe that firms are more capable than unions at predicting the influence of

economy wide factors on the firm's profitability. Consequently, it is

unlikely that the union would engage in costly bargaining in an attempt to

learn this type of information from the firm. On the other hand, the firm may

possess superior information concerning firm specific factors affecting its

future performance. The relevant uncertainty facing the union in this model

should be over firm specific information rather than general economy

information.

    The volatility of the firm's security return reflects both firm specific

and economy wide sources of uncertainty. The finance theory market model allows

us to separate out each source. The market model expresses a security's

return as a linear function of the market return plus a residual.


          R.t= a+ iRMt +:;
where
                                           —16—



          R.t =   return   on the 1th security at time t


          RMt =   return   on a value weighted portfolio of

                  securities at time t

The slope coefficient, ,       is   the firm's "systematic risk factor" and captures

the security's sensitivity to market influences.

    The residual is called the "excess" return and has a zero expectation

conditional on current inforamtion. The excess return nets out much of the

effect of general economy news on the firm's profitability by controlling for

changes in the market return. Schwert (1981, p.125) argues that ". .      .using   the

market model to control for market wide variations in returns to all assets

yields more precise estimates of the firm specific effects on asset returns".

    In order to estimate these excess returns, a market model was fitted to a

250 trading day sample for each negotiation in the data for which the firm was

actively traded.9 The firm specific source of uncertainty will be proxied by

the standard deviation of the excess returns. The standard deviation of the

market returns multiplied by the firm's systematic risk factor will proxy

general economy uncertainty. Adjusting for the firm's beta is important since

firms with low betas are more insulated from general economy influences. The

asymmetric information model suggests that the firm specific source of

uncertainty should have the dominant influence on strike activity. This

provides a sharper test of the model than simply looking at an overall

uncertainty measure.

     The next element of the bargaining environment to control for is the

average size of the rents to the match between the firm and the union. The
                                         —17—


model predicts that higher average rents will reduce the overall level of

strike activity.     In section one, I emphasized that these rents can be made up

of quasi-rents and/or monopoly rents. We need, then, proxies for each type bf
rent.

        An important source of quasi-rents is firm specific human capital (Becker,

1972). Workers often receive on-the-job training which has its full value

only when used in that firm (or industry). In Williamson's (1975)

terminology, firm specific training imparts an "idiosyncratic" nature to a

task. The end result is that a worker's productivity is raised above its

level in other firms thus creating quasi-rents.

        In the absence of direct measures of the extent of on-the-job training,

the most natural proxy variable is the average job tenure of union workers in

that industry. The 1979 May Current Population Survey (CPS) contains both a

union coverage and job a tenure question. All union workers answering the

tenure question were sorted by two-digit industry and the industry average

tenure was calculated. A problem with this measure was that several industry

averages were based on very small samples of workers. This may introduce

serious measurement error into this variable.10

     An alternative proxy overcomes this problem of small sample size but is a

less direct measure of specific training. Union workers were pooled from four

years of May CPS's (1973-1976) and their potential work experience was

calculated. This provided a large sample of workers in each industry to use

to obtain industry average experience estimates. As a comparison, the same

measure of experience was calculated from the May 1979 CPS. All three

measures will be tested in the next section. The prediction is that they will
                                      —18--



be inversely related to strike incidence and unconditional strike durations.

     The extent of monopoly rents depends in part on the industry structure

that the firm operates in. A simple characterization of this industry

structure is given by the concentration ratio. Specifically, the measure

used is the percent of the total sales in a four—digit industry classification

that were accounted for by the four largest firms. To the extent that higher

levels of measured concentration lead to a greater ability to generate

monopoly rents, then the model predicts that strike activity will be inversely

related to the concentration ratio.

     An additional factor which potentially could affect the rents to be shared

by a bargaining pair is the cyclic conditions facing the industry at the time

of the negotiations. When industry demand conditions are above average, rents

may tend to be larger than usual. This implies that, others things constant,

it is costly for the bargaining pair to be involved in a strike at this time.

     These cyclic demand shocks will be measured using residuals from an

industry employment trend regression. These trend regressions were estimated

using quarterly three-digit employment data for the period 1970-1981. A

linear time trend with quarterly dummy variables and an autoregressive error

term was fit for each three—digit industry in the negotiation sample. To

avoid any potential feedback between the actual amount of strike activity in a

quarter and the residual, forecasted residuals are used in the analysis.

     The final element of the model to proxy for are the union's outside

opportunities. During the course of a strike, union members may be obtain

part-time jobs which help to offset their strike costs. The likelihood of

finding temporary employment will be affected by the general labor market
                                         —19—


conditions in the locality. Following the apporach used to measure the cyclic

shocks to the industry, cyclic conditions in the local labor market will be

proxied by forecasted residuals from local employment trend regressions.

        This concludes the discussion of the proxy variables used to test the

predictions from the asymmetric information model of strikes. Several

additional variables will also be included in the analysis to control for

other factors which may affect the bargaining environment. A discussion of

the motivation for and construction of these variables -is given in Tracy

(1986).




V. EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION AND RESULTS


       One of the implications of the model outlined in section three is that any

variable which increases the likelihood of a strike should also increase the

unconditional strike duration. The choice of an econometric specification

should be flexible enough to allow the data to reject this association. An

example of a specification which violates this condition is the lob-it model.

Consequently, I will separately model the probability of a strike and the

conditional duration. This will allow me to calculate the marginal effect of

a variable on the likelihood of a strike, the conditional duration, and the

unconditional duration. Prior to estimation the data was standardized by

subtracting from each variable its sample mean and dividing by its sample

standard deviation.

       The probability of a strike is assumed to be given by a logistic function.


                        1

The marginal effect of a change in a variable Xk on the probability of a

strike is



             aPr -   S       EXP(-X)
               k         [1+EXP(-X )]

       The conditional strike durations are analyzed using a proportional hazard

function.



(28)         A(t;X) =     X7(At)'1EXP(X)
The conditional settlement probability decreases, remains constant, or increases

during the course of a strike as y < 1, y = 1, y > 1.         In addition, the industry

and local employment residuals are allowed to vary if the strike enters a new

quarter. The marginal effect of a variable Xk on the conditional strike

duration is

                         —

                             A[EXP(X)]' k[l+Exp(xS)]2

       The sample means and standard deviations of the variables used in the

analysis are presented in table 1. The impact of variables on the probability

and duration of a strike are presented in table 2 and table 3•11 Consider first
                                          —21—


the role of uncertainty in bargaining. As in Tracy (1986), overall

variability in the security returns has a significant and positive effect on

strike incidence. A one standard deviation increase in this broad measure of

uncertainty leads to nearly a three percent increase in the likelihood of a

strike. From table 3 we see that this same increase in uncertainty increases

the conditional strike duration by over eight days and the unconditional

duration by two and a half days.

    The second specification in each table presents the results from

disaggregating this broad uncertainty measure into its two basic components.

The data clearly indicates that uncertainty over firm specific information is

more important than uncertainty over general economy information in

determining strike activity. While both types of uncertainty raise the

likelihood of a strike, the marginal effect arising from variability in the

firm's excess returns is more than twice the magnitude and much more precisely

measured than the marginal effect from variability in the adjusted market

returns. Similarly, only increases in the firm specific uncertainty measure

leads to longer conditional and unconditional strike durations. A one

standard deviation increased in the volatility of the excess returns results

in an eight day increase in the conditional durations and over a two day

increase in the unconditional duration.

   The key assumption of the asymmetric information model of strikes outlined

earlier is that the firm has private information concerning its future

profitability. The data clearly establishes the connection between volatility

in the firm's security price and strike activity. These price movements

reflect the markets reaction to news pertaining to the firm's performance.
                                     —22—


The connection between these uncertainty measures and the model relies on some

of this news being known by the firm in advance of its disclosure. This

assumption is more reasonable for the types of firm specific information which

are captured by the excess returns. Consequently, the finding that

variability in the excess returns is the key uncertainty measure lends

additional support to this learning model of bargaining and strikes.

    Turn now to the variables used to test for the effect of changes in the

magnitude of the rents on the bargaining process. Consider first the various

measures for the amount of firm-specific human capital in the industry. Table

2 and table 3 report only the results from using the experience measure

obtained from the pooled sample of union workers. This reflects a concern

with the possibility of serious measurement error in the job tenure and

experience measures calculated from the May 1979 CPS data. A one standard

deviation increase in the pooled experience measure is associated with an

eight percent drop in the strike probability. However, experience had no

significant effect on the conditional strike duration.

    As a comparison, the exact same measure of experience calculated from the

1979 data resulted in a logistic coefficient of —0.05971 with a t—statistic of

—0.71. Similarly, the logistic coefficient for the job tenure measure was

—0.11316 with a t—statistic of -1.34. The potential measurement error problem

is evidenced by the dramatic difference in results between the pooled and

nonpooled experience measures. These results also indicate that given the

measurement error problems that may exist, job tenure is the superior measure.

The marginal effect and significance level for tenure is nearly double the

corresponding nonpooled experience figures. This is consistent with the
                                        —23—



notion    that what creates quasi-rents is firm—specific not general human

capital. Finally, a likelihood ratio test was carried out using the pooled

data to check the restriction that the correct specification was experience

rather than age and education entered separately. The test statistic was

-2lnX =   0.696 implying that the data does not reject that experience is the

correct variable to use.

     The data does not support the hypothesis that higher degrees of industry

concentration are associated with lower strike incidences. On the contrary, a

one standard deviation increase in the concentration ratio is associated with

a 1.7 percent increase in the probability of a strike. This marginal effect

is weakly significant. There is no corresponding connection between the level

of industry concentration and conditional strike durations. Consequently,

while the unconditional marginal effect is positive, it is not significant.

     Cyclic movements in the rents to the bargaining pair also seem to affect

strike activity in a manner consistent with the model. A five percent

increase in forecasted industry employment is associated with nearly a two

percent drop in the likelihood of a strike. Similar to the experience

measure, the industry employment residual does not significantly decrease the

conditional strike duration. Consequently, while the unconditional marginal

effect is negative as predicted it is not measured very precisely.

    The last variable to check which relates to the bargaining model -is the

local employment residual. The model suggests that improvements in local

labor market conditions would have the opposite effect on strike activity as

compared to improvements in industry labor market conditions. The data

supports this prediction. A 4 percent increase in local forecasted employment
                                      —24—


is associated with slightly over a 5 percent increase in the probability of a

strike. The t—statistic associated with this marginal effect is 4.80 for the

second specification. Unlike the industry employment residual, the local

employment residual does significantly affect the conditional duration of a

strike. The same 4 percent increase in forecasted employment is associated

with a dramatic two week reduction in the conditional duration. This implies

that the effect of local labor market conditions on the incidence of strikes

is opposite to its effect on the conditional durations.

     Recall that the model has the property that the marginal effects of a

variable on the incidence and the unconditional durations should be the same.

In the case of the local employment residual, we see that despite the large

drop in conditional durations, the point estimate for the unconditional

marginal effect is positive although not significantly different from zero.

It would be of interest to see if other data sets on strikes yield similar

findings for measures of local employment conditions.

    Turn now to the other variables included in the analysis. The capital

intensity of the production technology has some impact on the bargaining

environment. A one standard deviation increase in the capital/labor ratio

increases the strike probability by around two percent and increases the

conditional duration by slightly over ten days. Neither effect, though, is

measured with much precision. Changes in the firm's inventory position prior

to the negotiations does not affect the level of strike activity. Firm size

as measured by the net plant and equipment is an important aspect to the

negotiations. Larger firms were found to have lower incidences of strikes and

shorter conditional durations with the second effect being significant. These
                                      —25-


two effects combined to produce a negative and significant scale effect on the

unconditional duration. Despite the role played by the industry unionization

rate in union wage differential studies, this variable did not affect the

level of strike activity. Finally, higher employment growth rates for the

industry or the locality tend to raise the likelihood of a strike slightly and

shorten the conditional durations.

     The results presented in table 2 and table 3 are estimated using both

interindustry as well as intraindustry variation in the data. A question of

interest is whether the key findings of the study hold principally across

industries but not necessarily within industries. The answer to this issue

can be found by reestimating the model exploiting only within industry

variation in the data. To do this, seventeen industry fixed effects were

included in the logistic model. The food, textile, and apparel industries

comprised the left out group. The latter two experienced no strikes which

implied that no separate fixed effect could be estimated for them.

     The "within" logistic coefficients and their implied marginal effects are

given in table 4. Looking within industries the firm specific source of

uncertainty is still the key uncertainty measure affecting strikes. While its

marginal effect is reduced from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent, this effect

remains larger and more significant than the corresponding effect from the

economy wide measure of uncertainty. No estimate for labor force experience

is possible since it was measured only at the two-digit industry level. The

two employment residuals retain their opposite and significant effects on

strike activity. Finally, the industry concentration marginal effect is

higher and more significant when based solely on within industry variation.
                                      —26—


     In summary, the aim of this study was to explore and test the comparative

static results from a simple asymmetric information model of negotiations and

strikes. The central idea of the model was that bargaining may serve as a

means whereby the union can infer information about the firm's future

profitability that is privately known by the firm. An implication was that

increases in the union's uncertainty over the firm's profitabiltiy would

increase the incidence and unconditional duration of strikes. Two distinct

measures of profit uncertainty were generated. The data indicated that not

only were both measures directly related to strike activity, but that the firm

specific measure was the key source of uncertainty. This finding is important

since the firm specific uncertainty measure seems to be more closely tied to

the information asymmetry built into the model. As a whole, the data seemes

consistent with the predicitioris of the simple bargaining model outlined in

this paper. Clearly, additional tests should be developed for this class of

bargaining models and checked against the data.

always be efficient for the firm and the union to sign a contract.

6.   1 am currently working on deriving the concession function and its comparative

statistics   for the case where P(WN...l) < P.
                                                                                     *
                                                 In this case, the union sets WN =

which guarantees that the firm will accept the contract.
7.   Details of this induction argument are available upon request.

8.   Major contracts are those which cover at least 1,000 workers.

9.   Speculation as to the outcome of the bargaining will begin to occur as the

contract expiration date approaches. This speculation will induce price

movements of its own that do not reflect the unions uncertainty about the

firmts future demand conditions. To avoid picking up these price movements in

the uncertainty measure, the sample period used to estimate the market model

ended six months prior to the contract expiration date.

10. A total of eight industries had less than thirty observations on which to
                                        —28—


calculate the industry average tenure. For example, the tobacco industry had

one observation, the lumber industry three observations, and the textile

industry five observations.

11. Table 2 also reports "pseudo" R2 statistics for each specification. This

R2 is calculated as follows


                   2    1—(L /LQ)21'N
          "PSEUDO"R




where     L = maximized   value of the unrestricted likelihood function

          L = maximized  value of the likelihood function restricted to
               an intercept term

          N = sample   size.

This measure was proposed by Cragg and Uhier (1970).
