                                              ABSTRACT

Labor force participation at older ages has been rising in the Netherlands since the mid-nineteen-nineties.
Reforms of the social security and pension systems have often been put forward as main explanations
for this rise. However, participation rates above the normal retirement age of 65 have almost tripled
for men and quadrupled for women despite the fact that at those ages reforms are unlikely to have
had much impact. This suggests other factors may have played an important role in this rise as well.
In addition to the effects of reforms in social security and pension systems, this chapter examines the
importance for men’s labor force participation at older ages of improved health, increased levels of
education, and differences in skills across cohorts, as the older cohorts moved into retirement, such
that workers’ characteristics better matched labor demand. These changes on the labor supply side
are likely to have contributed to the success of the reforms since the mid-nineteen-nineties and to have
had a large independent impact on men’s labor force participation at older ages.

    1. Introduction

Over the last two decades, social security programs and pension schemes around the world have

been redesigned to create stronger incentives for continued work at older ages (Gruber and Wise,

2004; Wise, 2012, 2016). These reforms have for a large part been triggered by the rapidly declining

labor force participation of men at older ages since the nineteen-seventies while life expectancy

continued to rise (Figures 1 and 2). For the Netherlands, this rise in life expectancy has been just

under two months per year on average since 1950. For women, since the end of the nineteen-

seventies, labor force participation has risen at ages 55-59 but has notably dropped at ages 60-64

from over 11 percent in the mid-nineteen seventies to around 8 percent in the mid-nineteen-nineties

(Figure 3). Apart from people living longer, a strong decline in fertility rates has amplified the aging of

Dutch society. Completed fertility has dropped during the second half of the twentieth century from

around three children per woman during the mid-nineteen-fifties to around 1.7 in 2014 (Figure 4).

Increased life expectancy and decreased fertility have initially caused the total dependency ratio, i.e.

the number of people under 20 and over 64 as a percentage of the number of people aged 20-64, to

decrease from 1971 onward as there were relatively fewer children. Since the mid-nineteen-nineties

the total dependency ratio started rising again due to a continuing increase in the share of the

population aged 65 and over (Figure 5). The aged dependency ratio, i.e. the number of people over

64 as a percentage of the number of people aged 20-64, has increased from about 19 percent in

1971 to 29 percent in 2014. The aging of Dutch society gained momentum after 2011 as the baby

boom generation began to reach the normal retirement age of 65 and the aged dependency ratio is

predicted to further increase to about 50 percent in 2050 (Statistics Netherlands; statline.cbs.nl). The

aging of the Dutch population has raised concerns about the burden on public finances as it increases

public expenditures on, for instance, long-term care and retirement pensions (OECD, 2011; Van Ewijk




                                                                                                         2
et al., 2006). 1 One way to alleviate this burden is to increase labor force participation at older ages as

it will increase tax revenues and, when stimulated by an increased normal retirement age, reduce

public pension expenditures.

 Reforms aimed at a reduction of public health care expenditures such as decreased coverage of health care
and long-term care insurance, are unlikely to have impacted labor force participation and a discussion of these
are beyond the scope of this chapter.

This chapter discusses explanations that have been suggested in the literature for the strong rise in

men’s labor force participation since the mid-nineteen-nineties (Figure 2). The reason for restricting

our discussion to this period is that 1995 (or about) turns out to be a pivotal year for many countries,

including the Netherlands, after which labor force participation rates of older workers increased

sharply after a long period of decline. 2 Two important necessary conditions for an individual to keep

on working at older ages are being in good health and having the skills to remain attractive to

employers. These conditions are discussed in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. Next, Section 4 discusses

the role institutions may have played in the rise of labor force participation rates of older workers.

Section 5 discusses the overall findings, the restrictions of the underlying analyses, and implications

for future labor market participation of older workers.




    2. Health and Labor Force Participation

Staying healthy is necessary to keep on working at older ages. In this section we take first mortality

and healthy life expectancy, and next the percentage of people receiving Disability Insurance as

measures for the health of older workers.


2.1 Health and mortality


When looking at mortality data one can conclude that health at all ages has improved over long

periods of time. Life expectancy at birth in the Netherlands has doubled from around 40 years in

1850 (the earliest records available) to currently around 80 years (Human Mortality Database;

http://www.mortality.org). Although initially reductions in infant mortality caused this increase, at

older ages health has improved significantly as well. The mortality rate at age 60 (men and women


2
 The roles early retirement schemes and Disability Insurance have played in the declining men’s labour force
participation during the nineteen eighties are discussed in, respectively, Kapteyn and de Vos (1999) and Koning
and Lindeboom (2015).

                                                                                                              6
combined), for instance, has declined from around 3 percent in 1850, to 2.5 percent in 1900 and 1.2

percent in 1950. Currently it is about 0.6 percent. Figure 6 shows a stronger decline in men’s than in

women’s mortality at age 60 in recent decades. These declines in mortality rates are a global

phenomenon and can be attributed to (interrelated) factors such as a decline in infectious diseases,

medical innovations, improved living standards, better nutrition and public health and social policies

(Cutler, Deaton and Lleras-Muney 2006).


Increases in life expectancy are not always accompanied by an equal rise in expected healthy life

years. For this reason, Statistics Netherlands has computed healthy life expectancy; an adjustment of

life expectancy for the actual health status of individuals. 3 A visual inspection of the trends in figures

7 and 8 of men’s and women’s life expectancy and healthy life expectancy at different ages suggests

that life expectancy and healthy life expectancy are closely related. Using the numbers on which

these figures are based, we find that, on average over the past 25 years, healthy life expectancy as a

share of total life expectancy is about 0.60 to 0.63 for men and 0.55 to 0.59 for women. These shares

reveal that while women live longer, they spend relatively more years in bad health than men.

Noteworthy is that, for instance at age 65, healthy life expectancies of men and women have

converged. The difference was about two years in the early nineteen-eighties and is nowadays close

to zero. Almost all of the additional years of life expectancy for women aged 65 have gained since the

early nineteen-eighties are spent in bad health, and as a result the remaining healthy life

expectancies at age 65 of men and women are nowadays about equal. This suggests a stronger

improvement in men’s health than in women’s health at age 65.

expect to live in good health, assuming the current risks of death and bad health apply. Taken into account are
if a person perceives to be in good health (self-assessed health), is without physical limitations (no long-term
limitations in mobility, sight and hearing) and without chronic diseases (heart condition and/or myocardial
infarction, asthma, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema or chronic non-specific pulmonary disease,
cancer, stroke, diabetes, serious or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, chronic arthritis (Bechterew’s disease,
chronic rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis), serious or chronic backache (including slipped disk), degenerative
arthritis in hips or knees, hypertension (high blood pressure), migraine or recurring serious fits of headache),
and is in good mental health (based on the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) determined by the balance of
positive and negative feelings).

                                                                                                                 7
2.2 Health and Disability Insurance


The Disability Insurance (DI) scheme in the Netherlands mandates social insurance for all workers

against earnings loss due to adverse health events. In principle, therefore, the percentage of people

receiving DI measures the health of older workers. Koning and Lindeboom (2015) show that there is a

decline in DI recipients from about 1992 onward for the entire Dutch working population. Figure 9

shows that for older men the percentages of people receiving DI have been steadily declining since

1989. Over the years 1989-1993 this decline is most pronounced for men aged 50-54. A similar

decline is observed for these cohorts five years later over the years 1994-1998 (at ages 55-59) and

ten years later over the years 1999-2003 (at ages 60-64). If the percentage of people receiving DI

were to measure the health of older workers, it would suggest, in line with the observations based

on mortality rates in section 2.1, that the younger cohorts are relatively healthier than the older

cohorts (for a given age). Figure 10 shows that for women the DI rates are relatively stable, despite

the strong increase in women’s employment rates (Figure 3) which may also suggest an

improvement in health of older female workers. DI rates are not just a function of health, but also of

institutions governing flows into an out of the DI-system. At least part of the observed changes is also

affected by institutional changes as will be argued below.

      3. Skills

Part of the explanation for the rapidly declining labor force participation of older workers since the

mid-nineteen-seventies may be skill-biased technological change (SBTC; Autor and Katz 1999). SBTC

has increased the demand for higher educated workers at the expense of lower educated workers.

Many of the skills of lower educated older workers have become obsolete and are no longer in

demand. The occupations that demanded these skills often included manual and physically

demanding tasks that have been replaced by capital intensive equipment such as machines. In

addition, and especially since the nineteen-nineties, automation, i.e. a shift to capital intensive

equipment that makes use of computers, has taken over routine based tasks that happen to be

relatively more often performed by (older) workers with median levels of education (Autor and Dorn

2009; Goos, Manning and Salomons 2015). 4 One of the explanations for the rapid rise in labor force

participation from the mid-nineteen-nineties may, therefore, be related to shifts in the composition

4
    Often referred to as Routine-Biased Technological Change (RBTC).

                                                                                                            11
of employers’ demand toward non-routine occupations and high skilled workers. To investigate the

plausibility of that explanation we consider the change in the educational and occupational

distributions among older workers.


Levels of education are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of

Education (ISCED) 5. ISCED 1-2 will be referred to as a low level of education, ISCED 3 as a medium

level of education and ISCED 4-5 as a high level of education. Figure 11 shows that the percentage of

higher educated men aged 55-64 has doubled over the period 1989-2012. Over the same period the

percentage of lower educated men aged 55-64 has decreased by almost 20 percentage points. These

trends have resulted in a continuous increase in the level of education of older workers. Figure 12

shows similar trends for women in this age range, with even stronger increases in the percentage of

higher and median educated women and a stronger decrease in the percentage of lower educated

women. While the levels of education for men are higher than for women, the figures show

convergence as women in the younger cohorts are closing this gap. In addition, Kalwij, De Vos and

Kapteyn (2016) find that the level of education is one of the important determinants of employment

at older ages and that the exit rates from employment are largest for the lower educated. Taking

these findings together suggests that the increased labor force participation rates of older workers

can at least partly be explained by increased levels of education of older workers, which made them

more attractive to employers.


Figure 13 shows that in particular median skilled jobs have been disappearing for men, an 11

percentage points drop over the 1990-2011 period, while the high and academic skilled jobs have

gained (together about a 10 percentages point increase). The percentages low skilled and elementary

jobs remain relatively constant between 1990 and 2011. For women, Figure 14 shows a slightly

different picture. Although (relative) job growth for women has also been mainly in high and

education.aspx

                                                                                                       12
academic skilled jobs (together about a 12 percentage points increase), the percentage median

skilled jobs has also increased by about 8 percentage points. At the same time there has been a very

large drop in low skilled and elementary jobs by, respectively, 11 and 8 percentage points. The Dutch

situation of a relative rise in medium skilled jobs for women, as opposed to the relative drop for men,

appears to be in contrast to the empirical evidence provided for the U.S. that computerization of

tasks reduces employment in routine task-intensive occupations for male and female workers (Autor,

Dorn and Hanson 2015).


To sum up, the shifts in the level of education and skill composition of older male workers (Figures 11

and 13) are likely to have contributed to the rise of labor force participation rates among older men

from the mid-nineteen-nineties onward as the entering cohorts more often had the skills demanded

than the retiring cohorts.

    4. Institutions and labor force participation

From the end of the nineteen-seventies onward generous early retirement schemes were

introduced. Early on these were often called Young-for-Old programs. As this name suggests, the

main idea was that if older workers would leave the workforce, younger people would take their

places. The introduction of these early retirement schemes was a policy reaction to very high youth

unemployment and relatively unhealthy older male workers (section 2) of whom many had jobs that

were becoming obsolete (section 3). This, together with the fact that the benefits were quite

generous, made these schemes very attractive for both employees and employers. Net replacement

rates were high and the programs were mainly financed by the current workforce. As shown in Figure

15, the ER option has been taken by over one-third of the people aged 60-64. ER rates rapidly

declined since the mid-nineteen-nineties among people under 60 but ER rates among 60-64 year old

people remained high for many more years and started to decline somewhat after about 2006. As it

turns out, empirical evidence suggests that the early retirement schemes did not create additional

employment for the young (Kapteyn, de Vos, and Kalwij 2010). One explanation for this is that, as

mentioned earlier, many jobs that were left behind by early retirees involved obsolete tasks. Support

for this explanation is given by Kalwij, Kapteyn and de Vos (2010) who find that employment of the

young and old are not substitutes and may even be complements. As described in the introduction,

the popularity of the early retirement schemes has led to rapidly declining labor market participation

rates of older workers from the late nineteen-seventies onward, reaching a historical low in the early

nineteen-nineties (Kapteyn and de Vos, 1999).


At the end of nineteen-eighties Dutch policymakers’ reactions to the historically low labor market

participation rates of older workers, in combination with the aging of the Dutch population, involved

a series of reforms implemented from the early nineteen-nineties onward such as making early

retirement benefits less generous, and imposing stricter eligibility rules for disability and

unemployment insurances (see Appendix A). The necessity of the reforms has been amplified by a

                                                                                                     16
series of crises such as the dotcom crash in 2000-2001, the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and housing

market and Euro crises in its aftermath, which have shown the financial vulnerability of the Dutch

social security and pension system (e.g. Kalwij, Alessie, Gardner and Ali 2018). The latter sequence of

events created the momentum for increasing the normal retirement age in the Netherlands. The

normal retirement age is the age at which people start receiving a public old age pension. Up until

2012 the normal retirement age was 65. It will increase gradually to 66 in 2018 and 67 in 2021. After

that it will be further raised in line with increases in population life expectancy, up to age 70 and

three months.


The labor force participation rates shown in Figures 2 and 3 suggest that the reforms of the past two

decades may have been successful as these rates have strongly risen from the onset of the reforms in

the mid-nineteen-nineties. Men’s labor force participation at ages 60-64 has tripled over this period

from 20 percent in 1995 to over 60 percent in 2014. For men aged 55-59 the labor force participation

has substantially increased from 61 percent in 1995 to 86 percent in 2014 (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows,

from the mid-nineteen-nineties onward, similar trends for women as for men but at lower levels.

Previous empirical studies of the impact of less generous early retirement schemes also suggest that

these reforms have contributed to the increase in the labor force participation (LFP) of the 55–64

population from less than 30% in the mid-1990s to 45% in 2007 (Euwals, de Mooij and van Vuuren

2009; Kapteyn and de Vos 1999; Van Oorschot 2007).


As shown by Burkhauser and Daly (2011), the number of DI beneficiaries per worker in the

Netherlands, which for a long time was among the highest in the developing world, decreased below

the comparable figure for the US, which suggests that DI reforms may also have had considerable

impact. Findings of de Jong, Lindeboom and van der Klaauw (2011) suggest that stricter screening of

disability insurance applications has reduced long-term sickness absenteeism and disability insurance

applications. In line with these latter results, Kalwij, de Vos and Kapteyn (2016) show that the

reduction over the last decades in the percentage of older workers that have exited the labor market
                                                                                                        17
through DI has mainly been achieved by restricting access to the Disability Insurance scheme and is

not due to a reduction in the generosity of disability benefits.


Pathways


One way in which adverse labor market effects of the DI and ER reforms could manifest themselves is

that older workers who lose their job end up unemployed if stricter criteria make them no longer

eligible for early retirement or disability insurance. Figure 16, however, shows that men’s

employment rates have followed similar trends as the participation rates of Figure 2 and

unemployment rates have in fact decreased substantially to about 2 percent just before the dotcom

crisis of 2001 (Figure 17). Since then, unemployment rates have been rising, following the business

cycle, also among older workers to around 7 to 8 percent. Similar patterns are observed for women’s

employment and unemployment rates (Figures 18 and 19).


Older workers are more likely to have job protection than young workers (as it is based on tenure), to

be relatively expensive, and may have obsolete skills (Section 3). These features, together with the

fact that employers and employees bear little of the costs, made DI and ER schemes attractive

pathways to retirement during the nineteen-eighties and nineties. Koning and Lindeboom (2015)

make a convincing case that the DI system provided incentives to use DI as an alternative for

unemployment or early retirement. Figures 17 and 19 show that during the nineteen-eighties and

nineties the unemployment rates for older workers were relatively low compared to those for all

workers and that this relative difference gradually diminished since the mid-nineteen-nineties when

stricter eligibility rules for ER and DI benefits were introduced. These observations suggest that as

long as the eligibility criteria were lenient, ER and DI schemes were used to lay off redundant

workers. Nevertheless, it appears that restricting the ER and DI pathways has not resulted in a

substantially increased use of the UI pathway. As discussed in Appendix A, the various institutional




                                                                                                        18
reforms have affected a wide range of social security programs, including early retirement, disability

and unemployment insurance. On balance this has limited the possibilities for substitution.

    5. Discussion


The economic literature as well as some of the findings above suggest that the introduction of early

retirement schemes at the end of the nineteen-seventies, together with lenient eligibility rules for

disability and unemployment insurances, resulted in a strong reduction in labor force participation

among the older population in the two decades thereafter. Likewise, reforms of social security

programs and pension schemes since the mid-nineteen-nineties with the purpose of creating

stronger incentives for continued work at older ages, such as stricter eligibility rules for ER, UI and DI,

have been quite effective in the Netherlands. Figure 20 shows that most of the increase in

employment among men aged 60-64 has been accompanied by a decrease in UI and DI recipients

while ER rates remained high until recently. These policies have largely been designed in response to

changes in economic circumstances, some which we have highlighted in this chapter in Sections 2

and 3.


Figures 2 and 3 suggest however that probably not all labor force participation and employment

changes are due to institutional changes. These figures show that participation rates above the

normal retirement age of 65 have, from the mid-nineteen nineties onward, increased by 15

percentage points for men (almost tripling in levels) and 6 percentage points for women (almost

quadrupling in levels) despite the fact that these groups have been less affected by the reforms of

social security programs and pension schemes since the mid-nineteen-nineties that were mainly

targeted at people younger than 65.


This may suggest that factors other than institutions, such as the health and skills of older workers

(sections 2 and 3), may have played an important role in people working longer and the strong

increases in labor force participation at all ages since the mid-nineteen-nineties. Or, at a minimum,

these other factors provided the necessary conditions for DI and ER reforms to be successful. For

instance, the improved health of older people may have facilitated the reforms over the last two
                                                                                                        22
decades as it ensured the necessary extra work capacity. 6 In this interpretation, the reforms provided

people the incentives to keep on working and their improved health and better skills made it possible

for them to do so.


A final factor that has gained recent attention in the literature is the impact of the strong rise in

women’s employment at older ages, as shown in Figure 18, on men’s employment behavior. Men

and women take joint retirement decisions and an individual is more likely to continue working if his

or her spouse works longer (Schirle 2008; Bloemen, Hochguertel, and Zweerink 2015). Hence, more

men are likely to continue working if their wives are working and the strong rise in women’s labor

force participation is likely to have had its own positive impact on men’s labor force participation.


Looking toward the future, less generous pensions and a continuing increase in the normal

retirement age are likely to contribute to further increases in labor force participation. Two concerns

are often raised in the policy debate. First, keeping older people work longer may adversely affect

employment of the young, and especially in times of high youth unemployment this argument is put

forward. As we discussed above, the empirical evidence of Kalwij, Kapteyn and de Vos (2010) and of

references therein suggests this is not a reasonable concern. Empirical findings of previous studies do

not support the hypothesis that employment of the young and old are substitutes. In other words,

encouraging later retirement is unlikely to have adverse effects on youth employment. A second

concern is that there may be adverse effects of working longer on health. For instance, the relatively



6
    Based on a combination of population mortality and survey data, additional work capacity in 2013 is

estimated to be about 31 percentage points at ages 60-64, increases to 53 percentage points at ages 65-69 and

is reduced to about 44 percentage points at ages 70-74. At ages 55-59 additional work capacity is close to zero.

These findings suggest that at ages 55-59 participation rates nowadays are as high as one can expect based on

the health of this population but that health per se is not a restrictive factor for higher participation rates at

older ages (Kalwij, Kapteyn and De Vos 2017).


                                                                                                                     23
smaller decline in women’s than men’s mortality at age 60 (Figure 6) is often attributed to the rise in

smoking among women (Pampel 2002) and, possibly in part related to this, the increased labor force

participation of women and corresponding work related stress which, in turn, has been shown to

increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (Kivimäki, Leino-Arjas, Luukkonen, Riihimäki, Vahtera &

Kirjonen 2002; Kouvonen, Kivimaki, Virtanen, Pentti & Vahtera 2005). Overall, the empirical evidence

on the causal impact of work on health at older ages is mixed. Kalwij, Knoef & Alessie (2013) and

Neuman (2008) find that retirement has no adverse health effects, Charles (2004), Hemingway,

Marmot, Martikainen, Mein & Stansfeld. (2003) and Coe & Zamarro (2011) find a positive effect on

health, and Kuhn, Wuellrich & Zweimueller (2010), Behncke (2012) and Dave, Rashad & Spasojevic

(2008) conclude that retirement may have a negative impact on health.

Appendix A. Social Security System Reforms 1995-2016

In Table 1 we provide a comparison between the benefits for older workers and retirees available in

1995 and 2016. In Table 2 we provide a timeline of the most important reforms to the system

between both years. In the remainder of this appendix, we will discuss the main characteristics of the

benefit system and the implemented reforms. A large part of this discussion is based on De Vos,

Kapteyn and Kalwij (2012).




State pension

The Dutch benefit system is characterized by a clear distinction between benefits for persons

younger than the state pension (SP) age and benefits for older persons. The latter receive the flat

rate SP. Until 2013, the SP age was 65 but in the aftermath of the credit crisis government used the

opportunity to introduce a gradual increase of the SP age in order to ensure the future sustainability

of the pay-as-you-go SP. The SP age will reach 66 in 2018 and 67 in 2021 and is to be linked to the life

expectancy thereafter. The flat rate SP is supplemented when the spouse is younger than the SP age

and has a low income. This supplement is gradually abolished, starting in 2015.




Occupational pensions


In many cases the SP is supplemented by a (fully funded) occupational pension (PP), which ideally

supplements the SP to 70% of previous earnings. Until the early 2000s, most occupational pension

rights were calculated on the basis of final earnings but currently, most pension rights are calculated

on the basis of the average earnings during employment. Furthermore, until recently, most

occupational pensions were indexed on the basis of the wage index. However, following the credit

crisis and the dramatic reduction of the market interest rates most pension funds have had to



                                                                                                      27
suspend indexation or indeed lower the pensions in order to meet the legal solvability criteria (cf.

Kalwij, Alessie, Gardner and Ali 2018).




Early retirement


For persons younger than the SP age until recently various pathways to retirement were available.

Early retirement (ER) was introduced in most sectors during the 1970s, mainly in reaction to rising

unemployment (cf. Kapteyn, de Vos and Kalwij 2010), and at least until the end of the 1990s in most

cases consisted of an offer too good to refuse, usually at age 60 or thereabout. In particular, workers

retiring later than the earliest possible ER date were not compensated by higher benefits or lower

taxes, so that in fact they faced an implicit tax rate of more than 100% (cf. Kapteyn and De Vos,

1999). Notably, ER was not the result of government policy but the outcome of negotiations between

trade unions and employers. However, government facilitated ER by making ER contributions tax

deductible.


The prospect of exploding costs once the large baby boom cohorts start to reach the ER age turned

out to be sufficiently threatening for effective reforms to be put in place by the end of the 1990s. In

most cases a cost reduction as a result of reducing the effective ER entitlement was combined with

the introduction of a more or less actuarially fair system. As a result, an employee could still opt for

retiring early, but with a reduced pension, or later, but with a higher pension. By 2006, the

government dealt a final blow to the old ER systems by effectively terminating the tax exemption for

ER contributions that would enable a retirement age lower than 65. Only systems offering a

replacement rate of at most 70% at the pension age of 65 and actuarially fair reductions when an

earlier pension age is chosen can still collect tax exempt contributions.




                                                                                                       28
Unemployment Insurance


For workers approaching 60 who were not entitled to ER, e.g. because of an insufficiently long

employment history or because they worked in a firm which did not offer ER, and who could not

plausibly be retired via Disability Insurance (DI, see below), Unemployment Insurance (UI) offered a

third pathway to retirement before the SP age of 65. In most cases, it offered a replacement rate of

70%, and furthermore, until recently, no obligation to search for employment after the age of 57.5.


As of 2004, persons aged 57.5 or older receiving UI are no longer exempt from the requirement to

seek work. In other words, they are no longer ‘automatically’ receiving UI until age 65 but have to try

to find work and, in theory, accept a job offer. Moreover, as of October 1, 2006, the maximum

duration of UI is 38 months. After that period all that is left is a means tested entitlement to Social

Assistance (SA) with a benefit equal to the net minimum wage. Starting in 2016, the maximum

duration of UI will be further reduced. It will be limited to 24 months in 2019.




Disability Insurance

Introduced in 1967, the Dutch Disability Insurance (WAO, Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheids-

verzekering) aimed to insure employees against loss of earnings as a result of long-term inability to

work as a result of illness or incapacity. If after having been ill for a period of one year, the employee

could not resume work, he/she would be entitled to an earnings related DI benefit which could last

until the employee reached the statutory retirement age of 65.


Starting in the 1970s, the numbers of individuals on DI in the Netherlands showed a continuous

increase until the 1990s. These numbers were much higher than expected when the new DI

legislation was introduced and much higher than might be expected given the average health status

of the population. In fact, in the mid-1970s when unemployment was rising dramatically, the route to

DI was generally used by employers as a path of least resistance to shed superfluous employees. For
                                                                                                          29
the employee DI was both socially more acceptable and more attractive than UI, in particular

because the benefit could be received until age 65 when the old age pension would kick in.


With the increase in the number of benefit recipients, expenditures on DI started to rise dramatically,

and since the start of the 1980s government policy has sought to reverse the trend of the ever

increasing DI expenditures by various reforms to limit access to DI, increase the number of persons

exiting DI and lower the average DI benefit.


When lowering the replacement rate of DI from 80 to 70% and limiting access to the full DI for

partially disabled unemployed new entrants did not result in reversing the trend of ever increasing

numbers of DI recipients, the government introduced a series of measures in the early 1990s: the

duration of the full DI benefit was limited for new entrants younger than 50, stricter disability criteria

were introduced for entry into DI and younger DI recipients were to be retested. Mainly because

most employees took out a private insurance to compensate for the shorter duration of the full DI

benefit for younger persons, DI remained an attractive option. Next to limiting the access and the

generosity of the benefit, policies were also introduced to shift the costs to firms with high numbers

of employees exiting to DI. First, the costs of sickness benefits were charged directly to the employer

for two to six weeks (1994), and later on for a full year preceding the exit to DI. Second, in 1998

experience rating was introduced: for large firms in particular, the DI contributions were partly based

on the DI record of the firm in question. A high exit rate into DI resulted in higher contributions.


All these reforms still did not succeed in substantially reducing the numbers of DI recipients, and by

2002 the feeling was that enough was enough and the time had come for a more radical approach.

As from 2002, during the year of sickness preceding exit to DI, employer and employee are jointly

responsible for taking sufficient action for reintegration into the workforce. Moreover, this sickness

period can be extended if insufficient reintegration measures have been taken. As from 2004, exit to

DI only happens after two years of sickness, during which time the employer pays sickness benefits.


                                                                                                       30
As from 2006, the new DI law, (WIA, Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen) makes a strict

distinction between fully and permanently disabled and partially or temporarily disabled. The former

receive a generous 75% of their previous earnings until age 65 (IVA, Inkomensvoorziening Volledig

Arbeidsongeschikten). The latter receive a less generous benefit (WGA, regeling Werkhervatting

Gedeeltelijk Arbeidsongeschikten) which depends on the previous earnings, the number of weeks

worked before, and the current earnings (if any) and the percentage of previous earnings which the

employee is deemed to be capable of earning. Furthermore, once again a retest operation has been

set up for existing DI beneficiaries younger than 50 (whose DI remains unchanged).
