                                    ABSTRACT




      This paper studies the nature of the errors in preliminary GNP data,
  It first documents that these errors are large. For example, suppose the
  prelimimary estimate indicates that real GNP did not change over the
  recent quarter; then one can be only 80 percent confident that the final
  estimate (annual rate) v-ill be in the range from —2.8 percent to +2.8
  percent. The paper also documents that the revisions in GNP   data   are not
  forecastable, This finding implies that the preliminary estimates are the
  efficient given available information. Hence, the Bureau of Economic
  Analysis appears to follow efficient statistical procedures, in making its
  preliminary estimates.

     GNP is probably the most closely watched economic series. Almost all

observers-—economists, policymakers, and the press—-consider it the primary

measure of the health of the macroeconomy. Estimates of GNP, therefore,

receive much attention. The purpose of this article is to examine the size

and nature of the revisions in GNP estimates.

     In the first section, we briefly describe both the major sources of the

data used to estimate GNP and the timing of the GNP revisions. We also describe

the data analyzed in the remainder of the article.

     We discuss the magnitude of GNP revisions in the second section. We show

that the informational content of the early estimates is much less than one

might suppose. In particular, the standard deviation of the revision of

quarterly real GNP growth is over 2 percentage points at an annual rate.

Thus, a preliminary estimate of 1-percent growth in GNP is not significantly

different from a growth rate of 4 percent.

     In the third section, we examine whether early estimates of GNP are

efficient forecasts of the "final0 figure and find that they are. Moreover,

this conclusion applies to subsequent estimates: At the time of each revision,

the new figure is generally the best available estimate of the final value.

Data and revision schedule

     BEA assembles the national income and product accounts (MIPA's) from

disparate private and public sources. Data sources range from the many

censuses and surveys of the ureau of the Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics

to reports from individual private companies. The data are assembled by BEA

according to specific rules and procedures based on the definition of the

components of the NIPA's.

     BEA periodically revises the NIPA's. For the 1975—82 period covered by

this study, the first estimate of GNP for a given quarter was made approximately

15 days before the end of the quarter. This estimate, referred to as the

                                      1
                                      2



"flash" or "minus—15-day" estimate, was released to the public beginning in

September 1983 and since then was referred to in BEA's discussion of the

NIPA's in the Survey.

     The first estimate of GNP for a given quarter to appear with component

detail (for example, in the NIPA tables of the Survey) is made approximately

15 days after the end of the quarter. Tt is referred to as the "preliminary"

or "15-day" estimate and is based on incomplete source data. For example,

incomplete source data makes it impossible for BEA to construct an estimate

of corporate profits at the time of the preliminary estimate; consequently,

the preliminary NIPA's do not contain a complete income side or provide an
                                           1

estimate of the statistical discrepancy.       The next estimate is made

approximately 45 days after the end of the quarter to which they apply; it

is referred to as the "first revision" or "45—day" estimate. This estimate

is based on more source data than the preliminary figures; for example, the

first estimate of corporate profits is available in the 45-day estimate

(except in the first quarter). The "second revision" is made approximately

75 days after the end of the quarter. During the period covered by this

study, this "75-day" estimate for a quarter was prepared simultaneously with

the flash estimate for the following quarter.

     Following the 75-day estimate, the estimates remain unrevised until the

following July. Each July, BEA revises the entire set of NIPA estimates for

the preceding 3 years. These revisions reflect new source data that BEA has



'For the 15-day estimate, there are 3 months of source data only for personal
consumption expenditures on goods and business purchases of autos and trucks.
Only 2 of the 3 months of data are available for most components of investment,
government outlays, and the trade balance. See "Business Situation,1' Survey,
January 1982, p. 1, for example. For a detailed discussion of when the data
become available, see Robert P. Parker, "Revisions of the Initial Estimates
of Quarterly Gross National Product of the United States, 1968-83," Bureau
of Economic Analysis, Washington, DC, 1984.

                                    2
received since the previous July.

      BEA periodically overhauls the NIPA's; these benchmark revisions

take place approximately once every 5 years and reflect both statistical

(data) changes and conceptual or definitional changes. The statistical

revisions are based on data from ongoing efforts, such as the census of

manufacturing, that are available less often than annually (for example,

quinquennially for the census of manufacturing). Statistical revisions are

also based on sources of data that were unavailable for the previous benchmark.

For example, the 1980 benchmark revision used newly developed price data for
                              3
national defense purchases.

      Not all the revisions that occur when the NIPA's are benchmarked are

purely statistical. BEA occasionally changes the definition of GNP components

and thus the coverage of GNP. For example, if BEA decided to include the

product of homemakers in GNP, this change would be definitional rather than

statistical. rn this study, we abstract from definitional changes.

      Our aim in this article is to characterize the statistical revisions of

the estimates. To abstract from definitional changes, we use series that

BEA maintains for constant—dollar (real) and current-dollar (nominal) GNP on

the basis of consistent definitions. NIPA benchmark revisions were released

in January 1976 and in December 1980. Our series use consistent 1980 benchmark

definitions. Using these series, we analyze estimates from the fourth quarter

of 1975 through the fourth quarter of 1982.



2Data available for the July revision include the Census Bureau's annual
surveys of merchant wholesale and retail trade, housing, manufacturing, and
State and local government, and the Internal Revenue Service's tabulation of
business tax returns. For example, see "The U.S. National Income and Product
Accounts: Revised Estimates," Survey 62 (July 1982): 5.

     We analyze the annualized quarter-to—quarter growth rate, rather than

the level, of GNP. Use of the growth rate rather than the level eliminates

the strong trend in the series. We analyze five estimates of the growth

rate of GNP: The flash (minus 15—day), the preliminary (15—day), the first

revision (45—day), the second revision (75—day), and the final (the most

recent). The timing of these estimates-—which we denote Vi, Y2, Y3, Y4, and

Y5, respectively-—is summarized in table 1. For the first four of these

estimates, the 75—day estimate of the previous quarter's GNP is the most

up-to-date base figure for computing the growth rate. The ratio of the

flash, 15-day, 45—day, and 75-day estimates to the 75-day estimate for the

previous quarter is, therefore, used to compute the growth rates Yl, Y2, Y3,

and Y4. An exception to this procedure occurs to deal with the July revision

of the NIPA's. In July, contemporaneously with the 15-day estimate for the

second quarter, BEA revises estimates for the preceding 3 years. Hence, for

the second-quarter computation of Y2, Y3, and Y4, the base is the July—revised
                              4
figure for the first quarter.   The final growth rates, YS, are computed with

estimates as of February 1985.

The magnitude of the revisions

     Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation of each growth rate of

nominal and real GNP; the standard deviations of the revisions of the growth

rates are given in table 3. The standard deviation of the growth rate of

nominal GNP ranges from 4.1) percent when measured with the flash (Vi) to 5.7



4There are two further exceptions to this procedure. First, in 1980, the
revision that usually would have been made in July was incorporated in the
benchmark revision released in December. Hence, for the second quarter of
1980, the growth rates Y2, Y3, and Y4, are based on the 75-day estimate of
first-quarter GNP. Moreover, the base for Y4 in the third quarter of 1980 is
the second quarter of i980 estimate released in December. Second, no July
revision was made in 1981, so for the second quarter of 1981, the growth rates
Y2, V3, and Y4 are also based on the 75—day estimate of the preceding quarter.

                                                  5
percent when measured with the final (Y5).            The standard deviation of the

revisions range from a low of 0.6 percentage point for the change from the

45-day to 75—day estimate (Y4 — Y3) to a high of 3.1 percentage points for

the flash to final (Y5 —        Yl).   The standard deviations of the revisions are

thus large relative to the standard deviations of the growth rates themselves.

     This finding implies that an estimated growth rate is associated with a

large confidence interval. For example, the standard deviation of the revision

from the 15—day to the final estimates (Y5 — Y2) is 2.7 percentage points. If

the 15—day estimate of the growth rate is 5.0 percent, then one can only be

68 percent confident that the final estimate will be in the range from 2.3

percent to 7.7 percent. The 95-percent confidence interval is from -0.4
                            6
percent to 10.4 percent.

     A similar picture emerges for real GNP. Again, the standard deviations

for the revisions are large. For example, the standard deviation of the

revision from the 15—day to the final estimates (Y5 - Y2) is 2.2 percentage

points. If the 15—day estimate indicates no growth, the probability that

the final estimate will indicate that growth exceeds 2.0 percent is 18 percent.

News or noise: The informational content of GNP revisions

     We begin this section with a simple theoretical discussion of data
            7
revision.       Our aim is to distinguish two polar characterizations of the

process of data revision. For ease of exposition, and in order to prevent

confusion with BEA's terminology, estimates that are subject to subsequent

revision will be referred to as "provisional" estimates.



5All percent changes are expressed at annual rates.

6This discussion of the confidence intervals presumes that the revisions are
normally distributed, with zero mean.

    Two characterizations of data revision.—.At one extreme, a provisional

estimate of the growth rate of GNP can be regarded as an observation of the

revised series, but one that is measured with error; subsequent estimates

reduce or eliminate this measurement error, or "noise," by drawing on larger

or more representative samples, correcting clerical mistakes, etc. At the

other extreme, the provisional estimate can be regarded as an efficient

forecast of the revised series, i.e., a forecast that reflects all available

data; subsequent estimates reduce or eliminate the forecast error by

incorporating new data, or "news."

     Whether the revisions reflect errors of measurement or errors generated

by efficient forecasts depends on how BEA assembles the provisional estimates.

If BEA assembles the NIPA's by piecing together the source data without

taking account of the time—series correlations and cross-correlations of the

components of GNP and other data, then we would expect the revisions to

behave as measurement errors. If, instead, BEA uses optimal statistical

procedures to assemble the NIPA's, then we would expect the revisions to

behave as errors generated by efficient forecasts. In fact, BEA need not

use an overt statistical procedure to deal with the problem of incomplete

source data. There is clearly substantial scope for judgment in constructing

the NIPA's. Expert judgment, as well as sophisticated statistical procedures,

could be used to generate efficient forecasts.

     These two characterizations of the provisional estimates have very

different implications for the properties of the revision.

     Statistical implications of the two characterizations.——Because the

NIPA's are successively revised, an intermediate estimate serves simultaneously

as a revision of previous estimates and as a provisional estimate for subsequent

revisions. Thus, for example, Y3 is a revision of Yl and Y7, hut a provisional

estimate of Y4 and Y5. If the provisional estimate differs from the revised
                                        7



value by a measurement error, then the revision is uncorrelated with the

revised value, but correlated with data available when the provisional estimate

is made. In particular, the revision is correlated with the provisional

estimate itself. Conversely, if the provisional estimate of GNP growth is an

efficient ("rational") forecast of revised GNP growth, then the revision is

correlated with revised GNP growth but uncorrelated with data available at

the time of the provisional estimate.

     By examining the correlations of the revisions with data available before

and after the provisional estimates, we can characterize the informational

content of the revisions. Before doing so, we observe that there is a further

implication of the two hypotheses based on the variance rather than the

cross—correlation of the series. If the provisional estimates are efficient

forecasts of the subsequent estimates, then the variance of the subsequent

estimates increases. Efficient forecasts are necessarily smoother than the

object being forecast. Conversely, if the revisions are measurement errors,

then the variances should be falling as time goes on. Table 2 gives the

standard deviation of the level of nominal and real GP growth for the various

estimates. For both the nominal and real series, the variability of the

growth rates increases with subsequent estimates. Hence, the variability of

the growth rates is consistent with the hypothesis that the earlier estimates

are efficient forecasts of subsequent estimates.

     As discussed above, correlation between the revision and the provisional

estimate would be evidence for the measurement error hypothesis; correlation

between the revision and the revised estimate would be evidence for the

efficient forecast hypothesis. Table 4 presents those correlations for the

growth rates of nominal and real GNP. The four incremental revisions are

listed in the rows of the tables and the successive estimates are listed in

the columns. Absolute values of t statistics for the correlation coefficients,

                                                                               8
under the hypothesis that there is no correlation, are given in parentheses.

Each panel of the table is divided into two triangles. The lower triangle

presents the correlation of the revisions with earlier provisional estimates;

under the null hypothesis that the revisions are errors generated by efficient

forecasts, these correlations should be zero. The upper triangle gives te

correlations of the revision with the current and subsequent estimates;

under the hypothesis of measurement error, these should be zero.

     The evidence in table 4 concerning the growth rate of nominal GN is

consistent with the efficient forecast characterization and inconsistent with

the measurement error characterization of the revisions. The correlations in

the lower triangle of the top panel of the table are all small and none is

statistically significantly different from zero. On the other hand, the

correlations in the upper triangle of the table are large and strongly

statistically significant. Hence, one cannot reject the hypothesis that the

revisions are errors generated by efficient forecasts and can strongly reject

the hypothesis that they are pure measurement errors.

     The correlations for the revision Y4 - Y3 (the 75—day estimate rrnus the

45—day estimate) is an exception to the rejection of the measurement error

characterization. None of the estimates is correlated with this revision.

Note from table 3 that the standard deviation of this revision is very snall.

Because this revision is typically minor, there is essentially no variatn

for either set of tests to capture.

      For real GNP, the correlations shown in the bottom panel of table 4

tell essentially the same story. The correlations in the lower triangle are

small compared to those in the upper triangle. Again, none of the correlatio"s



8The t statistic of the correlation coefficient is identical to the t
statistic of the slope coefficient of the regression of the column o the
row or of the row on the column.

in the lower trianqle is statistically signifi.cantly different from zero.

The characterization of the revisions of the real growth rate is somewhat

less decisive than that for the nominal growth rate.

     Efficiency of the forecasts.--Our examination of the variance and the

cross-correlations of the estimates and the revisions supports the characteri-

zation that the revisions are errors generated by efficient forecasts and

rejects the characterization that they are measurement errors. If the revisions

are efficient forecast errors, then other data available at the time of the

provisional estimate should also be uncorrelated with the revision.   If the

revision is regressed on variables that reflect other data available at the

time of the provisional estimate, all such variables should be jointly

insignificant. Candidates for such variables include prior provisional

estimates, the constant, seasonal dumies, lagged values of the growth rate,

and macroeconomic variables. Although the NIPA estimates are seasonally

adjusted, seasonal dummies could be relevant if BEA's revisions are seasonal.

The macroeconomic variables we considered were the rate on 3—month Treasury

bills and the return on the stock market as measured by the change in the

Standard and Poor's Composite Stock Index. These were measured as of the

middle month of the quarter under study so that they would be known at the

time of all the estimates of GNP growth.

    For regressions of the revision of both nominal and real GNP growth,

neither the financial variables nor the seasonal dummies were statistically

significant. This result was obtained whether or not the level of the

provisional estimate was included in the regression. Because none of the

coefficients was statistically sicnificant, we do not report the details of

these regressions. The absence of any relationship, however, is a potentially

important finding. It indicates that observed financial variables do not

contain information about GNP that is not already reflected in BEA's estimates.
                                        10


Because the small size of our sample reduces the power of these tests, these

results should not be overemphasized.

    Table 5 gives the regressions of the various revisions of nominal GNP

growth on a constant, the provisional estimate, and the lagged growth rate.

The lagged growth rate is measured by Y4, which is known at the time of the

provisional estimates. The equations are estimated from the second quarter

of 1976 to the fourth auarter of 1982 to allow for the lag. Under the null

hypothesis that the revisions are errors generated by efficient forecasts,

all the coefficients in these regressions——including the constant——should be

zero. We have already seen from our study of the correlation matrix that

this hypothesis is not rejected for the slope coefficients of the equations

without the lagged growth rate.   In the table, we report F statistics for

the hypothesis that all the coefficients, including the constant, are zero.

    The results reported in table 5 are broadly consistent with the hypothesis

that the revisions reflect new information. The revision from the minus—15—day

to the 15-day estimate shows weak evidence of forecastability in equation

5.2, but not equation 5.1. The revision from the 15—day to the 45-day estimate

is completely unforecastable (equations 5.3 and 5.4). Indeed, the 2 for

equation 5.4 is negative and the F statistic is small. This result is striking

given that the source data for many components is only available for 2 of

the 3 months when the 15—day estimate is made (see footnote 1). Hence, the

estimates behave as if BEA follows an efficient statistical procedure in

projectinQ the unavailable data. Of course, we have only tried a limited

number of variables, so our results do not preclude the existence of other

variables that do forecast the revisions.

     For the regressions of Y4 — Y3, reported in equations 5.5 and 5.6, the

revision is forecastable. Roth the constant and the lagged growth rate are

statistically significant. The significantly positive constant implies that,
                                      11

on averaae, the revisions of GNP are positive from Y3 to Y4. We have already

seen in table 3 that this revision is qualitatively different from the others.

The size of the revisions are substantially smaller than the others. Hence,

it is possible that this rejection of the hypothesis is a statistical artifact.

In any case, this revision is fairly minor.

     The revisions from the 75-day to the final estimate are, again, unforecastable

(equations 5.7 and 5.8). This revision spans several years and reflects, for

example, data from the Census Bureau's annual and quinquennial surveys. The

unforecastability of the revisions is strong evidence that the 75—day estimate

is an efficient forecast of the final estimate.

     Users of the NIPA's may be more concerned with how a provisional estimate

predicts the final estimate (Y5) rather than the intermediate estimates.

Equations 5.9—5.16 present evidence that the total revisions of nominal GNP

growth are unforecastable. All variables in all eouations are statistically

insignificant. The idiosyncratic forecastability of Y4 - Y3 mentioned above

is not evident in the total revisions. Therefore, at any point in time,

BEA's most recent estimate of GNP growth is an efficient predictor of the

final estimate.

     The analagous results for real GNP growth are reported in table 6.

They are qualitatively similar to those for nominal GNP growth.

     Nordhaus has studied the efficiency of forecast errors for a wide range

of forecasting activities ranging from projections of nuclear generating
                                                                     9
capacity to macroeconomic projections based on econometric models.       He finds

that the revisions are typically positively correlated, which, of course,

implies the forecasts are not efficient. This positive correlation implies

                                      12


forecasters only correct errors gradually. Table 7 presents regressions

of revisions of BEA's estimates of GNP on previous revisions. From these,

we can judge whether BEA's estimates share the slow correction of errors

than Nordhaus finds generic.

     The regressions reported in table 7 show no significant positive

correlation of the revisions. The only departure from efficiency of forecasts

occurs in the constant of the 75—day estimate (Y4), which was already discussed.

In equations 7.4 and 7.8, we report the regression of the revision from the

45-day to the final (Y5 — Y3) on the revision from the 15—day to the 45—day

(Y3 — Y2) for nominal and real GNP growth. Examining these revisions should

provide a powerful test of efficiency because they exclude the flash (Vi),

which was released to the public during only part of the sample period, and

because they exclude the Y4 — Y3 revision, which has very low variance. In

these equations, the coefficient of the previous revision is indeed positive,

but not significantly so. Equivalently, the 12 statistics are low. Hence,

BEA does not appear to share with other forecasters the slow correction of

errors.

     We also considered estimates for two different periods. First, we

considered estimates beginning in 1968. These estimates did yield some

rejections of the efficient forecast hypothesis, yet we suspect those results

may be misleading. The pre—1976 estimates were expressed in 1958 dollars and

have been benchmarked twice. Our estimates used BEA's correction to place

them on 1980 benchmark definitions, expressed in 1972 dollars. Hence, these

rejections, which we do not report, may well be due to bias in the definitional

corrections or to the shift in base years. Alternatively, one could argue
                                                                           10
that BEA's estimation techniques have improved since the earlier period.



lOFinally, one could argue that our failure to reject in our sample is
caused by having too few observations. This argument does not appear to be
                                         13


     Second, we also extended the sample through the second quarter of 1985.

These results were qualitatively the same as those reported here for 1976—82.

The very recent estimates are based on "final" estimates made only shortly

after the provisional estimates. Conseauently, recent "final" revisions may,

themselves, be revised substantially. To avoid this problem, we report the

results for the sample ending in 1982.

Conclusion

     We conclude, with the exceptions noted, that the revisions of GNP growth,

both nominal and real, are more like unforecastable new information than like

measurement error. Both Zeliner and Cole provide evidence that the revisions

of GNP are serially correlated, but serial correlation of the revisions is

entirely consistent with their being unforecastable.     The revised values

are unavailable for quarters or years after the provisional announcement;

efficient forecasting, therefore, does not imply that these forecast errors

should be uncorrelated. Hence, serial correlation of the revisions is not
                                                       12
evidence against the hypothesis of efficient forecasts.   Cole's finding,

along with that of Jaszi, that the average of the revision errors is nonzero




warranted: The rejections in the early estimates are based on the same number
of observations, which indicates we have enough observations to have statistical
power.

'2Such serial correlation would not make our estimated regression
coefficients inconsistently estimated. It could, however, make our standard
errors inconsistent. We have, however, found no evidence of serial correlation
in our residuals, so our standard errors appear to be valid.

could be evidence that the provisional estimates are biased.        If, as we

found for Y4 - Y3, the onditional mean of the revisions were statistically

sianificantly nonzero, that would be evidence of bias. Yet in general we

find no evidence for such bias.

     Our findings have important consequences for the use of the provisional

estimates of GfW by forecasters, policymakers, and economic agents. If the

revisions were measurement errors rather than efficient forecast errors,

users of the provisional estimates should use statistical signal extraction
                                                  14
procedures to best estimate the underlying value.    Our findings suggest,

however, that there is limited scope for using other observed data to improve
                                               15
the estimate of the underlying value of GNP.

      Our characterization of the provisional GNP estimates is the opposite

of that of the preliminary money stock data. Preliminary announcements of

the money stock data are better characterized as observations of the true

lEOne might wonder why we are not able to forecast the revisions of aggregate
GNP when Howrey ("The Use of Preliminary Data") is able to do so for inventory
investnent, a component of GNP. There are likely to be errors in the cornponents
of GNP that wash out in the aggregate. Jaszi finds evidence for this claim,
calling it the "guardian angel of national income estimators" ("Quarterly
National Income and Product Accounts," p. 126). Of course, a failure to
find a forecastable component to the revision error could be due to a lack
of statistical power.

characterizations may be attributable to the qualitative difference in the

procedures for estimating the money stock and estimating GNP. BEA does

exercise judgment in estimating GPJP. Specifically, BEA staff meets to evaluate
                                                  17
and adjust the estimates before they are released.       The Federal Reserve

has a dual role of estimating and controlling the monetary aggregates.

Consequently, it may be reluctant to exercise discretion in constructing its

estimates.
