            The Sources of Disagreement Among International
         Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination




                                ABSTRACT

     This paper makes use of the simulation results of 12 leading large
international econometric models, as to the effects of commonly specified
changes in monetary and fiscal policy, conducted under the Brookings exercise
"Empirical Macroeconomics for Interdependent Economies." The first half of
the paper examines disagreement among the models on the signs of policy
multipliers, and how such disagreement compares to the ambiguities appearing
in the theoretical literature. There turns out to be relatively little
disagreement as to the effects on output, prices and the exchange rate. The
greatest disagreement is rather over the question whether a monetary expansion
worsens or improves the current account.

     The second half of the paper examines the implications for international
macroeconomic policy coordination. The existing literature makes the
unrealistic assumption that policy—makers all know the true model, from which
it follows that the Nash bargaining solution is in general superior to the
Nash competitive solution. But everything changes once we recognize that
policy—makers' models, as the models in the Brookings simulations, differ
from each other and therefore from the "true" model. When the central bank
and fiscal authorities subscribe to conflicting models, it is still true that
(1) the competitive equilibrium is sub—optimal, and that (2) the two authorities
will in general be able to agree on a cooperative policy package that each
believes will improve the objective function; however, (3) the bargaining
solution is as likely to move the target variables in the wrong direction as
in the right direction, in the light of a third true model. Out of 1,210
possible combinations of different models subscribed to by the two policy
authorities and models representing reality, bargaining raises welfare in
only 819 cases. The conclusion is that disagreement as to the true model may
be a more serious obstacle to successful policy coordination than is institu-
tional failure to enforce Pareto—improving solutions.

       An easy way for an outsider to tell when an academic discipline

has not yet ascertained "the truth" of a question is when Its practi-

tioners each give different answers. We know that we as tnacroeconomists

have not yet ascertained "the truth," if there was previously any doubt

on this score, when we look at the great divergence in forecasts as to

the effects of carefully—specified policy changes in the Brookings simu—

lation exercise "Empirical Macroeconomics for Interdependent Economies".

The probability that a given model is correct is small when the number

of models giving different answers is large. Furthermore it is unlikely

that we will ever discover the true model; the number of different

models and the way models keep changing over time is evidence of this

proposition, and it seems inherent in the nature of social science.

       There are three ways research can proceed. The first is for the

researcher at each point in time to maintain that he or she has now

discovered the one true model, and that all other models are wrong. The

second is for the researcher, while continuing to speak the language

that suggests his model is the one true one, to recognize implicitly

that this language is merely a convenient shorthand. The third is to

focus explicitly on the simultaneous co—existence of conflicting models.

       The second research strategy is the best one to pursue for most

economic problems. The econometrician knows that his parameter esti-

mates are not exactly correct. More generally, all modellers know that

their models must be incomplete and misspecified. Nevertheless, if the

economist is good, the errors in his model will be such that, even if


                                  —1—
they could be correctly handled, it would not much change his forecasts

(in the case of an econometric forecasting model) or the conceptual

point he is trying to make (in the case of a theoretical model). While

it may be useful for the modeller to have explored as many extensions as

possible in appendices and such, there is not a need for him to be able

to claim that he has exhausted the truth. Nor is there a need for him,

on the other hand, to make frequent disclaimers; the readers will

understand that the model is not to be taken as literal truth.

       These issues become most salient where, as in most modern macro-

economic models, agents in the proposed model must make decisions based

on expectations formed on the basis of some model of their own. The

rational expectations assumption is, of course, the assumption that the

model used by the agents is the same as the proposed larger model. As

soon as we admit that——because intelligent people are observed to

believe in conflicting models——we cannot claim that the proposed larger

model necessarily is literal truth, it follows that we cannot claim that

agents' models must necessarily be literally identical to the proposed

larger model. But, again, for most economic problems, especially those

involving the microeconomic decisions of private agents, one can make a

case that there is little to be gained by explicitly focusing on diver-

gent models. The assumption that the agents know the one true model

will continue to be an attractive modelling strategy.

       When the decision makers are governments and the decision vari-

ables are macroeconomic policies, the case for assuming that everyone

knows the one true model is less compelling. In the first place, there




                                  —2—
is no powerful force like the marketplace to discipline governments who

use incorrect models. In the second place, the Federal Reserve Board's

MCM model, the Japanese EPA model, the OECD Interlink model, etc., are

the best that these government agencies have, and we can see that these

models conflict. One can argue that inicroeconomic agents have access to

specific knowledge of a common model unavailable to the macroeconomist.

It would be more difficult for a inacroeconomiist at a government agency

to argue that his or her own agency has access to knowledge of a common

model unavailable to the macroeconomist himself.'

       The subject of this paper is the international econometric

models' conflicting estimates of the effects of macroeconomic

policies. To focus the discussion, we limit the policy variables to

each country's money supply and level of government expenditure. The

framework of policy variables and targets can thus be represented:




                        Y =   U   + VIM C
                                            Gb]'




     'This is not to make the naive mistake of thinking that policy
makers put complete faith in the models of the macroeconomists at their
own agencies, nor that the latter necessarily have access to the latest
data and thoughts of the former. But policy makers, at best, base their
thinking on models——whether developed by government, academic or
corporate institutions——similar to those in the Brookings modelling
exercise. (For example, British macroeconomic policy under Thatcher may
have been based on a model closer to the Liverpool model, which appears
in this exercise, than to any models previously existing at the U.K.
Treasury or Bank of England.) Policymakers, more likely, base their
thinking on "models" that conform even less to each other or to truth
than do the models of macroeconomists.


                                     —3—
where Y is a vector of output levels and other policy variables of

interest to the two countries, V is a matrix of policy multipliers,

Ma and Ga are the domestic money supply and government expenditure

and M.D and Gb are the foreign money supply and government expendi-

ture.

        The project is divided into three major parts. Part I examines

how the reduced form policy multipliers, the entries in matrix V above,

are determined by more fundamental economic parameters such as the

degree of capital mobility, money demand elasticities, etc. This exami-

nation includes (a) the divergent multipliers one would expect to get

from the standard theoretical models that appear in the literature,

(b) the divergent multipliers that emerge from the simulations in the

Brookings modelling simulation exercise, (c) an attempt to interpret (b)

in terms of (a).

        The other two parts of the project show what can happen in

standard policy—making problems when one policy maker bases his actions

on one of the available macroeconomic models, and another policy maker

bases his on another model, neither of which is necessarily the correct

model. It is shown that the usual finding of the popular literature on

macroeconomic policy coordination——that is, that policy—making is

necessarily improved if policy makers coordinate——does not hold if

policy makers base their actions on conflicting models.

        In Part II we consider two domestic policy makers: the monetary

authority and the fiscal authority. We also limit the policy targets at

first to output and the current account balance to get a two—target,




                                   —4—
two—instrument framework. We begin with the case in which the policy

makers have common goals and the only coordination issue arises out of

divergent models. If the fiscal authority can believe any of the N

models, the monetary authority can believe any of the N models, and

the true world can be represented by any of the N models, then there

are N3 possible combinations. We show that when the two policy makers

coordinate, the common welfare function is improved relative to the Nash

competitive equilibrium in only 98 out of 180 combinations. Then in the

appendix we move to the usual case where goals diverge. The fiscal

authority seeks to maintain internal balance and the monetary authority

external balance or vice versa. This is the classic assignment

problem. As in the case of common goals, the qualitative answer changes

when the policy makers disagree on the correct model.

       In the third part of this project, which will appear as a sepa-

rate paper, we consider the more complex problem of international policy

coordination. In studying coordination among four sets of policy

makers, monetary and fiscal authorities both domestically and abroad,

the policy targets will have to include three target variables, such as

output, the current account and inflation, the same three used by Oudiz

and Sachs (1984).2 Again, when models diverge, it is possible that

everyone will be worse off when policy makers do coordinate than when

they do not. Perhaps the main lesson of the paper is that when, for



         alternative for the two—target, two—instrument framework would
be output and the exchange rate, which could be argued to span the three
targets.

example, U.S. and European authorities fail to adopt an economist's plan

for Improving joint welfare by adopting a specific coordinated combi-

nation of policies, it may be because of divergent views as to what the

effects of those policy changes will be, rather than because of competi-

tive maximization of divergent goals.

                       CONFLICTING POLICY MULTIPLIERS


         We focus on the models' conflicting implications for the effects

of a change in fiscal policy, and the effects of a change in the money

supply, in each case with the other policy variables (domestic and

foreign) held constant. The most well—known ambiguity is the question

of whether a fiscal expansion causes the domestic currency to appreciate

or depreciate. The other ambiguity that appears most commonly in the

theoretical literature is the effect of the exchange rate, and therefore

the effect of domestic fiscal (and monetary) policy, on foreign income.

The issue of whether transmission is positive or negative is of course

crucial to questions of international policy coordination. Somewhat

surprisingly, neither of these issues is the one on which the simula-

tions in the Brookings interdependent modelling exercise show the most

conflict. Most of the models show a fiscal expansion appreciating the

domestic currency and raising foreign output. The models are in much

greater disagreement on an issue that much of the literature considers

unambiguous: the effect of a domestic monetary expansion on the current

account and, via the trade linkage, on foreign output.

         We begin by considering the standard theoretical two—country

model.

       Since the model is so familiar, we circumscribe the algebra

tightly. Though we specify the equations in relatively general form, we

then proceed to consider only special cases.

Equations (1) and (2) give the money demand equations for the domestic

and foreign countries, respectively. We allow for the possibility that

foreign bonds compete with domestic bonds as an alternative to domestic

money in portfolios by including the other country's interest rate after

the semi—colon. Equations (3) and (4) show the demands for goods. We

allow for the possibility of a Laursen—Metzler effect, that a worsening

of the terms of trade would raise expenditure measured in domestic

units, by including the real exchange rate after the semi—colon.

Equation (5) gives the trade balance. Equation (6) gives the capital

outflow as a function of the nominal Interest differential, and possibly

of expected depreciation, where the latter is assumed to be a function

of the spot rate relative to Its equilibrium level. Under floating ex-

change rates the trade balance and capital outflow are equal. Finally,

in equations (7) and (8) the supply of output is seen to be a function

of the price level relative to an equilibrium value, which can be

thought of as either the expected price level or as the cost of labor

and other variable factors of production.

       The above model leaves out many factors. Perhaps the most

notable omissions are the stocks of government and international

indebtedness.3 Such omissions might be justified by an appeal to the

short run, over which the stocks cannot change much: our focus in the




     3Also omitted are some so—called "supply side" effects, such as the
possibility that a balance budget reduction in tax rates and government
expenditure would stimulate output and appreciate the currency. Such
effects have been important in the thinking of the Reagan Administration
and a few private economists, but they do not seem to be incorporated
into any of the 12 models involved in the Brookings simulation exercise.

simulations will be on the effects in the second year after a policy

change (just long enough for the trade balance to get past the negative

part of the "J—curve"). In models with forward—looking expectations, of

which the MSG, Liverpool, and Taylor models among the Brookings twelve

are examples, long—run effects can be passed back through time to the

short run. But even then, the effect is generally quantitative rather

than qualitative. This paper concentrates on the more blatant of contra-

dictions: those in the sign of an effect. These are less likely to be

affected by the omission of such factors as stocks of indebtedness.4

        We consider first the case when supply is infinitely elastic

    =

          = co) so that the price levels P and P      are fixed in the

short run, and all variables that appear after the semi—colon are

omitted. This is the standard Mundell—Fleming model.5 Equation (6) for

the trade balance can be substituted into equations (3) and (4); these

two together with equations (1) and (2) determine four endogenous

variables——Y, Y, i, and i*__as a function of the four policy variables——

G, M, G, and M*. (Equation (5) then determines the exchange rate.)

        A fiscal expansion in the Mundell—Fleming model has the following



     41t is possible to get reversals of sign. For example, in some
models a fiscal expansion could be contractionary if expectations of
future debt drive up expected future short—term interest rates and
current long—terni interest rates, and therefore crowd out investment,
enough. The Liverpool model appeared to show this effect for the case
of a U.S. expansion in earlier work (Minford 1984, 100, 114, 133).

     5Citations for the two—country Mundell—Fleming model are Mundell
(1964), Mussa (1979), and Swoboda and Dornbusch (1973). An early two—
country version of the portfolio—balance model, with the degree of sub-
stitutability between domestic and foreign bonds filling in for the
Mundell—Fleming model's degree of capital mobility, is Girton and
Henderson (1976).



                                   —10—
well—known effects. It increases domestic income Y and therefore the

domestic interest rate i.6 The differential between the domestic and

foreign interest rates attracts a capital inf low which, ex post,

corresponds to a trade deficit. If capital mobility is sufficiently

high (if the slope of the BB curve j/k is less than the slope of

the LM curve /X), then the balance of payments would improve at an

unchanged exhcange rate, which implies that the domestic currency appre-

ciates under floating rates. The currency appreciation may be as impor-

tant a cause of the trade deficit as the increase in income. The

counterpart foreign trade surplus increases foreign income Y. For

monetary equilibrium to hold, it also must increase the foreign interest
       *
rate i • The primary ambiguity in the above story is whether capital
mobility is high enough (or the LM curve steep enough) for the fiscal

expansion to appreciate the currency; the reverse case appears as a

prominent possibility in textbooks and in many of the large econometric

models. Some of these models have been said to exhibit an asymmetry:

fiscal expansion in the U.S. appreciates the currency but——whether

because of lower capital mobility, a flatter U1 curve, monetary

accommodation, or other factors——fiscal expansion in Europe or Japan

depreciates their currencies.

       A monetary expansion has unambiguous effects in the Mundell—

Fleming model. It reduces the domestic interest rate and therefore in—




     61n the limiting case of perfect capital mobility (k = c) and an
exogenous foreign interest rate (small country), these effects vanish.


                                 —11—
creases domestic income. The differential between domestic and foreign

interest rates induces a capital outflow. The currency unambiguously

depreciates, all the more if capital mobility is high. As a result the

trade balance improves, notwithstanding the higher level of income; we

know this because of the ex post net capital inf low. The improvement in

the trade balance may constitute a larger amount of the increase In

output than the stimulus to investment and other interest—sensitive

sectors. The corresponding worsening in the foreign trade balance re-

duces foreign income. (For monetary equilibrium to hold, it must also

reduce the foreign interest rate.) Thus we get the classic Mundell—

Fleming result of inverse transmission: a coritractionary monetary

policy such as the United States adopted in 1980—82 is expansionary for

Europe, via the trade balance.

       The theoretical literature features at least five ways that the

foregoing transmission results can be reversed, via effects of the

exchange rate on variables other than the trade balance.7 The exchange

rate S can enter the saving/expenditure decision via the terms of

trade in equation (4), can enter money demand via the price level in

equation (2), can enter expenditure via real wealth in equation (4), can

enter supply via the price of imported inputs in equation (8), and can




     7There is also a way that the standard Mundell—Fleming result of
negative transmission of monetary policy can be reversed via a reversal
of the trade balance. It is if net capital inflows respond to expected
future appreciation which, In turn, depends on the current level of the
spot rate relative to its equilibrium level, as indicated in equation
(6). Because discussion of this effect does not for the most part occur
in the theoretical literature on international transmission, it is post-
poned to the following section.


                                  —12—
enter supply via the nominal wage rate, also in equation (8). We

consider each briefly.

         First, according to the Laursen—Metzler—Harberger effect, a

worsening in the terms of trade, i.e., an increase in SP/P, should

affect the saving/expenditure decision similarly to any other decline in

real income. In the traditional Keynesian literature, this means a

reduction in saving to protect living standards, as measured in domestic

terms:
          A5 > o.8 The point of the original Laursen—Metzler (1950)
article was that, when   a domestic   expansion depreciates the domestic

currency, the foreign country would respond to the improvement in its

terms of trade by decreasing expenditure, giving the result of negative

transmission under floating exchange rates. In the case of a monetary

expansion, the Mundell—Fleming model's introduction of capital flows

gave the negative transmission result anyway,    so the Laursen—Metzler
effect changes little. But   in   the case of a fiscal expansion (with low

capital mobility, so that the domestic currency depreciates), this

negative effect on foreign output could conceivably reverse the standard

transmission result. This case does not seem relevant to the U.S.

fiscal expansion of 1983—85, as the dollar appreciated strongly. For

the purposes of the following discussion of each of the remaining four

effects, we assume for simplicity that a fiscal expansion appreciates

the currency.



     80n the other hand, the modern theory of saving says that only if
the currency depreciation is perceived as a temporary decline in real
income or, in the case of a permanent decline, if the rate of time
preference rises with a fall in welfare, will intertemporally—optimizing
consumers react by reducing saving. See Obstfeld (1982) and Svensson
and Razin (1983).



                                      —1 3-.
       Though we have previously defined the price levels P and

to refer only to goods produced in the domestic and foreign countries,

respectively, in the case of the money demand functions they could as

easily be replaced by the consumer price indices, CPI and CPI, de-

fined as a Cobb—Douglas weighted average of domestic goods and imports:


 (9)                         CPI   = P a(SP* ) 1—a
                          *                   *    1_cz*
(10)                   CPI     =   (P/S)    (P )

(See, for example, Branson and &iiter, 1983, 256—58.) A depreciation of
the foreign currency (S4) will lower the real money stock M*/CPI,

exerting a contractionary effect on foreign output. If the fall in the

exchange rate originated in a domestic fiscal expansion, this effect can

reverse the standard Mundell—Fleming result of positive transmission.

The effect on the real money stock is one of the lines of argument open

to those Europeans who believe that the U.S. fiscal expansion and strong

dollar of the early eighties had adverse effects on European growth. In

the case of a domestic monetary expansion, the domestic currency

depreciates, the foreign currency appreciates, CPI falls, the foreign
                           *
real money stock rises and Y increases; transmission is positive. Thus
both the positive transmission of fiscal policy and the negative

transmission of monetary policy can be reversed.

       Similar to the negative effect of the exchange rate on the real

money stock is the negative effect on the real stock of domestic gov-

ernment bonds. It can be contractionary if real wealth enters the

expenditure function. There is also a negative effect of the exchange




                                     —14—
rate on expenditure if the domestic country is in debt to foreigners in

foreign currency. Either of those effects is capable of reversing the

effects on income through the trade balance, i.e., turning the positive

transmission of fiscal policy into negative transmission and vice versa

for monetary policy. (If a country is in debt in its own currency, as

the United States is rapidly becoming, then a depreciation has a

positive effect on wealth and expenditure, reinforcing the expansionary

effects through the trade balance.)

         Until now we have assumed, for the short run, infinitely elastic
               *                                                   *
supply   (c = a    =   ')   so that the output prices .P   and P       are fixed

(in their own currencies). Relaxing this assumption does not in itself

change qualitative conclusions about movements in output, assuming the
                                     _*
equilibrium   price levels P and P ——whether interpreted as expected price

levels or as markup functions of input costs——are constant in the short

run. Where expansionary effects on Y were previously noted, they are

replaced by increases in P and, as a result, smaller increases in Y.

To be precise, only a/i+a of an increase in aggregate demand will be

reflected in higher output. All contractionary effects are similarly

reduced. In a well—specified model, the changes in P should in the

long run be large enough to eliminate any effects on Y. But we are

concentrating on the short run, in which most models show increases in

both P and



     90f course, there exist models in which prices rise so quickly that
there is no effect on output even in the short run. At the opposite
extreme, a few of the large econometric models represented in the
Brookings simulations, have the property that an expansion actually
reduces prices in the short run. This may come as a consequence of
highly procyclical productivity and the (more questionable) assumption
that prices are determined as a markup over current unit labor costs.

       The last two ways that the standard transmission results can be

reversed operate via the equilibrium price levels in the supply rela—
                               _*
tionships.   Assume that P and P in the supply functions are determined

as markups over input costs; i.e., their rate of change is a linear

function of the rate of change of the prices of oil and other inputs,

the rate of change of wages, and the long—run rate of productivity

growth. An increase in input prices will shift the supply relationship

adversely, reducing output. Thus, to the extent that the price of oil

is determined in dollars, an appreciation of the dollar is contraction—

ary for other countries. This effect of the exchange rate, like the

effects on real money balances and real wealth, runs in the reverse

direction from the standard trade balance effect in the Mundell—Fleming

model: fiscal expansions that appreciate the currency can be trans-

mitted negatively and monetary expansion transmitted positively, rather

than the other way around. Thus, this route too is open to those who

wish to argue that the strong dollar has hurt Europe.

       The final variable that might depend on the exchange rate is the

wage rate. (For simplicity, let P equal the wage rate.) If wages are

fixed, or determined by the unemployment rate, then the standard results

are not affected. On the other hand, if wages are fully indexed to the

domestic price level, then equations (7) and (8) become Y = Y and
  * _*
 Y = Y :   policy can have no effect on output in either country. The

interesting case is when wages are indexed to the consumer price index,

may fall if capital costs (interest rates) are reflected in mark—up
pricing: Hickman identifies such an effect for some countries
(apparently France, Italy and Canada) in the Link model.

including import prices as in equations (9) and (10), because the

exchange rate can open a gap between the CPI and P. Equations (7) and

(8) then become

It   is clear that one country's output can go up only if the other

country's output goes down. In the case of a domestic fiscal expansion

that appreciates the currency (reduces S), there is a contractionary

effect on foreign income that is similar to those we saw for the effects

via real money, real wealth, and oil prices; all four work to reverse

the Mundell—Fleming result of positive transmission. One might expect

that a domestic monetary expansion, because it increases S in equation

(12), would have the opposite effect from a fiscal expansion, that it

would increase foreign income. But from equation (11) the monetary

expansion would then have to reduce domestic income; this perverse

result can be ruled out by the recognition from equation (3) that Y

cannot fall unless i rises and reduces A or the currency appreciates

and reduces TB, neither of which will follow from a monetary

expansion. The only possible solution is that P rises by the same

proportion as S (the increase in the money supply) and there is no

effect on either domestic or foreign income.'0

            I. 2. The Policy Multipliers in the Simulations


       Table 2 summarizes the effects of a fiscal expansion (an increase

in government spending, with the money supply and foreign policy

variables held constant) according to the 12 models in the Brookings

simulations. (The U.S. expansion is represented by Simulation B with

all signs reversed. The non—U.S. OECD expansion is Simulation G.) For

simplicity it shows the effects only in the second year.

       The most well—known theoretical ambiguity, the effect on the

exchange rate, turns out to generate relatively little disagreement. In

the case of a U.S. fiscal expansion eleven models show an appreciation

of the dollar. The only exception is the Wharton model, which reports a

significant depreciation (evidently attributable to little or no capital

mobility). In the case of a non—U.S. fiscal expansion there is a little

more divergence. But seven out of eleven models still show the standard

high capital mobility result, a domestic appreciation, with only the

EPA, LINK, VAR and Wharton models showing the reverse. The asymmetry

between the exchange rate effects of U.S. fiscal expansion and European

or Japanese expansion, which here shows up only In these four models,

has been attributed to a variety of possible reasons. One of them, a

greater tendency to monetize government deficits abroad than in the

United States, should have been ruled out by the careful specification

of the Brookings experiment. Another reason suggested, lower capital

mobility (k), could explain econometric findings for individual non

U.S. countries but cannot explain the asymmetry in a well—specified two—

country Mundell—Flerning model: capital mobility into the United States

cannot be higher than capital mobility Out of the rest of the world.

The same applies to the argument that non—U.S. countries are more open

to trade than the United States; given that the non—U.S. economy is

larger than the U.S., it must be less open in the aggregate. One

explanation that works is a steeper LM curve in the United States so

that U.S. interest rates are more easily driven up.''

       For either U.S. or non—U.S. fiscal policy the simulations show

that changes are transmitted positively to the rest of the world, in all

the structural models but one. This is not surprising. Including even

the few cases where a fiscal expansion depreciates the currency, the

domestic current account is observed to worsen in all the structural

models (as it must in standard theory; it is the worsening of the trade

balance, if it is big enough, that is the cause of any downward pressure

on the currency under Mundell—Fleming). The foreign current account and

foreign income therefore increase.'2 In the majority—case where a

fiscal expansion appreciates the currency, the positive transmission to




     '1Oudiz and Sachs (1984, 7, 19, 22) find the asymmetry present in
the MCM and EPA models, and attribute it to the slopes of the LM curve
and the importance of dollar assets in the world portfolio. Yoshitonii
(1984, 34—37, 62) explains that the asymmetry in the EPA model is due to
the slopes of the 124 curve and the degree of bond substitutability. A
general discussion of the various possible reasons for the asymmetry
occurred in a Brookings—World Bank conference in October 1984. (Volume
edited by Fleisig.)

          the VAR results, a fiscal expansion in either country produces
a current account deficit in the other country. In the case of a U.S.
fiscal expansion, the non—U.S. current account worsens slightly in the
second year even though U.S. output rises, non—U.S. output falls, the
dollar rises against foreign currencies, and the U.S. current account
worsens! Such results suggest limitations to the usefulness of using
non—structural models to answer questions about the likely effects of
changes in policy. Cooley and Leroy (1985) consider this methodological
issue.



                                  —22—
foreign output provides a preliminary indication that the four

theoretical contractionary effects of a currency depreciation discussed

above (via money balances, real wealth, imported input prices or wages)

either are not operating, or at least are not powerful enough to reverse

standard transmission results.

       The one exception among the eleven structural models is the

Liverpool model. Though lining up with the majority on the positive

effect of a fiscal expansion on the value of domestic currency, the

negative effect on the domestic current account, and positive effect on

the foreign current account, the Liverpool model nevertheless produces

the unique result of a negative effect on foreign output. The reverse

transmission holds both from the United States abroad and in the

opposite direction. Evidently one or more of the four contractionary

exchange rate effects is operating. Minford (1984, eq. 2, pp. 88—89)

specifies an adverse supply effect from depreciation, apparently

justified along the lines of the last of the four effects enumerated

above: an increase in wages, in nominal or own—product terms.'3 The

Liverpool simulations show a sharper increase in the CPI of the country

not undertaking the fiscal expansion, presumably as a result of the

depreciation of its currency, than do the other models. This could

explain the strength of the adverse supply effect in that model.



     13However, Marston (1984, 136) specifically describes Minfordvs
exchange rate effect on supply as coming from imported inputs, not labor
costs. (Neither wages nor imported inputs appear explicitly in the
model.) looper (1986, 7) identifies the contractionary effect of the
exchange rate in the Liverpool model as the real wealth effect.


                                  —23—
       It is not surprising that the one model that shows the most

dissimilar results is nonstructural: the Sims—Litterman VAR model.

Like the Liverpool model it shows no positive transmission from U.S.

fiscal policy to non—U.S. output (the effect appears to be inverse in

the first two years, but insignificant to the third digit). More

anomalously it shows a fiscal expansion in either country reducing the

price level P in both countries (GNP deflator).'4

       To sum up the results of fiscal expansion, all structural models

show positive effects on the domestic price level and negative effects

on the domestic current account. All but one show positive effects on

both domestic and foreign output. Several show a negative rather than

positive effect on the value of the currency, especially when it is the

non—U.S. OECD that is expanding. But the one case of negative trans-

mission to foreign output is not one of the few, like the Wharton model,

in which the domestic currency depreciates and thereby weakens the

transmission link through the trade balance. Rather, it is the

Liverpool model, in which the domestic currency appreciates, raising the

other country's CPI sharply with adverse effects on supply.

       These conflicts regarding the exchange rate and transmissions

findings are relatively few and within the bounds of standard

theoretical results. (This does not include the VAR model which

features anomolous effects on price levels, interest rates and current

accounts.)




     14The LINK model also shows a U.S. fiscal expansion reducing the
domestic price level, for the reasons mentioned in footnote 9.


                                  —24—
       Table 3 displays the effects of a monetary expansion (Simulation

D for the United States and H for the rest of the OECD). The simulation

findings for the effects of monetary policy show more conflict among the

models, and the conflict is less in line with well—known theoretical

ambiguities, than for the effects of fiscal policy. The models divide

almost evenly on the transmission of a U.S. monetary expansion to the

rest of the OECD. All models show a clear depreciation of the

dollar.The MCM, EPA, LINK, Liverpool, Minimod, Taylor and DRI models

show the standard Mundell—Fleming result that the appreciation of

foreign currencies causes the foreign current accounts and incomes to

decline. But the EEC, VAR, MSG, OECD and Wrton models show positive

transmission instead. When the monetary expansion originates in the

non—U.S. OECD, positive transmission occurs not only in those five

models but also in EPA, LINK, Liverpool, MSG and Taylor.

       The obvious explanation for a rise in foreign income in response

to a domestic increase in the money supply and exchange rate is that the

appreciation of the foreign currencies has one or more of the expan-

sionary effects abroad enumerated above: increasing the real money

supply and real wealth or decreasing wages and imported input costs. If

any of these expansionary effects is strong enough to dominate the

change in the trade balance, we could get the positive transmission.

The primary obstacle to attaching this interpretation to the models is

that in the Brookings simulations for the case of a non—policy

depreciation of the dollar (Simulation F) eight of the ten models show a

clear negative effect on foreign income. The only one to show a clear

expansionary effect, despite the worsening in the foreign trade balance,

is the Minimod model, which is not one of those showing positive

transmission of monetary expansion.'5 This suggests that the positive

transmission of a U.S. monetary expansion to foreign income occurs

through a channel other than the exchange rate.

       In the case of the EEC, OECD and Wharton models, the channel of

the transmission of a U.S. monetary expansion is easily identified:

despite the depreciation of the dollar, the U.S. current account worsens

and the foreign current account improves. Surprisingly, the worsening

in the U.S. current account occurs not only in the three models in which

non—U.S. output rises, but also in five of the models in which non—U.S.

output falls: the MCM, EPA, LINK, Liverpool, and DRI models.'6 In the

case of the MCM model, the non—U.S. current account worsens even though

the U.S. current account worsens, while in the other four, non—U.S.

output falls even though the non—U.S. current account improves; either

breaking of the trade transmission link seems difficult to explain.

       The surprise contained in the deterioration of the U.S. trade

balance in 8 out of 11 of the models is not the fact that the dollar

depreciates. Higher U.S. income accounts for higher imports, and




     15me Taylor model is one that shows a small expansionary effect
from a non—U.S. monetary expansion on U.S. output in the first two
years, though the effect is substantially reversed thereafter. The
Taylor simulations reported in Table 3 show the U.S. currency
appreciating and the U.S. CPI falling, if only in the second year. But
the positive transmission cannot be attributed to the real product wage,
which rises slightly at first, despite the appreciation of the U.S.
currency. Rather, the positive effect of an appreciation of the
currency on real money balances and therefore output is reported to be
important in Taylor (1985, 62), and to give positive transmission of a
domestic monetary expansion to the foreign country.

     '6Oudiz and Sachs (1984, 20—22) report that monetary expansion
worsens the domestic current account, for the EPA model as well as the
NCM model (for either the U.S., Japan, or West Germany). Yoshitomi
(1984, 347—350, 396) confirms this property of the EPA model.
                             —27—
Simulation F, the "non—policy exogenous depreciation of the dollar,"

reveals that several of the models have a prolonged enough J curve

that the trade balance does not respond positively to the exchange rate

until the third or fourth year (Wharton, OECD, and LINK). The puzzle is

rather how the net capital inflow, which must equal the trade deficit

under floating exchange rates, can increase after a monetary expan-

sion. The monetary expansion should decrease the U.S. interest rate

(except, of course, in models where there are lags in neither expec-

tations nor price adjustment). In the simulations, the interest rate

does indeed decrease, though for most models the nominal interest rate

has already begun to start back up by the second year.'7 The Mundell—

Fleming theory under floating exchange rates says that the lower

interest rate should induce a capital outflow, implying a sufficiently

strong currency depreciation to improve the current account corres-

pondingly.18 The models in the simulations seem to be behaving more

like models of fixed (or managed) exchange rates, where an increase in

the money supply flows out of the country through a trade deficit

financed out of foreign exchange reserves, than like models with no




     17Agairi the Liverpool model is the exception: the interest rate
rises in the first year and falls in the second. But even in this
model, it is lower in the second year relative to the zero baseline.

     181n models of perfect capital mobility, the ex ante decrease in
demand for dollar assets, which leads to the depreciation of the
currency, is not the same thing as an ex post decrease in the net
capital account balance. But if perfect capital mobility ties the
domestic interest rate to the foreign interest rate, then it means the
trade balance must improve even more (by enough so that the higher
transactions demand absorbs all the increased money supply with no help
from lower interest rates, except via large—country effects).



                                  —28—
intervention in the foreign exchange market.

       Helliwell and Padmore (1985, 1130—31) and Helliwell (1986, 15)

have identified why the large econometric models have the property that

a monetary expansion causes a net capital inf low. Capital flows respond

not only to interest rates but also to expectations of future exchange

rate changes. If the instantaneous depreciation of the currency, which

results from a monetary expansion, generates expectations of future

appreciation, then it will have a positive effect on the attractiveness

of domestic assets that runs counter to the lower interest rates. In

Helliwell's terms, speculative capital flows fulfill the stabilizing

"buffer stock" role that official intervention would play under a system

of fixed or managed exchange rates. This regressive type of expectation

has been found to be rational in the Dornbusch (1976) overshooting model

and some other versions of the asset market approach to exchange rate

determination. Its properties in the Mundell—Fleming flow approach to

the capital account are somewhat less well—known, though stated by Mussa

(1979, 191).19 It is clear that many as yet unresolved research issues

continue to fall under the heading of understanding the capital account.

       One might think that showing how "speculative" capital inflows

allow a domestic trade deficit in a small—country model would be



     '9yoshitomi (1984) emphasizes the importance of regressive exchange
rate expectations in potentially reversing the direction of capital
flows. Among the other models that now incorporate the regressive
exchange rate expectations of Dornbusch (1976) are the MCM model (Haas
and Syrnansky (1984)) and Minimod. The MSG model (Minford (1984, 90,97),
and Taylor (1985, 56) make the assumption that efficient market
arbitrage drives the interest differential to the rationally expected
rate of depreciation; but Taylor (1985) reports no exchange rate over-
shooting, implying that regressive expectations are not rational.


                                  —29—
tantamount to showing how they allow a foreign trade surplus, and

therefore positive transmission of the expansion, in the corresponding

two—country model. But a problem remains. If a money market equilib—

rium condition like (2) holds in the foreign country, then foreign nom-

inal income cannot rise unless foreign interest rates rise. It seems

unlikely that foreign interest rates would rise at the same time that

the domestic monetary expansion is reducing domestic interest rates.

Indeed a U.S. monetary expansion reduces short—term non—U.S. interest

rates in all ten of the reporting structural models, and a non—U.S.

monetary expansion reduces U.S. short—term interest rates in seven of

the nine reporting structural models. (In the case of the only

exceptions, LINK and Wharton, the short—term interest rate is virtually

unchanged. )20

       It must be that in these models, the short—term interest rate is

not determined by a simple money market equilibrium condition, but by a

portfolio decision that considers a broader menu of assets. It would be

enough to have the demand for foreign money depend on the domestic

interest rate in addition to the foreign interest rate. If the U.S.

monetary expansion drives down U.S. interest rates sufficiently far

relative to European interest rates, or if European money demand is

sufficiently sensitive to U.S. interest rates, then the unchanged




     20Gerry Hoitham points out that a simple money market equation like
(2) is consistent with a decline in the foreign interest rate and a rise
in foreign real output, provided that the exchange rate change reduces
the foreign price level by more than enough to offset the rise in out-
put. This is the case——foreign nominal GNP falls in response to a U.S.
monetary expansion——in the EEC, MSG and OECD models.


                                  —30—
European money stock can support the higher level of European income

implied by positive transmission.

       To sum up the results of monetary expansion, almost as many

models show positive transmission to the rest of the OECD as show

negative transmission. Their reversal of the Mundell—Fleming result is

not attributable to non—trade effects of the exchange rate on foreign

income. Rather It appears to be due to a non—interest rate related

capital flow into the domestic country, allowing a trade balance shift

in favor of the foreign country. In terms of target variables of

interest to the domestic country, the effect of a monetary expansion on

the trade balance is the issue on which the models disagree the most.

This disagreement among the models will play a key role in the next part

of the paper.

                 II. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR COORDINATION
          BETWEEN THE DOMESTIC MONETARY AND FISCAL AUTHORITIES


       It is a general principle that, when two policy makers both

affect variables that each cares about, they can do better by cooperat-

ing than they would in the Nash competitive equilibrium, in which each

acts to maximize his own welfare function taking the actions of the

other as given.21 This principle has led economists to propose

increased coordination between different domestic policy—making

agencies, and between domestic and foreign policy makers. An example of

the first type from the l98Os is the argument that the Federal Reserve

should agree to follow a looser monetary policy in return for the

Administration (and Congress) agreeing to reduce the federal budget

deficit. The point would be to reduce interest rates, the value of the

dollar and the trade deficit, without losing anything in the

output/inflation tradeoff. An example of the second type is the

argument that the United States should agree to follow a tighter budget

policy in return for Europe and Japan agreeing to move in the opposite

direction.22 The point, again, would be to reduce the trade imbalance

without causing a world recession.

       The existence of conflicting models gives the literature on

international coordination a certain air of unreality. To begin with,




            paper is not the first to develop an exception to this
principle. One counterexample (along very different lines) is offered
by Rogoff (1985). For good introductions to the coordination
literature, see Oudiz and Sachs (1984) or Cooper (1985).

     22For example, Layard et al (1984) and Marris (1985).



                                     —32—
the issue of the gains from coordination is subtle enough that, even

among economists who agree on the broad outline of the correct model,

small differences can lead to opposite recommendations as to the

direction in which policy—settings must be moved to reap the gains from

coordination. A possible example in domestic U.S. policy—making is that

movement in the direction of a tight monetary policy and a loose fiscal

policy, far from being the outcome of a destructive lack of coordination

between the monetary and fiscal authorities, might be thought desirable

from the national point of view: the high value for the dollar reduces

the U.S. Consumer Price Index and thereby allows an improvement over the

regular output/inflation tradeoff.23 Examples in the international

context abound. OECD countries are often urged to undertake a coordi-

nated expansion; the argument is that each is reluctant to expand on its

own for fear of worsening its trade balance and/or currency value.24 On

the other hand there has been talk about the need for coordinated mone-

tary discipline (particularly in the l970s) and coordinated budgetary

discipline (particularly in the 1980s). It seems that every possible

combination has been suggested: the Nash non—cooperative equilibrium Is

variously thought to result in competitive currency appreciation,




     23Sachs (1985), for example, has offered this interpretation of the
U.S. monetary/fiscal mix in the early 1980s——that it might have been
optimal given the objective function.

     240ne of many examples from the 1980s is Bergsten et al (1982).
The gains from coordinated expansion by Europe, Japan and the United
States were also behind the locomotive theory that led to the 1978 Bonn
Summit.


                                 —33—
competitive currency depreciation ("beggar—thy—neighbor"), insufficient

expansion, or excessive expansion. It has even been suggested that the

gains from international coordination lie in an agreement that one

country will expand whenever others are contracting and vice versa.

       If such contradictions are possible within the standard models of

mainstream macroecononiists,25 the situation is even worse once the more

widely—scattered views of policy makers are acknowledged. In the

context of 1983—1984, there was little point in trying to convince the

U.S. Treasury that, to correct the exchange rate and trade imbalance,

the United States should reverse its fiscal expansion in exchange for

European and Japanese fiscal expansion. The Treasury view was that

there had been no U.S. fiscal expansion to begin with, that fiscal

expansion causes currencies if anything to depreciate, that the strength

of the dollar was instead attributable to other factors (the safe—haven

effect), that the trade deficit was in any case not attributable to the

strong dollar (but rather to rapid U.S. growth), and——most relevantly—

that the Administration did not want Europe and Japan to undertake

fiscal expansion.

       The purist will argue that if policy makers have different

"information," then they "should" share it with each other and agree o.




     25Some of the conflicting possibilities arise from uncertainty as
to what are the variables that should enter the objective function and
where the economy currently is relative to the optimum, rather than
uncertainty as to the correct model or parameter values. The economist
could plausibly argue that such questions can only be answered by the
political process.


                                  —34—
 a common model. The proposition about gains from coordination holds

 regardless of which model is correct.26 In practical terms, then, the

 purist is urging on economists a research strategy of first discovering

 and agreeing on the true model, and only then convincing policy makers

 that it is the true model (a task that would surely be less difficult if

uiacroeconomists agreed among themselves) and pointing out the gains from

coordination based on this true model.

       Research will, and should, proceed with the aim of developing

models that more closely reflect economic reality. Most of this

research will, and probably should, proceed under the assumption that

actors within the model act on the basis of the model itself. But there

is also a need for research under the assumption that actors have

different models. These are the only circumstances under which policy-

making is likely to take place.

       In this part of the paper, we consider the domestic problem in

which the two policy makers are the monetary authority and the fiscal

authority. In future work we will consider the international problem,

in which the policy makers are the U.S. authorities on the one hand and

European and Japanese authorities on the other. The findings in the

international context are expected to be quite similar to the findings




     26Some authors, such as Canzoneri and Gray (1983) set up their
theory in a framework general enough to encompass all of the possible
positive or negative effects. The direction in which policies must be
moved in order to reap gains from coordination can be viewed as a
function of the parameter values, the latter presumably to be filled in
later by the econometrician.

reported here. In both problems, the 12 models that participated in the

Brookings simulations will be used to illustrate the conflicting beliefs

that policy makers could have, and their implications for coordination.

      We will consider here what happens when the monetary and fiscal

authority have identical welfare functions, so as to focus on the role

of divergent models in policy conflict and coordination. In the ap-

pendix we introduce divergent welfare functions, the usual basis for

policy conflict and coordination.

        II. 1. Competition and Bargaining When the Policy Makers
            Seek to Maximize the Same Goals Using Different Models


       We begin by showing how the monetary and fiscal authorities will

prefer a cooperative equilibrium to the Nash non—cooperative one despite

an identical welfare function, if they subscribe to different models.

We will also show how, if neither of the policy makers happens to have

the correct model, the cooperative equilibrium could as easily be

inferior to the Nash equilibrium as the other way around, that is, could

result by the light of the true model in a lower value of the agreed—

upon welfare function.

       When we study international coordination, each country must have

more than two goals; otherwise it can use its two instruments, domestic

monetary and fiscal policy, to attain both goals regardless what the

other country does, and no interesting issue of coordination arises.

But here we consider domestic coordination and limit the welfare func-

tion to two goals for simplicity. Let y be the log of domestic output

and x be the current account as a share of GNP, both expressed as

deviations from their desired or sustainable long—run levels. (We have

also tried the exchange rate and the CPI for the second goal). The

framework shared by all is the familiar linear one of targets and

instruments:

       Subscripts on the upper case letters, the policy multipliers,

will indicate the different values they can take depending on the

model: a "c" to represent the perceptions of the central bank, and an

"f" to represent the perceptions of the fiscal authority. We adopt the

conventional assumption that policy makers seek to iuinimize a quadratic

loss function w:

If both policy makers knew the true model, all subscripts could be

dropped. The optimal solution in terms of the true parameters would

then follow by solving the two equations simultaneously for        g and
in. There would be no issue of conflict or coordination, each agency

simply doing its agreed—upon part.

       But if the policy makers believe in different models, the

subscripts must remain. The first equation has been solved for m as a

function of g and the second vice versa, so that they represent the

two authorities' reaction functions to each other's policies. The Nash

competitive equilibrium is:

graph its reaction function CB1, as represented by equation (16). We

draw it downward—sloping (a positive             this would follow when, as in

many of the models, m and g both have positive effects on income and

both have negative effects on the current account. The central bank's

perceived indifference curves radiate Out from its perceived optimum,

point 1. They are intersected by CB1 wherever they are flat, because

along CB1 the central bank is optimizing with respect to m for a

given g.

         Assume the fiscal authority believes in model 2. We draw its

reaction function FA2 upward—sloping (a negative Lf). This slope nilght

follow if the fiscal authority's model differs from model 1 by featuring

a positive current account multiplier for the money supply Df, as in

the EPA, MSG, Minimod, and VAR models in the case of U.S. monetary

policy (and the MCM, Liverpool, Minimod, VAR and Wharton models in the

case of non—U.S. monetary policy). The positive slope also might follow

If the fiscal authority's model differs from model I by featuring a

negative output multiplier for fiscal policy (as in the Liverpool model

in the case of non—U.S. expansion).27

         The fiscal authorities' perceived indifference curves radiate

from its perceived optimum, point 2. They are intersected by FA2

wherever they are vertical, because along FA2 the fiscal authority is

optimizing with respect to g for a given m. The Nash competitive

equilibrium is where the two reaction functions intersect, point N. If

the two policy makers happen to have the same model, then point 1 =

point   2 =   point   N.

         There is a potential issue of stability. If the policy makers

are thought of as taking turns reacting to each other according to (15)



          the second target variable were the exchange rate instead of
the trade balance, then the ambiguous effect of a fiscal expansion
discussed previously could change negative slopes to positive. If it
were the price level, then the negative effect of a monetary expansion
in the LINK model or of a fiscal expansion in the VAR model could have
the same implication. However, the points to be made here, particularly
that coordination need not improve welfare, require only that the
parameter values differ, not that they differ enough to give opposite—
signed slopes.


                                   —41—
and (16), will they actually reach the Nash equilibrium point? If the

slopes are as in Figure 2, then the process is unstable. Stability

requires that the absolute value of the slope of CBI exceed the absolute

value of the slope of FA2. If the condition is satisfied, there is a

second question of whether convergence to equilibrium will be slow or

rapid. These are the first of the questions that will be analyzed below

for different possible combinations of the models in the Brookings

simulation exercise.

           It is very easy to see that the Nash solution represented by (17,.

and (18) is not the optimum. (One would need I =       I,   K = K,   'c =

and   Lf     L, where the unsubscripted letters are defined analogously to

the subscripted ones so as to represent parameter values in the true

model, for the Nash solution to be the optimum.) Neither policy maker

will be happy with this equilibrium, each cursing the stupidity of the

other for not moving in the desired direction. As we have drawn Figure

1, the fiscal authority wishes that the central bank would increase

money growth, so as to depreciate the currency and improve the current

account. But the central bank's perception is different, that increas-

ing money growth would worsen the current account. It wishes the fiscal

authority would decrease government spending.

        One might think that when two policymakers have conflicting views

as to the effects of any proposed package of policy changes, they would

simply fail to come to an agreement to coordinate. But even assuming

that neither policymaker is willing to revise his beliefs, there will ir

general be a bargain they can make

authorities' indifference curves at N have slopes of zero and

infinity, respectively, from which it follows that they are not

tangent. They can both agree to move in the southeast direction. There

is an entire range of points, those in the shaded "lens," that

dominate N for both policy makers. Which point will they actually

agree on? Much of the literature singles out the Nash bargaining

solution, at which the product of the two agents welfare gains is

maximized relative to what perceived welfare would be at the Nash

competitive solution N12.28 The bargaining solution is represented by

a point on the contract curve like the one labelled B12 in figure 3.

could not tell from equation (19), if one did not know, that the

parameters refer to different perceptions of the same multipliers,

rather than similar perceptions of different multipliers.

       The usual enforcement problems exist as well: each would prefer

to cheat on the bargain. We will ignore issues of repeated games,

credible commitment, etc., and content ourselves for the purposes of

this paper with comparisons of the static cooperative and non-

cooperative solutions.

       One alternative to the Nash bargaining point as a cooperative

solution for the problem of conflicting models would be for the policy

makers to "bargain" over what is the correct model. In the event of

widely diverging Bayesian priors, it would probably take a prohibitively

great amount of new data for the two to reach a genuine convergence of

beliefs. But for the sake of compromise, in an attempt to improve on

the competitive equilibrium N12, they could base their policy actions on

a version of equations (12) and (13) in which the parameter estimates

are taken as a weighted average of their individual parameter esti-

mates. If one wished to preserve the symmetry that characterizes the

Nash bargaining solution (19), the weights could be equal, although this

seems ad hoc.

       A priority for future research is to compare the implications of

a strategy of averaging the parameter estimates to the implications of

the usual Nash bargaining point. As a positive, rather than normative,

solution concept, it has the disadvantage that it could lie outside the

shaded lens, that is, it could result in one policy maker's perceived


                                  —46—
level of welfare being less than it would be at point N12. But if the

average of two parameter estimates is a better estimator of the true

parameter value than either alone, as is generally the case in

statistics, then it might be possible to show that the averaging

solution would result in a higher expected value of welfare as judged by

the true model than the Nash bargaining solution. The prescriptive

conclusion would be that ministers in OECD meetings should spend more of

their time discussing the basic assumptions underlying their views of

the world.

       Our major question here is whether movement of the policy

settings in the direction that raises each policy maker's perceived

welfare, for example movement to the bargaining point B12, does in

reality affect y and x in such a way as to improve welfare. The

answer of course depends on the true model. If one or the other of the

policy makers' models (1 and 2) happens to be the true model, then

cooperation will necessarily improve welfare; otherwise that policy

maker would not have agreed to the change. But, as we argued in the

introduction, this is unlikely to be the case. More likely, reality is

represented by some third model, say point 3 in Figures 1 or 3. The

true welfare levels produced by various combinations of m and g are

represented by the indifference curves radiating from point 3. As we

have drawn it, cooperation turns out to reduce welfare, though it could

as easily have been the reverse.

       To see what other outcomes are possible, we can swap models.

Figure 4 shows the possibilities. If the central bank believes model 3


                                   —47—
instead of model 1 then its reaction function is given by line CB3. If

the fiscal authority believes model 1, then the reaction line is given

by FA1. The Nash competitive point is now N31 instead of N12. The two

policy makers can raise the perceived welfare of each by agreeing to

move in the northeast direction. If reality is represented by the same

model 3 then cooperation necessarily improves welfare. But if reality

is represented by model 2 instead of model 3, then the Nash point N31

must be judged by the standard of the indifference curves radiating from

point 2. As we have drawn the graph, cooperation turns out to raise

true welfare with this combination of models.

       Altogether there are twenty—seven (= 3 x 3 x 3) combinations:

the fiscal authority can believe any of the three models, the central

bank can believe any of the three, and reality can be represented by any

of the three. In the 9/27 combinations where the two agencies happen to

share the same model, coordination is not an issue one way or the other.

Out of the remaining 18 combinations there are 12 in which one of the

two agencies' models coincides with the true model; here coordination

necessarily improves welfare. The remaining 6 combinations could go

either way; when all three models are distinct, it seems that coordi-

nation could reduce welfare (as from point N12) as easily as improve it

(from point N31). This case becomes more important as the number of

distinct models becomes larger. If there are q models, there are

q(q—1)(q—2) combinations in which three different models are featured,

out of a total of    combinations. The limit as q goes to infinity,

in which the probability of divergent models goes to 1, seems to

describe the actual state of affairs.

                  11.2 Evidence from the Simulations


       How important is the issue of conflicting models likely to be in

practice? For example, is the case where coordination reduces welfare

as judged by the true model merely a pathological counterexample? In

what follows we use the simulation results of the international

macroeconometric models that participated in the Brookings exercise to

see what might happen. If we used all 12 models there would be 1728

(=12) combinations. To keep the problem more manageable,29 we

concentrated on 6 models (giving 216 combinations): the MCM, EPA, LINK,

Liverpool, VAR and OECD models. The models were chosen to be repre-

sentative of the full range of models both with respect to geography——

one might choose to associate the NCM with U.S. beliefs, the EPA with

Japanese beliefs, and the OECD (or EEC) with European beliefs——and with

respect to philosophy——the LINK model being considered the most

Keynesian of the twelve, Liverpool the most monetarist/new classical,

and VAR the only non—structural model.

       This study follows the path blazed by Oudiz and Sachs (1984).

Indeed they listed uncertainty (though not disagreement) as to the

correct model as one of the topics remaining for future research:

      "A second difficulty in our treatment is the implicit assumption
      that the "true" model of the world is known with certainty and
      that exogenous shocks are absent during the planning period....We
      have not yet investigated the implications of such uncertainty for
      the logic of policy cooperation, but it is important to do so. We



          is as easy to program the computer to do 1728 combinations as
fewer. But the output would be too much to digest.


                                 —49—
      think Feldstein is correct when he says that such uncertainty is a
      major practical impediment to greater policy coordination."
      (p. 56)

Oudiz and Sachs calculated the effects of international coordination

taking the policy multipliers from the MCM and EPA models. They noted

differences between the models, but maintained the usual assumption that

the models used by both policy makers coincided with each other and with

reality. If our results on international coordination are viewed in a

three dimensional q x q x q matrix, then the Oudiz—Sachs results

should be the entries appearing on the diagonal (MCM—MCM—MCM and EPA—

EPA—EPA).

       We take policy multipliers from the simulation results reported

in Tables 2 (government expenditure) and 3 (money supply). These are

the effects in the second year, chosen to represent the relatively short

run, but allowing enough time to get past the negative part of the J—

curve. For those of our experiments that envision the policy makers

taking turns in real time, one can imagine using dynamic multipliers,

that is, the entire time profile of policy effects that was produced ii

the simulations; but this complication is left for future research.

Table 4 reports the policy multipliers for the percentage effect on ths

level of GNP (the cumulated change over the two years) and the effect on

the current account as a percent of GNP; these are the terms in which

Oudiz and Sachs treat the target variables.

       Computing the reaction functions (15) and (16) requires knowing

not only the perceived policy multipliers, but also the relative welfare

weight (ta)     placed on the trade balance, and the perceived constant
terms (A and B).3° Though we have decided here to attribute

the same      to both policy makers, in order to concentrate solely on

conflicts in models, the value judgment remains an exceedingly difficult

and arbitrary task.   It seems that the calculation as to the location of

the Nash point can be as sensitive to the choice of welfare weights and

constant terms as to the choice of policy multipliers.3' Oudiz and

Sachs made their choices based on the calculation of what the welfare

weights would have to have been for policy makers, optimizing in Nash

equilibrium, to produce the values of output, inflation and trade

balance actually observed in the l980s. There are problems with this

methodology. To use it in our context would require the computation of

different weights, not only for the two policy makers, but for every

possible combination of models. Instead we simply take weights from the

EPA case of Oudiz and Sachs and apply them uniformly to all models.32

       One point regarding the constant terms can easily escape

notice. In assuming that the policy makers react directly to each

other's policy—settings g and m rather than to the target vari-

ables y and x, we have implicitly assumed that they ignore observed

deviations of y and x from what they would have expected based on

their models, or treat them as purely random disturbances.33 An



     31mis is not to say that the calculation as to whether cooperation
improves on the Nash point is as sensitive to the choice of the welfare
weights as to the choice of policy multipliers.

     32We do not use their weights for the MCM case because the reported
weight on the U.S. current account is zero.

     33A complete Bayesian analysis would have agents ascribe only part of
the observed discrepancy to the error terms, and part to a revision of the
parameter values. But the premise of this paper is that it is realistic
to assume that policy—makers revise their models to a negligible extent.

alternative would be to assume that they treat such observed discrep-

ancies as following a random walk, that is, as permanent revisions in

the constant terms A and B. This would be equivalent to a perpetual

updating of the intercepts of the reaction functions to insure that they

always pass through the target optimum y =    x   =   0.   This alternative

assumption is applied in the appendix, in the context of the classic

"Assignment Problem."

       Table 5 reports the results for the Nash equilibrium when the two

goals are output and the current account balance, under 36 possible com-

binations of models to which the monetary and fiscal authorities can

subscribe. If one chooses, one can think of the policymakers taking

turns in real time. The first entry in each cell reports whether the

Nash equilibrium is stable, and the second reports the number of

iterations required to reach convergence (of both target variables, to

within a tolerance of 1.0 percent). Only 14/36 combinations exhibit

technical instability (most of them models in which the fiscal authority

is acting on the basis of either the VAR, or OECD models). Another

6/36, though technically stable, require more than 20 iterations to

converge. However one may choose instead to think of the policymakers

instantly jumping to the Nash equilibriumm.

       The main focus of interest in Table 5 is the nature of the

coordination that the two policy makers will view it as in their

interest to undertake, under each combination of models. Two lines in

each cell indicate the change, relative to the Nash equilibrium, in

which they can agree to move the money supply and government expendi-

ture, respectively, in order to maximize the product of the two

perceived gains in welfare. The next two lines indicate the effects

that the two agents perceive such a package of policy changes will have

on the target variables; they can be obtained by taking the product of

the change in policy settings and the multipliers reported in Table 4.

The last two lines in each cell indicate how much the central bank and

fiscal authority, respectively, thinks that the country has to gain in

terms of the welfare function (equation (14)) by the movement of the

policy—settings in the indicated direction. If the policy makers happen

to believe the same model (the diagonal cells), then there is no scope

for coordination. This is a consequence of our ruling out conflicting

welfare functions; each thinks that the country is at the optimum.

       Otherwise, there will be scope for coordination. Consider the

example where the central bank subscribes to the MCM model and the

fiscal authority to the OECD model. Each perceives that they can

accomplish relatively large welfare gains by an alteration of the mix in

favor of more expansionary monetary policy and more restrictive govern-

ment spending. This is the kind of coordination that has been suggested

frequently for the United States in the 1980s; the Nash competitive

solution results in too high a level of interest rates, value of the

dollar, and size of the trade deficit. It shows up in 12 cases in Table

5. But all other combinations appear as well. Coordination could call

for contractionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy (5

cases, most of them cases where the monetary authority subscribes to the

Liverpool or LINK model), or expansion on both fronts (6 cases, again



                                  56
cases where the monetary authority subscribes to the Liverpool, or LINK

models), or contraction on both fronts (7 cases, most of them cases

where the fiscal authority subscribes to the Liverpool or LINK models).

       To find out whether a given plan for policy coordination raises

welfare in truth, rather than only in the perceptions of the policy

makers, we would have to know the true model. This we cannot do. But

we can get an idea of the range of possibilities by judging it by the

standard of each of the other models in the Brookings simulations. The

36 cells in Table 6 correspond to the same 6 x 6 combinations of sub-

scribed—to models as in Table 5. Each gives the true welfare gains,

under 6 possible models of reality. Consider again the example where

the central bank subscribes to the MCM and the fiscal authority to the

OECD model.   If either the MCM or OECD models coincides with the true

model, then there will necessarily be a true welfare gain, equal to

.0034 or .0029, respectively, just as the central bank or fiscal

authority, respectively, thought there would be. (The welfare units are

expressed in terms of the variance of output.) It turns out that if the

true model happens to be the EPA or VAR model, then there will also be a

welfare gain. But if the true model is the Liverpool or LINK model,

then there will be a welfare loss. The coordination plan moves policy

settings in the wrong direction, and everyone would have been better off

staying with the Nash competitive equilibrium. This conclusion is

nation plan (monetary contraction and fiscal expansion) will again

worsen welfare as judged by the other four models.

        Of course the proper strategy, if the true model could be

discovered, would be simply for both policy makers to optimize subject

to it. The point here is that one cannot, under conditions where policy

makers subscribe to different models, make the blanket pronouncement

that coordination must improve welfare.

        Of the 216 (=   6)   possible combinations in Table 6, 180 (= 216 —

6)   involve disagreement between the policymakers, and therefore

bargaining. Of the 180, welfare is improved by bargaining in 98 cases

and worsened in 64 cases. (In 18 cases the effect is not perceptible:

zero to four decimal places.) However in 60 (= 2 x 6 x 5) of these

cases, one agency or the other has the true model, so that a non—

negative welfare change is guaranteed. Of the 120 (= 6 x 5 x 4) cases

where the agencies' models differ not only from each other but also from

the true model, welfare is perceptibly improved in 52 and worsened in 64.

       When all 11 available models are used (the Taylor model reports

no results for the current account) there are 1331 (=     ii)   possible

combinations. Of the 1210 (= 1331 — 112) that involve disagreement and

bargaining, welfare is perceptibly improved in 667 cases and worsened in

477 cases. Of the 990 (= 11 x 10 x 9) cases where three distinct models

are involved, welfare is perceptibly improved in 490 cases and worsened

in 471 cases. As a sensitivity analysis with respect to targets, we

tried redoing the analysis with a target level of GNP assumed to be 25

percent above the baseline. When all 11 models are used, 537 of the

cases involving 3 distinct models show perceptible welfare gains from


                                     —63—
bargaining and 402 show losses. We also tried a target level of GYP

assumed to be 5 percent below the baseline; 557 of the cases involving 3

distinct models show welfare gains and 408 show losses. It may not be a

coincidence that coordination does, after all, produce welfare gains in

a (slight) majority of cases. A convex combination of two sets of

parameter estimates——even such a strange nonlinear "convex combination"

as comes out of the coordination mathematics——may be closer to the true

answer, and on average closer to any third set of parameter estimates,

than either individually. But to the extent there are possible gains

from coordination of this type, it might be more advantageous for the

agencies to realize them by bargaining over the correct model rather

than over the policies.

                           II. 3. Extensions


       Quite a number of extensions have been left for future research,

even after the same issues that have been investigated here for domestic

policy making are repeated for international policy making. We could

try different objective functions. For the exercises where the policy

makers are viewed as taking turns in real time, we could use the more

complete time profile of multiplier effects reported in the Brookings

simulation. A high priority is to compare the results of two possible

kinds of cooperation among policy makers: the Nash bargaining solution

versus maximization of joint welfare based on a model with parameter

values determined by averaging the estimates of the two.

       More ambitious modeling is possible. We could study a

Stackelberg equilibrium in which the U.S. policy makers are able to

choose their preferred point on the other countries' reaction curve. It

would be interesting to compare a naive Stackelberg equilibrium in which

the U.S. authority assumes that the others' actions are based on the

same model as its own, versus, the "rational expectations" Stackelberg

equilibrium in which the U.S. authorities realize that the foreign

governments will react on the basis of their own model, even though that

model is different from the model that the U.S. authorities themselves

believe to be correct. Other possibilities include having the policy

makers update their parameter estimates each period to reflect new

information in a Bayesian manner, evaluating institutional arrangements

like fixed exchange rates that might substitute for coordination, and

applying game theory concepts of repeated games and precomniitment.

                   APPENDIX: WHEN ThE POLICY MAKERS
                       ARE ASSIGNED DIFFERENT GOALS


       The preceding analysis was unusual in that issues of conflict and

coordination among policy makers were assumed to arise solely out of

divergent models. In this section we introduce the more usual diver-

gences in goals as well. As a concrete example, it is sometimes

observed that the fiscal authority cares more about output and

employment, particularly in an election year, and the central bank more

about other variables.34

       We adopt the extreme assumption that the fiscal authority cares

only about output and the central bank cares only about the other

variable, or vice versa. This assumption is not necessary, but keeps

things simple. It has the added advantage that when we compare the two

possibilities——a Nash equilibrium with the fiscal authority monitoring

output and the central bank monitoring the other variable, versus the

reverse combination——we are doing the classic Assignment Problem. Under

this interpretation the writer of a national constitution, resigned to

the necessity of decentralization of policy—making, must decide which

agency to make responsible for internal balance and which for external

balance. As Mundell (1962) showed, the wrong assignment of responsi-

bility could result in an unstable system. Mundell's solution was the

principle of "effective market classification:" assign each agency




     34mis section could be viewed as a warm—up for studying
international coordination, where the divergence in goals is clear.


                                 —66—
responsibility for that goal for which its policy tool is comparatively

more effective. We will see how the possibility of conflicting models

changes the nature of the Assignment Problem, as we have seen that it

changes the nature of gains from coordination.

       We return to the targets—and—instruments equations (12) and (13),

each perceived differently by the two authorities. But we add new

objective functions. Under Assignment Rule I, the central bank seeks to

minimize variation in output y and the fiscal authority to minimize

variation in the current account x. Thus the central bank seeks to

minimize

Equations (21) and (23), the two reaction functions under Assignment

Rule I, are graphed in Figure 5. The central bank's reaction function

CB1, Equation (21), slopes downward as long increases in m and g are

both thought to increase income. (The only exception among the 12

models is the Liverpool simulation, in which g can have a negative

multiplier.) But the fiscal authority's reaction function FA1,

Equation (23), slopes upward if an increase in g is thought to have

the opposite effect from m, that is to improve the current account (as

in the EPA, MSG, MiniMod, and VAR for a U.S. fiscal expansion), and so

we have drawn it that way. If the two agencies are thought of as takin

turns in real time, then the system is stable if and only if the

absolute value of the slope of CB1 is greater than the absolute value

of the slope of FA1:

If the two models coincide, as in the conventional Assignment Problem,

then one of the two Rules must be stable and the other unstable.36 But

with conflicting models, it is possible that both rules are stable, or

that neither are.

       In general with conflicting models, the equilibrium point where

the two reaction functions intersect will be different depending on the

rule and on the perceived models. One has only to solve equations like

(21) and (23) simultaneously and compare the solution with the simul-

taneous solution of equations like (25) and (26) to see the differ-

ence. One can evaluate the two solution points for in     and   g by the

standard of the true model to see the values of y2 and x2 that they

will in reality produce. The true value of the welfare function at the

equilibrium point would probably be a more important criterion for

evaluating the two possible assignment rules than is the criterion of

stability. In the problem considered in this paper, where each policy—

maker has only one goal, each will succeed in attaining his optimum (y

= 0   and x = 0)    regardless what the other does, so all equilibrium

points coincide. Stability is the only relevant criterion. But the

issue of different equilibrium points and different resulting welfare

levels arises if the domestic policy—makers have multiple goals, or in

the context of international policy—making.

        The above equations have the property that the policy makers do

not revise their views as to the values of the policy multipliers even




     361f the two slopes happen to be equal in absolute value, then
convergence will not be reached under either rule.


                                     —70—
though they observe levels of y and x that are inconsistent with

what their models would have predicted from the current settings of m

and g. In the previous section we made the assumption that such

discrepancies were viewed by the policy makers as transitory error

terms. In this section, since we are studying a problem in which each

agency has a single target variable, we make the alternative assumption

that each agency reacts directly to the observed value of the variable,

making the policy change that would be best if its multiplier estimates

were correct. Since its policy reaction line always runs through the

optimum point (y = 0, x =       0),   and the slopes are functions of the

multipliers, we are in effect assuming that the discrepancies are viewed

as shifting the perceived constant terms in equations (12) and (13).

       Under Assignment Rule I, the central bank and fiscal authority,

respectively, react according to


(28)                                  Lm= ——y

model that determines y and x, we obtain the system

By substituting into equations (12) and (13) we obtain a system, with

roots that can be solved for in the same way.

       We took the approach of using the multiplier estimates from Table

4, in simulations of the two policy makers alternating turns, to find

out the number of steps needed for convergence in addition to the answer

as to whether the system converges at all. Table 7 reports the results

for all 216 possible combinations of the 6 models. Each of the 6 panels

represents one true model. Within each panel are 36 cells representing

the possible combinations of models subscribed to by the two policy

makers. Within each cell is reported, first, convergence under Rule 1

(a "1.' if the system is stable, followed by the number of steps required

for convergence), and then convergence under Rule II (a 2" for

stability, followed by the steps to convergence).

       Consider the case when the true model is the MCM. If the central

bank subscribes to the MCM, EPA or VAR, the system is stable only under

Rule 1, and otherwise it is stable only under Rule II, with the added

result that it is often unstable under either rule if the central bank

subscribes to the OECD or LINK models, and is always unstable if the
