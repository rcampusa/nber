                                         ABSTRACT

In this study, we empirically test “quiet life hypothesis,” which predicts that managers who are
subject to weak monitoring from the shareholders avoid making difficult decisions such as risky
investment and business restructuring with Japanese firm data. We employ cross-shareholder and
stable shareholder ownership as the proxy variables of the strength of a manager’s defense
against market disciplinary power. We examine the effect of the proxy variables on manager-
enacted corporate behaviors and the results indicate that entrenched managers who are insulated
from disciplinary power of stock market avoid making difficult decisions such as large
investments and business restructures. However, when managers are closely monitored by
institutional investors and independent directors, they tend to be active in making difficult
decisions. Taken together, our results are consistent with managerial quiet life hypothesis.

1. Introduction


     For decades, Japan has suffered from low corporate profitability, low economic growth, and
poor stock market performance. Despite unprecedented and prolonged monetary policy meant to
boost the economy, capital investments in the corporate sector have remained stagnant. Some have
attributed the low profitability of Japanese firms to their failure to restructure and their aversion to
risk (which, in turn, has suppressed innovation). The failure of firms to restructure and innovate
may be related to the fact that managers’ interests may not always coincide with shareholders’
interests. That is, managers may make decisions to maximize their own utility rather than maximize
shareholders’ wealth. For instance, managers may overinvest to grow a firm’s size and increase
their own private benefits. Given this problem, corporate governance may be useful for mitigating
the conflict of the interest between managers and shareholders. To this end, some studies have
suggested that corporate governance can assuage problems related to free cash flow/overinvestment
(Jensen, 1986; Gompers et al., 2003; Harford, 1999). Interestingly, underinvestment on the part of
managers has gone largely unexplored. This is likely because costs associated with under
investment are relatively difficult to identify 1.
    Hicks (1935) argued that managers of monopolistic enterprises that are insulated from
competition in the product market may not be motivated to adequately enact their managerial
duties; shirking their responsibilities increases their own utility. Hicks (1935) dubbed this practice
the “quiet life.” In other words, Hicks argued that when discipline from the product market is not
sufficiently punitive, managers avoid difficult decisions and exert less effort. Hart (1983) also
contended that discipline from the product market reduces managerial slack. Scharfstein (1988) and
Schmidt (1997) came to similar conclusions.
    This line of research was limited in its exclusive focus on discipline from the product market,
but the quiet life hypothesis also includes discipline from the capital market (see Giroud and
Mueller, 2010). This work shows that managers avoid making difficult decisions not only in
companies protected from discipline from the product market, but also in companies that are
protected from hostile takeovers or, more broadly, pressure from unfriendly shareholders. Bertrand
and Mullainathan (2003) performed a critical study to empirically examine this extended version of
the quiet life hypothesis. In this study, they focused on the introduction of state anti-takeover laws,
which reduces the threat of a hostile takeover. More specifically, the authors used factory-level data
in the US to evaluate how the introduction of state laws affects the corporate decision-making.
Their results show that for companies with head offices located in the state where the anti-takeover

  In this paper, we define investment as an increase of real assets. It does not include a decrease in
real assets.

                                                     2
legislation was passed, rates of factory construction and closure decreased, employees’ wages
increased, and the firm’s financial performance suffered. These results were not consistent with the
free cash flow hypothesis, which predicts that managers seek to increase their own prestige by
maximizing firm size rather than shareholder value.
    The quiet life hypothesis essentially predicts that managers avoid making difficult decisions
when they are protected from the disciplinary effects of the capital market. Because increasing
investments (e.g., new facility development, acquisitions, R&D) requires substantial effort on the
part of managers, managers may decrease these investments, even if they are expected to increase
firm value. This forms the basis of the quiet life hypothesis—when insulated from disciplinary
effects of the capital market, managers often underinvest. Because many managers of Japanese
firms are protected from the disciplinary effects of the stock market through cross-shareholding, the
quiet life problem is cause for some concern. Despite the importance of the quiet life problem, there
has been no empirical study of underinvestment problem caused by Japanese firm managers who
entrenched themselves.
    It is also possible that the under-investment problem or failing to restructure their unprofitable
businesses can be explained by the career concern hypothesis (see Holmström, 1999). The career
concern hypothesis predicts that when managers face pressure from shareholders and have resultant
concern for their own careers, they avoid risky investments that may fail due to exogenous shocks.
Although it is rare for managers of Japanese firms to fail to get approval for their own director
nomination proposals in shareholder meetings, the increasing influence of foreign institutional
investors can raise these career-related concerns 2. Since friendly cross-shareholders reduce the
career-related concerns held by managers, a higher ratio of these shareholders is likely to increase
managers’ confidence in their job security, and will therefore lead to an increase in risky
investments. So, by examining the effects of cross-shareholding on corporate behaviors, it is
possible to simultaneously test these competing hypotheses.
    In this study, we examine the effects of cross-shareholding and stable shareholding on
corporate behaviors among companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 2004 to 2014.
Results of our analyses show that managers of companies characterized by a high proportion of
cross-shareholding and/or stable shareholding avoid making difficult decisions or risky choices
(e.g., large investments, restructuring). We also find that monitoring by institutional investors and
independent directors mitigates these effects. Our results are consistent with quiet life hypothesis,
but not with the career concern or free cash flow hypothesis. In addition, among the three
shareholder categories, zaibatsu group firms, industry group firms, and lender banks, which mainly


2
  In contrast, Aghion et al. (2013) found institutional investors reduce managers’ concerns about
their careers. However, collaboration between firm managers and institutional investors is rare in
Japan. As such, we do not expect the same results as Aghion et al. (2013) in the Japanese context.

                                                  3
constitute cross-shareholding, none of one specific group dominates the observed negative effects
on corporate investments and restructuring behavior. At most we can tell is that industry group
shareholders tend to impede M&A and restructuring behavior of the firms.
       To address the issues outlined above, we have organized this paper into a series of
interrelated sections. In the following section, we discuss the relatively recent phenomenon of
cross-shareholding in Japan. Then, in Section 3, we develop our hypotheses. In Section 4, we
describe the data and methods we employ to test the hypotheses. We present the results of these
analyses in Section 5. In Section 6, we report the results of robustness checks on our main results.
In Section 7, we report relation between composition of cross-shareholders and corporate behavior,
and we offer some concluding remarks in Section 8.


2. Cross-shareholding and stable shareholding


    When there is little threat of hostile takeover or shareholder intervention, firm managers are
free to make decisions that increase their own utility because they are unlikely to be replaced.
Related to this, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) explored the effects of a state anti-takeover law
in the American manufacturing industry from 1976 to 1995. They found that for companies with
head offices in states where anti-takeover laws were passed, there were decreases in factory
construction or closures, increases in worker wages, and worsened firm performance. Bertrand and
Mullainathan’s (2003) results are consistent with the quiet life hypothesis; they indicate that the
introduction of state anti-takeover laws resulted in a situation of moral hazard for the managers of
companies located in those states.
    Cross-shareholding is a mechanism that weakens the threat of takeovers and shareholder
interventions. Because cross-shareholders are friendly to managers, they often refuse to sell their
shares to the hostile acquirer when a takeover does occur. This reduces the likelihood of the
takeover being successful.
    There is real-world evidence of cross-shareholding arrangements strengthening the defense
against hostile takeovers. When Mittal Steel acquired Arcerlor (a European steel company) in early
2006 via unsolicited bid, Nippon Steel—the largest steel company in Japan—recognized the
possibility that Mittal may next target it for acquisition. To defend against this possibility, Nippon
Steel increased its cross-shareholding arrangements with many business counterparties including
Sumitomo Metal Industries and Kobe Steel.
    In Japan, the “poison pill” was introduced in 2005. However, to enact a poison pill in Japan, it
is necessary for the general shareholder meeting to invoke its use. Therefore, if a company does not
have a sufficient number of friendly shareholders (i.e., cross-shareholders and stable shareholders),
the poison pill is unlikely to be enacted or effective (Tanaka, 2012).


                                                   4
      Given the limitations of a poison pill, cross-shareholding is a more effective measure for
thwarting hostile takeover attempts. This is why Nippon Steel enhanced its cross shareholding
arrangements besides adopting poison pill to itself also in 2006. Therefore, in this study, we use
the cross-shareholding ratio as a variable to measure the degree to which managers are subject to
disciplinary effects of the stock market. The quiet life hypothesis dictates that when a company has
a high cross-shareholding ratio, managers avoid making difficult business decisions.
      For the purposes of this study, we define cross-shareholding as an interlocking ownership
arrangement among related firms such as within zaibatsu (conglomerate-type corporate groups in
Japan) and industry groups (horizontal or vertical corporate group consist of business transaction
counterparts), and between lending banks and their borrowers. The concept of cross-shareholding
in Japan initially developed in the late 1960s as a means to deter foreign takeovers (Hoshi and
Kashyap, 2001) 3. To this end, cross-shareholding has been largely successful; its practice has
largely eliminated the possibility of hostile takeover of Japanese firms. Although attempts at hostile
takeover are relatively rare in Japan, cross-shareholding also protects managers from shareholder
activism and hostile block shareholders, particularly in shareholder meeting elections. Institutional
owners and proxy advisory firms have recently gained in influence, but friendly shareholders still
serve as a protective barrier for managers. Between 1997 and 2004, cross-shareholding declined as
a result of banks selling their shares during a banking crisis (Miyajima and Nitta, 2011).
Nevertheless, many firms still engage in cross-shareholding, and it still acts as a strong impediment
to the exertion of shareholder power.
      Stable shareholders, who retain blocks of a firm’s shares for a long period of time through
ongoing business relationships with the firm, play a similar role for managers as cross-shareholders.
In most cases, stable shareholders act as friendly shareholders for incumbent managers, though they
do not necessarily offer as much protection as cross-shareholders. Also distinct from
cross-shareholding, stable shareholding is difficult to identify externally because it is not
characterized by interlocking arrangements. So, although we analyze the effects of stable
shareholding in conjunction with cross-shareholding, our primary focus is on the effects of the
latter.
      It is important to note that there is potentially a positive association between ratio of friendly
shareholders (i.e. cross-shareholding and stable shareholding) and corporate investment. Long-term
commitments on the part of shareholders allow managers to consider the firm’s long-term strategy.
As part of this strategy, managers may make long-term investments without concern for their
careers. In addition, the protracted period of their relationship with the firm allows those long-term
shareholders to understand a firm’s condition better than other types of capital providers. As such,
they are likely to provide capital with lower costs in cases of financial distress (Hoshi et al., 1990,

3
    See p. 126 of Hoshi and Kashyap (2001) for details related to this.

                                                    5
1991).
  Whether those cross-shareholders or stable-shareholders have positive effects on corporate
investment and risk-taking through delegated monitoring or simply provide strong protection for
entrenched managers which should result in lower managerial effort is an empirical question.


3. Hypotheses


    When managers are not effectively monitored or subjected to discipline by shareholders, they
may make sub-optimal decisions with respect to firm value. Moreover, managers who are
entrenched in their positions, and are therefore shielded from takeovers or shareholder intervention,
may overinvest as a function of a free cash flow problem (Gompers et al., 2003; Harford, 1999;
Jensen, 1986) or underinvest due to a desire for a “quiet life” (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003).
Although both possibilities represent threats to efficient managerial decision-making, we focus on
Bertrand and Mullainathan’s (2003) quiet life hypothesis. We do so because of the frequent claim
that Japanese managers often fail to promote innovation through aggressive investment or promptly
restructure unprofitable businesses.
     According to the career concern hypothesis (Holmström, 1999), which theoretically predicts
underinvestment, it is possible that cross-shareholding yields different results than those predicted
by the quiet life hypothesis and free cash flow hypothesis. Aghion et al. (2013) reported that
pressure to earn short-term profits exerts pressure on CEOs to be risk-averse in their investment
decisions. However, institutional investors encourage CEOs to make riskier investments by
reducing the likelihood of their being fired if the investments should fail. In this way, the career
concern hypothesis predicts that cross-shareholding may protect management from being fired as
the result of a failed investment decision. Therefore, managers protected by cross-shareholdings are
likely to increase their risky investments (e.g., innovative R&D). This prediction is consistent with
the free cash flow hypothesis, although the increased investment under the free cash flow
hypothesis is not positive NPV investment.
     In summary, among the free cash flow hypothesis, the career concern hypothesis, and the quiet
life hypothesis, only the latter predicts that firms with a greater proportion of cross-shareholders
will reduce their risky investments.
     We further test the quiet life hypothesis by examining the effects of cross- and stable
shareholding on the frequency with which managers restructure unprofitable businesses. Both the
quiet life hypothesis and free cash flow hypothesis predict that protected managers will restructure
their businesses to a lesser degree than firms with unprotected managers. The quiet life hypothesis
contends that the failure to restructure is due to diminished managerial efforts; the free cash flow
hypothesis predicts it is due to a motivation to maximize firm size. The career concern hypothesis


                                                  6
offers no clear prediction on cross-shareholding restructuring efforts.
     In testing the relationship between cross- or stable shareholding and corporate investments, we
may find that firms invest more or less, but cannot assess if they over- or underinvest. Although
researchers often use the market-to-book ratio as a proxy for firm value, we will use it to control for
a firm’s investment opportunities. Because we cannot assess if a firm’s investments increase its
value, we will instead examine if cross- or stable shareholding is positively related to risk-taking.
John et al. (2008) used the standard deviation of industry-year adjusted ROA as a proxy for
risk-taking. In doing so, the authors showed that this proxy variable correlates positively with firm
growth rate. Therefore, we examine if cross- or stable shareholding results in lower risk taking by
managers. The quiet life hypothesis would predict that a firm’s ratio of cross- or stable shareholding
is inversely related to its risk-taking. In contrast, under the career concern hypothesis, higher
risk-taking is predicted as a result of the stronger protection for managers provided by the cross
shareholders. If our analyses reveal a negative relationship between cross- or stable shareholding
and a firm’s investments and risk-taking, we interpret that as an indication that firms are operating
as predicted by the quiet life hypothesis.
     Given the above, we can test three hypotheses by examining cross- or stable shareholding and
firm behaviors. To make our argument clear, we develop our testable hypotheses focusing on quiet
life hypothesis, by developing specific testable predictions related to the quiet life hypothesis.
    Although there are several outcomes associated with the managerial phenomena we describe,
in this paper, we focus on investments and business restructuring. These two outcomes represent
the most difficult decisions that managers are likely to avoid.
    First, we predict that managers will decrease investments (even when they have positive net
present value) to reduce their managerial efforts. Although investments in fixed assets are essential
for growing their businesses in a product market, the implementation of a new project with large
capital expenditures requires substantial effort on the part of managers. Second, mergers and
acquisitions are also difficult decisions for managers; the integration of new businesses and
employees requires significant effort. Thus, the quiet life hypothesis dictates that managers are also
likely to seek to avoid M&A. Moreover, past researchers (e.g., Gompers et al., 2003; Harford,
1999) have treated capital expenditures and M&A as investments that maximize the firm’s size,
thereby increasing managers’ private benefits. If entrenched managers prioritize the maximization
of the firm’s size over “living the quiet life,” there should be a positive relationship between cross-
or stable shareholding and capital expenditures (or M&A). Third, R&D investments can also be
difficult decisions for managers, as they are often protracted and risky. In addition, Japanese
accounting standards dictate that R&D costs are recorded as expenses that negatively affect current
profits. Distinct from capital expenditures and M&A, making large R&D investments does not
increase firm size, and may not increase the manager’s prestige. Given this, the quiet life


                                                    7
hypothesis predicts that managers of companies characterized by substantial cross- and/or stable
shareholding are likely to avoid capital investments, M&A, and R&D expenditures. This tendency
should hold, even if these activities have high NPV. By avoiding these activities, these managers
are likely to underinvest.


         H1: When a company has a high cross- and/or stable shareholding ratio, that firm’s
         capital expenditures, M&A investments, and R&D expenses are low.


     Next, we consider business withdrawal activities. Business withdrawal activities require
substantial managerial effort including the renegotiation of relationships with clients or adjusted
treatment of employees. Business withdrawals are typically regarded as failures; they leave
managers exposed to criticism from shareholders, employees, and the news media. Given this, the
quiet life hypothesis predicts that even if a business is not profitable for years, if that company has
a high ratio of cross- or stable shareholders, its managers will week to avoid decisions related to
business withdrawal.


         H2: When a company has high cross- or stable shareholding ratio, that firm will be
         unlikely to execute actions related to business withdrawal.


4.    Data and sample


     For the purposes of this paper, we constructed a panel dataset using data from non-financial
companies that were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 2004 to 2014 4. All financial data
were obtained from the Nikkei NEEDS Financial Quest database. We obtained data related to the
adoption of stock options, ownership structure, and outside director ratios from the Nikkei
NEEDS-Cges Database. We used the RECOF M&A database to determine the dollar value of
M&A-related investments. All databases from which we collected data are the most reliable ones in
Japan and frequently used by researchers and practitioners in Japan.


     The Nikkei NEEDS-Cges database labels an ownership structure as cross-shareholding if (a)
two firms mutually hold at least 1% of each other’s outstanding shares, or (b) one of the firms is
one of the ten largest shareholders of the other firm (even if ownership is less than 1%) 5. Stable
shareholding is defined by ownership categories. The Nikkei NEEDS-Cges Database calculates the

4
   The sample included listed firms on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers, but does not included
listed firms from the JASDAQ.
5 The NLF Research institute reports that even when it includes less than 1% but within the largest

30 shareholders, the cross-shareholding ratio increases by only 2%.

                                                   8
stable shareholder ratio using the following formula;


Stable shareholding = Cross-shareholders + financial institutions (property accounts) +
nonfinancial corporate owners + parent company ownership + director ownership + employee
ownership + treasure shares + corporate shareholding of more than 3% of outstanding shares.


In this analysis, however, we exclude cross-shareholders from the stable shareholder ratio to
analyze the effect of the two separately. We also exclude director ownership in calculating the
stable shareholding ratio. Although most stable shareholders are friendly to incumbent managers,
the relationships between stable shareholders and the firm are less clear than the relationships
between cross-shareholders and the firm. This is due to a lack of interlocking ownership. Although
interlocking shareholding relationships are based on formal agreements in many cases, they can
also be based on implicit contracts. In this paper, we focus more directly on cross-shareholding,
which is based on intentional arrangements between managers of two firms; stable shareholding
often lacks any mutual obligations on the part of the firms involved.
    More specifically, we examine the effects of ownership structure three variables related to
corporate investments. These variables are:


  CAPEX: Capital expenditure / Total Assets;
  M&A: Annual M&A investments / Total Assets;
  R&D: R&D expenses / Total Assets.


We also explore the effects of ownership on two variables related to corporate restructuring. These
variables are:


  Sub dummy: A dummy variable that indicates whether a firm sells subsidiaries in a given fiscal
year (1 = yes, 0 = no). To make this determination, we identified divesture of the subsidiaries in the
firm’s cash flow statement;
  Reducing Seg dummy: A dummy variable that indicates whether a firm reduces the number of
reported business segments in which it is involved relative to the previous year (1 = yes, 0 = no). In
our analysis of this variable, we excluded firms that reported being involved in only one business
segment.


    Table 1 provides a synopsis of all variable definitions and descriptive statistics. These data
show that the maximum value of the director ownership ratio is quite large. This is due to a stock
split during the accounting period. To avoid bias in our results, we excluded these outliers from our

       Table 2 shows the correlations between the variables used in the following regression analyses.
Only the relationship between total assets and institutional investor ownership showed a correlation
higher than 0.4. However, the key results of our regression analyses did not change when we did
not include firm size among the control variables.
       Cross-shareholding and stable shareholder shareholding are negatively correlated (-0.26),
suggesting that these two types of ownership may exert complementary effects. Although stable
shareholding and institutional ownership are negatively correlated (-0.315), cross-shareholding and
institutional ownership are not significantly related. This indicates that firms with high
cross-shareholding ratios and firms characterized by substantial institutional ownership are not
patently different.

  We excluded two firms from the sample for which the director ownership ratio exceeded 1
(100%).

                                                             10
        Miyajima and Nitta (2011) reported that cross-shareholding among Japanese firms decreased
between 1997 and 2004 due to lender banks selling shares during the banking crisis. If banks
primarily sell shares of profitable firms, the remaining cross-shareholders would be clustered in
poor-performing firms. In that case, cross-shareholding cannot, in and of itself, be considered the
sole impetus behind any possible effect on corporate behaviors of such firms. However, neither
cross-shareholder ownership nor stable shareholder ownership are strongly correlated with ROA.
This result is inconsistent with the notion that firms with high cross-shareholding ratios between
2004 and 2014 are concentrated in the poor performers. In contrast, cross-shareholder ownership is
negatively correlated with market to book ratio (-0.179), implying that cross-shareholding is
associated with lower valuation by the stock market and/or diminished future growth.
        Although the cash ratio is negative correlated with cross-shareholding (-0.248),
cross-shareholder ownership and leverage are not negatively related. Thus, we do not consider
firms with a high degree of cross-shareholding to be financially constrained. In the regression
analyses in the following section, we control for both cash ratio and leverage.

        Figure 1 illustrates the time series variation in cross-shareholder and stable shareholder
ownership between 2004 and 2014. Stable ownership increased from 2004 to 2005, but this is due
to change in the data provider’s definition of stable shareholding. Specifically, from 2005 forward,
the Nikkei NEEDS-Cges Database included treasure shares and corporate shareholding of more


                                                                                         11
than 3% of the outstanding shares among stable shareholders. Given this definitional anomaly, we
excluded FY 2004 from our analyses that include stable shareholding as a predictor. Barring that
one outlying year, neither type of shareholding changed much in the time period of focus. This
result also holds at the individual-firm level. The mean and median change in yearly
cross-shareholding was only -0.06% and 0.00% respectively, indicating that both types of
shareholders are essentially constant. In addition, although cross-shareholding decreased from 1997
to 2004 (Miyajima and Nitta, 2011), Japanese firms seemed to maintain interlocking relationships
in the subsequent period. Thus, any possible effect of cross-shareholding and stable shareholding
on corporate management and behaviors is a topic of current import.

5. Empirical Results
5.1 Empirical approach
      To test the hypotheses developed in Section 3, we performed random-effects panel regression
analyses. Similar to studies that have used corporate governance indexes as data, we did not use a
firm fixed-effects model because cross-shareholding and stable shareholding did not change to a
large extent over time. Inclusion of firm fixed effects would force the identification of the
cross-shareholding coefficient from only small changes 7. Therefore, we performed our analyses
with a focus on the effects of ownership structure across firms rather than within firms.
      In our regression analyses, we clustered standard errors by firm to adjust for cross-sectional

7
    See the Section 3-C of Gompers et al. (2003).

                                                        12
heteroskedasticity and within-firm serial correlation of error terms. As a robustness check, we also
employed propensity score matching to compare of treatment and control firms and the two-staged
least squares method.
     In the next section, we describe our multivariate regression analyses comprised of the
variables. When the dependent variable is a dummy, we employ a random-effects probit regression.
First, we analyze the model which includes only the cross-shareholding ratio and control variables
as predictors. We then add stable shareholding to the model as an independent variable. In both
models, we include the following variables as controls: the market-to-book ratio (MtoB; to control
for firms’ investment opportunities), the cash ratio (Cash; to control for financial constraints), the
natural logarithm of total assets (LnAssets), the leverage ratio (Lev), ROA, the industry dummy
variables, and the year dummy variables. We lagged all explanatory variables for one year from the
point of analyses, and removed all outlying variables from the analysis. We also excluded
market-to-book ratios that were negative in sign. Industry dummy should partially control degree of
competition in respective product markets. By controlling this with the dummy variable, we expect
to also control disciplinary effect to management of the sample firms from competition in its
product market in certain extent.


5.2 Effects of cross- and stable shareholding on investments and business restructuring


    We first tested Hypothesis 1 by examining whether cross-shareholding and/or stable
shareholder ownership exerts negative effects on investments and restructuring. To test these
relationships, we tested separately regressed capital expenditures (CAPEX), M&A, and R&D on
corporate investments. We standardized all variables by the firm’s total assets at the previous fiscal
year’s end. The results of this regression analysis are shown in Table 3.

     Consistent with Hypothesis 1, our results show that cross-shareholding and stable shareholding
are significantly and negatively related to capital expenditures and R&D. The regression model
testing the effect of ownership structure on M&A produces mixed results; cross-shareholding is
significantly and negatively related to M&A, but stable shareholding has no significant relationship.
Taken together, these results produce support for H1, at least in relation to cross-shareholding. This
suggests that managers who are protected from the threat of hostile takeovers and other shareholder


                                                               14
pressure by cross-shareholders tend to invest less than those that are not.
    Our results further show that the market-to-book ratio is significantly and positively associated
with capital expenditures and M&A. Interestingly, the market-to-book ratio is significantly and
negatively related to R&D. This contradictory result may suggest that firms perform more R&D to
prompt innovation when that firm has limited opportunities for growth.
    The results of our analyses illustrate that respective decreases in cross-shareholding and stable
shareholding by 8% and 19% (one standard deviation of the respective ratio) increases total
investments by an amount equivalent to 0.7% of total assets. This effect is considerable, given that
the average ratio of capital expenditures to total assets is 4.2% (see Table 1).
    In summary, these results are consistent with the quiet life hypothesis for entrenched managers,
but not with the free cash flow hypothesis or career concern hypothesis. Stable shareholding has
largely similar effects as cross-shareholding, though the magnitude of the effects associated with
the former are slightly weaker than those of the latter.
    We next analyzed the effects of cross-shareholding and stable shareholding on a firm’s
restructuring activities. To evaluate this relationship, we constructed two dependent variables. The
first is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 when the firm divests its subsidiaries in a given
fiscal year and 0 otherwise (i.e., sub dummy). The other is a dummy variable that takes the value of
1 if a firm reduces the number of its business segments in the given fiscal year and 0 otherwise (i.e.,
reducing seg dummy). To evaluate the regressions with these dummy dependent variables, we used
a random-effects probit model. The results of these analyses are outlined in Table 4.

Sub dummy is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if a company sells its subsidiary (which changes scope of
consolidation), and 0 otherwise; and Reducing Seg dummy is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if a company with
multiple segments reduces the number of segments in which it operates, and 0 otherwise. Cross is the ratio of the
number of cross-held shares to the number of outstanding shares; Stable.exc.Cross is the ratio of the number of shares
held by stable shareholders except for cross-shareholders and directors to the number of outstanding shares; MtoB is

     Table 4 shows that both cross- and stable shareholding have significant and negative
relationships with restructuring activities. Once again, cross-shareholding has stronger effects than
stable shareholding (see the t-statistics associated with the coefficients). These results are consistent
with H2; managers who are protected by cross-shareholders and stable shareholders are less likely
to engage in restructuring activities.
     Researchers and policy makers often comment that since the 1970s, non-manufacturing firms
in Japan have been less productive than manufacturing firms (Fukao, 2010). Although many large,
Japanese manufacturing firms (e.g., automobile manufacturers, electronics firms) are competitive


                                                             16
globally, most large Japanese non-manufacturing firms operate primarily within the domestic
market. Because many sectors of Japanese service market are dominated by domestic firms,
managers of these non-manufacturing firms tend to have greater opportunity to pursue the “quiet
life” (e.g., avoid investing and restructuring) than their counterparts in manufacturing firms. Given
these differences, it is possible that cross-shareholding may affect investment and restructuring
activities for manufacturing firms differently than for non-manufacturing firms. To check for this
possibility, we repeated our regression analyses (see Tables 3 and 4) after splitting our data into
subsamples of manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms. See Table 5 for the results of this
analysis.

    These results show that cross-shareholding is significantly and negatively associated with all
outcomes except for M&A among non-manufacturing firms. The effects associated with stable
shareholding are more mixed (likely due to a smaller sample size). Among manufacturing firms,
stable shareholding is significantly and negatively related to R&D and the reduction of business
segments. Among non-manufacturing firms, stable shareholding is significantly and negatively
related to capital expenditures and R&D expenses.
    Taken together, these results indicate that the negative effects of cross-shareholding on
investments and business restructures are common in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing
firms.
    An interesting question emerges from these results is if the negative effects of
cross-shareholding on firm investments and restructuring activities is consistent in times of
economic expansion and depression. To answer to this question, we included a term in the
regression that represents the interaction between GDP growth and cross-shareholding. After
including this interaction term, we found that the main effect of cross-holding remained
significantly and negatively related to all outcomes, but the interaction term was significant (and
negative) only for capital expenditures 8 . This result suggests that the negative influence of
cross-shareholding on firm investments and restructuring occurs during both economic expansion
and depression. However, because we only analyzed an eleven-year period in this study, analyses of
longer periods of time may produce different results. This is one limitation of our study.


5.3 Cross- shareholding and risk taking


    Although we found consistent evidences to support H1, because our analyses do not allow us to
identify a firm’s optimal investment level, the results presented thus far are not sufficient to
definitively conclude that managers protected by cross-shareholding and stable shareholding
under-invest. Accordingly, we measured a firm’s tendency to take risks by industry-year adjusted
standard deviation of ROA over the previous decade 9. John et al. (2008) showed that this variable is
positively associated with a firm’s long-term growth. Managers often challenge projects that realize
innovation and long-term growth, as these projects often result in higher volatility and uncertain
future profitability of the firm. If there is a negative relationship between cross-shareholding and a
firm’s tendency to engage in risk-taking, a negative coefficient accompanying the variables for

8 For the sake of parsimony, we did not include this figure in the table.
9 We first subtracted the industry-year matching average ROA from the firm’s ROA.
This yields an industry-year adjusted ROA for each respective firm. We then calculated
the standard deviation for each firm-year of the last decade (if data for more than five
years of ROA are available). Although it is impossible to directly observe how
companies take risks, the performance of high-risk projects should result in a large
distribution of ROA.

cross- and stable shareholding would indicate that the firm under-invests. Thus, we test if
companies with high cross- and stable shareholding ratios take fewer risks to confirm the presented
supporting evidences for H1 indicate under-investment by the firms. The results of the regression
analysis testing this are outlined in Table 6.

    The regression results show that the coefficients for cross-shareholding (in the analyses for the
entire sample and all manufacturing and non-manufacturing firm subsamples) are significant and
negative. Stable shareholding is negatively related to salient outcomes, but not significantly so for
the non-manufacturing sub-sample. These results provide strong support for H1 relating to cross
shareholders, though partial support relating to stable shareholders.
    Taken together, the results presented in Tables 3-6 indicate that firms with higher
cross-shareholding ratios invest less and engage in less restructuring than firms with lower
cross-shareholding ratios. In addition, firms with high cross-shareholding ratios tend to take fewer
risks, which may hinder a firm’s future growth. These results collectively support H1 and H2.
    Although ownership by cross shareholders tends to be lower than ownership by stable
shareholders as shown in Table 1, cross shareholding ratio shows stronger negative effects on both
investments and restructurings. This might be due to stronger relationship between the firms which
have cross shareholding arrangements each other. Thus, we focus on cross shareholding in the
additional analyses presented in the following sections.


5.4 Corporate governance and the quiet life problem


    Because the quiet life problem is a form of agency problem, effective corporate governance
should mitigate the negative effects of cross-shareholding on investments and restructuring actions.
When managers pursue the quiet life under the protection of cross-shareholders, other mechanisms
of governance may preclude them from reducing their efforts. In this section, we examine whether
corporate governance measures make managers maintain high levels of effort.
    Investors can use their voting power at shareholders’ meetings to discipline managers.
Although individual investors with small stakes in the firm have little incentive to monitor and/or
discipline managers, institutional investors with large equity interests have the incentive and power
to do so. Thus, it is likely that institutional ownership is positively related to disciplinary measures
taken against managers that exert little effort in executing their responsibilities. Miyajima and Hoda
(2015) reported that firm ownership by institutional investors had positive effects on corporate
value and ROA, suggesting that institutional investors do exert some disciplinary pressure on
managers. This can be illustrated by recent cases in which institutional investors have come to
monitor managers more closely. Since the early 2000s, some activist hedge funds have begun to
influence managerial decisions. Similarly, the influence exerted by proxy advisory firms (backed by
institutional investors) has also increased in the form of intensified corporate governance. Although
the quiet life hypothesis predicts that managers will exert less effort when protected by
cross-shareholders and stable shareholders, institutional investor ownership may mitigate the
strength of this relationship.


                                                   21
    Outside directors also monitor firm managers. In the 2000s, an increasing number of firms
employed independent directors to monitor and advise firm managers. These independent directors
were allowed to participate in board meetings and obtain inside information related to the company.
Given their access to the firm and salient information, they could monitor managers more
effectively than shareholders. Related to this, Dahya and McConnell (2007) performed a study
based on the UK’s Cadbury Report. This report recommended at least three outside directors on a
firm’s board. Through their analysis, Dahya and McConnell (2007) found that, if a company
increased the number of outside directors to comply the recommendation, ROA of the firm
improved significantly. Saito (2011) similarly analyzed the effect of the introduction of outside
directors on corporate performance in Japan. He reported that companies that introduced outside
directors between 1997 and 2008 experienced significant increases in their ROA within a year.
These studies suggest that outside directors effectively discipline managers. As suggested by Dahya
et al. (2008), outside directors sent from a parent firm do not necessarily monitor managers in a
way to benefit minority shareholders. Given this caveat, we excluded outside directors who
represent their parent company and lending banks when calculating the independent director ratio.
    Aligning shareholders’ and managers’ profits can also be an effective method of corporate
governance meant to circumvent the aforementioned agency problem. As such, we use two
variables to capture this alignment—director ownership and a stock-option dummy variable (1 if
firm provides stock options for managers, 0 otherwise). According to Jensen and Meckling (1976),
director ownership is key in mitigating the agency problem associated with managers seeking the
quiet life. In this vein, Teshima (2004) found a positive relationship between director ownership
and the Tobin’s q of companies listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
    In this study, we consider the director ownership ratio to be a measurement of managerial
incentive. If the ratio is high and managers hold stock options, those managers are likely to act in
accordance with shareholder interests, thereby mitigating the quiet life problem due to
cross-shareholding ownership. Table 7 provides the results of this analysis.

    The positive and significant coefficients for interaction terms (cross-shareholding ×
institutional ownership) in the regression models on capital expenditures, M&A, and divesture
indicate that greater institutional ownership significantly mitigates the negative effects of cross
shareholding on these three behaviors. Our results similarly demonstrate that a firm’s independent
director ratio mitigates the negative effect of cross-shareholding on a firm’s capital expenditures
and R&D, as well as a manager’s tendency to reduce the number of business segments in which a
firm operates. However, stock options only mitigate the negative effect of cross-shareholding on
M&A. Director ownership had no significant effect on how cross-shareholding influences these
outcomes.
    In sum, our results indicate that as a form of corporate governance, monitoring by institutional
investors and independent directors significantly mitigates the negative effect of managers’ pursuit
of the quiet life on multiple outcomes. This is consistent with the original quiet life hypothesis,
which predicts that managers who do not face discipline as a result of their actions are likely to
avoid making difficult decisions that may upset a firm’s status quo.


6. Robustness tests


    Although the results presented above are consistent with H1 and H2, because our results
depend on the linear regression models, there is a potential misspecification problem.     In addition,
we did not include a firm fixed effect in the regression models, it is still possible that our presented
results are driven by unobservable time invariant factors that correlate with cross shareholding. It is
possible that better-performing firms had already resolved any problems related to interlocking
shareholding arrangements. In this case, firms characterized by a high proportion of
cross-shareholders may cluster as poor-performing firms. Although we included both the
market-to-book ratio and ROA as predictors in the models to avoid this possibility, we also
performed two robustness tests to address potential problems associated with endogeneity. To
address above two potential issues, we conduct two robustness tests; the first is a propensity score
matching test; in the second, we employed a two-stage least squares (2SLS) method with an
instrumental variable.
    In the propensity score matching test, we first divided sample firms into tertiles for each year
by cross shareholding ratio. We then used the propensity score matching method to select control
firms for the first tertile—which is comprised of firms with the highest cross-shareholding
ratio—from the second and third tertile firms. In performing the propensity score matching analysis,
we used the same control variables as those outlined in Table 3, and chose the nearest-matching
firm as the control firm. Using this method, we selected control firms with similar characteristics as
the treatment firms. Table 8 shows the results of mean- and median-difference tests that compare


                                                   24
the treatment firms (first tertile) and their corresponding control firms.

The propensity scores are calculated using an estimated logit model in which the dependent variable is a dummy
variable that is equal to 1 if a firm can be classified among the treatment firms, and 0 otherwise; the independent
variables in the model are MtoB, Cash, Lev, LnAssets, ROA, and Industry fixed effects, all of which are lagged by
one year. MtoB is the ratio of stock market capitalization to net assets; Cash is the ratio of the sum of cash and
short-term securities to total assets; Lev is the ratio of interest-bearing debt to total assets; LnAssets is the natural
logarithm of total assets; and ROA is the ratio of operating cash flow to total assets. CAPEX is the ratio of capital
expenditures to total assets; M&A is the ratio of the value of M&A transactions to total assets; R&D is the ratio of
research and development expenses to total assets; and Risk-taking is the standard deviation of industry-year adjusted
ROA for the past 10 years (ROA is calculated by using operating profit). We respectively report t-statistics and
z-statistics for t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. ***, **, * are significance levels at 1%, 5%, and 10%,
respectively.


      Table 8 shows that all three investment metrics (CAPEX, M&A, and R&D), as well as
risk-taking, were significantly lower among treatment firms relative to control firms. In addition,
although we do not show in the table, both the Sub dummy and Reducing Seg dummy associated
with the treatment firms were lower than in their control firms in McNemar’s chi-squared tests
(McNemar’s chi-squared test, p < 0.01 and 0.10, respectively). As such, these robustness tests
provide further support for H1 and H2.
     Second, in the 2SLS tests, we used firm age as an instrumental variable. Hoshi and Kashyap
(2001, p. 126) reported that cross-shareholding, as a practice, originated in the 1960s, and declined
between 1997 and 2004 (see Miyajima and Nitta, 2011). These historical trends suggest that
cross-shareholding was essentially a 20th century practice. As such, firm age should be intrinsically
related to the cross-shareholding ratio. In our data, the correlation between cross-shareholding and
the natural logarithm of firm age is 0.30; the correlation between cross-shareholding and ROA is
only -0.04. In the first stage regression, we used the same control variables as those listed in Table 3.
The coefficient associated with the natural logarithm of firm age is 0.032 (t = 37.80). The F-statistic
for the overall model is 129.264. Table 9 summarizes the results of the second-stage regression
results 10.

  In the 2SLS analysis, we used linear probability models for the equations predicting the Sub
dummy and Reducing Seg dummy.

     In Table 9, Cross represents the figure estimated from the first stage regression. The
coefficients associated with Cross are significant (p < 0.01) and negative, except for the model
predicting the M&A ratio. The results further confirm the results outlined in Tables 3, 4, and 6. That
is, a greater degree of cross-shareholding results in lower capital expenditures, lower R&D
investments, fewer restructuring actions, and less risk-taking. These results provide further support
for H1 and H2.

7. Cross-shareholder composition and firm behavior


     The above results show that when the cross-shareholding ratio of a firm is high, the
management tends to avoid difficult decisions and enjoys quiet life. Here, one aspect we should pay
attention to is that unlike institutional shareholding, cross-shareholding and stable shareholding do
not point to a specific shareholder category. They can be broadly divided into three shareholder
groups. The first group includes companies which are members of a zaibatsu, a Japanese
conglomerate corporate group led by a large bank or a large trading firm. The second group
includes non-financial companies in close business relationship with each other. This second group
overlaps with the horizontal or vertical corporate group called keiretsu to a certain extent. The third
one includes lender banks. It is widely observed in Japan that banks hold at most 5% share of their
listed borrower firms, owing to the restriction of Japanese antitrust law. Essentially, the purposes of
shareholding by the three categories are not pure investment. Their shareholding should provide
some other benefits to them than investment returns, such as takeover defense of themselves and/or
better terms and conditions in business transactions with the firm.
     Meanwhile, the purposes of ownership of these three categories of shareholders might differ
from each other. Among zaibatsu group firms, while the ultimate purpose of cross-shareholding is
to have a takeover defense measure for themselves, each group firm also monitors the other through
the zaibatsu group’s CEO association, which is called “Shacho-kai,” to maintain goodwill of the
group. For this reason, zaibatsu has often played an important role in M&A and corporate
rehabilitation procedures of group firms which faced financial difficulties. On the other hand,
cross-shareholding among firms which have close business relations has often insisted by managers
that it works as a proof of mutual trust relationship and is essential to transfer technology and
develop strategic alliances among them 11. Lender banks have exercised monitoring and voicing on
borrower firms not only as creditors but also as shareholders, particularly during financial
difficulties of the borrower firms. At least, it seems these cross-shareholders have played a
monitoring role on management of counterparties to a certain extent (Hoshi, et al. 1990, 1992).
     As such, although the main purpose of cross-shareholding is always to provide managers with
protection against disciplinary effects of the stock market, each of the three shareholder categories
might have more or less different motivations to initiate and maintain interlocking shareholding
relations 12. Thus, whether these three categories of cross-shareholders have the same effects on
corporate behavior depends on the relative magnitude of the positive and negative effects from the

respective shareholdings. Therefore, in this section, we will attempt to clarify if there is a difference
in the effects from different types of cross-shareholders.
     For this analysis, it is necessary to identify the shareholders with whom each firm has
cross-shareholding arrangements. However, Nikkei Cges, the database we use to collect the
cross-shareholding ratio, or the companies themselves, does not disclose such information.
Therefore, we estimated the composition of cross-shareholders of each firm through the following
process.
     First, among the companies categorized in the third tertile regarding cross-shareholding ratio
as of the year 2004 prepared for the propensity score matching analysis shown in Section 6 (group
of firms that have the highest cross-shareholding among the entire sample), we select the top five
companies in sales as of the year 2004 in each industry based on the Nikkei industry classification.
For some industries, we could not extract five firms since these industries have less than five listed
firms categorized in the third tertile. In such cases, we included all the third tertile firms in those
industries in the sample. Accordingly, we have 144 companies in the samples. Since our interest
here is to test if different categories of cross-shareholders have different effects on the firm
management, we focus on the analysis of companies with high cross-shareholding ratio and having
important economic impacts on each industry.
     Second, based on the data provided by Toyo Keizai Shimposha (2001), we divide the selected
companies into the constituent companies of the Six Major Zaibatsu Groups and other companies.
The Six Major Zaibatsu Groups refer to the six corporate groups of Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo,
Daiichi Kangyou, Sanwa, and Fuyo. The groups have a particularly long history among Japanese
corporate groups, and maintain strong unity as a conglomerate-type corporate group through
cross-shareholding and the CEO association. Companies categorized as Zaibatsu firms account for
35.4% of the selected firms.
     Third, we categorize the largest ten shareholders of each sample firm, information on which is
disclosed annually, into four categories: Zaibatsu group, Industry group, Bank, and others.
Regarding the firms belonging to one of the Six Major Zaibatsu Groups, corporate shareholders
which belong to the same zaibatsu group are categorized in the Zaibatsu group. Other Japanese
corporate shareholders, excluding founding family firms, are categorized in the Industry group.
Banking shareholders are categorized in Bank, regardless of whether the bank belongs to the same
zaibatsu group. This categorization should be appropriate in the analyzed period, which includes
the post-banking crisis period in Japan when banks prioritized own capital adequacy and their own
interest as creditors first. As for sample firms which do not belong to any of the Six Major Zaibatsu
Groups, all their Japanese corporate shareholders excluding founding family firms are classified in
the Industry group, and their banking shareholders are categorized in Bank. However, in the cases
that a corporate shareholder holds more than 15% of the shares of a sample firm, and we cannot


                                                   28
find interlocking-shareholding relationship between the two firms based on the top 10 shareholder
lists of the firms, we excluded the corporate shareholder from either the Zaibatsu group or Industry
group, since the aim of such large shareholding is usually related to control of the firm, which
should have a different economic implication from that of cross-shareholding. The category of
others mainly consist of institutional investors, foreign owners, individuals, and employee stock
ownership plans. We assume that these shareholders do not to compose cross-shareholding from
their characteristics.
     Based on the above processes, we categorized 15.3% in the mean level and 13.8% in the
median level of shareholders into one of the first three shareholder categories. Since
cross-shareholding of the sample firms is 17.6% in the mean level and 15.5% in the median level,
we can say that we could trace and categorize a large portion of cross-shareholders into the first
three categories. The mean ownership ratio categorized into the Zaibatsu group is 3.0%, that into
the Industry group is 5.2%, and that into the Bank is 7.0%. Thus, the largest shareholders
constituting cross-shareholding are lender banks. The Zaibatsu group’s ownership is relatively low,
but the ratio excludes a bank’s holding even when the bank belongs to the same Zaibatsu group as
the firm.
     In order to verify whether there is a difference in the effect of each of the three shareholder
categories, we conduct the same analyses shown in Tables 3 and 4 by replacing cross- and
stable-shareholding ratios in the explanatory variables with the ownership ratio of the three
shareholder categories, Zaibatsu group, Industry group, and Bank.
     Table 10 shows the results of regressions of which the dependent variables are the three
investment behavior variables and two restructuring behavior variables. Among the three
shareholder categories, the Industry group solely shows negative effects for all the dependent
variables for both investment behavior and restructuring, although it is statistically significant only
for M&A and Reducing Seg dummy. On the other hand, Bank does not show statistically
significant effects for any of the dependent variables. The Zaibatsu group has a statistically
negative effect on R&D, but has positive, not statistically significant, coefficients for CAPEX,
M&A, and Reducing Seg dummy. These results indicate that the Industry group has rather
prominent negative effects which are similar to those of cross-shareholding ratio.
     However, we should note that these results do not indicate that the Zaibatsu group and Bank
do not have negative effects on investment and restructuring behavior. The results only indicate that
their respective effects do not significantly differ from those of other cross-shareholders in most
aspects. In addition, although the respective effects of the three shareholder categories shown in
Table 10 are overall less obvious than those of cross-shareholding shown in Tables 3 and 4, this is
not surprising since the sample is limited to the largest tertile of the cross-shareholding ratio.

      In summary, among the three shareholder categories that constitute cross-shareholding, none
of one specific group dominates the observed negative effects from cross-shareholding on corporate
investments and restructuring behavior. At most we can tell from the results in Table 10 is that the


                                                               30
Industry group has a tendency to allow the managers to enjoy quiet life more significantly than the
other two shareholder categories. The firms categorized in the Industry group mainly have vertical
or horizontal business relationships with the sample firms. Those firms might have weak
motivation to require managers of the sample firms to conduct M&A and restructuring behaviors in
particular, which are likely to change existing business relationships.
     Historically, the Industry group is considered by business practitioners to have positive effects
on business. For example, cross-shareholding among Toyota Motor and its suppliers has been found
to enable mutual trust among them, which has been a key element for establishing their unique
just-in-time system. Toyota Motor seems to still believe in the positive effect since it recently
announced a cross-shareholding deal of approximately 50 billion JPY with Mazda, another
Japanese automotive manufacturer, to strengthen business relations of the two firms in 2017 13. Of
course, in some individual cases, cross-shareholding should contribute to competitiveness of the
firms. However, results in Table 10 indicated that this kind of relation is likely to impede firms
from making difficult decisions, on average. We can find an example consistent with the indication
also in the same automotive industry. Nissan, which faced business and financial difficulties in the
late 1990s, succeeded in significantly restoring the profit margin by nearly 10% from 1998 to 2003,
by conducting large-scale restructuring, including resolving cross-shareholding with most of its
suppliers and related companies and rearranging business relations with them under the strong
leadership of Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan from 1999. Cross-shareholding among industry group
firms seems to discourage their member firms to conduct M&A and restructuring, which is likely to
destroy familiar ways of business currently enjoyed by the group firms.


8. Conclusion


     In this paper, we have empirically examined the effects of cross-shareholding and stable
shareholding on corporate behaviors. Our results are consistent with the quiet life hypothesis
(Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003), which claims that managers who are protected from the
disciplinary effects of the capital market avoid making difficult business decisions and exert less
effort in the performance of their duties. Although cross-shareholding in Japan decreased between
1997 and 2004, contemporary cross-shareholding exerts negative effects on investments and the
frequency of restructuring activities among Japanese firms. These firms also engage in less
risk-taking, which may lead to reduced growth in the future.
     These results are not consistent with the free cash flow hypothesis (Gompers et al., 2003;


13Nihon Keizai Shimbun, morning paper, August 5th, 2017, “Toyota Motor and Mazda
announce to start mutual shareholding arrangement and cooperation in developing
EV.”

                                                  31
Harford, 1999; Jensen, 1986) which predicts that entrenched (i.e., protected) managers will
overinvest. This conclusion, combined with the test of the quiet life hypothesis, indicates that
managers will seek to maintain a peaceful status quo when protected by the umbrella of
cross-shareholding. In this way, cross-shareholding has substantial indirect costs. To illustrate,
Table 9 shows that relative to control firms, firms with the highest proportion of cross-shareholders
annually utilize 0.1% less of their total assets for capital goods, 0.1% less for M&A, and 0.3% less
for R&D. In total, firms characterized by substantial cross-shareholding use 0.5% less of their total
assets than control firms per year. This is a significant amount, considering that the mean of these
three investment types represents about 7% of the firm’s total assets (see Table 1).
    Our results also show that enhanced governance measures, including monitoring by
institutional investors and independent directors alleviate the costs of quiet life problem. Therefore,
policies which enhance monitoring mechanism for managers by outsiders may be useful to
encourage managerial risk-taking in Japanese firms where the quiet life problem may emerge.
