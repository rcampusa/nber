                                      ABSTRACT


        For over a century, economists and policy makers have debated the relative merits of bank-based

versus market-based financial systems. Recent research, however, argues that classifying countries as
bank-based or market is not a very fruitful way to distinguish financial systems. This paper represents the
first broad, cross-country examination of which view of financial structure is more consistent with the
data. The results indicate that although overall financial development is robustly linked with economic
growth, there is no support for either the bank-based or market-based view.

I.      Introduction

        This paper empirically assesses competing theoretical views on a century old policy debate: Are

bank-based or market-based financial systems better for promoting long-run economic growth? Since the

19th century, many economists have argued that bank-based systems are better at mobilizing savings,

identifying good investments, and exerting sound corporate control, particularly during the early stages of

economic development and in weak institutional environments. Others, however, emphasize the

advantages of markets in allocating capital, providing risk management tools, and mitigating the problems

associated with excessively powerful banks. Economists have constructed a vast number of theoretical

insights into the comparative advantages of different financial systems.1 Reflecting these schisms,

policymakers continue to struggle with the relative merits of bank-based versus market-based financial

systems in making policy decisions. Thus, the objective of this paper is to produce empirical evidence

that (1) distinguishes among competing theories and (2) helps policy makers design appropriate financial

sector reform strategies.

        Empirical research on the comparative merits of bank-based and market-based financial systems

has centered on Germany and Japan as bank-based systems and the United States and the United

Kingdom as market-based systems.2 This work has produced illuminating insights into the functioning of

these financial systems. Nonetheless, it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the long-run growth

effects of bank-based and market-based financial systems based on only four countries, especially four

countries that have very similar long-run growth rates. Although these countries together account for

over 50 percent of world output and although there are decades during which their growth rates diverged

substantially, broadening the analysis to a wider array of national experiences will provide greater

information on the bank-based versus market-based debate. Consequently, this paper constructs a new

dataset to investigate the relationship between economic growth and the degree to which countries are

bank-based or market-based.

        In conducting the first, broad cross-country study of financial structure and economic growth, this

paper provides empirical evidence on competing theories of financial structure. The bank-based view

highlights the positive role of banks in (i) acquiring information about firms and managers and thereby

improving capital allocation and corporate governance (Diamond, 1984; Ramakrishnan and Thakor,

1984), (ii) managing cross-sectional, intertemporal, and liquidity risk and thereby enhancing investment

efficiency and economic growth (Allen and Gale, 1999; Bencivenga and Smith, 1991), and (iii)

mobilizing capital to exploit economies of scale (Sirri and Tufano, 1995). The bank-based view also

stresses the shortcomings of market-based systems. Stiglitz (1985), for instance, argues that well-

developed markets quickly and publicly reveal information, which reduces the incentives for individual

investors to acquire information. Banks, however, mitigate this problem since they form long-run

relationships with firms and do not reveal information immediately in public markets (Boot, Greenbaum,

and Thakor, 1993). Also, Boot and Thakor (1997) argue that banks – as coordinated coalitions of

investors – are better than uncoordinated markets at monitoring firms and reducing post-lending moral

hazard (asset substitution). Proponents of the bank-based view also stress that liquid markets create a

myopic investor climate (Bhide 1993). In liquid markets, investors can inexpensively sell their shares, so

that they have fewer incentives to exert rigorous corporate control. Thus, according to the bank-base

view, greater market development may hinder corporate control and economic growth. Furthermore,

Gerschenkron (1962) and Rajan and Zingales (1998) stress that powerful banks can more effectively force

firms to re-pay their debts than atomistic markets, especially in countries with weak contract enforcement

capabilities. Without powerful banks to force repayment, therefore, external investors may be reluctant to

finance industrial expansion in countries with underdeveloped institutions. Thus, the bank-based view

holds that banks -- unhampered by regulatory restrictions on their activities -- can exploit scale economies

in information processing, ameliorate moral hazard through effective monitoring, form long-run

relationships with firms to ease asymmetric information distortions, and thereby boost economic growth.

        In contrast, the market-based view highlights the growth enhancing role of well-functioning

markets in (i) fostering greater incentives to research firms since it is easier to profit from this information
                                                     3


by trading in big, liquid markets (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1993), (ii) enhancing corporate governance by

easing takeovers and making it easier to tie managerial compensation to firm performance (Jensen and

Murphy, 1990), and (iii) facilitating risk management (Levine, 1991; Obstfeld, 1994). Moreover, the

market-based view stresses problems with banks. Specifically, powerful banks can stymie innovation by

extracting informational rents and protecting established firms with close bank-firm ties from competition

(Hellwig, 1991; Rajan, 1992). Furthermore, powerful banks with few regulatory restrictions on their

activities may collude with firm managers against other creditors and impede efficient corporate

governance (Hellwig, 1998; Wenger and Kaserer, 1998). In contrast, competitive capital markets play a

positive role in aggregating diffuse information signals and effectively transmitting this information to

investors, with beneficial implications for firm financing and economic performance (Boot and Thakor,

1997; Allen and Gale, 1999). Thus, proponents of the market-based view stress that markets will reduce

the inherent inefficiencies associated with banks and enhance economic growth.3

        The financial services view -- as articulated by Merton and Bodie (1995) and Levine (1997) –

minimizes the importance of the bank-based versus market-based debate. It stresses that financial

arrangements – contracts, markets, and intermediaries – arise to ameliorate market imperfections and

provide financial services. That is, financial arrangements arise to assess potential investment

opportunities, exert corporate control, facilitate risk management, enhance liquidity, and ease savings

mobilization. By providing these financial services more or less effectively, different financial systems

promote economic growth to a greater or lesser degree. According to this view, the main issue is not

banks or markets. The issue is creating an environment in which intermediaries and markets provide

sound financial services. Conceptually, the financial services view is fully consistent with both the bank-

based and market-based views. Nevertheless, the financial services view places the analytical spotlight

on how to create better functioning banks and markets, and relegates the bank-based versus market-based

debate to the shadows.

        A special case of the financial-services view when applied to the bank-based versus market-based

debate is the law and finance view (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, henceforth LLSV,
                                                      4


1998). As stated by LLSV (2000, p. 19), “… bank- versus market-centeredness is not an especially

useful way to distinguish financial systems.” Rather, these authors highlight the role of the legal system

in creating a growth-promoting financial sector. The law and finance view argues that finance is a set of

contracts. These contracts are defined – and made more or less effective – by legal rights and

enforcement mechanisms. From this perspective, a well-functioning legal system facilitates the operation

of both markets and intermediaries. It is the overall level and quality of financial services – as determined

by the legal system – that improves the efficient allocation of resources and economic growth.      While

focusing on legal systems is not inconsistent with banks or markets playing a particularly important role

in stimulating economic growth, LLSV (2000) clearly argue that laws and enforcement mechanisms are a

more useful way to distinguish financial systems than focusing on whether countries are bank-based of

market-based.

        An important contribution of this paper is the construction of a broad cross-country dataset to

examine market- and bank-based financial systems. Past empirical research primarily involves rigorous

country-studies and uses country-specific measures of financial structure. Thus, studies of Germany

commonly focus on the extent to which banks own shares or vote proxy shares. Studies of Japan

frequently focus on whether a company has a “main bank.” Studies of the United States sometimes

concentrate on the role of market takeovers as corporate control devices. These country-specific

measures are very useful; however, they are difficult to use in a broad cross-country analysis. This paper

uses data from individual country publications, international agencies, and a recent survey of national

regulatory authorities to measure financial structure. One advantage of the broad cross-country approach

is that it permits a consistent treatment of financial system structure across many countries. 4 Second, the

cross-country approach circumvents the problem noted earlier: if one accepts that Germany and Japan are

bank-based and that the United States and the United Kingdom are market-based, then this implies that

financial structure did not matter much since the four countries have very similar long-run growth rates.5

This paper incorporates countries with very different financial systems and growth rates. The dataset

measures the size, activity, and efficiency of various components of the financial system, including banks,
                                                      5


securities markets, and nonbank financial intermediaries for a wide assortment of developed and

developing countries. The paper also measures financial structure by using new data on regulatory

restrictions on bank activities and the ability of banks to own and control firms. While recognizing that

broad cross-country comparisons come at the cost of less precise measures of financial structure, this

paper provides the first consistent appraisal of financial structure and economic performance in the

international cross-section of countries.

        The results are overwhelming. There is no cross-country empirical support for either the market-

based or bank-based views. Neither bank-based nor market-based financial systems are particularly

effective at promoting growth. The results are robust to an extensive array of sensitivity analyses that

employ different measures of financial structure, alternative statistical procedures, and different datasets.

The conclusions are also not altered when looking at extremes: countries with very well developed banks

but poorly developed markets do not perform notably differently from those with very well developed

markets but poorly developed banks, or than those with more balanced financial systems. I also allow for

the possibility that financial structure changes as countries develop and legal systems evolve. For

instance, Boyd and Smith (1998) develop a model in which countries become more market-based, with

positive implications for economic growth, as they develop. Rajan and Zingales (1998) argue that bank-

based systems are better at promoting growth in countries with poor legal systems, while market-based

systems have advantages as legal systems improve. Allowing for these possibilities, however, does not

alter this paper’s conclusion: cross-country comparisons do not suggest that distinguishing between bank-

based and market-based is analytically useful for understanding the process of economic growth.

        The cross-country evidence is consistent with the financial services view. Better-developed

financial systems positively influence economic growth. It is relatively unimportant for economic

growth, however, whether overall financial development stems from bank or market development. More

particularly, the data are consistent with the view that the legal system plays a leading role in determining

the level of growth-promoting financial services. The component of financial development defined by the

legal rights of investors and the efficiency of contract enforcement is very strongly associated with
                                                     6


growth. Thus, the data tend to support the LLSV (1999) view that (i) the legal system crucially

determines financial development and (ii) financial structure is not a particularly useful way to distinguish

financial systems. The results do not support public policies aimed at creating a particular mixture of

financial markets and intermediaries. Rather, the results highlight the importance of strengthening the

rights of investors and improving the efficiency of contact enforcement. While there are difficulties in

measuring financial structure, this paper uses an exhaustive number of indicators that all tell the same

story: it is less useful to distinguish financial systems by whether they are bank-based or market-based

than it is to focus on the specific laws and enforcement mechanisms that govern both debt and equity

transactions.

        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the econometric

specification and the data are discussed in Section III. Section IV provides the regression results and

Section V conclusions

II.     Econometric Specification

        The bank-based, market-based, financial services, and law and finance views of financial

structure can be represented as rival predictions on the parameters in a standard growth equation.

Standard growth models and their econometric representations typically model real per capita GDP

growth, G, as a function of a number of growth determinants, X. These growth determinants universally

include initial income and the initial level of workforce education to capture conditional convergence and

the importance of human capital. Many models also control for macroeconomic stability, openness to

international trade, and political stability. I modify these cross-country growth specifications to

investigate econometrically the competing views of financial structure.

        Consider the following cross-country regression equations

        G = a’X + bS + U(1)                                                                           (1)

        G = c’X + dF + U(2)                                                                           (2)

        G = f’X + hS + jF + U(3)                                                                      (3)

G is real per capita GDP growth.
X is a set of conditioning information, i.e., standard growth determinants.
S measures financial structure. Larger values of S signify more market-based, while smaller values
         signify more bank-based.
F measures overall financial sector development, i.e., the level of development of banks, nonbanks, and
         securities markets. Larger values of F signify a greater level of financial services.
U(i) is the error term in equation i=1, 2, and 3 respectively.
The small letters, a, b, c, d, f, h, and j are coefficients.

          Different hypotheses regarding financial structure and growth imply different predictions on the

values of the parameters in regressions (1)-(3).

Bank-based view: Bank-based systems are particularly good for growth and banks contribute to overall

financial development. Thus, the bank-based view predicts that b<0, d>0, h<0, and j>0. This is a narrow

conception of the bank-based view. A broader approach is explained and tested below

Market-based view: Market-based systems are particularly good for growth and markets contribute to

overall financial development. Thus, the market-based view predicts that b>0, d>0, h>0, and j>0.
                                                     8


Financial-services view: Financial services – whether provided by bank or markets -- positively influence

growth. Thus, the financial-services view predicts that d>0, and j>0.

Law and finance view: The law and finance view is a special case of the financial-services view. It

predicts that the component of overall financial development defined by the legal system is critical for

long-run economic growth, but having a bank-based or market-based financial system per se is not critical

for growth. Moreover, the law and finance view predicts that the legal system matters primarily by

influencing overall financial sector performance. To assess the law and finance view, I use instrumental

variables to extract that component of overall financial development, F, defined by the legal rights of

outside investors and the efficiency of contract enforcement. Then, I assess whether this component of

financial development is robustly linked with economic growth. I also examine whether the legal system

variables directly explain growth and whether they explain growth beyond their ability to explain cross-

country differences in F, overall financial development. Econometrically, the law and finance view

makes the same predictions as the financial-services view, except within the context of a regression

framework that uses the legal codes and enforcement efficiency variables as instruments.

Hybrid views: An important set of views on the market-based and bank-based debate argue that banks

are important for growth under some conditions while markets are more important under alternative

conditions.

          First, Boyd and Smith (1998) suggest that banks are particularly important at low levels of

economic development. As income rises, however, countries benefit from becoming more market-based.

This view suggests that the regression should be specified as follows, where Y is real per capita GDP.

        G = a’X + bS + kS*Y + U(4)                                                                         (4)

This view predicts that b<0 and k>0. I consider this below.

          Second, Rajan and Zingales (1998) argue that bank-based systems have a comparative

advantage in economies with weak legal systems. In those countries with weak institutions, powerful

banks can still force firms to reveal information and pay their debts. According to this view, economies

will benefit from becoming more market-based only as their legal system capabilities strengthen. This
                                                      9


view suggests that the regression should be specified as follows, where L is an index of legal system

development.

        G = a’X + bS + kS*L + U(5)                                                                          (5)

This view predicts that b<0 and k>0. I consider this below.



III.    Data

        A. Definitions of Financial Structure

        To examine the relationship between financial structure and growth, one needs a measure of

financial structure. Unfortunately, there is no uniformly accepted definition of a bank-based or market-

based financial system. Consequently, I construct an assortment of measures for 48 countries over the

1980-95 period. All of these data are available on request. This is the largest set of countries for which I

could get complete data. Most of the analyses involve pure cross-sectional analyses with one observation

per country. The data appendix provides details.

        One advantage of the broad cross-country approach is that it permits a consistent treatment of

financial system structure across countries and thereby facilitates international comparisons. One

weakness of the broad cross-country approach is that it does not permit the use of indicators such as the

voting power of banks or the role of market takeovers as corporate control devices. These types of

measures are not available for the cross-section of countries. To provide a broad cross-country approach,

therefore, this paper focuses on four aggregate indicators of financial structure based on measures of the

relative size, activity, and efficiency of banks and markets. I also use a measure of financial structure

based on regulatory restrictions on the activities of banks. In considering the development of markets, I

focus on stock markets because the International Finance Corporate collects accurate, consistent data for a

broad cross-section of countries. I consider a wide array of alternative measures that I discuss below.

        STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY is a measure of the activity of stock markets relative to that of

banks. To measure the activity of stock markets, I use the total value traded ratio, which equals the value

of domestic equities traded on domestic exchanges divided by GDP. This total value traded ratio is
                                                     10


frequently used to gauge market liquidity because it measures market trading relative to economic

activity. To measure the activity of banks, I use the bank credit ratio, which equals the value of deposit

money bank credits to the private sector as a share of GDP. Bank credit includes all deposit taking

institutions as recognized by the International Monetary Fund. This measure excludes credits to the public

sector (central and local governments as well as public enterprises). Thus, STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY

equals the logarithm of the total value traded ratio divided by the bank credit ratio. Larger values of

STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY imply a more market-based financial system. The values for STRUCTURE-

ACTIVITY are ranked and listed in Table I. I discuss these values below.

        STRUCTURE-SIZE is a measure of the size of stock markets relative to that of banks. To

measure the size of the domestic stock market, I use the market capitalization ratio, which equals the

value of domestic equities listed on domestic exchanges divided by GDP. To measure the size of bank, I

again use the bank credit ratio. It should be noted, however, that other measures of banking system size,

such as the total banking system assets divided by GDP, yield similar results. Thus, STRUCTURE-SIZE

equals the logarithm of the market capitalization ratio divided by the bank credit ratio. The values for

STRUCTURE-SIZE are ranked and listed in Table I. I discuss these values below.

        STRUCTURE-EFFICIENCY is a measure of the efficiency of stock markets relative to that of

banks. To measure the efficiency of stock markets, I use the total value traded ratio since it reflects the

liquidity of the domestic stock market. I also used the turnover ratio, which equals the value of stock

transactions relative to market capitalization. The turnover ratio measures trading relative to the size of

the markets and is also used as an indicator of market efficiency. Using the turnover ratio produces

similar results to those obtained with the total value traded ratio. To measure the efficiency of the

banking sector, I use overhead costs, which equals the overhead costs of the banking system relative to

banking system assets. Large overhead costs may reflect inefficiencies in the banking system. There are

potential problems with this measure, however. Overhead costs may capture efficient investments in

banking, not inefficiencies. While many readers may question the accuracy of this index, I include it for

completeness. I also used interest rate margins in place of overhead costs and obtained similar results.
                                                       11


Thus, STRUCTURE-EFFICIENCY equals the logarithm of the total value traded ratio times overhead

costs. Larger values of STRUCTURE-EFFICIENCY imply a more market-based financial system. Its

value is given in Table I.

        STRUCTURE-AGGREGATE is a conglomerate measure of financial structure based on

activity, size, and efficiency. Specifically STRUCTURE-AGGREGATE is the first principal component

of STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY, STRUCTURE-SIZE, and STRUCTURE-EFFICIENCY. Thus, I construct

STRUCTURE-AGGREGATE to be the variable that best explains (highest joint R-square) the first three

financial structure indicators. The ranked values of this variable are also given in Table I.

        STRUCTURE-REGULATORY is an aggregate measure of regulatory restrictions on

commercial bank activities. Based on a two-year survey of national regulatory authorities, I have

information on the degree to which national regulatory authorities allow commercial banks to engage in

securities (securities underwriting, brokering, dealing, and all aspects of the mutual fund industry),

insurance (insurance underwriting and selling), or real estate (real estate investment, development, and

management) activities and the extent to which banks can own and control nonfinancial firms.6

Specifically, for the three regulatory categories on activities, I assign four possible values: 1 if the activity

is unrestricted (A full range of activities in the given category can be conducted directly in the

commercial bank); 2 if the activity is permitted (a full range of activities can be conducted, but all or

some must be conducted in subsidiaries); 3 if the activity is restricted (less than a full range of activities

can be conducted in the bank or subsidiaries); and 4 if the activity is prohibited in the bank or

subsidiaries. In terms of banks owning nonfinancial firms, this variable takes on the value 1 if ownership

is unrestricted (bank may own 100% of the equity in any nonfinancial firm), 2 if ownership is permitted

(bank may own 100% of the equity in a nonfinancial firm, but ownership is limited based on a bank’s

equity capital.), 3 if ownership is restricted (bank can only acquire less than 100% of the equity in a

nonfinancial firm), and 4 if commercial bank ownership of nonfinancial firms is prohibited
                                                      12


        Table I lists values of STRUCTURE-REGULATORY, which is the summation of each of these

four indicators of regulatory restrictions on commercial bank activities. I have examined each of the

individual indicators and they produce the same conclusions as the aggregate index.



        B. Discussion of Financial Structure Measures

        The financial structure measures, especially the STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY indicator, produce

intuitively appealing classifications of national financial systems, though it is important to highlight

potential anomalies. The activity measure of financial structure, STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY, makes the

intuitively attractive classification that Taiwan, Malaysia, Switzerland, and the United States are highly

market-based because of their active markets. However, STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY also identifies

Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil as very market-based even though their total value traded ratios are about

one-sixth that of the United States. This reflects the fact that these countries all have extremely low levels

of bank development.

        The size measure of financial structure suffers from a large array of anomalies. The size measure

of financial structure, STRUCTURE-SIZE, identifies Ghana, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe as having highly

market-based financial systems. It does this because these countries have very small and under-

developed banking systems, not because their stock markets are particularly well developed. The size

measure also classifies Egypt and Honduras as highly bank-based, even though they have bank credit

ratios below the sample mean. The size measure also indicates that Chile and South Africa are very

market-based even though neither country has a very active market. Both countries have large market

capitalization with relatively little trading. Many theories, however, focuses on market liquidity, not the

listing of shares per se. Moreover, those models that emphasize the positive role of market size in

disseminating and aggregating information presume the existence of a liquid market. Thus, the size

measure seems particularly prone to problems.

        STRUCTURE-EFFICIENCY identifies Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States, and the United

Kingdom as market-based. It also indicates that Brazil has a relatively efficient market. Brazil has a high
                                                      13


value of STRUCTURE-EFFICIENCY because it has very large bank overhead costs. Similarly, Egypt,

Kenya, and Ghana standout as bank-based according to this efficiency measure, because they have very

inefficient stock markets, not because they have efficient banks.

        The STRUCTURE-REGULATORY variable provides a reasonably intuitive classification of

countries. Some countries that are frequently classified as bank-based -- such as Austria, Germany,

Switzerland, and France -- place very few restrictions on the activities of banks. Perhaps surprisingly,

the United Kingdom and New Zealand also permit banks great latitude in securities activities, insurance

activities, real estate activities, and in owning nonfinancial firms. In turn, the quintessential market-based

economy, United States, imposed comparatively tight regulations on banks (prior to recent legislative

changes). While STRUCTURE-REGULATORY is not highly correlated with the other financial

structure indicators, we include it for completeness and to assess whether regulations on bank activities

influence economic growth.

        As exemplified, the activity, size, and efficiency financial structure measures can be large either

because the country has well-developed markets, or because it has very poorly developed banks.

Similarly, a country may have small financial structure indicators either because its banks are

comparatively well-developed or because its markets are relatively underdeveloped. To assess whether

this feature of the data is driving the results, I also identify countries with highly underdeveloped financial

systems. Specifically, I identify those counties that have below median values of bank credit, market

capitalization, and total value traded ratios and greater than median values of overhead expenditures. I

create a dummy variable called UNDEVELOPED, which equals 1 if the country has below median values

of all of these financial development indicators. Thus, rather than classifying countries as either bank-

based or market-based, I first identify those countries with highly underdeveloped financial systems.7 As

a robustness check, I test whether controlling for these countries in the regressions alters the findings and

find that the findings are unaltered.8

        The paper uses the best available data to assess the relationship between financial structure and

economic growth. Although these indicators do not directly measure the degree to which bank influence
                                                      14


industrial expansion or the ability of markets to fund innovative companies and facilitate risk

management, the structure indicators – when taken together – provide a measure of the comparative role

of banks and markets in the economy. As further evidence of the usefulness of these measures,

Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2001) show that countries with strong shareholder rights relative to creditor

rights, strong accounting systems, and no deposit insurance tend to have more market-based financial

systems. Thus, key legal and regulatory differences match-up with these financial structure measures.

Furthermore, many of the individual components of the financial structure indicators (e.g., the bank credit

and total value traded ratios) are robustly linked with growth and this link is not due to simultaneity or

omitted variables bias (See Levine and Zervos, 1998; Levine, Loayza, and Beck, 2000; and Beck and

Levine, 2002). Thus, I use these indicators to assess the relationship between economic performance and

the degree to which countries are bank-based or market-based.

         C. Measuring Overall Financial Development

         The financial services views suggest that neither market-based nor bank-based categorizations are

particularly important for identifying growth-enhancing financial systems. This section presents measures

of overall financial sector development based on indicators of activity, size, and efficiency. The goal is

that these indicators proxy for the degree to which national financial systems provide financial services:

assessing firms and monitoring managers, easing risk management, and mobilizing resources. Table II

lists these data.

         FINANCE-ACTIVITY is a measure of the activity of stock markets and intermediaries. To

measure the activity of stock markets, I use the total value traded ratio. To measure the activity of banks,

I use the private credit ratio, which equals the value of financial intermediary credits to the private sector

as a share of GDP. This measure excludes credits to the public sector (central and local governments as

well as public enterprises). Unlike the bank credit ratio used to construct STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY,

however, the private credit ratio includes credits issued by non-deposit money banks. Thus, it is a more

comprehensive measure of financial intermediary development than private credit. This is appropriate

since FINANCE-ACTIVITY is an overall index of financial sector activity. (Note, however, that when I
                                                      15


reconstruct all the structure measures using private credit instead of bank credit, this does not change the

results.) Thus, FINANCE-ACTIVITY equals the logarithm of the total value traded ratio times the

private credit ratio. Also, Table III shows that FINANCE-ACTIVITY is significantly and positively

correlated with each of the structure indicators and the other financial development indicators.

         FINANCE-SIZE is a measure of the size of stock markets and intermediaries. To measure the

size of the domestic stock market, I use the market capitalization ratio. As noted above, there are

conceptual problems with simply using market size to gauge market development. Also, Levine and

Zervos (1998) find that market size is not strongly linked with economic growth but market activity (as

measured by the total value traded ratio) is a good predictor of economic growth. Nonetheless, we

include this measure for completeness and to assess the Levine and Zervos (1998) finding with a different

dataset. To measure the size of intermediaries, I again use the private credit ratio. Thus, FINANCE-SIZE

equals the logarithm of the market capitalization ratio times the private credit ratio.

         FINANCE-EFFICIENCY is a measure of financial sector efficiency. To measure the efficiency

of stock markets, I use the total value traded ratio. To measure the efficiency of the banking sector, I use

overhead costs, which equals the overhead costs of the banking system relative to banking system assets.

Thus, FINANCE-EFFICIENCY equals the logarithm of the total value traded ratio divided by overhead

costs.

         FINANCE-AGGREGATE is the first principal component of the first three financial

development indicators of activity, size, and efficiency.

         B. Other Variables

         To assess the independent relationship between growth and both financial structure and financial

development, I control for other potential growth determinants (X in equations (1)-(5)). I use two sets of

conditioning information.

         The simple conditioning information set contains only the logarithm of initial real per capita

GDP, which for the present study is the value in 1980, and the logarithm of the initial level of the number

of years of schooling in the working age population. Initial income captures the convergence effect
                                                       16


predicted by many growth models and schooling is included because many analyses suggest a positive

role for human capital in the growth process.

        The full conditioning information set contains the simple conditioning information set plus (i)

the logarithm of one plus the average rate of inflation, (ii) the logarithm of one plus the average black

market premium, (iii) the logarithm of government size as a share of GDP, (iv) the logarithm of

international trade (exports plus imports) as a share of GDP, and (v) indicators of civil liberties,

revolutions and coups, political assassinations, bureaucratic efficiency, and corruption. An assortment of

research papers stresses the importance of macroeconomic policies and political factors in the process of

economic growth. I control for these factors in order to assess the independent link between growth and

both financial structure and overall financial development (Levine and Renelt, 1992).9



IV.     Results

        A. Financial Structure

        Table IV presents the financial structure results using ordinary least squares estimation with

heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. The top panel lists the results for the simple conditioning

information set for each of the five financial structure variables. The bottom panel lists the results for the

full conditioning information set. I use a common sample throughout, so that there are 48 observations in

all of the regressions (except as noted below). To concisely summarize a large number of regressions, I

only report the results on the variable of interest: the financial structure variables.

        Financial structure is not significantly related to economic growth. None of the financial

structure indicators enters any of the growth regressions significantly at the 0.10 level. The results are

inconsistent with both the bank-based and the market-based views. The bank-based view predicts a

negative relationship between growth and the financial structure measures. The market-based view

predicts a positive relationship. Rather, the results are more consistent with the financial services and law

and finance views: they predict that financial structure is not the most useful way to distinguish financial

systems.10 Furthermore, I modified the econometric specification to include both financial structure and
                                                      17


overall financial development. The financial structure variables never enter the growth regression

significantly. However, overall financial development is robustly linked with economic growth as

discussed below.11

        Finally, I assess the broad views of financial structure and economic growth that involve a bit

more nuance. That is, Table V presents the results of estimating equations (4) and (5), in order to mitigate

potential interpretational complexities and evaluate the predictions of an important set of models. As

noted, Boyd and Smith (1998) argue that the optimal degree level of financial structure changes with

income per capita. Rajan and Zingales (1998) instead argue that in countries with weak shareholder

protection codes and poorly enforced property rights, bank-based systems will better promote growth,

while economies benefit from more market-based systems as the legal system improves.

        The results do not suggest that distinguishing countries as bank-based or market-based is an

analytically useful way of distinguishing financial systems, even after allowing for the systematic

evolution of financial structure (Table V). The first set of regressions (structure and income per capita)

include the interaction term, S*Y, where S is the financial structure indicator and Y is real per capita

GDP. As shown, neither the structure variable nor the interactive term enters significantly. The second

set of regressions (structure and shareholder rights) includes the index of the legal rights of (equity)

shareholders independently and interacted with financial structure (S).12 This does not change the

conclusions. None of the variables associated with financial structure enters significantly. The third set

of regressions (structure and the rule of law) includes an index of the degree to which the country follows

the rule of law, LAW. 13 This is included independently and interacted with financial structure. Again,

there is no evidence that financial structure is a useful way to distinguish financial systems in assessing

long-run growth. Finally, I simply split the sample according to the level of economic development and

analyzed OECD and non-OECD countries. Financial structure does not enter significantly in any of these

regressions either. These results do not reject the theories outlined by Boyd and Smith (1998) and Rajan

and Zingales (1998). These findings do, however, suggest that the absence of a link between growth and
                                                      18


the level of bank-basedness or market-basedness is not due to countries selecting the optimal level of

financial structure.

         B. Sensitivity of the Financial Structure Results

         While many of the robustness tests are detailed above, I explain a few additional ones here.

       First, I use instrumental variables to control for potential simultaneity. I use three instrumental

variables that explain cross-country differences in financial structure. All three variables come from

LLSV (1998). The index of shareholder rights (defined above) does a particularly good job of explaining

cross-country differences in stock market development. In turn, the LLSV index of creditor rights helps

account for cross-country differences in banking sector development.14 The creditor rights index,

however, does not explain much of the cross-country variation in stock market development. Since

contract enforcement is important for both bank and market activities, I also include a measure of the law

and order tradition of the country, LAW. Use of these instruments does not alter the results: financial

structure is neither positively nor negatively related to economic growth. Alternative instruments tell the

same story. I use legal origin to extract the exogenous component of financial structure. LLSV (1998)

show the Common Law countries tend to have stronger investor protection laws and enforcement

capabilities than French Civil Law countries. Using these alternative instruments, however, does not alter

the results.15

       Second, the results in this paper have been checked using an alternative statistical procedure that (i)

exploits the time-series (as well as the cross-country) dimension of the data, (ii) controls for the

possibility that there is an important country-specific variable inducing omitted variable bias, and (iii)

accounts for the possibility that financial structure and economic growth are simultaneously determined

variables. Specifically, instead of conducting the analyses using a pure cross-country estimator with one

observation per country, I use pooled cross-section, time-series procedures. The panel estimates,

however, produce exactly the same results: while overall financial development is an important

determinant of growth, financial structure is not systematically linked with economic performance. 16
                                                      19


      Finally, microeconomic evidence from individual country studies supports this paper’s findings.

For instance, Gallego and Loayza (2001) investigate the development of Chile’s financial system over the

last two decades using firm-level data and panel econometric techniques. They find that changes in

financial structure did not influence the cost of capital in Chile or firms’ access to capital. However, they

do find that overall financial development lowered the cost of capital and eased financing constraints.

Furthermore, using firm-level data from a cross-section of 33 countries, Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, Levine

and Maksimovic (2001) find that overall financial development boosts firm growth, but financial structure

is unrelated to firm performance. Finally, using industry level data across 42 countries, Beck and Levine

(2002) find that while overall financial development boosts industry growth and new firm formation,

having a bank-based or market-based financial system does not matter much.



        C. Financial Development

        The results are quite different when examining overall financial development. Past work has

demonstrated a strong link between financial development and growth. Here, I show that the measures of

overall financial development used in this paper are strongly linked with long-run growth and this

relationship is not due to simultaneity bias.

        Financial development – as measured by the conglomerate indices of bank activity and stock

market activity -- is positively and significantly related to economic growth in the international cross-

section of countries (Table VI).17 Indeed, the only financial development indicator that is not

significantly related to growth is FINANCE-SIZE, which measures financial size. This result is

consistent with the Levine and Zervos (1998) result that market capitalization is not a robust predictor of

economic growth. They show that stock market liquidity, as measured by the total value traded ratio, and

banking sector activity, as measured by bank credit to the private sector are robust predictors of growth.

Thus, the Table VI results are consistent with the financial services and law and finance views. While

they are also consistent with both the market-based and bank-based views of financial development, these

views of financial structure did not fair very well in the specific examination of financial structure.
                                                      20


Moreover, all of the overall financial development indicators continue to enter significantly in the simple

growth regressions when controlling for financial structure.

        These findings are consistent with the financial services view of financial structure and the

coefficients suggest an economically large relationship between finance and growth. To illustrate the

economic size of the coefficients in Table VI consider FINANCE-ACTIVITY, the overall financial

activity measure, and its estimated coefficient of 0.435 in the full conditioning information set regression.

Now consider changing Peru and Argentina’s levels of overall financial activity from –6.6 and –6.0

respectively to the level of their neighbor Chile, which has a value of FINANCE-ACTIVITY of –4.0 over

the 1980-95 period. The estimates suggest an increase in real per capital GDP growth of 1.15 percentage

points for Peru and 0.89 percentage points in Argentina. This increase in growth is large. Over this

period, Peru shrank at a rate of –1.8 percent per year while Argentina stagnated with an annual growth

rate of 0.04 percent. Chile, however, might also strive for greater financial development. For instance,

Thailand, which has similar real per capita GDP, has an overall financial sector activity index of –2.0,

compared to Chile’s value of –4.0 for FINANCE-ACTIVITY. If Chile had enjoyed Thailand’s level of

financial activity during this 15-year period, the coefficient estimates suggest that Chile would have

grown 0.86 percentage points faster each year (Chile’s real per capita annual growth over the period

averaged 3.7 percent). These examples are meant to illustrate the economic size of the coefficients and

should not be viewed as exploitable elasticities. Nonetheless, the results indicate that the economic

relationship between overall financial sector development and long-run growth is economically relevant.

        C. The Law and finance View

        Table I5 provides information on a special case of the financial services view: the law and finance

view of financial structure. Here I use instrumental variables to extract that part of overall financial

development determined by the legal environment. Specifically, I identify that component of financial

development determined by (i) legal codes that support shareholders, (ii) legal codes that support

creditors, and (iii) the efficiency with which law are enforced. I then assess whether this component of

overall financial development is strongly linked with long-run growth.
                                                      21


        It is worth pointing out the desirability of using these legal indicators. Using a variety of

econometric methods, earlier studies show that the exogenous component of financial development is

positively linked with growth.18 Thus, while economic activity may influence financial development, the

strong, positive link between financial development and growth is not fully explained by reverse

causality: there is an exogenous component of financial development that positively influences growth.

While these earlier studies were primarily interested in confronting the issue of exogeneity, the current

study is primarily interested in assessing the law and finance view: Is that part of overall financial

development defined by legal codes and enforcement capabilities helpful in explaining cross-country

growth differences? Thus, we use measures of the rights of investors and the efficiency of contract

enforcement. This may raise concerns that growth alters laws and enforcement. This is not a dominant

influence, however. Levine (1999) uses the legal origin of each country as an instrumental variable in

extracting the exogenous component of financial development. LLSV (1998) argue that legal origins –

French, English, German, or Scandinavian legal origin – were determined centuries earlier and were

largely disseminated through conquest and colonization, so they can be treated as reasonably exogenous

for current analyses. These legal origin variables explain differences in legal codes and enforcement

efficiency. Critically, this paper’s conclusions hold even when using legal origin as instrumental

variables. Thus, I focus on using legal codes and law enforcement to extract this component of overall

financial development, rather than replicating past work.

        The results are consistent with the law and finance view: greater financial development, as

defined by the legal environment, is positively related to economic growth (Table VII). Furthermore, the

regressions pass the test of the overidentifying restrictions. That is, the data do not reject the hypothesis

that shareholder rights, creditor rights, and the law and order tradition of the country influence growth

only through their effects on financial development. Thus, the data are consistent with the view that the

component of overall financial development explained by legal codes and enforcement efficiency is

positively and significantly related to economic growth. Also, the instruments explain a significant

amount of the cross-sectional variation in financial development in the first-stage regressions.19 Finally,
                                                      22


the coefficient sizes do not shrink from the OLS regressions presented in Table VI. The economic impact

of the exogenous component of financial sector development is economically large.

        D. Discussion

        The results provide strong support for the financial services view: overall financial development

is strongly associated with growth. This close relationship holds after controlling for potential

simultaneity bias, omitted variable bias, and wide range of sensitivity checks. Furthermore, while overall

financial development is closely associated with economic growth, the degree to which financial structure

is bank-based or market-based is not associated with growth. These findings are consistent with the

financial services view.

        Furthermore, the data support a special case of the financial services view of financial structure:

the law and finance view. While the results on the law and finance view must be viewed cautiously, some

additional information supports the law and finance view. In terms of caution, to derive conclusions

about the law and finance view of financial structure from Table VII, one must interpret the results as

supporting the contention that the component of financial development determined by specific legal

variables is positively and significantly linked with growth. Although this is consistent with the results,

this interpretation is inherently a structural statement. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight three

pieces of information. First, as noted above, the three legal system variables jointly explain cross-country

variation in the overall financial development indicators. Thus, the results accord with LLSV (1998)

view that legal system differences account for differences in financial development. Second, the three

legal system variables jointly explain economic growth. Specifically, when the three legal system

variables are entered jointly in the full conditioning information set growth regression -- while excluding

the financial development measures, an F-test on the three legal variables shows that they explain a

significant proportion of the cross-country variation in economic growth.20 Third, I enter the three legal

system variables in the growth regression along with the financial development indicator. The legal

variables do not enter significantly when controlling for overall financial development. 21 This suggests
                                                      23


that it is the ability of the legal variables to explain cross-country differences in financial development

that is crucial for growth. This is exactly the law and finance view of financial structure.

V.      Conclusions

        This paper explores the relationship between economic performance and financial structure – the

degree to which a country’s financial system is market-based or bank-based. In particular, this paper

empirically assesses competing theoretical views of financial structure and economic growth. The bank-

based view holds that bank-based systems – particularly at early stages of economic development and in

weak institutional settings – do a better job than market-based financial system at mobilizing savings,

allocating capital and exerting corporate control. In contrast, the market-based view emphasizes that

markets provide key financial services that stimulate innovation and long-run growth. Alternatively, the

financial services view stresses the role of bank and markets in researching firms, exerting corporate

control, creating risk management devices, and mobilizing society’s savings for the most productive

endeavors. This view minimizes the bank-based versus market-based debate and emphasizes the quality

of financial services produced by the entire financial system. The law and finance view, which is a special

case of the financial services view, argues that the legal system is the primary determinant of financial

development. Thus, the law and finance view stresses the role of the legal system in boosting overall

financial sector development and hence long-run growth.

        The data provide no evidence for the bank-based or market based views. Distinguishing

countries by financial structure does not help in explaining cross-country differences in long-run

economic performance. Rather, the cross-country data strongly support the financial services view.

Distinguishing countries by their overall level of financial development helps to explain cross-country

difference in economic growth. Countries with greater degrees of financial development – as measured

by aggregate measures of bank development and market development – enjoy substantially greater

economic growth rates. Moreover, the component of financial development explained by the legal rights

of outside investors and the efficiency of the legal system in enforcing those rights is strongly and
                                                    24


positively linked with long-run growth. The data are consistent with the view that the legal system

importantly influences financial sector development and this in turn influences long-run growth.

    Goldsmith (1969) made this argument when discussing Germany’s bank-based system and the

United Kingdom’s market-based system during the period 1864-1914: “One cannot well claim that

a superiority in the German financial structure was responsible for, or even contributed to, a more

rapid growth of the German economy as a whole compared to the British economy in the half-

century before World War I, since there was not significant difference in the rate of growth of the

two economies.” (p. 407)

    Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2001a) examine the links between bank performance and regulatory

powers. Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2001b,c) present a new data set of bank regulation and

supervision and then use these data to examine the relationship between the regulatory and

supervisory regime and both bank performance and stability. For a helpful review of the economics

of bank regulation, see Bhattacharya, Boot, and Thakor (1998).

8
    Furthermore, I examined “unbalanced financial systems.” Countries with well-developed banks

and poorly developed markets, or vice-versa, may have distorted financial structures that hinder the

efficient provision of financial services. However, identifying countries with very unbalanced

financial systems does not help explain growth.
9
    Recent work stresses that religious composition and geographical endowments (such as distance

from the equator) influence financial development. When controlling for these factors, the results

on financial structure reported below are unaltered.
10
     I tested robustness using an array of different indicators of financial structure. Specifically,

instead of using total value traded of equity shares relative to GDP to measure stock markets

development, I used total value traded relative to market capitalization. The results are the same.

Then, instead of using secondary market measures of stock market development, I used primary

market measures. Thus, I computed the amount of money obtained by the issuance of equity and

used this as the indicator of stock market development. Again, the results are the same. Also, I used

expanded measures of banking development that include measures of privately owned life insurance

companies and private pension funds. The conclusions are the same. Also, controlling for the

extent of public ownership of banks does not change the findings. Finally, I used the structure-

aggregate indicator to compute a zero-one structure-dummy variable of whether each country’s

financial system is bank-based or market-based and get the same results.
11
     I assessed the empirical link between financial structure and the individual sources of growth:

total factor productivity growth, physical capital accumulation, and private saving rates using data

from Easterly and Levine (2001). Some models, for instance, suggest that bank-based systems are

particularly important for capital-based growth, while market-based system are crucial for

innovation led growth (Allen and Gale, 1999). There is not a significant link – positive or negative
                                                      2



– between financial structure and any of the sources of economic growth. Also, Wurgler (2000)

measures efficient capital allocation as the degree to which investment flows into industries with

growing value added and out of industries with declining value added. I found that the degree to

which an economy has a bank-based or market-based system is unrelated to Wurlger’s (2000)

measure of efficient capital allocation.
12
     Specifically, for shareholder rights, I add 1 if: (1) the country allows the shareholders to mail their

proxy to the firm; (2) shareholders are not required to deposit their shares prior to the General

Shareholders’ Meeting; (3) cumulative voting or proportional representation of minorities in the

board of directors is allowed; (4) an oppressed minorities mechanism is in place; (5) the minimum

percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to call for an Extraordinary Shareholders’

Meeting is less than or equal to 10 percent (the sample median); or (6) shareholders have

preemptive rights that can only be waived by a shareholders’ vote.
13
     LAW ranges from 10 (strong law and order tradition) to 1 (weak law and order tradition). The

data are averaged over the period 1982-95. LAW is very highly correlated with indexes of the

security of property rights and the efficiency of contract enforcement. Using these alternative

measures of legal development does not alter the conclusions.
14
     Specifically, for creditor rights I add one if (1) the country imposes restrictions, such as creditors’

consent, to file for reorganization; (2) secured creditors are able to gain possession of their security

once the reorganization petition has been approved (no automatic stay); (3) secured creditors are

ranked first in the distribution of the proceeds that result from the disposition of assets of a bankrupt

firm; and (4) the debtor does not retain the administration of its property pending the resolution of

the reorganization.

15
     Furthermore, I assess whether financial structure measured in 1980 explains subsequent growth.

It does not.
16
     I have also examined the links between financial structure and both output volatility and banking

sector crises. Financial structure is not related to the probability of suffering a major banking crisis,

or to output growth volatility. Thus, distinguishing between bank-based and market-based financial

systems is not particularly useful for understanding long-run growth, output volatility, or financial

fragility.
17
     I also confirm earlier findings by King and Levine (1993a,b), Levine and Zervos (1998), and

Beck, Levine, and Loayza (2000) using this paper’s new overall financial development indicators:

financial development is closely linked with total factor productivity growth but not robustly linked

with capital accumulation or private saving rates.
18
     See Levine (1999) and Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000).
19
     For instance, the instruments are jointly significant in the FINANCE-ACTIVITY first-stage

regression at the 0.01 level and account for 50 percent of its cross-country variance.
20
     Specifically, the F-statistic equals 3.01 with a P-value of 0.048.
21
     Specifically, the P-values on the F- statistic (when testing the joint significance of the legal

variables while controlling for overall financial development) are typically greater than 0.45.

Notes:
1. Each structure variable and the corresponding interaction term are included in separate regressions.
   Thus, the table summarizes the results of 15 regressions.
2. Structure and income per capita regressions also include the logarithm of initial income and schooling.
3. Structure and shareholder rights regressions also include the logarithm of initial income and schooling, and Rights (which is an index of (equity) sharehold
legal rights).
4. Structure and rule of law regressions also include the logarithm of initial income and schooling, and Law (which is an index of the degree to which the rule of
law holds).
Structure-Activity = Ln (total value traded ratio / bank credit ratio).
Structure-Size = Ln (market capitalization ratio / bank credit ratio).
Structure-Efficiency = Ln (total value traded ratio * overhead costs).
Structure-Aggregate = principal component of Structure 1, 2, 3.
Structure-Regulatory = Index of regulatory restrictions on commercial bank activities.
Income = Ln(Real per Capita GDP)
Rights = Index of (equity) shareholder rights.
Law = Index of the degree to which the rule of law holds in a country.
