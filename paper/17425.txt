                                               ABSTRACT

If official interventions convey private information useful for price discovery in foreign-exchange
markets, then they should have value as a forecast of near-term exchange-rate movements. Using
a set of standard criteria, we show that approximately 60 percent of all U.S. foreign-exchange interventions
between 1973 and 1995 were successful in this sense. This percentage, however, is no better than
random. U.S. intervention sales and purchases of foreign exchange were incapable of forecasting
dollar appreciations or depreciations. U.S. interventions, however, were associated with more moderate
dollar movements in a manner consistent with leaning against the wind, but only about 22 percent
of all U.S. interventions conformed to this pattern. We also found that the larger the size of an intervention,
the greater was its probability of success, although some interventions were inefficiently large. Other
potential characteristics of intervention, notably coordination and secrecy, did not seem to influence
our success rates.

       The Federal Reserve as an Informed Foreign-Exchange Trader: 1973 - 1995

               There is no evidence, nor does anybody here [in the FOMC]
               believe that there is any evidence, to confirm that sterilized
               intervention does anything.

1. Introduction
        In mid-1973, shortly after the onset of generalized floating, the United States started
intervening in the foreign-exchange market, buying or selling foreign currencies in an effort to
influence dollar exchange rates. By 1995, however, the United States had all but abandoned
these operations. The evidence over the intervening years suggested that intervention was more
of a hindrance to good policy than a contribution. Starting in the late 1980s, Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) participants increasingly questioned the effectiveness of
intervention. They believed that if intervention were to have anything other than a fleeting, hit-
or-miss effect on exchange rates, monetary policy had to support it. This stricture, however,
implied that intervention did not afford the Federal Reserve an instrument with which to
systematically affect exchange rates independent of monetary policy. Intervention could
interfere with the FOMC’s domestic policy objectives. Moreover the impetus for U.S.
intervention after 1985 came largely from the U.S. Treasury, which is primarily responsible for
intervention in the United States. Despite having separate legal authority for intervention, the
Federal Reserve System found that it could not easily avoid participating in Treasury initiated
operations. Under these circumstances, the FOMC feared, intervention must weaken confidence
in the System’s commitment to price stability, which at the time the committee was avidly
attempting to strengthen (Broaddus and Goodfriend 1996, Goodfriend 2010, Bordo, Humpage,
and Schwartz 2010b).
        While many other advanced countries followed suite, intervention operations never
entirely ended. The Japanese Ministry of Finance, for example, undertook frequent—and at
times massive—operations between 1991 and 2004 with an eye toward limiting the yen’s
appreciation against the dollar (Ito 2003, 2005, 2007). The United States, for its own part, has
participated in two operations against Japanese yen and one against euros since the summer of
1995. The recent global financial turmoil has encouraged a limited resurgence of intervention.
Japan has again intervened, once with U.S. cooperation. The Swiss National Bank has also
intervened heavily in an effort to limit the franc’s appreciation against the euro and the dollar.
Emerging markets, including Brazil, Chile, and Israel, have also intervened. The often
heightened volatility of exchange rates since 2007 has prompted some economists to recommend
the limited use of intervention (Neely 2011).
        This paper reviews the U.S. experience from 1973 through 1995 in search of lessons
pertinent to any modern re-evaluation of intervention policy. Following Humpage (1999, 2000),
we construct reasonable success criteria based on the correspondence between interventions and
daily exchange-rate movements. We count the number of observed successes under each
criterion and assess whether that count exceeds the number that might occur randomly given the
near-martingale nature of daily exchange-rate changes. A high success count indicates that
intervention has value as a forecast of near-term exchange-rate patterns and implies that
intervention conveys information useful for price discovery. We also investigate whether
                                                                                                    4

various characteristics of an intervention, such as its size, frequency, or coordination, can
increase its probability of success.
        We find that 60 percent of all U.S. interventions between 1973 and 1995 were successful
under our criteria—a percentage that is no better than random. This result occurs because U.S.
purchases and sales of foreign exchange show no systematic correspondence with dollar
depreciations or appreciations, respectively. U.S. interventions, however, often did accompany
same-day moderations of dollar exchange-rate movements in a manner broadly consistent with
leaning against the wind. While these successes were generally greater than random, they
accounted for less than one-fourth of all U.S. interventions, and were not universally robust
across time periods and currencies. We also found that the larger the size of an intervention, the
greater is its probability of success, although an intervention can be inefficiently large. Other
characteristics of interventions, notably coordination, seem to have had no apparent influence on
our success rates.
         This paper proceeds as follows: The next section draws a key distinction between
sterilized and nonsterilized interventions and discusses the theoretical channels through which
sterilized intervention might operate. Section 3 explains our three success criteria, our data, and
our counting methods. Section 4 evaluates our success counts under the assumption that
successes are hypergeometric random variables. Section 5 checks the robustness of our results
across various subperiods. Section 6 uses probit regressions to see if various characteristics of an
intervention alter the probability of success. Section 7 concludes with some discussion of our
results and a few comparisons to earlier work.
2. Background
        Except for the instruments involved, the mechanics of an intervention are similar to those
of an open-market operation, and like an open-market operation, foreign-exchange interventions
have the potential to alter bank reserves. The Federal Reserve—like most large central banks—
routinely sterilizes the impact of all U.S. foreign-exchange operations on the monetary base
(Neely 2001, Lecourt and Raymond 2006). Sterilization prevents foreign-exchange transactions
from interfering with the domestic objectives of monetary policy.
         In contrast to the sterilized variety, nonsterilized intervention, which alters the monetary
base, is essentially equivalent to introducing an exchange-rate target into a central bank’s
reaction function. While presenting the central bank with an additional policy target, non-
sterilized intervention fails to offer an additional independent instrument with which to attain
that target. If an undesirable movement in the exchange rate should stem from a domestic
monetary shock, then counteracting it through purchases of foreign exchange is wholly
redundant to doing so through traditional open-market operations (see Bonser-Neal et al. 1998,
Humpage 1999).1 On the other hand, if the initial, underlying shock to the exchange rate is
something other than domestic and monetary in nature, then attempting to achieve an exchange-
rate objective through either nonsterilized intervention or traditional open-market operations can
interfere with the attainment of a central bank’s domestic policy goals. If, for example, the
dollar depreciates vis à vis a foreign currency because the foreign central bank tightens its
monetary policy, then conducting nonsterilized intervention to stabilize the dollar lowers
inflation below the Federal Reserve’s desired level.
      Sterilized intervention is useful to policy makers only to the extent that it provides a
mechanism for systematically affecting exchange rates independent of their domestic monetary
                                                                                                  5

policy objectives. Theoretically, sterilized intervention might influence exchange rates through a
portfolio-balance channel, an inventory-adjustment channel, an expectations channel or a
coordination mechanism.2
         A portfolio-balance channel should offer central banks a way to routinely affect exchange
rates without interfering with their domestic monetary-policy objectives. Sterilized intervention
has no effect on the monetary base, but it alters the currency composition of publically held
government securities. Specifically, the act of sterilizing an intervention increases outstanding
debt denominated in the currency that central banks are selling relative to debt denominated in
the currency that central banks are buying. If risk-averse asset holders view securities in
different currency denominations as imperfect substitutes, they will hold the relatively more
abundant asset in their portfolio only if the expected rate of return on this asset compensates
them for the perceived risks of doing so.3 Their initial reluctance to hold the relatively more
abundant security forces a spot depreciation of the currency that central banks are selling relative
to the currency that they are buying. The spot depreciation relative to the exchange rate’s
longer-term expected value then raises the anticipated rate of return on the now more-abundant
securities and compensates asset holders for the perceived increase in risk.4 Unfortunately, most
empirical studies do not find that intervention affects exchange rates through a portfolio-balance
mechanism (Edison 1993). Typically, the relevant coefficients in these studies are either
statistically or quantitatively insignificant, or unstable across time periods and currencies. A
notable exception is Dominguez and Frankel (1993a) who find support for a portfolio-balance
channel. In general, central banks put little stock in this mechanism (Neely 2007).
        A variation of the standard portfolio-balance channel, the inventory-adjustment
mechanism, describes how intervention might affect exchange rates in the very short run (Evan
and Lyons 2001, 2005, Lyons 2001). These models focus on the role of foreign-exchange
dealers, who, as market makers, stand ready to buy and sell foreign exchange. These same
dealers typically do not hold sizable open positions in a foreign currency, especially overnight
(Cheung and Chinn 2001). They will try to distribute their unwanted currency holdings among
other dealers and eventually among their commercial customers. Since different currencies are
not perfect substitutes in the dealers’ portfolios, this inventory-adjustment process resembles a
portfolio-balance-like mechanism at the micro level. Evans and Lyons (2001, 2005) claim
evidence of both temporary—dealer-to-dealer inventory reshuffling—and permanent—dealer-to-
customer—portfolio-balance effects. The permanent component of this model, however, is at
odds with the macro literature.
        Alternatively, sterilized intervention might exert some influence over foreign-exchange
rates by affecting market expectations about future exchange-rate changes. Unlike the portfolio-
balance mechanism, an expectations channel does not alter the fundamental determinants of
exchange rates, but changes perceptions of those fundamentals. This may quickly shift exchange
rates to an alternative path, but one that is still consistent with those unchanged fundamentals.
        For the expectations channel to work, information must be costly and asymmetrically
distributed, and monetary authorities must have private information about exchange rates that
they can convey to the market through their interventions (Baillie, Humpage, and Osterberg
2000). Survey evidence does suggest that information is asymmetrically distributed (Cheung
and Chinn 2001). Large foreign-exchange traders have better information than smaller traders
and transfer that information through their trades. Any traders—including monetary
                                                                                                     6

authorities—that others suspect of having superior information could affect prices, if market
participants observed their trades.
        Should we expect central banks to routinely possess a significant informational advantage
over private-market participants? Mussa (1981) initially suggested that a central bank might
signal unanticipated changes in monetary policy through its interventions. This signal would
have credence because the monetary authority will incur a capital loss on its foreign-exchange
position if it fails to carry through with its policy signal. Because of this condition, the signaling
channel does not offer monetary authorities a mechanism through which they can routinely affect
exchange rates independent of their monetary policies.
        Monetary authorities, however, often claim to intervene when they view current
exchange rates as being inconsistent with market fundamentals, implying that they have an
information advantage beyond prospective changes in monetary policy. Central banks have
large staffs that gather and analyze data, and they maintain ongoing informational relationships
with major banks. Through their frequent contacts with market participants, central banks can
aggregate the private information of individual traders and disseminate this information through
intervention (Popper and Montgomery 2001). If monetary authorities routinely have better
broad-based information than other market participants, then their interventions should
accurately predict near-term exchange-rate movements.
        In extreme cases of information imperfections, when a substantial portion of market
participants base their trades on extrapolations of past exchange-rate movements, exchange rates
might remain misaligned, even if more-informed traders feel that current exchange rates are
inappropriate. In the presence of strong bandwagon effects or collective-action problems,
informed traders may have recently lost money and withdrawn temporarily from the market,
causing the misalignment to persist. In such cases, sterilized intervention might offer a
coordinating signal to those traders that react to fundamentals (Sarno and Taylor, 2001 and Reitz
and Taylor, 2008). This coordination channel does not require that a central bank necessarily
have better information than the market. The signal bolsters traders’ confidence about their own
expectations and encourages them to take positions. It does seem to require, however, that
monetary authorities lack credibility. A credible central bank could simply announce that the
exchange rate is misaligned (Reitz and Taylor 2008).
       In the next section, we test whether U.S. interventions had value as a forecast of
subsequent exchange-rate movements. As such, our tests seem consistent with an expectations
channel or, possibly, a coordination mechanism.
3. Success Counts
       We evaluate the success of U.S. foreign-exchange operations using two specific criteria
and a general criterion that incorporates the first two. In all of the definitions that follow, It
designates U.S. intervention on day t, with positive (negative) values being sales (purchases) of
foreign exchange. St is the opening (9:00 a.m.) spot bid for foreign exchange in the New York
market on day t measured in foreign-currency units per U.S. dollar, and ΔSt = St+1 – St. The
change in the exchange rate from the opening on day t to the opening on day t+1 brackets U.S.
interventions on day t.5 The target exchange rate is either German marks per dollar or Japanese
yen per dollar, and It consists only of the corresponding intervention, that is, dollars against
German marks or dollars against Japanese yen.
                                                                                                    7

        Our first binomial success criterion (SC1) counts an official U.S. sale or purchase of
foreign exchange on a particular day as a success (SC1=1) if the dollar appreciates or depreciates,
as the case may be, over that same day:
                  if I t  0, and St  0, or
             1    
1)     SC1       if I t  0, and St  0;
             0     otherwise.
             
        Our second success criterion (SC2) scores an intervention as a success (SC2=1) if the
United States sells foreign exchange and the dollar continues to depreciate, but does so by less
than over the previous day. Likewise, this criterion counts intervention as a success if the United
States buys foreign exchange and the dollar continues to appreciate, but does so by less than over
the previous day. (For completeness, we include ΔSt = 0 in this criterion.)
                  if I t  0, and St -1  0, and St  0, and St  St , or
              1   
2)     SC 2      if I t  0, and St -1  0, and St  0, and St  St 1 ;
              0    otherwise.
              
        Our general success criterion (SC3) incorporates SC1 and SC2. Accordingly, an
intervention sale of foreign exchange on a particular day is successful (SC3=1) if the dollar
appreciates or if it depreciates by less than on the previous day. A corresponding rule holds for
dollar purchases of foreign exchange.
              if I t  0, and St  0, or St  St 1 or
             1 
3)     SC3   if I t  0, and St  0, or St  St 1;
             0 otherwise.
             
        We measure success over a single day, which some may find unduly restrictive
(Goodhart and Hesse 1993, Fatum and Hutchison 2002). Despite the narrow window, the chance
that we might fail to count an intervention as successful because the appropriate exchange-rate
movement occurred beyond the opening on day t+1 seems remote. Chang and Taylor (1998),
Chueng and Chinn (2001), and Dominguez (2003), among others, suggest that exchange markets
begin to respond to intervention within minutes or hours, not days. Likewise, a majority of
central bank officials in Neely’s (2001) survey contended that exchange rates reflect the full
effects of intervention within hours. Alternatively, by keeping the window narrow, we may
count an intervention as a success even though the exchange-rate change that led us to that
conclusion subsequently disappears. Opening the event window beyond a single day to limit this
problem, however, quickly causes overlap among interventions, making inferences about the
likelihood of an intervention’s success impossible.
       We assume, as in Dominguez (2003, p. 34), that U.S. monetary authorities base a
decision to intervene on day t only on past information about exchange rates. We believe this to
be an accurate characterization of how U.S. policy makers generally reach their decision to
intervene, although the Desk may sometimes adjust the amount of an intervention in response to
market reactions (Neely 2001, Baillie and Osteberg 1997). If exchange-rate changes and
interventions are jointly determined on day t, our counts could contain a bias (Neely 2005).
                                                                                                  8

        Although we do not model a specific transmission mechanism for intervention, we
assume that intervention operates through an expectations channel. We are testing to see if U.S.
monetary authorities have an informational advantage that they impart to the market through
their interventions (ala Popper and Montgomery 2001). If central-bank intervention does indeed
impart new information to the market, private traders will immediately incorporate it into their
exchange-rate quotes. This information may be positive; that is, the market may interpret the
intervention in the manner that the central bank intends. Alternatively, this information may be
negative; that is, the market may react to an intervention in the opposite manner than the central
bank desires. Our tests look to uncover this.
4. Evaluation
       Following Henriksson and Merton (1981) and Merton (1981), we evaluate our success
count under the assumption that the number of successes is a hypergeometric random variable.
The hypergeometric distribution seems appropriate because it does not require individual
interventions to be independent events and does not depend on a presumed probability of an
individual success. To apply the Henriksson and Merton methodology, we must consider
intervention sales and purchases of foreign exchange separately.
       Our null hypothesis compares the actual and the expected success counts. We reject the
null and conclude that intervention has positive forecast value if the success count exceeds the
expected number by two standard deviations. We reject the null and conclude that intervention
has negative forecast value if the actual number of successes lies below the expected number by
more than two standard deviations. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that the
number of successes is not different than a number that could randomly occur given the near
martingale nature of daily exchange-rate changes.
         This approach also assumes that intervention does not change fundamental
macroeconomic determinants of exchange rates. This supposition seems appropriate given that
the Federal Reserve routinely sterilizes all U.S. interventions and given the lack of evidence that
sterilized intervention works through a portfolio-balance mechanism. The failure of this
assumption to hold would bias our results toward finding a high number of successes in any
sample.
         Table 1 presents our results for the entire sample period, 2 March 1973 through 19 March
1997.6 During these 6,274 business days, the United States intervened on 971 days against
German marks and on 243 days against Japanese yen.7 The first intervention against German
marks took place on 10 July 1973, and the first intervention against Japanese yen followed on 24
January 1974. The United States intervened against German marks roughly four times as often
as it did against Japanese yen. Roughly 60 percent of U.S. interventions against Japanese yen
involved purchases of yen, suggesting that the United States often thought that the market
overpriced the dollar. Interventions against the German mark were more evenly distributed
between purchases and sales of marks, with only a slight bias toward mark purchases. (See,
however, the discussion of pre-1980 interventions in section 5.)
        The first column in table 1 lists the success criteria for the German marks (top section)
and Japanese yen (bottom section). The second column shows official U.S. intervention
purchases and sales. Between 2 March 1973 and 19 March 1997, for example, the United States
sold German marks on 469 days and bought German marks on 502 days. The next two columns
of data show intervention successes. Of the 469 U.S. sales of German marks, 136, or 29.0
                                                                                                     9

percent, were successful under criterion SC1; that is, each of these 136 interventions was
associated with a same-day dollar appreciation. The next two columns show virtual successes.
Virtual successes follow the respective success criteria outlined in equations 1 through 3, absent
any consideration of intervention. The dollar, for example, appreciated against the German
mark—whether or not the United States intervened against marks—on 2,951, or 47.0 percent, of
the 6,274 business days in our sample.
        The final two columns in table 1 refer to the hypergeometric distribution. If successes are
hypergeometric random variables, then in a sample of 6,274 observations with a virtual success
rate of 47.0 percent, we would expect to observe 221 successes in 469 interventions, purely by
chance. The observed number of successes, 136, falls more than two standard deviations below
the expected value, implying that the United States had negative forecast value. This value is so
low that market participants, who knew when the United States intervened, could have bet
against the United States—bought German marks on day t—and made money on average. From
an expectations-channel perspective, a U.S. sale of German marks signaled that the dollar would
depreciate over the same day as the intervention. Similar results hold for purchases of German
marks, implying that the United States had negative forecast value in this case too. The
corresponding success counts for U.S. official interventions against Japanese yen, however, were
no different than random.
        In contrast to the results under success criterion SC1, the success counts under SC2, for
both U.S. interventions against German marks and Japanese yen, are more than two standard
deviations above their expected values, indicating that U.S. interventions had positive forecast
value with respect to criterion SC2. When the dollar is depreciating and the United States sells
foreign exchange, it is a good bet that the dollar will continue to depreciate, but will do so by less
than on the day prior to the intervention. Likewise, when the dollar is appreciating and the
United States buys foreign exchange, it is a good bet that the dollar will continue to appreciate,
but will do so by less than on the day prior to the intervention.
       While the successes under criterion SC2 clearly exceed the expected number, the overall
frequency of this type of success is fairly low. Only 23 percent of all U.S. interventions against
German marks and 19 percent of all U.S. interventions against Japanese yen were successful
under the SC2 criterion.
        The final, general success criterion, SC3, combines SC1 and SC2. Generally, we expect
that approximately 60 percent of all interventions will be successful under at least one of our
success criteria purely by chance. (See the virtual counts under SC3 in table 1.) The total
number of actual successes under SC3 is—in all but one case—no better than random. The
exception is the total for U.S. sales of German marks, which falls more than two standard
deviations below the expected number.
5. Robustness
       We repeated our counting analysis for various subperiods as a robustness check. We start
by dividing the sample into two parts: The first broad subperiod runs from 2 March 1973, when
generalized floating was just beginning, through 17 April 1981, when the Reagan administration
announced its minimalist intervention strategy. The second broad subperiod extends from 20
April 1981, the start of the minimalist period, through 19 March 1997, the end of our sample
period. Next, we divided each of these two subperiods further.
                                                                                                  10

        Table 2 summarizes our results for the various subperiods, with N and P indicating that
the number of actual successes for a specific criterion was, respectively, two standard deviations
below or above the expected number and suggesting, respectively, that intervention had negative
or positive forecast value for a designated criterion.8 An R in table 2 indicates that the observed
number of successes was no different than the number that we expect purely by chance.
        The table cautions that overall conclusions about intervention are not necessarily robust
across time periods or across currencies within any time period. Nevertheless, some relatively
persistent patterns stand out: First, U.S. intervention in German marks prior to 17 April 1981
universally had negative forecast value (N) with respect to criterion SC1 and universally had
positive forecast value (P) with respect to criterion SC2. Often during this time period—certainly
before 15 September 1977—the United States feared that private traders might interpret an
intervention as a sign that the dollar was fundamentally weak and that market participants might
bet against the System’s interventions.9 Our results validate this concern. To avoid such an
adverse response, the United States typically transacted in small amounts through the agency of a
commercial bank in the broker’s market. Operating in this manner kept the System anonymous.
In addition, Green (1984, #127), who once managed U.S. foreign-exchange operations, suggests
that over this time period, U.S. policy makers usually only hoped to smooth exchange-rate
movements; that is, the United States usually cared more about results under SC2 than under SC1.
Moreover, despite what the numbers of purchases and sales might suggest, the United States
typically sought only to moderate dollar depreciations—not appreciations. The United States,
however, often financed its foreign-exchange sales through swap drawings and had to repurchase
the dollars to repay the swaps fairly quickly. These repurchases may have had no exchange-rate
objective, other than to avoid creating market disorder in the process.
        Second, U.S. interventions against Japanese yen prior to the Plaza Accord—with few
exceptions—seem unsuccessful under each of our three criteria. Prior to the Plaza Accord,
however, the United States rarely intervened against Japanese yen. With so few observations,
drawing firm conclusions about the success of U.S. interventions against Japanese yen may be
risky. (A similar caveat applies to the interventions against German marks over the 20 April
1981 through 29 March 1985 minimalist period.) Nevertheless, the counts do not seem
supportive of an active intervention strategy
        Third, the large U.S. interventions associated with the Plaza and Louvre Accords (1 April
1985 through 29 April 1988) and with the U.S. Treasury led interventions of the very late 1980s
and early 1990s, had overall success counts that were not obviously different than previous
episodes. Economists have often regarded the interventions following the Plaza and Louvre
accords as highly successful. The failure to find positive forecast value under SC1 suggests that
U.S. interventions could not have maintained a target-zone arrangement once the dollar reached
a band. We do, however, find evidence of positive forecast value under SC2 for U.S. purchases
and sales of German marks during the Plaza and Louvre period, for U.S. sales of Japanese yen
during both of the final two subperiods, and for U.S. purchases of yen in the last period.
        Fourth, U.S. interventions lack positive forecast value under success criterion, SC3,
during every subperiods portrayed in table 2. Our overall finding that fewer than 60 percent of
U.S. interventions had positive forecast value seems consistent across time periods and
currencies.
                                                                                                   11

6. Conditional Probability
        Tables 1 and 2 describe the unconditional probabilities of success under our three criteria.
U.S. monetary authorities, however, conceivably could have increased their odds of success by
altering the way in which they undertook an intervention. Tables 3 through 6 present a series of
probit regressions that attempt to describe how various conditioning variables affected the
outcome. Tables 3 and 5 show estimates for only U.S. interventions against German marks and
Japanese yen, respectively, over our entire sample period—2 March 1973 through 19 March
1997. Tables 4 and 6 consider shorter sample periods, which allow us to include, respectively,
published data on German and Japanese intervention in our probit regressions. Data on German
intervention against U.S. dollars are publicly available between 1 January 1976 and 29
December 1995, and data on Japanese intervention against U.S. dollars are publicly available
between 1 January 1991 and 19 March 1997. The dependent variable in all cases is our general
success criterion, SC3, since we do not know whether the United States was pursuing criterion
SC1 or SC2, at any particular time. The independent variables in the various probit regressions
appear in first columns of tables 3 through 6. We drop nonintervention days from the sample
and run the regression only over observations containing intervention.
        Although a few variables appear to be statistically significant in specific cases, the only
variable that consistently explains the likelihood of success across all of the estimates in tables 3
through 6 is the dollar amount of a U.S. intervention. The results for those other variables that
sometimes appear significant are either not robust to changes in the sample size (necessary to
include foreign intervention) or across currencies, or they prove collinear with the amount of
U.S. intervention.
        The United States, for example, often undertook intervention in concert with the
Bundesbank or the Bank of Japan. A coordination dummy is significant for the German mark at
time t, but lowers the likelihood of success (table 4). German intervention at t, however, appears
collinear with the amount of U.S. intervention. The United States spends more on average when
Germany has intervened ($113.4 million) than when Germany has not entered the market ($89.1
million). At time t+1, however, U.S.-Bundesbank coordination is not significant. When we add
the amount of German intervention at either time t or at time t+1 to U.S. intervention at time t to
construct a new amount variable consisting of the total amount of intervention (U.S. and/or
German), the amount is not significant. Given the time difference between Frankfurt and New
York and given the timing convention in this paper, German intervention at t and t+1 overlaps a
U.S. intervention on day t, so we should consider both measures of intervention. Similarly, the
coordination dummy for Japanese intervention on day t is significant and suggests that
coordinated intervention increases the likelihood of success. All but one U.S. intervention over
this period, however, are coordinated with Japan on day t, so the variable adds virtually no
additional information. Given the time difference between Tokyo and New York and given our
timing conventions, comparing Japanese intervention at t+1 with SC3 at time t seems
appropriate, but when we do so, the coefficient suggests that coordinated intervention lowers the
likelihood of success. When we instead add the amount of Japanese intervention at either time t
or time t+1 to U.S. intervention again creating a new series of total U.S. and/or Japanese
intervention, the amount is not statistically significant.
       The dummy variables that consider the sign on the previous day’s intervention—lagged
same-type intervention and lagged different-type intervention—are both significant in the
                                                                                                  12

German mark case (tables 3 and 4), but not in the Japanese yen case (tables 5 and 6). For the
German mark case, these variables seem collinear with the amount of U.S. intervention.
        Figure 1 uses the coefficient estimates for the amount of U.S. intervention (exclusive of
foreign-intervention variables) from tables 3 and 5 to estimate how the probability of success
responds to the size of intervention. Over the entire sample, the unconditional probability of a
successful intervention against German marks using the SC3 criterion is 57 percent, while the
probability of a virtual success is slightly higher, around 60 percent. Based on our estimates, a
U.S. intervention of $110 million against German marks has a 60 percent probability of being
successful. Over the entire sample period, 2 March 1973 through 19 March 1997, fewer than 25
percent of U.S. interventions against German marks were greater than $100 million. The mean
intervention in our sample was $80 million, while the median intervention was only $31 million.
The largest intervention against German marks amounted to $950 million. This amount is more
than twice as large as was necessary to virtually guarantee success, about $400 million, and
seems inefficiently large.
       Similarly, large interventions against Japanese yen increased the probability of success.
Over the entire sample, the unconditional probability of success (SC3) for interventions against
Japanese yen was 65 percent, somewhat higher than the probability of a virtual success at
roughly 60 percent. We find that a U.S. intervention against Japanese yen of $187 million had a
65 percent probability of success. Over the entire sample, the average U.S. intervention against
Japanese yen was $131 million, and the median intervention against Japanese yen equaled only
$90 million. The largest intervention against Japanese yen amounted to $800 million. As is the
case with U.S. intervention against German marks, this amount seems inefficiently large. We
estimate that a U.S. intervention of roughly $510 million is sufficient to virtually guarantee
success against Japanese yen.
7. Conclusion and Discussion
         Between the inception of generalized floating in 1973 and the FOMC’s abandonment of
its active intervention policy in 1995, approximately 60 percent of all official U.S. transactions in
the foreign-exchange market were associated with a same-day exchange-rate movement that U.S.
authorities could have easily deemed a success. Given the near-martingale nature of exchange-
rate changes, this percentage is no different than what we expect to find purely by chance.
Overall, U.S. intervention lacked value as a forecast of near-term exchange-rate movements.
        This general result, however, combines two very different outcomes: U.S. intervention
sales and purchases of foreign exchange were generally incapable of forecasting dollar
appreciations or depreciations, respectively. This negative result is robust across all time periods
and both of the currencies that we considered, and prior to 1981, private-market participants
could have profitably bet against U.S. interventions in German marks. In sharp contrast, we do
find that U.S. intervention was associated with more moderate movements in the dollar in a
manner consistent with leaning against the wind. A private trader observing U.S. intervention
usually could have predicted this outcome. Neely and Weller (1997) and LeBaron (1999) cite
leaning-against-the-wind intervention strategies as a reason for their finding that intervention
improves the profitability of technical trading rules. That said, only about 22 percent of all U.S.
interventions conformed to this pattern, and the result—while strong—is not universal across
every time period and currency.
                                                                                                 13

       Our findings do not seem to reflect a purely U.S. phenomenon. Using like techniques,
Chaboud and Humpage (2005) and Humpage and Ragnartz (2005) found similar results for
Japanese interventions between 1991 and 2004 and Swedish interventions between 1993 and
2002, respectively.
       While our criteria are consistent with the notion of a successful intervention, they are not
the only conceivable criteria. Greene (1984 #129) suggests some other criteria—for example
wide bid-ask spreads—that U.S. monetary authorities have viewed as consistent with market
disorder. Moreover, intervention, or even the threat of intervention, can affect market
expectations and actions in ways that such criteria cannot easily capture. Galati, Melick, and
Micu (2005), for example, investigate how the higher moments of market expectations, which
they derive from the distribution of option prices, respond to intervention.
        We also found some evidence that the likelihood of success—measured broadly (SC3)—
increased with the amount of intervention. Large U.S. interventions may convey private
information better than small transactions. Our analysis suggests, however, that an intervention
above approximately $400 million against German marks or $500 million against Japanese yen
virtually guaranteed success. The three percent of all U.S. interventions that exceeded this
amount were inefficiently large.
        We did not find evidence that coordinated intervention increased the likelihood of
success. The empirical evidence on coordination seems mixed. Humpage (1999) found that
coordination increased the probability of success by roughly 20 percent during the Louvre period
(1987-1990). Dominquez and Frankel (1993a 1993b) also found in favor of coordination.
Humpage and Osterberg (1992), however, found that unilateral U.S. interventions were more
effective than coordinated interventions between 1983 and 1990. Chaboud and Humpage (2005)
found only weak evidence that coordination increased the probability of success for Japanese
interventions against dollars between 1991 and 2004. The importance of coordination may be
situational.
        Also controversial is the relative importance of secrecy to an intervention’s effectiveness.
Given that intervention often operates through an expectations channel, secrecy may seem
counterproductive, but Bhattacharya and Weller (1997) and Vitale (1999) present theoretical
models in which secrecy contributes to an intervention’s success. Dominguez and Frankel
(1993a), Hung (1997), Chiu (2003), and Beine and Bernal (2007) also discuss various reasons
for maintaining secrecy. Prior to the late 1970s, the System usually operated covertly.
Thereafter, the System usually operated openly. In comparing our results across time periods
consisting of various degrees of secrecy, we find no reason to believe that secrecy is important
for success.
       Overall our analysis of the U.S. experience with sterilized foreign-exchange intervention
between 1973 and 1997 cautions against a return to an active intervention policy. Our results
suggest that U.S. policymakers did not routinely have private information useful for price
discovery in the foreign-exchange market. Sterilized intervention seemed more of a hit-or-miss
phenomenon than a sure bet. Chairman Greenspan’s observation, cited at the head of this paper,
may have been a bit strong, but not by much.

                                   Appendix: Supplemental Tables
        This Appendix presents the eight tables summarized in table 2 of the text. Each of these
tables corresponds exactly to the methodology use to construct table 1, which we explained in
section 4 of this paper, except that we estimated each table for a separate subperiod.
       Table A1 covers all U.S. interventions from the inception of generalized floating until the
United States first abandoned its active intervention policy in 1981.
       Table A1.1 considers intervention during the early dollar float, 1973-1977. Interventions
were generally small, conducted primarily by the Federal Reserve through the brokers market to
maintain anonymity, and generally financed through swap drawings.
       Table A1.2 covers the dollar crisis of 1977 through 1979. Intervention became larger,
more frequent, less covert, and with more Treasury involvement. Swap lines remained a
predominant source of funds.
        Table A1.3 focuses on the period 1979 to 1981when the dollar was beginning to
strengthen, and the United States was attempting to acquire a portfolio of foreign exchange to
avoid using the swap lines.
       Table A2 covers all U.S. interventions from the first minimalist intervention period in
1981 until the end of our sample in 1997. The active intervention policy ended in 1995. These
interventions were generally larger, more frequent, and more overt. The United States generally
financed them from its own portfolio of foreign exchange and split the transactions 50/50
between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
       Table A2.1 considers the minimalist intervention policy of the Regan administration,
1981 – 1985. The interventions were very infrequent.
       Table A2.2 covers the heavy interventions associated with the Plaza and Louvre accords,
1985 – 1988. These were often coordinated with foreign central banks and widely announced.
        Table A2.3 covers the heavy intervention in the late 1980s and early 1990s that prompted
the FOMC’s concerns about its monetary credibility and the winding down of U.S. intervention
policy.

            If a country is in a liquidity trap and long-term domestic government securities—the traditional vehicles
of quantitative easing —are perfect substitutes for base or in short supply, then conducting open-market operations
through foreign exchange (and other types of assets) may be advisable (see McCallum 2003).
         2
          Edison (1993), Alkeminders (1995), Baillie, Humpage and Osterberg (2000), and Sarno and Taylor
(2001) provide excellent surveys of intervention. Nealy (2005) also touches on some econometric issues.
         3
           The portfolio balance mechanism also assumes that no restrictions exist on cross-border financial flows
and that Ricardian equivalence does not hold.
         4
          Most models assume that relative changes in the stock of securities leave interest rates unaffected
because monetary policy determines interest rates. This need not be the case.
         5
           The United States conducts most U.S. interventions, by far, in the New York market, but has on occasion
placed orders through correspondents in both the European and Far Eastern markets. We cannot isolate these
transactions.
         6
            The United States did not abruptly end its intervention on 19 March 1997. U.S. interventions began to
taper off in the early 1990s. After August 1995, the United States intervened against Japanese yen on 17 June 1998,
against euros on 22 September 2000, and again against Japanese yen on 18 March 2011. These last three
interventions are the only instances of U.S. intervention during the floating exchange rate era not included in our
analysis. Our exchange-rate data determined our sample, which ends on 19 March 1997.
         7
           The United States intervened against some other European currencies during the 1970s and early 1980s,
but data on these currencies are not available.
         8
            An appendix in the working paper version of this paper contains the detailed data that we used to
construct table 2.
         9
             Bordo, Humpage and Schwartz (2010a) provide a detailed discussion of intervention during prior to
1981.
