Tax Prices and Charitable Giving: Projected Changes in Donations Under the 2017 TCJA

                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate the tax price elasticity of charitable giving using newly-available data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics spanning 2001-2017. We find that households that always itemize are
less sensitive to changes in the tax treatment of donations than house-holds that switch itemizing
status. We apply these results to the provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, taking into
account the marginal propensity to donate from the increase in disposable income expected for
most households, and predict significant reductions in charitable giving.

1. Introduction
        The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made significant changes to the rate

structure of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States.1 One of the many activities

potentially affected by this change in marginal tax rates ­ and, in particular, the near-

doubling of the standard deduction ­ is charitable giving. At the time of its debate and

passage, many commentators asserted that charitable giving would be reduced (see, e.g.

McQueeney, 2017). Indeed, recently-released aggregate data does indicate a decline of 3.4

percent in giving by individuals in 2018 (GivingUSA, 2019), though drawing a direct causal

relationship is difficult because of other changes in economic conditions and incentives to

shift giving into the 2017 tax year. Charitable giving is sensitive to macroeconomic condi-

tions (List and Peysakhovich, 2011; Meer, Miller, Wulfsberg, 2017), and this likely impacted

giving (Osili and Zarins, 2019).

        By reducing marginal tax rates by 1 to 4 percentage points, the TCJA increases the

tax price of giving for those who itemize their deductions. For those households, each dollar

donated to a qualifying charity reduces their taxable income by one dollar, thus lowering

their tax liability by their marginal tax rate. More importantly, though, the increase in the

standard deduction means that far fewer households are expected to itemize, thus eliminat-

ing the direct tax incentive to make a charitable donation; projections suggest that the

proportion of itemizing tax filing units will fall from about 25 percent to about 11 or 12

percent (Gale et al., 2018; Joint Committee on Taxation, 2018).

1
  For procedural reasons, the formal title of the bill is "Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II
and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018." We will refer to it by its colloquial
name throughout for brevity. Other major provisions in the individual income tax code include the elimination
of the personal exemption (and therefore its phase-out), the elimination of the Pease phase-out for itemized
deductions, a cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, an increase in the child tax credit, and the use
of chained CPI to index provisions of the tax code. The maximum amount of the charitable giving deduction
was increased from 50% of Adjusted Gross Income to 60%, which Duquette (2019) suggests will increase
charitable giving by high-income donors substantially. Changes were also made to the estate tax, which may
affect charitable bequests (see Bakija, Gale, and Slemrod, 2003; Joulfaian, 1991; and Meer and Rosen, 2013).
                                                                                             2


       The deduction for charitable giving has existed since the War Revenue Act of 1917,

with the justification that charitable organizations may provide valuable societal services

while being more responsive than the government. Prior to the TCJA, this provision reduced

federal income tax revenue by approximately $57 billion, with about 70 percent of that

benefit accruing to households earning over $200,000 per year. Estimates of the reduction

in itemized giving suggest that the effects of this provision fell to about $40 billion in 2018

(JCT 2017, 2018). For a discussion of tax policy and charitable giving, see Bakija (2013),

Clotfelter (2016), and Duquette (forthcoming); for a broader look at motivations for phi-

lanthropy, see Bekkers and Wiepking (2012) and Gee and Meer (2019).

       We provide new estimates of the tax price elasticity of charitable giving using nine

waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), spanning 2001-2017, and apply these

estimates to the provisions of the TCJA; we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of

these data below. Because of the large number of households that make no donations, we

separately estimate the likelihood of giving and the amount given conditional on making a

donation using fixed effects models and combine these estimates for an overall effect on

donations. Further, since the tax price of giving is endogenous ­ that is, those who donate

large amounts may lower their marginal tax rates, leading to a spurious correlation ­ we

follow much of the existing literature and instrument with the "first-dollar price." That is,

we estimate what the household's price of giving would have been without any donations

and use that as a proxy for the actual price of giving.

       We also examine for the marginal propensity to donate from income (see Meer and

Priday, 2019, for more details). The TCJA lowered tax liability for about 80 percent of

households, with an average reduction of about $1,600 for all tax units (Gale et al., 2018).

The increase in disposable income should increase giving to some degree, offsetting some of

the reduction due to an increase in the tax price. Previous academic research on this topic
                                                                                                          3


has focused on the direct impact of a change in the tax price of giving, holding all else

constant. But a full accounting of the impact of the TCJA on giving should include this

change in income.2

        In line with the previous literature, we find that charitable giving is responsive to

tax incentives. A 10 percent increase in the price of giving (equivalent to a reduction in

marginal tax rates from, for example, 30 percent to 23 percent) is expected to reduce giving

by 10.7 percent, though effects are smaller for those who continue to itemize. We find that

the marginal propensity to donate is small and, for most households, the size of the increase

in disposable income from the TCJA is sufficiently low that this term does not affect the

overall estimates very much.3 Given that the TCJA is expected to significantly alter item-

izing behavior, we estimate our results separately for households that always itemize and

those that switch; we find that switchers tend to be more sensitive to the tax price. We also

find that there are some lagged effects, suggesting that taxpayers take some time to adjust

their giving to changes in the tax code.

        Of course, our work is subject to limitations. In particular, the PSID does not include

many very high earners, who make a large proportion of charitable donations. For example,

tax units with earnings over $2 million made $63 billion in deductible contributions in 2016,

or about 30 percent of the total, despite making up about 0.1 percent of the population

(IRS, 2018). But there are only two such observations in the PSID in that year. We apply

our estimates to data from the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income to provide

some indication of expected effects on these households.


2
  There are several thorough and in-depth projections of the TCJA's effect on charitable giving, including
Brill and Choe (2018), Gleckman (2018), and IUPUI (2017, 2019). These estimates suggest a reduction of
about 4-5% in individual giving. However, these studies draw on an older literature for estimates of the tax
price elasticity of giving and do not account for potentially countervailing income effects.
3
  Our fixed effects specification controls for permanent income, and we include controls for wealth, so this
might best be viewed as the marginal propensity to donate from transitory income. Further details are in
Meer and Priday (2019).
                                                                                                              4


        In Section 2, we briefly review the literature on tax incentives for charitable giving.

In Section 3, we discuss the PSID and its advantages and disadvantages for this type of

analysis, as well as our econometric specification. Section 4 lays out the results, and Section

5 concludes.



2. Previous Literature
        The rich literature on the impact of tax policy on charitable giving stretches back

over a half-century.4 Even limiting the focus to papers that use data from the United States,

there is huge variety: the use of administrative tax data vs. surveys, panel data vs. cross-

sections, approaches to dealing with those who do not make a donation, the inclusion of

bequest giving, breakdowns by income level, and the examination of permanent vs. transi-

tory changes in tax prices and income. Peloza and Steel (2005) provide a meta-analysis of

sixty-nine papers from this earlier literature and find a weighted average of elasticities of

about -1.1 when excluding outliers. More recently, Bakija and Heim (2011) use variation in

federal and state tax rates on a panel of high-income taxpayers between 1979 and 2006,

where nearly all of the observations in the sample have a positive amount of charitable

giving. They find that giving is responsive to its tax price, as well as evidence that house-

holds adjust to tax changes over time.

        Duquette (2016) takes a different approach, examining charities' revenues rather than

individuals' donations. He finds significantly larger estimates of the tax price of giving, with

an elasticity of about -4 and meaningful differences across types of charities.5 Backus and

and Zieschang (1985), Feenberg (1987), Randolph (1995), Auten, Sieg, and Clotfelter (2002), among many
others.

  Meer (2014) discusses the effects of the price of giving in different contexts, including the impact of fund-
raising or administrative costs and matches, and compares these estimates to the tax price elasticity of giving.

Grant (2019), using earlier waves of the PSID, argue that the inclusion of a control for

itemizing status is important to account for endogeneity arising from idiosyncratic shocks

to giving that change itemization. They concede, though, that if the act of itemizing has its

own direct effect on giving, then this term will also reflect a price effect.6 This potential

"itemization effect" is not novel (Boskin and Feldstein, 1977), but has received little atten-

tion in the literature, likely because of the difficulty in providing causal estimates. Ottoni-

Wilhelm and Hungerman (2007) address it by separately estimating price elasticities for

households that always itemize and those that switch between itemizing and not itemizing.

We follow their approach, which is particularly valuable in analyzing the TCJA and its large

impact on the likelihood of itemizing. They find that "switchers" are much more price-

elastic than always-itemizers.7 In later work, Hungerman and Ottoni-Wilhelm (2016) use a

state-level tax credit for donations to educational institutions and find a lower elasticity

than the rest of the literature, with estimates around -0.2.

        Recent evidence from other countries also suggests that charitable contributions are

sensitive to their tax treatment. Adena (2014) and Bönke and Werdt (2015) find that higher-

income households in Germany have relatively high tax-price elasticities. Almunia, Lock-

wood, and Scharf (2018) find elasticities of about -0.35 in the United Kingdom, while Fack

and Landais (2010) find elasticities of -0.2 to -0.6 from France's generous tax subsidies.

        A frequently-discussed issue in the literature is that short-run responses to tax in-

centives may be larger than long-run responses because individuals may change the timing




Hungerman and Ottoni-Wilhelm (2016) directly compare tax- and match-elasticities for a state-level tax in-
centive for giving to higher education.
6
  The inclusion of this term changes our estimated elasticity from -1.07 to -0.66, but interpretation of this
estimate is unclear given the potential "itemization effect."
7
  They also disaggregate giving into religious and secular causes, though the differences in price elasticities are
not necessarily significant. Brooks (2007) finds that the price elasticity of giving differs across causes.
                                                                                                           6


of their giving to take advantage of changes in the law (Randolph, 1995; Auten, Sieg, Clot-

felter, 2002; Bakija and Heim, 2011). Ottoni-Wilhelm and Hungerman (2007) argue that

policymaking in recent years, with tax bills going into effect on short notice and sometimes

retroactively, make it difficult for households to anticipate future tax rates. But as discussed

in Section 3.3, this issue may be a particular concern with the response to the TCJA.



3. Data and Specification
          3.1 Data

          The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a biennial household survey that

collects information from the previous year on wealth, income sources, and a rich set of

household characteristics. The Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS) data is a

PSID module that includes charitable activity to religious and ten types of secular charities.

We aggregate household giving to all charities for our primary analysis.

          The PSID is especially advantageous for analyzing charitable activity. Wilhelm

(2006) shows that the data are superior to other surveys, and compare well to tax return

data below relatively high levels of income. While tax return data have the advantage of

being more precise and covering high earners, donations only appear in tax data if the

household itemizes. This excludes over two-thirds of tax filing units and results in a sample

selected for higher income levels. This selection precludes estimating tax price elasticities of

giving for households who itemize in some years but not in others. Unlike the PSID, tax

return data do not disaggregate giving by charity type. Further, data on wealth are not

available on tax returns, which is an important determinant of donative behavior (Bakija

and Heim, 2011; James and Sharpe, 2007).8




8
    Duquette (2018) and Splinter (2019) discuss the impact of inequality on donations by high-income donors.
                                                                                                             7


        We use nine waves of the PSID spanning 2001-2017. These represent every other

calendar year from 2000-2016. The raw sample has 16,146 households with 76,784 house-

hold-year observations. We remove 166 observations with negative net-of-tax income. We

also remove the low income Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) oversample and the

2017 Immigrant Refresher.9 Consistent with prior literature on tax price elasticities, we omit

households that are "endogenous itemizers" ­ those who would not itemize if they had zero

charitable contributions (Clotfelter, 1980; Backus and Grant, 2019; Ottoni-Wilhelm and

Hungerman, 2007). These households are more likely to be making the decisions of whether

to itemize and how much to donate simultaneously; their inclusion in the estimation makes

elasticities appear larger in magnitude than they are in reality. There are 1,776 endogenous

itemizer observations. To avoid introducing more measurement error from selectively elimi-

nating observations, we remove all observations for a household that ever endogenously

itemized (7,026 observations or 951 households).10 This leaves us with a final sample of

45,941 observations for 9,711 households. Across all household-years, 56% of households

make a donation. Conditional on making a donation, the average (median) gift is $2,045

($750). The mean (median) income of our sample is $85,696 ($61,158).

        High-income households constitute a large portion of annual donations but are not

sampled in large numbers in the PSID. To make predictions about changes in giving for

these households, we use summary information on tax returns from the IRS Statistics of

Income (SOI).11 These tables provide estimates of the number of filers, totals from various



9
   The 2017 Immigrant Refresher was intended to update the PSID sample to be more representative of the
US demographic composition, but only appears for one year in our data. The SEO oversamples low income
households which disproportionately lowers the average income of our sample. Combined, omitting them from
our sample removes 23,651 observations. Including the oversample and refresher do not change the total
elasticity estimate by a meaningful amount.
10
   We also estimate our specifications including these observations. Counterintuitively, we find that giving is
less responsive with respect to the tax respect including this sample, with an elasticity of -0.79.
11
   Specifically, we use the Individual Statistical Tables by Size of Adjusted Gross Income, Table 1.4 and 2.1.
                                                                                                           8


income sources, and itemized deductions stated in individual income tax returns. Donations

are only observed in tax data if the filer itemizes deductions, which most high earners do.

We use these tables to generate a "representative tax filing unit" within four bins of adjusted

gross income: $500k - $1M, $1M - $5M, $5M - $10M, and $10M+.

        We use the National Bureau of Economic Research's TAXSIM program to calculate

tax liability for each tax filing year in our sample (Feenberg and Coutts, 1993). TAXSIM

uses tax-relevant household characteristics, sources of income, and deductions to calculate

state and federal tax rates and liabilities. We use these tax liabilities to construct the tax

price of giving for household i in year t. In the literature, this is typically addressed by

calculating the price as 1 -   , where  is a binary variable equal to one if household i

itemizes in year t and  is the marginal tax rate. Calculating  is not always straightfor-

ward, however, because of phase-ins and phase-outs of various credits and deductions, state

treatments of charitable contributions, interactions with state taxes, and other vagaries of

the tax code.12 TAXSIM accounts for all these components simultaneously when estimating

tax liability. We therefore estimate the tax price of giving as:

                                                   - 
                                            = 1 +
                                                  100
where  is the tax liability for household i in year t and  is the tax liability calculated

after adding $100 to charitable donations.  therefore reflects the estimated tax burden

less the marginal tax benefit of donating.13 Donating more will never increase tax liability,

so  is always less than  , which bounds   [0,1].14


12
   There are 42 states that allow charitable deductions on state tax returns and 6 states that allow federal
taxes to be deducted. See Duquette et al. (2019) for a discussion of the efficacy of state tax incentives for
charitable giving.
13
   We also estimated the models with the more-traditional approach of calculating marginal tax rates to find
the tax price of giving. Results were similar, though there were a number of unusual marginal tax rates due
to notches, kinks, and phase-outs.
14
   The small number of households who are predicted to begin itemizing when $100 is added to their charita-
ble contributions are given a price of 1.
                                                                                                              9


        However,  is endogenous because households can increase donations enough to

move into a lower tax bracket. This, in turn, makes  endogenous, as noted by Auten,

Sieg, and Clotfelter (2002). We address this issue by modifying a standard approach in this

literature: by constructing a "zero-dollar" rate where  is calculated with giving set to zero

and  with giving set to $100 for i in t.15 The corresponding zero-dollar price is used to

instrument for the tax price  .16

        The PSID asks respondents whether or not they itemized deductions on their taxes.

Ottoni-Wilhelm and Hungerman (2007) note that this itemization status is measured with

error, especially for low-income respondents who over-report itemizing. We instead use item-

ization status calculated by TAXSIM.17 Though the calculated itemization status likely also

introduces some measurement error, we avoid the endogeneity of self-reporting.

        We use a similar approach in TAXSIM with high-income bins from the SOI data as

with PSID. We observe the percentage of each AGI bin that itemizes its deductions. We use

TAXSIM to estimate a single  and  for the itemizers within each bin to find the tax

prices because only itemizers have a charitable contributions average listed. For simplicity,

we assume that non-itemizers have $0 of itemizable expenses and a tax price of 1. Section

4.3 discusses in more detail how these estimates are applied.

        We use the 2017 wave (2016 tax year) of the PSID to predict changes in giving from

the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The TCJA affected giving primarily through two

channels: the standard deduction nearly doubled for all filers, removing the incentive to



15
   See Ottoni-Wilhelm and Hungerman (2007), Auten, Sieg, Clotfelter (2002), Backus and Grant (2019), among
many others.
16
   About 5 percent of the sample has a zero-dollar tax price that differs from its actual tax price. This is not
an uncommon issue in this literature, as discussed by Backus and Grant (2019).
17
   Reported and calculated itemization status agree for 80 percent of observations in our sample. 15 percent
report itemizing when we calculate that they shouldn't have and 5 percent report not itemizing when they
should have. Benzarti (2019) finds that some taxpayers do not itemize even when it is advantageous to do so
due to high compliance costs.
                                                                                             10


itemize for large portions of itemizers, and changing marginal tax rates. Consistent with

other projections, we see the proportion of itemizers go from 19.9 percent in 2016 to an

estimated 7.0 percent under our TCJA counterfactual; the overall rates are lower than those

found by others because many itemizers have incomes at levels that are not well-represented

in the PSID.


       3.2 Specification

       We estimate the impact of income and the tax price of giving on the extensive and

intensive margins of giving separately, then combine the estimates, using two-stage least

squares with household and year fixed effects for each specification. Other controls include

bins for the level of household wealth; indicators for marital status, whether the head of the

household is retired or disabled, his or her self-reported health status, and religious affilia-

tion; continuous variables for household head's age and its quadratic, number of children, a

housing price index and its quadratic; as well as state and year effects.

       Previous work using samples of high-income taxpayers had few non-givers (e.g.

Bakija and Heim, 2011) and did not have to address the well-known problems with obser-

vations censored at zero. Including non-donors in the analysis directly may bias findings

towards less elastic estimates. Other work uses the Tobit (e.g. Brooks, 2007), though this

model suffers from tractability problems with fixed effects, is likely not appropriate when

zeroes arise from corner solutions rather than true data censoring, and constrains the mar-

ginal effects on the extensive and intensive margins to be related by a constant. This last

issue is particularly problematic when considering the impact of, say, income, which may

have very different impacts on the likelihood of making a donation and the amount given.
                                                                                                            11


The two-part hurdle model separates the decision of whether to give from how much to give

conditional on making a donation.18 Standard errors are clustered at the household level.

        The inclusion of household fixed effects controls for time-invariant factors that are

correlated with giving and the tax price. The most important of these may be unobserved

altruism. For example, more generous individuals may be more likely to succeed in the

workplace, leading to a spurious correlation between donations, income, and tax rates.

Changes in altruistic behavior that are correlated with changes in income may still lead to

spurious correlation, though, such as if a pay raise coincides with a need to signal generosity

to others. Additionally, these fixed effects control, in part, for permanent income. We also

include controls for household wealth to further account for permanent income.

        Since the amount of charitable giving can affect a household's marginal tax rate, the

price of giving is endogenous. As discussed above, we construct an instrument calculating

the tax price of giving with donations set equal to zero. This will be correlated with the

household's actual price, but variation therein is driven by changes in the tax code, rather

than any decision of the household itself.


        3.3 Limitations

        Like all of the literature on this empirically-challenging question, our work is subject

to a number of limitations.

        As mentioned previously, the PSID has very few observations on high-income house-

holds, who make the majority of donations. Further, the data are arranged at the household

level rather than by tax filing unit. This not only makes direct comparisons to previous

work using tax returns difficult, but also introduces measurement error into the calculation


18
  See Huck and Rasul (2011) and Meer (2011) for more discussion on the use of this specification for estimates
of charitable giving responses; Wilhelm (2008) compares the Tobit to other specifications for charitable giving
estimation. Recent work by Almunia, Lockwood, and Scharf (2018) emphasizes the importance of estimating
tax price effects on the extensive margin of giving.

of the tax price of giving (Butrica and Burkhauser, 1997). For example, a household in the

PSID may include two tax filing units (such as a dependent who earns income); the house-

hold may be assigned a higher marginal tax rate based on its total income than the tax

filing units have on their own.

       The TCJA's effects may also take some time to be felt fully. Short-run impacts may

be larger or smaller than those in the longer run. Donors may have moved giving into 2017

to take advantage of higher tax prices, leading to overestimates of the law's impact on

aggregate giving. On the other hand, it may take some time for taxpayers to change their

behavior in response to the new law, as the results detailed below suggest. Further, the

TCJA incentivizes households to give less frequently but in larger amounts to reach the

itemization threshold; the pattern of giving among donors around these cutoffs may change.

The increasing popularity of donor-advised funds may play a role in this kind of timing

behavior (Andreoni, 2018). The biennial structure of the PSID makes it more difficult to

identify these shifts.

       Finally, we are applying estimates from a time period with less radical changes in

the tax code than the TCJA, at least in regard to the size of the standard deduction. It is

unclear whether our results are fully applicable to the specific parameters of the law. Our

findings are best viewed as an approximation rather than a firm prediction.



4. Results
       4.1 Tax Price of Giving

       We begin by estimating the effect of the tax price of giving on the extensive and

intensive margins separately. Table 2 shows these results, which also include the controls

described in Section 3.2. Column 1 estimates the effect on the extensive margin, and indi-

cates that a 10 percent increase in the tax price of giving reduces the likelihood of making
                                                                                              13


any donation by 1.3 percentage points, a statistically significant change and about a 3

percent change of the mean giving rate. Column 3 estimates the effect on the intensive

margin of giving; a 10 percent increase in the tax price reduces the amount given conditional

on giving by 3.4 percent. As discussed above, this estimate should not be interpreted as a

reflection of the treatment of a higher tax price, since it also reflects a change in the com-

position of givers. Combining these effects to find the overall tax price elasticity of giving

in Column 5, we find that a 10 percent increase in the tax price reduces giving by 10.7

percent. This elasticity is in line with the vast majority of previous work, and suggests that

giving is responsive to its tax treatment.

       We also examine how charitable giving responds to increases in income in Table 2,

noting that we also control for wealth and individual fixed effects; as such, these results

should be interpreted as the impact of additional income for a particular household, holding

all else equal. The marginal propensity to donate out of income is fairly low: our estimates

suggest that, on average, households will donate about 45 cents from an additional $100 of

income.

       Table 3 reports the impact of the tax price of giving on donations including lead and

lag terms. As discussed above, there is concern in the literature about anticipatory effects,

as well as the possibility that taxpayers take time to fully adjust to a new tax regime.

Column 1 includes a term for the lead of the log of tax price (instrumented with the lead

of the log of the zero-dollar tax price). We find little evidence of anticipatory or timing

effects; the coefficient is fairly small and imprecisely estimated. This is perhaps unsurprising,

given that the PSID's waves are two years apart. Few of the tax changes over the past two

decades have had sufficient time between passage and enactment for households to adjust

their giving behavior in such a manner (Ottoni-Wilhelm and Hungerman, 2007). Column 2

includes a lag for the log of the tax price (also instrumented). The lag term ­ again, for two
                                                                                                             14


years prior ­ is statistically significant and about two-thirds the size of the contemporaneous

term. This suggests that even two years after a tax change, households are still responsive

to the tax price they faced previously; that is, they adjust slowly. Column 3 includes both

a lead and a lag term. The leading term remains small and statistically indistinguishable

from zero, while the lagged term does not change much in magnitude or precision. Taken

together, this suggests that the effects on charitable giving of changes to the tax code like

the TCJA will grow over the first few years after implementation.

        Accounting for differences in behavior by switchers and always-itemizers is a matter

of some contention (Backus and Grant, 2019). We follow Ottoni-Wilhelm and Hungerman

(2007) and divide the sample into households who always itemize and households that switch

itemizing status over the sample period in Table 4. As discussed in Section 3.3, it is difficult

to know how applicable these results are to changes wrought by the TCJA. In our sample,

less than 10 percent of households change itemizing status in each year; 21 percent of house-

holds ever change itemizing status and 5.1 percent always itemize.

        But the TCJA is projected to significantly reduce the prevalence of itemizing, espe-

cially for the income groups with representation in the PSID. Among units earning between

$100,000 and $200,000, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that itemizing will fall

from 63 percent to 22 percent. Put another way, the composition of switchers and always-

itemizers will change. Itemizing is less likely to change for very high income households;

average itemized deductions for units earning over $1 million were $465,000 in 2016, far

above the new level of the standard deduction (IRS, 2018).19

        We find that always-itemizers are much less sensitive to the tax price of giving. The

estimated tax price elasticity is -0.79 and is not statistically significantly different than zero,


19
   The elimination of the Pease phase-out for itemized giving also increases the overall value of itemized
deductions for households with incomes at the top of the distribution, though this does not affect the tax price
of giving.
                                                                                                         15


as the estimate is quite noisy. The elasticity for switchers, though, is -1.24 and statistically

significant. There are a number of possible reasons for this difference. Switchers may be

more aware of the impact of itemizing ­ and therefore the tax price ­ on their giving. They

may be more strategic in the timing of their giving. Further, the changes in their tax prices

from year to year are much larger than for always-itemizers.20 As such, the data cover a

broader range of price changes and may reflect a different relationship than that for the

always-itemizers.


        4.2 Projections for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act

        The TCJA changed both the price of giving (by altering the standard deduction and

marginal tax rates) and the amount of money available to donate by changing tax liabilities.

To estimate the net predicted changes under the TCJA, we separately estimate the price

and income effects on giving for 10 bins of income from the PSID. Projections for higher-

income households are discussed in Section 4.3.

        We use the 2016 PSID data from the 2017 wave to project tax prices and post-tax

income for 2018 by using TAXSIM under TCJA policies rather than those in place in 2016.21

We follow TAXSIM's predictions of who would itemize in 2016 and 2018 based on relevant

deductions; itemizing behavior changes dramatically for households in the PSID sample. For

example, Table 5A shows that 46.1 percent of households with AGI between $100,000 and

$125,000 are should itemize in 2016, but only 13.4 percent of those same households would

itemize under the TCJA. Reductions in itemizing are even more dramatic for slightly higher

income bins, with the prevalence of itemizing dropping from 81 percent to 26 percent among

those earning between $125,000 and $200,000. The mean tax price of giving increases from


20
   For example, the TCJA's change in the top tax bracket increases the tax price of giving by 4.3 percent (a
marginal tax rate reduction from 39.6 percent to 37 percent), but an individual in that bracket who stops
itemizing because of the increase in the standard deduction sees a price increase of 65 percent.
21
   TAXSIM's calculations also include any state tax changes that took place for the 2018 filing year.
                                                                                                         16


0.947 to 0.980 for all observations in 2016 when applying the TCJA's provisions; among

itemizers in 2016, the tax price is projected to increase from 0.751 to 0.905.

        As discussed above, we estimate separate price elasticities for always-itemizers and

switchers, which we apply to the estimates here. We calculate the number of continuing

non-itemizers, continuing itemizers, and switchers from 2016 to 2018 and apply a weighted

average of the number, mean giving, and mean price change for each type to the appropriate

elasticities to generate the average price change for each bin (Table 5B).

        Tables 5A and 5B apply these estimates to the changes from the TCJA for selected

income bins. In Panel A, Column 1 reports the number of observations per bin (in the 2017

wave of the PSID, corresponding to 2016). Columns 2 and 3 report the mean tax price of

giving and the percent of households itemizing, as calculated by TAXSIM, for that year.

Columns 4 and 5 are the estimated tax prices and percent of households itemizing based on

the provisions of the TCJA, as applied to the PSID data from 2016. Note that the prevalence

of itemizing falls dramatically and, as expected, the tax price of giving increases.

        Panel B displays the mean change in the tax price of giving in Column 1, and applies

our elasticity result to calculate the estimated change in giving induced by the change in

the tax price in Column 2.22 As expected, the changes for lower-income bins are small, since

few households itemize in that range. Column 3 shows the average change in income ex-

pected from the TCJA, and Column 4 applies the marginal propensity to donate out of

income (calculated from Table 4) to those figures. Column 5 combines the estimates. As

described above, these income-induced increases in giving are fairly small. For example, for

households with AGI between $75,000 and $100,000, the income-induced increase is about

15 percent of the change due to the tax price, and only about 4 percent for households



22
  We winsorize giving at the 95th percentile for this calculation; a small number of outliers increases mean
giving by an unrealistic and unrepresentative amount.
                                                                                            17


between $100,000 and $300,000. For the highest-income bin in the PSID, though, the in-

come-induced increase in giving offsets about 15 percent of the decrease.

        Figure 1 plots the projected changes in itemizing status by income group, while

Figure 2 does so for the tax price. Figure 3 shows the projected changes induced by the tax

price changes in the TCJA as well as the amount net of income-induced increases in giving.

Figure 4 shows actual giving in 2016 by income group against the projection under the

TCJA.


        4.3 Projections for High-Income Tax Filing Units

        Unsurprisingly, high-income donors make a large share of total donations. Even a

small percentage of a ten-million-dollar income is significantly more than the combined

donations of tens of thousands of lower-income households. As such, the behavior of these

households in the face of changes to the tax code is of significant interest. Unfortunately, as

detailed above, the PSID simply does not sample a sufficient number of these high earners.

Nevertheless, we estimate some simple projections to provide insight on expected changes

in giving and the degree to which additional disposable income from the TCJA might offset

these changes.

        We use the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income (2018) to create representa-

tive tax filing units using the means of the various components of income and itemized

deductions for the 2016 tax year. We group them together into bins above $500,000 ($500K-

$1M; $1M-$5M; $5M-$10M; $10M+). We assume that households earning above $1 million

continue to itemize at the same rate as they did prior to the TCJA, as the means of itemizing

exceeds the new standard deduction by a significant amount. Of course, there will be some

marginal tax filing units that switch to the standard deduction. That would tend to increase

our estimate of the reduction in giving, though we expect the number of switchers to be

small, even with the cap on state and local tax deductions. For the $500,000-$1M group, we
                                                                                           18


apply estimates from the Tax Policy Center (2018) for the expected number of units that

stop itemizing.

       We then estimate the tax price of giving as described above, using TAXSIM, as well

as calculating the expected change in tax liability. Our estimates for the latter are similar

to those by the Joint Committee on Taxation (2019) and Gale et al. (2018).

       We can apply our estimates of the tax price elasticity of giving to these calculations,

though we must make the assumption that our estimated elasticity are valid for these higher-

income bins. Our estimates for the marginal propensity to donate out of income yield im-

plausible predictions that are orders of magnitude larger than a reasonable amount; it is

clearly not reasonable to apply estimates from households earning less than $300,000 to

households at the upper reaches of the income distribution. We therefore show estimates for

a range of plausible values for the marginal propensity to donate in Table 6.

       Even with our assumption that they continue itemizing, households earning above

$1 million see substantial reductions in charitable giving due to changes in tax price. How-

ever, particularly for the highest levels of the income distribution, the reduction in tax

liability is sufficiently large that reasonable values for the marginal propensity of giving

offset a meaningful portion of the tax-price-induced reduction. For example, a marginal

propensity to donate of 0.02 for households with AGI between $1 and $5 million offsets

about 20 percent of the reduction.

       Finally, we scale our estimates in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 up by the number of tax filing

units in each income bin. We estimate that, had they been in effect in 2016, the provisions

of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act would have reduced charitable giving by about $9.8 billion, or

about 3.5 percent of total individual giving.
                                                                                            19


         While lacking many of the important determinants of charitable giving, including

wealth, new research on the marginal propensity to donate and tax price elasticity of giving

of very high-income households using administrative tax data would be valuable.



5. Conclusions
         This paper provides updated estimates of the tax price elasticity of charitable giving

using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We apply these results to the provisions of the

Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and predict significant reductions in charitable giving, pri-

marily arising from the reduction in the number of households that itemize their deduc-

tions.

         We note a number of limitations to this study, particularly in regards to the relative

dearth of very high income households in the data. Additionally, the TCJA's changes to

the standard deduction are outside the scope of changes to the tax code covered in our data.

It is difficult to know how accurate our extrapolations are, particularly for very high income

households. But we do show that plausible values for the marginal propensity to donate out

of income offset some portion of the tax-price-induced reduction in giving. Projections that

do not account for this countervailing effect are likely to overestimate the impact of reduc-

tions in marginal tax rates on giving.

         We also find evidence that taxpayers take at least several years to fully respond to

changes in the tax price of giving. To the extent that charitable giving is habit-forming

(Rosen and Sims, 2011; Meer, 2013), and that changes to incentives to give through one

form of philanthropy alter giving to others (Gee and Meer, 2019; Scharf, Smith, and Wil-

helm, 2017; Brown, Meer, and Williams, 2019), the ripple effects of the law may take years

to be felt.

This figure displays the changes in each bin of net-of-tax income in the 2017 wave of the
PSID (corresponding to 2016) between the proportion of households itemizing in 2016 and
that projected under the TCJA. These results correspond to Columns (3) and (5) of Table

This figure displays the changes in each bin of net-of-tax income in the 2017 wave of the
PSID (corresponding to 2016) between the mean tax price of giving for households in 2016
and that projected under the TCJA. These results correspond to Columns (2) and (4) of

This figure displays the changes in each bin of net-of-tax income in the 2017 wave of the
PSID (corresponding to 2016) between actual giving and that projected under the TCJA.
The blue bars reflect the projected change solely based on the tax price, corresponding to
Column (2) of Table 5B. The red bars includes the change induced by the reduction in tax
liability, corresponding to Column (5) of Table 5B.

This figure displays mean donations in each bin of net-of-tax income in the 2017 wave of
the PSID (corresponding to 2016). It also displays the estimated mean giving for that bin
based on the TCJA's impact on the tax price of charitable giving and the increase in net-
of-tax income. The difference between these two bars corresponds to the results in Figure 4
and in Column (5) of Table 5B.

In addition to the variables listed, each specification also includes household fixed effects, bins for the level of wealth, marital status, household head's
age and its quadratic, number of children, whether the head is retired or disabled, the head's health status, religious affiliation, as well as state and year
effects and a housing price index and its quadratic. Standard errors are clustered at the household level and in parentheses. Column 1 reports the results
of a linear probability model for the probability of making a gift, instrumenting for the log of the tax price using the log of the zero-dollar tax price.
The first stage is shown in Column 2. Column 3 reports the results for the conditional log amount given, instrumenting for the log of the tax price using
the log of the zero-dollar tax price. The first stage is shown in Column 4. Column 5 combines the estimates in Columns 1 and 3 and reports the marginal
effects on the unconditional log amount given.

Each column reports the marginal effects on the unconditional log amount given, calculated by
estimating the extensive and intensive margins separately. Lead and lag values are instrumented
using the lead and lag values of the log of the zero-dollar tax price. Each specification also includes
household fixed effects, bins for the level of wealth, marital status, household head's age and its
quadratic, number of children, whether the head is retired or disabled, the head's health status,
religious affiliation, as well as state and year effects and a housing price index and its quadratic.
Standard errors are clustered at the household level.

Each column reports the marginal effects on the unconditional log amount given, calculated by estimating the
extensive and intensive margins separately. The sample in Column 1 is limited to households that itemize in
each year, as calculated by TAXSIM. The sample in Column 2 is limited to households that itemize at least
once during the sample period, but not in every year, as calculated by TAXSIM. Each specification also
includes household fixed effects, bins for the level of wealth, marital status, household head's age and its

This table reports projected effects of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act for higher-income bins. Changes in tax price and post-tax
income are calculating using TAXSIM on representative tax filing units from the IRS Statistics of Income. Columns (4)-(8)
report the overall net change in giving under different assumptions of the marginal propensity to donate (MPD) out of the
change in income.
