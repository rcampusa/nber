                                          ABSTRACT

American politics have been characterized by a high degree of partisan conflict in recent years.
Combined with a divided government, this has led not only to significant Congressional gridlock,
but also to spells of high fiscal policy uncertainty. The unusually slow recovery from the Great
Recession during the same period suggests the possibility that the two phenomena may be related.
In this paper, I investigate the hypothesis that political discord depresses private investment. To
this end, I construct a novel high-frequency indicator of partisan conflict. The partisan conflict
index (PCI) uses a semantic search methodology to measure the frequency of newspaper articles
reporting lawmakers' disagreement about policy. I find a negative relationship between the PCI
and aggregate investment in the US. Moreover, the decline is persistent, which may help explain
the slow recovery observed since the 2007 recession ended. Partisan conflict is also associated
with lower investment rates at the firm level, particularly in firms that rely heavily on government
spending and in those who actively engage in campaign contributions through PACs.

1       Introduction
American politics have been characterized by a high degree of partisan conflict in recent
years. The combination of increasing polarization and divided government has led not only
to significant Congressional gridlock (such as the budgetary warfare that eventually triggered
the 18th government shutdown in US history in 2013), but also to spells of high fiscal policy
uncertainty (such as the 2012 tax-expirations and the fiscal cliff). The unprecedented slow
recovery in investment from the Great Recession during the same period suggests the possi-
bility that the two phenomena may be related. Partisan conflict is relevant for the evolution
of private investment for two reasons. First, because expected returns on investment become
less predictable when the timing, size, and composition of fiscal policy is uncertain (Azzi-
monti and Talbert, 2013). To the extent that investment is irreversible and subject to fixed
upfront costs, this induces delays in investment decisions (Bernanke 1983; Baker, Bloom,
and Davis, 2016; Canes-Wrone and Park 2011).1 Second, because the resulting legislative
gridlock negatively affects the optimal response to adverse shocks and the quality of policy
reforms aimed at preventing them (Alesina and Drazen, 1991). This lowers expected returns,
and hence discourages investment.
     To test the hypothesis that partisan conflict depresses investment, I construct a novel
indicator of the degree of partisan conflict based on news provided by the media. The par-
tisan conflict index (PCI) is computed using a semantic search approach to measure the
frequency of newspaper coverage of articles reporting political disagreement about govern-
ment policy—both within and between national parties—normalized by the total number
of news articles within a given period. In order to show that the resulting measure indeed
captures true political discord, I compute the PCI between 1891 and 2013, and show that its
behavior is consistent with that of slow-moving variables characterizing the political process.
First, I show that the long-run trend in the historical PCI mirrors the evolution of political
polarization, as computed by Mc-Carty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006).2 .
     Second, I show that changes in (the trend of) the PCI: (i) are more pronounced under a
divided government, (ii) are positively related to the number of cloture attempts (a proxy for
filibusters), and (iii) decline with the share of seats in Congress controlled by the President’s
party (a proxy for political power). Third, I find that short-term increases in partisan conflict
are associated with presidential elections and well-known fiscal policy debates, such as the
Immigration Act of 1924, the debt ceiling debate, and debates on the Affordable Care Act
(both related to its approval and potential repeal in early 2017). This is reassuring, suggesting
that the indicator captures disagreement about well-known polemical issues. Interestingly,
no clear relationship between partisan conflict and recessions (measured by NBER dates or
by periods of high unemployment rates) was detected. For example, the index is much lower
than average during the Great Depression, but reached significant levels during the panics
of 1893 and 1911, and the Great Recession. Taken together, these observations indicate that
the index is mainly capturing political factors, rather than the state of the economy.

    The measure has a similar relationship with political polarization computed by Jensen, Kaplan, Naidu,
and Wilse-Samson (2012) from Congressional Records



                                                   2
     It is worth noting that while the methodology used to compute the PCI is similar to the
one used by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) to measure EPU, the two indexes represent
different concepts and are therefore characterized by distinctive features. While there are
cases in which increases in the PCI are associated with higher economic policy uncertainty
(such as during the Obamacare debate and the tax-expirations of 2012, when investors could
not predict which policies would be undertaken) this need not always be the case (an example
is given by the 2013 shutdown). Interestingly, the indexes move in opposite direction when
the country is at war or subject to national security threats, such as World War I, Pearl
Harbor, and 9/11. The 9/11 attacks, for example, introduced uncertainty in the economy
(so EPU was extremely high), but there was very little disagreement about which policies
should be implemented (so PCI was extremely low). This suggests that American politics are
very polarized regarding economic policy, but less divided when it comes to national defense
issues. It also indicates the presence of a partisan ‘rally around the flag” effect. A more
detailed comparison between the PCI and EPU can be found in Appendix 5.1.
     The PCI is also related to measures of political polarization, such as those computed
by McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006) from roll-call votes. This is to be expected: Pol-
icymakers’ ideological differences, or polarization, are clearly an important determinant of
political disagreement. The further apart parties’ views over policies are, the higher the level
of conflict should be. While the general trend of partisan conflict since the mid sixties is sim-
ilar to the one observed in these measures, short-term fluctuations are remarkably different.
This is due to the fact that polarization measures bundling Congressional behavior typi-
cally ignoring filibuster threats and presidential vetoes, which constitute important sources
of policy determination. The interaction between the executive and legislative branches, or
between the House and the Senate under a divided government, are important factors affect-
ing the determination of partisan conflict (as pointed out by Alesina and Rosenthal, 1995).
Moreover, the PCI deviates significantly from the DW-nominate measure constructed by Mc-
Carty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006) in periods where one party controls Congress and the
Presidency. Because the PCI is a signal about the outcome of a game (between two parties
with different objectives in the political arena), rather than a measure of the distance in their
ideal points, the index developed in this paper is conceptually different from polarization,
and does not represent an alternative measure of it.
     To quantify the effects of innovations in news about partisan conflict on private invest-
ment, I first consider a VAR specification using the historical PCI series. Using data from
1929 to 2013, I find that an increase in PCI is associated with a large and persistent reduction
in aggregate investment. Even though this approach does not allow me to uncover a causal
relationship between the two variables, it illustrates their long-run co-movement. Moreover,
it allows me to show that their relationship is not confounding the effects of other slow-moving
variables, such as polarization or political power, or that of economic policy uncertainty. To
address potential omitted variables bias, I also study how news about partisan conflict affect
the investment rates of publicly traded firms. I use a large panel covering the period 1985:Q1
to 2015:Q1, and exploit the variation on these firms’ exposure to government spending, as
computed by Belo, Gala, and Li (2013) from input-output tables. This experiment is along
the lines of Gulen and Ion (2015), who attempt to tease out the effects of political uncertainty


                                               3
on investment. Intuitively, higher partisan conflict would imply a higher level of demand un-
certainty in firms which are more heavily exposed to government purchases. Controlling for
firm fixed-effects and time fixed-effects, I find a strong negative effect of PCI on investment
rates of firms belonging to industries highly exposed to government spending. Firms which
are more politically engaged, as proxied by campaign contributions through PACs (obtained
from Cooper, Gulen, and Pvthinnikov, 2010), are also found to respond more to increases in
the PCI, using a similar estimation model. The idea behind this specification is that compa-
nies whose returns are more exposed to recessions and crises (i.e. because their profits would
suffer disproportionately were a financial crisis to occur) have more incentives to contribute
to candidates who are more likely to choose appropriate policies and regulation. More gen-
erally, firms that contribute a lot dislike partisan conflict, as it reduces the likelihood of the
actions that they were trying to induce from policymakers with their contributions. The
higher the degree of partisan conflict, the less likely it is that policy will effectively prevent
bad outcomes or be beneficial for a particular firm with vested interests, and hence the lower
the returns would be.


2       Measuring partisan conflict
The main objective of this section is to construct an indicator of the degree of partisan
conflict to analyze how it evolves over time, understand its determinants, and later assess
how it effects private investment.

2.1     Index construction
To construct the partisan conflict index I use a search-based approach that measures the
frequency of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about government policy.
The assumption underlying the index is that greater media coverage of ideologically divisive
issues, legislative gridlock, presidential vetoes, or filibuster threats indicates intense disagree-
ment between policymakers (either across party lines or within a party).
    I will compute two indexes: Historical Partisan Conflict(HPC), covering the period 1891-
2013, and a benchmark measure, Partisan Conflict Index (PCI), covering the interval 1981-
present. The latter is updated monthly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and
available free of charge in their website.3
    Historical Partisan Conflict is computed annually using news articles from five major
newspapers that have been digitized since 1891 for the whole sample period: The Wall Street
Journal, The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington
Post. I abstract from other newspapers that have been digitized only for a sub-period, because
with a small number of newspapers, the addition or elimination of a newspaper significantly
changes the trend of the estimated index.4 The advantage of this measure is that it allows us
    3

center/partisan-conflict-index.

     The benchmark series is constructed from the whole sample of newspapers for which digitized versions
exist. Because the number of newspapers included is much larger, jumps in the series do not appear as
newspapers are included or excluded at particular points in time.

to characterize the long-run trend in partisan conflict and compare it with other slow-moving
variables such as polarization and the composition of Congress. The main disadvantage is
that the search cannot be refined to the same degree as the benchmark case is. While we can
restrict the search over actual articles (excluding, for example, advertisements or obituaries),
we cannot restrict it to domestic news or distinguish opinions and commentaries from regular
news.
    The search used in the construction of the Partisan Conflict Index is performed monthly
in Factiva (by Dow Jones), covering the interval 1981-present. An advantage of using Fac-
tiva’s search engine versus the ones provided by each particular newspaper is that the search
outcome is homogeneous and an identical set of predefined filters can be applied. In partic-
ular, I restrict the comprehensive Boolean search to major US newspapers (see Table 5 in
Appendix 5.2 for a full list of sources included) with news written exclusively in English and
restricted to events occurring in, or related to, the US.5 The top news sources resulting from
the search are The Washington Post, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago
Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday, The Dallas Morning News, The Boston Globe,
and Tampa Bay Times (see Figure 1 for a decomposition).

                                                                    The Dallas Morning News


                                                                    The Boston Globe


                                                                    Tampa Bay Times


                                                                    The Wall Street Journal



  Figure 1: Percentage of news searches in which these subjects are mentioned over the sample.

    Routine general news, reviews, interviews, etc. are also excluded in order to reduce the
incidence of false positives. A comprehensive list of filters applied can be found in Appendix
5.3. Articles with less than 200 words and republished news are excluded (this is standard
in the semantics literature). Note that the search is performed on full articles, not just titles
or abstracts.
    The index is computed as follows. First, I count the number of articles that discuss
disagreement between political parties, branches of government, or political actors (e.g. can-
didates not yet in office, legislators, etc.) in a given month. In particular, I search for articles
   5
     Factiva indexes articles according to the region they are most related to through a semantic algorithm. To
filter out news that are not related to the US, I exclude articles which have been indexed to countries/regions
other than the US. This will include articles which are indexed to the US, as well as articles which have not
been coded.

containing at least one keyword in the following two categories: (i) political disagreement
and (ii) government. Figure 2 summarizes the resulting terms used in each category. I fo-
cus on articles including keywords at the intersection of those two categories. In addition,
I also search for specific terms related to partisan conflict, such as “divided party,” “parti-
san divisions,” and “divided Congress.” Note that the search involves terms related to the
political debate (e.g., “fail to compromise”), as well as the outcome of the partisan warfare
(e.g. “gridlock” and “filibuster”). The complete set of words included in each category can
be found in Appendix 6.

                           Figure 2: Sample keywords used in the search.
   Note: The term “X committee” stands for Appropriations Committee, Finance Committee, or
   Ways and Means Committee.

    The search captures disagreement not only about economic policy (e.g., related to bud-
getary decisions, tax rates, deficit levels, welfare programs, etc.), but also about private-sector
regulation (e.g., financial and immigration reform), national defense issues (e.g., wars, ter-
rorism), and other dimensions that divide policymakers’ views (e.g., same-sex marriage, gun
control, abortion rights, among others).
    For the PCI benchmark series, the particular words included in each category were chosen
using a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, I selected words normally used in the polit-
ical economy and political science literatures that refer to political disagreement. From the
outcome of this first-stage search, three articles per month over the period 1981-2012 were
selected at random from The New York Times and thoroughly read by the author. Additional
words used by the media that were identified during this human audit were incorporated into
the initial search in the second stage. The objective of this refinement was to reduce the
incidence of false negatives. Some of the original keywords were eliminated in order to re-
duce false positives. Articles were identified as false positives or false negatives by analyzing
whether the article was indeed describing disagreement between policymakers. Words were


                                                   6
eliminated when the incidence of false-positives (or negatives) was higher than 30 % of the
articles selected. In addition, the words “polarization” and “dysfunctional” were excluded
from the historical search used to construct HPC because these words entered the media
language only in the 1980s. The remaining words were observed with a relatively constant
frequency in the historical newspapers (using 10-year intervals). In addition “political” and
“disagreement” have also been excluded from the historical search because they retrieved a
disproportionate amount of foreign news (notably during WWI and WWII). This shortcom-
ing does not arise in the benchmark search used to construct PCI where we can restrict it to
domestic articles.6
    Because the volume of digitized news varies over time, I scale the raw partisan conflict
count by the total number of articles in the same newspapers over the same time interval.
To do this in the benchmark PCI, I perform a search every month from January 1981 until
the present containing the word “today.”7 For the historical series, HPC, I divide the raw
partisan conflict count by the number of articles every year that contain the word “the,”
rather than “today,” due to the fact that, early in the sample, there was usually a delay
between the date at which an event happened and the date at which it was reported. Finally,
I normalize both the PCI and HPC scores to average 100 in the year 1990. This normalization
is without loss of generality.

2.2    The historical evolution of partisan conflict
In this section, I study the behavior of the PCI over a long period of time (1891-2013). By
comparing its evolution to other indicators of political discord, I attempt to validate the
index as an informative signal of true partisan conflict.
    The HPC index declined between 1891 and the early 1920s, remained relatively stable
until 1965, and exhibited an increasing trend thereafter, as seen from Figure 3. The rise in
partisan conflict accelerated during the Great Recession, peaking with the 2013 government
shutdown. This behavior, as shown in the next subsections, is consistent with that of other
slow-moving variables characterizing political disagreement, such as political polarization and
the distribution of political power (e.g. whether the government is divided or not, the degree
of presidential influence in Congress, the number of filibusters, etc.) and media trends.
    Because these variables are related with the PCI at different frequencies than other shocks
(such as elections and wars), the analysis will be divided in two parts: (i) the long-run trend
and (ii) short-term fluctuations. To isolate long-run trends from short-term fluctuations, I
apply an HP-filter to the series. Since HPC is computed annually, it is filtered using a weight
of w = 6.25 (see in Ravn and Uhlig, 2002).8 Figure 4 shows the evolution of the resulting
two components of partisan conflict for the HPC series.
   6
     Robustness to the set of words is discussed in Appendix 6.1
   7
     Using the word “the” to count the total number of articles instead causes no noticeable difference in the
index.
   8
     HP filtering has been chosen rather than first differences because the trend is not completely removed
from the series when using differences. Using a smoothing parameter of w = 100 also resulted in slow-moving
trends observed in the residual. More details are available from the author upon request.

2.2.1      Long-run trend of HPC
I first focus on the relationship between the long-run trend of the HPC series and variables
which, according to the political economy literature, reflect political discord. I also discuss
the relationship between the PCI and trends in media coverage.

Political determinants Polarization is possibly one of the most important factors (al-
though not the only one) determining partisan conflict. We should expect partisan conflict
to intensify when political polarization rises. Intuitively, it is more difficult for parties to
agree on the course of social and economic policy when their ideological differences are large.
Interestingly, McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006) document that polarization between po-
litical parties has risen significantly in the postwar era. This pattern is consistent with the
sustained increase in the PCI over the same period, as shown in Figure 5.
     While both series exhibit a decline early in the sample, partisan conflict decreases at a
much faster rate and lies below polarization until the 72nd Congress. As the PCI identifies
political outcomes rather than policymakers’ preferences, the divergence in the two series
could be explained by changes in the composition of the government, affecting the political
power of the Democratic and Republican parties. For example, between the 63rd and the
71st Congresses both chambers had a Democratic majority. Therefore, even if parties were
very polarized, de facto disagreement—as proxied by the PCI—, was not.
     To test the conjecture that polarization is associated with higher PCI whereas control of
the government by one party is associated with lower PCI, I estimate the following model
over the period 1891-2012 (from the 62nd to the 112th Congresses):

                                ∆HP Cc = α0 + α1 ∆P olarc + α2 Idiv,c + c ,                (1)
    where c = denotes a particular Congress. The dependent variable is the first difference
in the trend of partisan conflict, ∆HP Cc .9 The variable ∆P olarc represents changes in the
trend of political polarization (also de-trended using the HP filter), obtained from McCarty,

      Notes: Polarization obtained from McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006), who use information

Poole, and Rosenthal (2006; see note in Figure 5 for more details). The dichotomic variable
Idiv,c equals 1 under a divided government (that is, when a party has a majority in the House
and the other party a majority in the Senate) and 0 otherwise. Finally, c represents the
error term.
    The estimated coefficients are reported in the first column of Table 1. Both are positive
and statistically significant, indicating that polarization and partisan conflict are indeed
positively related, and that the PCI is typically higher under a divided Congress.
    I consider an alternative measure of partisan control, Pres Seats Hc , representing the
share of seats held by the President’s party in the House. Including changes in its trend
as an additional explanatory variable does not change the results from the benchmark case,
as shown in the second column of Table 1. A negative and statistically significant coeffi-
cient associated with ∆Pres Seats Hc indicates that when the Presidency and the House are
controlled by the same party, political disagreement—as reported by the media—declines.10
    Interestingly, the share of seats controlled by the President’s party in the Senate P res Seats Sc
has no significant impact on the partisan conflict index, as shown in column (3) of this table.
This is reasonable given super-majority rules and filibusters in the Senate. For much of US
history, filibusters were rare and only used in matters of great importance. Nowadays, they
have become a major tool by which a large part of the majority party’s Senate agenda is
blocked by an organized minority party filibuster. The threat of a filibuster is typically prox-
ied by the number of cloture motions filed, as they are filed not only to interrupt filibusters in
progress, but also to preempt anticipated filibusters. The evolution of the PCI is remarkably

      Notice that the trend is calculated by HP-filtering Pres Seats Hc .

similar to that of cloture motions filed, as seen in Figure 6. Their correlation, computed
between the 66th and 112th Congress, is 89%.11
     The strong positive relationship between PCI and cloture holds even after controlling
for polarization and the distribution of political power, as seen from the highly significant
coefficient of ∆Cloture c in column (4) of Table 1. The model estimated is identical to the one
in Specification (2), but augmented to incorporate changes in the trend of cloture motions
files. The model fit is better than in previous specifications, as indicated by an R2 of 0.59.
Interestingly, polarization becomes insignificant once cloture is considered. This could be due
to the fact that partisan conflict captures filibuster threats (recall that ‘filibuster’ is a word
used in the search), whereas polarization is based only on actual votes. Notice, however, that
since I only have observations from the 66th Congress and onwards, the sample over which
  11
    The number of motions filed prior to 1975 was close to zero, exhibited a large spike in early 1975 (beginning
of the 94th Congress). This is due to a procedural reform by which the number of Senators needed to invoke
cloture is reduced from two-thirds to three-fifths (about 60 out of 100). While this reform would explain an
increase in the average number of motions filed, it does not explain the rising trend. Barber and McCarthy
(2013) conjecture that the increasing portion arises as a result of rising polarization.

Specifications (2) and (4) are computed is different.

Media coverage Because the partisan conflict index is based on news reports, changes in
media coverage are also likely to impact the measure. Figure 7 shows the evolution of HPC
(solid line) alongside a measure of media coverage of government news (broken line). The
latter corresponds to the share G T , where the number of government-related news articles G
are identified using the set of words in the “Government” ball of Figure 2, and T , the total
number of articles in a year, is proxied by articles including the word “the.”
     The two variables exhibit a very similar trend. Extending the benchmark regression in
eq. (1) to include changes in the trend of media coverage reinforces this observation: the
correlation between changes in the trend of media coverage and those in HPC is about 0.6, and
statistically significant. Moreover, the resulting R2 is increased from 0.145 in the benchmark
case (Specification 1) to 0.59 in Specification (5), as seen in Table 1. This result is robust to
including other control variables such as the share of seats controlled by the President in the
House or Senate, or the trends in cloture. Results are omitted due to space constraints, but
are available upon request from the author.
     That the HPC index is highly correlated with the share of news devoted to politics over
time could be due to the fact that newspapers devote a larger share of news to politics
in periods of high disagreement, precisely when investors are most interested in obtaining a
signal about true partisan conflict. On the other hand, it could well be the case that trends in
media coverage respond to other factors, such as competition from alternative news sources
(i.e. TV, radio, or the internet) that emphasize political disagreement. The HPC index
would be a more accurate reflection of true partisan conflict in the former case than in the
latter case. I am mostly interested in the effect of news about partisan conflict on investors’

are simply an artifact of media manipulation. It would be interesting, in future work, to try
to disentangle the effects of these two forces more systematically.

2.2.2      Short-run fluctuations of HPC
In this section, I focus on the relationship between the PCI and determinants of (true)
partisan conflict at shorter frequencies. More specifically, I consider how changes in the
cyclical component of HPC are related to: (i) elections, (ii) recessions, and (iii) wars. The
benchmark model follows.

                                           ĤP Ct = β0 + β1 P resElect + β2 W art + β3 Recesst + t ,
where ĤP Ct denotes the cycle component of HP-filtered partisan conflict data in year t,
P resElect denotes a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 in years where a presidential
election is held. The dichotomic variable W art takes a value of 1 if there is more than
1 military death per 100,000 people in the population in a given year and 0 otherwise.12
This variable captures, for example, the Spanish-American War, WWI, WWII, the Korean
War, and the most violent years of the Vietnam war. The variable Recesst , which follows the
NBER definition of a recession, is obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED

dataset. The results for the benchmark specification are summarized in the first column of
Table 2, and will be discussed below.

(i) Elections The most natural source of short-run fluctuations in the PC indicator is the
arrival of election dates, an anticipated shock. We should expect the index to be higher than
average during elections purely for mechanical reasons: Newspapers increase the proportion
of articles covering political debates and emphasize differences between candidates during
those periods. In addition, partisan conflict may also intensify endogenously, as legislators
try to pursue a particular agenda or block specific legislation to tilt election results in their
party’s favor (see Groseclose and McCarty, 2001 on strategic disagreement). Political agents
(incumbent legislators, the opposition, the President, etc.) have incentives to exaggerate
their positions to signal a particular type in an attempt to attract votes, also referred to as
‘posturing’ in the political economy literature (see Ash, Morelli, and Van Weelden, 2014).
An estimated coefficient of β1 = 3.32 indicates that the index does indeed spike in years
in which Presidential elections take place. This is not the case when midterm elections are
considered (see Specification 2). This result should be taken with caution, however, since
there is a midterm election every other year in the historical sample. When shorter intervals
are analyzed (e.g., at a monthly frequency), periods surrounding a midterm election are
indeed characterized by higher observations of the index.

(ii) Recessions The state of the economy can potentially affect partisan conflict, and
hence the PCI, in the short run. Recessions are periods when automatic stabilizers (such
as unemployment benefits) kick in. Several of these stabilizers are highly redistributive in
nature, and thus potentially conflictive. We should expect partisan conflict to intensify in
“bad times,” when revenues tend to be low and spending needs tend to be large. An example
is the 2007 recession, when the subsequent conflict over tax-cut expirations led to gridlock and
hence extreme values in HPC. Surprisingly, the HPC index is not statistically different during
booms and recessions, as seen by the high standard error on the coefficient ot Recess. This
could be explained by the fact that recessions are seen as periods of ‘national emergency,’
were policy response is highly valued by voters. Inspection of Figure 3 reveals that while
HPC is significantly higher during the 1893 and 1911 panics, it takes one of it lowest values
of the century during the Great Depression. To test the robustness of this result, I include
alternative proxies for recessions in specifications (3) and (4). In (3), a lagged value of the
unemployment rate (obtained from FRED) is introduced. In (4), a lagged value of the HP-
filtered unemployment rate is used instead. The coefficients are statistically insignificant,
reinforcing the observations that the state of the economy is not an important determinant
of the cyclical behavior of the PCI, at least at the annual frequency.13

(iii) Wars Finally, I analyze how wars affect news about partisan conflict. Following
Mueller (1973), a large strand of the political science literature has analyzed the effects
of dramatic and sharply focused international crises (or wars) on the popular support of
  13
    Lagged values of GDP growth can also be used as alternative proxies for a recession (ommitted due to
space constraints). Their coefficients are also statistically insignificant.

the President of the United States. The unprecedented increase in George W. Bush’s public
approval ratings, from 51% to 86% following the September 11th terrorist attacks, is a typical
example of the ‘rally around the flag” effect. Mathews (1919) argues that one effect of war
upon the party system (...) is to bring about, at least for a time, a relatively greater stability
of party control, if not complete quiescence of partisanship, either through coalition or through
cessation of party opposition, or both. This would suggest that a rally around the flag should
be observed at the party level. Interestingly, lower-than-average HPC scores are recorded
during episodes of war and national security threats in the historical series. The clearest
examples are given by the First War World and the Second War World in Figure 3. As the
third row of Table 2 indicates, HPC is significantly lower during wars even after other sources
of short-term fluctuations are considered. One may argue that lower PC scores are observed
during wars because newspapers devote a larger percentage of coverage to documenting events
related to the war itself, rather than to government policy. Inspection of the evolution of
the EPU suggests that this is not the case, as this series increases significantly during these
events. An example is given by the large spike in EPU observed during 9/11, a period where


                                                         15
partisan conflict reached record lows (relative to trend).14 . This is discussed in more detail
in Appendix 5.1, where I contrast the evolution of partisan conflict to that of EPU.
    Taken together, the results of this section indicate that: (i) HPC is higher during Pres-
idential elections, (ii) there exists a partisan rally-around-the flag, (iii) there is no evidence
that HPC is higher during recessions than it is in booms (at annual frequencies).

2.3    The (more recent) evolution of partisan conflict
In this section I describe the more recent evolution of partisan conflict. Figure 8 depicts
the benchmark PCI measure. Recall that this measure is more precise, due to the greater
availability of digitized newspapers and the possibility of filtering out foreign news, among
others. Additionally, it is computed at a monthly frequency, which allows us to better analyze
the behavior of partisan conflict at shorter frequencies.
    The first observation is that the index has fluctuated around a constant mean for most of
the sample, but exhibited an increasing trend starting at the outset of the Great Recession
(e.g., around 2007). The index reached its highest level of our 30-year sample period during
the shutdown of 2013, a value closely followed by the unexpected victory of D. Trump in the
2016 Presidential election and his first two months in office.
    The vertical lines in Figure 8 indicate months in which Congress held midterm elections.
Consistently with fact (i), the index spikes when elections are held. The rally-around-the flag
effect (fact ii. above) is even more evident when analyzing the monthly PCI, as the series is
clearly below average during both Gulf Wars, the Beirut and Oklahoma City bombings and,
particularly, 9/11 when it decreased dramatically from the spike associated with the Bush
vs Gore election. This reinforces the previous observation that partisan conflict subsides
significantly not only when the country is at war, but also when it is subject to national
security threats.
    The figure also displays other historical events that resulted in deviations from the trend.
Most noticeable are the government shutdowns of 1995 and 2013, the passage of “Obamacare,”
the debt ceiling debate, the partisan divide on immigration, and the potential repeal of the
Affordable Care Act in early 2016. This is reassuring, suggesting that the indicator captures
disagreement about well-known polemic issues. True partisan conflict is also expected to
increase at short frequencies when polemic issues over which a decision must be taken arise
in the legislative agenda. As Lowell (1902) noted ...the amount of party voting depends
largely upon the accident of some question in which the parties are sharply divided happening
to come up for decision...in England, parties frame the issues. In America the issues do not,
indeed, make the parties, but determine the extent of their opposition to each other in matters
of legislation. 15
  14
     Recall that both EPU and PCI share the same denominator, namely, the number of newspaper articles
during a period
  15
     At a particular point in time, it is impossible, unfortunately, to disentangle whether partisan conflict is
high because parties are ideologically far apart on a particular issue from the relevance of the issue per se.
Polarization levels cannot, therefore, be inferred from PCI at very short frequencies. The index can be a better

3         Partisan Conflict and Private Investment
In this section, I explore empirically the effects of news about partisan conflict on private in-
vestment. In particular, I want to test whether innovations to the PCI and private investment
are negatively related.
    To do so, I take two complementary approaches. In the first one, I consider a VAR
specification using yearly data from 1929 to 2013. Although this approach does not allow me
to robustly identify a causal relationship between HPC and investment, it illustrates their
long-run co-movement. Moreover, I can show that their relationship is not confounding the
effects of other slow-moving variables such as polarization or the share of seats held by the
President in Congress, neither it is capturing the effects of economic policy uncertainty.
    In the second approach, I use panel data of publicly traded firms to identify the effects of
partisan conflict on private investment. Using firm-level regressions that control for firm fixed-
effects and calendar-quarter fixed-effects, I find that there is a significant negative correlation
between partisan conflict and investment rates, particularly in firms belonging to sectors
highly exposed to government spending and those actively engaged in campaign contributions
through PACs.

3.1         VAR Approach
To test the impact of partisan conflict on aggregate investment, I estimate a vector auto
regression (VAR) model and recover orthogonal shocks by using a Cholesky decomposition
of the following: War, Recession, Divided Congress, Historical Partisan Conflict, Interest
Rates, Log-Investment, and Log-GDP. War is proxied with the number of military deaths
per 100,000 people in the population in a given year, while the recession indicator is obtained
from the NBER. Investment and output are obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analy-
sis (BEA), and correspond to seasonally adjusted ‘Gross Private Domestic Investment’ and
‘Gross Domestic Product,’ respectively. Real variables are constructed using the GDP defla-
tor, and expressed in billions of 2005 dollars. Interest rates are proxied by Moody’s Seasoned
AAA Corporate Bond Yield, as this series goes back to 1929.16 The sample is restricted to
the period 1929-2013 due to lack of investment data prior to the start date.

         Mortgage rates are available only since 1971 whereas the Federal Funds Rate is available from 1954.

Figure 9: Impulse-response function of a one-standard deviation increase in HPC. Solid line: mean
estimate; dashed outer lines: one-standard-error bands. Estimated using a yearly Cholesky VAR
model with War, Recession, Divided Congress, Historical Partisan Conflict, Interest Rates, Log-
Investment, and Log-GDP (in that order).

    In the baseline specification, I use yearly data with three-year lags. The VAR is stable,
so impulse-response functions can be constructed. Figure 9 shows that an increase of a one-
standard deviation of the—orthogonalized—shock to the historical partisan conflict index
causes a significant and persistent reduction of log-investment. A standard deviation of the
HPC corresponds to a 22.5 point increase in the index, implying a 13% reduction (on average)
in aggregate real investment upon impact. The largest impact is seen after one year, in which
investment declines 16%. Interestingly, HPC increased by about 26 points (slightly above a
one-standard deviation) between 2010 and 2011, suggesting that part of the slow recovery in
investment could have resulted from investors’ reaction to news about political turmoil.


Robustness to Specification: Figure 10 shows the response of log-investment under al-
ternative specifications. The solid line replicates the response obtained under the benchmark
model. The line denoted ‘Last’ (solid with x-markers) considers an alternative ordering of the
Cholesky decomposition: War, Recession, Divided Congress, Interest Rates, Log-Investment,
Log-GDP, and HPC. That is, we allow for the possibility of log-investment and log-output
to cause HPC. Even though the response is smaller, the qualitative result holds: increases in
HPC are associated with declines in private investment. The dashed-line includes polarization
and the share of seats held by the President in the House (PPH), two variables which were
shown to be significant determinants in the trend of HPC (see Section 2.2.1 for a description


                                                    19
of these variables and their impact on HPC). The model considers War, Recession, Divided
Congress, PPH, Polarization, HPC, Interest Rates, Log-Investment, and Log-GDP (in that
order). Finally, the dotted line incorporates EPU to the model.17 We can see that the main
result, namely that the relationship between HPC and log-investment is negative, is robust
to several modifications of the benchmark model.

Decomposing the changes in investment: It is possible to decompose how the pri-
vate sector reacts to a shock in partisan conflict by investigating the response of investment
components, namely fixed residential and non-residential investment, as well as changes in
inventories. The series ‘Private Residential Fixed Investment,’ ‘Private Nonresidential Fixed
Investment,’ and ‘Change in Private Inventories’ are obtained from FRED (under the labels
PRFIA, PNFIA, and CBIA, respectively).18 Real variables are constructed using the GDP
deflator, and expressed in billions of 2005 dollars. The VAR specification is analogous to the
benchmark model, the only difference being the introduction of the three investment com-
ponents. The Cholesky decomposition is now: War, Recession, Divided Congress, Historical

     The ordering is War, Recession, Divided Congress, PPH, Polarization, HPC, EPU, Interest Rates, Log-
Investment, and Log-GDP in that case.

Log-Residential Investment, and Log-GDP. The results are presented in Figure 11, which
also depicts the response of our benchmark investment measure for ease of comparison.

Figure 11: Impulse-response function for different investment measures (of a one-standard deviation
increase in HPC). Solid line: investment (in logs, benchmark measure). Dashed line: Private Res-
idential Fixed Investment (in logs). Dotted line: private non-residential fixed investment (in logs).
Semi-dashed line: Change in inventories. Estimated using a yearly Cholesky VAR model with War,
Recession, Divided Congress, Historical Partisan Conflict, Interest Rates, Change in Inventories, Log-
Non-Residential Investment, Log-Residential Investment, and Log-GDP (in that order).

    The first thing to note is that the immediate (e.g. on impact) response of each individual
investment component is smaller than in the benchmark model, with the largest effect ob-
served in the decline of inventories. Secondly, the overall impact is much larger in residential
investment (dashed line) than in non-residential investment (dotted line). Finally, the re-
ductions in fixed investment (both residential and non-residential) are more persistent than
those of inventories. The effect of partisan conflict vanishes in inventories after two years
(standard errors omitted in the figure, but available upon request).19
    In light of this result, a natural question arises as to whether these changes are driven
by the recent housing and financial crisis. Figure 12 depicts the response of investment as
computed in Figures 9 and 11, together with those obtained by computing the same VAR
models over the period 1929-2006 (e.g. excluding the Great Recession). The solid line
in the first panel depicts the results for the benchmark investment measure, whereas the
dashed lines represent standard errors. For ease of comparison, the dotted line replicates the
  19
    For robustness, I have also computed the response to a partisan conflict shock of each component in a
separate VAR model and the results are qualitatively similar. The joint specification seems more reasonable
though, as errors affecting each component are likely to be correlated.

response computed using the whole sample (1929-2013). The two estimations are similar,
with persistence being somewhat smaller once the Great Recession is excluded (note that the
previous estimation falls within the one-standard deviation band of the new model). This
indicates that the response of investment to partisan conflict is not driven by the reaction of
investment to the most recent financial crisis.
    The second panel shows the response of investment components for the two sample peri-
ods. The most noticeable difference, as expected, corresponds to the response of residential
fixed investment. When the Great Recession is excluded from the sample, the estimated


                                                                                          22
response of residential fixed investment (dotted line with circles) is smaller and significantly
less persistent than when the full period is considered (solid line with circles). The standard
errors are not shown for readability, but it is worth mentioning that the reduction in residen-
tial investment is statistically significant only for the first three periods after the innovation
in partisan conflict. Even though the magnitude of the response to the shock is smaller when
the period 2007-2013 is excluded, residential investment responds negatively to increases in
partisan conflict. The response of non-residential investment is similar in the first few periods
to the one obtained in the full sample (dotted and solid lines, respectively).
    Taken together, these figures indicate that the lower persistence in overall investment
to a partisan conflict shock is due to the behavior of residential investment. Its reduction
upon impact, on the other hand, does not seem to depend significantly on whether the
Great Recession period is excluded form the sample (this happens because the response of
inventories is more marked for the period 1929-2006 than it is for the full sample, result
ommitted).
    The results from this VAR specification should be interpreted as “informed correlations”
between these variables, as the exercise does not allow us to isolate the causal effect of PCI
on aggregate investment.

3.2   Firm-level Data Approach
In this section, I exploit the heterogeneity of US publicly traded firms to study the effects
of partisan conflict on private investment. To do so, I use a panel of Compustat firms with
quarterly data over the period 1985:Q1-2015:Q1. I consider two alternative strategies. In the
first one, firms are differentiated by their ex-ante exposure to government demand of goods
and services, a measure obtained from Belo, Gala, and Li (2013). Their measure is computed
using detailed industry level data from the NIPA input-output accounts. Firms which are
more exposed to government spending are expected to have lower investment rates when
partisan conflict is high (but moderate) through the uncertainty channel. This exercise, in
the spirit of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) and Gulen and Ion (2015), yields better causal
identification than what was presented in previous sections using aggregate investment levels.
However, the level of exposure is obtained only at the industry level (i.e., three digit SIC
codes) for a specific group of publicly traded companies, making the result less general.
     The second strategy differentiates firms by their individual contributions to U.S. political
campaigns, using an index constructed by Cooper, Gulen, and Ovtchinnikov (2010). These
authors showed that firms which devote a larger share of revenues to campaign contributions
tend to have abnormal future returns, in particular if the candidates supported hold office
in the same state in which the firm is located. We should expect firms that donate more
through PACs to have a larger response to innovations to the PCI, as potential gridlock makes
it less likely to receive political favors from the candidates supported. In addition, companies
whose returns are more exposed to low-probability events (i.e. because their profits would
suffer disproportionately were a financial crisis to occur) have more incentives to contribute
to candidates who are more likely to choose appropriate policies and regulation. The higher
the degree of partisan conflict, the less likely it is that policy will effectively prevent bad
outcomes, and hence the lower the returns would be for these firms. A benefit of Cooper,

                                               23
Gulen, and Ovtchinnikov (2010)’ contribution index is that it is firm specific (rather than
industry specific), but it involves a smaller number of firms than the one used in the first
exercise.

Data Firm-level data is obtained from Compustat for the period 1985:Q1-2015:Q1. I ex-
clude all financial firms (SIC codes between 6000 and 6999), utilities (SIC codes between
4900-4999), and government entities (SIC codes greater than or equal than 9000). The capi-
tal stock of firm i, Kit is measured using net property, plant and equipment (corresponding
to PPENTQ in Compustat) in quarter t, whereas investment Iit is measured by the growth
rate of capital. This is a normalized measure of net investment (i.e. gross investment minus
depreciation). Firms’ sales are measured by SALEQ in Compustat. All nominal values are
converted to 2009-dollars using the quarterly GDP deflator obtained from FRED. Variables
expressed in Canadian dollars, i.e. those with CURCDQ=CAD, are converted to US dol-
lars using quarterly exchange rates also obtained from FRED. Firm-quarters with missing or
negative PPENT data are excluded.
    Investment rates I/K are computed as the ratio between investment in quarter t and
capital in quarter t − 1.20 To limit the impact of outliers and potential data errors, I exclude
investment rates that are lower than the 1st percentile or larger than the 99th percentile of
the whole sample. This results in 479,620 firm-quarter observations. The investment rate of
the median firm is about 3% per quarter in the sample.

Government exposure The first approach differentiates firms by their exposure to govern-
ment spending. I use Belo, Gala, and Li (2013)’s exposure measure, defined as the proportion
of each industry’s total output that is purchased directly by the government sector (federal
plus state and local), as well as indirectly through the chain of economic links across indus-
tries. Indirect effects arise form the fact that in order for a specific sector to make a sale to the
government, it uses inputs from other sectors. The authors compute indirect governments
spending effects using the Leontief inverse. I use the average exposure over time for each
3-digit SIC industry to construct the variable Expi . Even though most of the government
exposure is concentrated at low levels, some industries rely heavily on the sales to the govern-
ment sector. For example, Radio and Television Broadcasting (SIC 483)’s exposure is about
72 %, followed by Ordnance and Accessories (SIC 348) at 66% and Search and Navigation
Equipment (SIC 381) at 58%. These industries have also been identified as highly exposed
to government policy by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) using data on federal contracts and
Nekarda and Ramey (2011) using an alternative measure derived from NIPA accounts.
    The main investment rate specification takes the following form
                        Iit
                             = αi + β ln(P CIt ) × Expi + γMt + QRTt + it
                       Kit−1
   where i indexes firms and t indexes time. The dependent variable Iit /Kit−1 represents
the investment rate, ln(P CIt ) is the natural logarithm of quarterly PCI, Expi denotes the
  20
     Quarter t corresponds to the calendar quarter rather than the fiscal quarter. This is done for consistency
with PCI measures.


                                                      24
government exposure level of the industry to which firm i belongs, αi is the firm fixed-effect,
and QRTt represents calendar-quarter dummies. To control for macroeconomic conditions
(Mit−1 ), and following Gulen and Ion (2015), I include lagged quarterly change in (log) GDP.
    Table 3 displays the results for the estimated effects on firms’ investment rates of the
natural logarithm of partisan conflict interacted with the measure of exposure, ln(P CIt ) ×
Expi . I control for unobserved characteristics of the firm with firm fixed-effects, as well as
unobserved common factors that change over time, with time fixed-effects. Standard errors
are clustered at the firm level and the calendar-quarter level in order to correct for potential
cross-sectional and serial correlation in the error term it (Petersen (2009). The estimated
coefficient of −0.0631 indicates for the median firm in the sample, which sells 17% of its
output to the government, a 1% increase in partisan conflict is associated with a decline of
0.0107 in their investment rate (computed as −0.0631 × 0.17).21 Given that the investment
rate of the median firm is 3.4%, a one percent increase in partisan conflict is associated with
a 0.32 percent decline in investment (computed as 0.0107/3.4 × 100). To put this number
in perspective, notice that ln(P CI) was 4.42 in 2007 and reached 4.97 in 2011. This 55 log
point increase, according to the estimation, would have been associated with a 17% decline
in investment rates for the median firm. This result is in line with the theoretical predictions
in Bernanke (1983) and Dixit and Pindyck (1994), among others.
    Given the forward looking nature of firm investment decisions, Specifications (2) to (5)
include forecasts for the growth rate of government expenditures relative to GDP (interacted
with government exposure) as an additional control. The variable corresponds to the mean
forecasted change in quarterly Real Federal Government Consumption and Gross Investment
(rfedgov2), obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Fore-
casters. The coefficient of interest has a similar magnitude when compared to the benchmark
case, as seen by comparing the first two specifications.
    The third specification in the table considers the effects of the moving average of the
partisan conflict index since the last election,
                                                       L
                                                       X P CIt−l
                                             P CIt =                 ,
                                                              L+1
                                                        l=0

where L is the number of quarters since the last election, under the convention that L = 0
indicates the quarter in which an election (either midterm or presidential) is held. The idea
behind this specification is that investors who are trying to learn the true degree of partisan
conflict from news may average out what they have observed since the last time the composi-
tion of government changed. This is consistent with a Bayesian updating posterior if the PCI
at any given point in time is understood as a signal about true partisan conflict (see Azzi-
monti, 2017). For consistency, I will use the moving average of the natural logarithm of PCI
instead, ln(P CIt ). The result is presented in the second column of Table 3. The estimated
coefficient is still negative and statistically significant. Moreover, a one percent increase in
beliefs about partisan conflict has a stronger effect on investment decisions, −0.0810, than a
one percent increase in the index itself. The third specification controls for economic policy
 21
      Median firm is defined as the firm in the third quintile of total deflated sales over the time period.

          Notes: The sample period is 1985:Q1-2015:Q1. The dependent variable is the the investment rate I/K of firm i in
          quarter t. Capital Kit is measured with (Net) Property, Plant, and Equipment and investment Iit with the change
          in this variable. The investment rate is defined by Iit /Kit−1 . The independent variables in specification (1) are
          the natural log of PCI, ln(P CIt ) interacted with firm exposure Expi , lagged GDP growth, firm-fixed-effects, and
          time-fixed effects. Specifications (2) to (5) include forecasted government expenditures as a percentage of GDP.
          Specification (3) considers ln(P CIt ), the moving average of P CI between elections, interacted with firm exposure.

          Specification (4) controls for EPU, by interacting ln(EP Ut ) × Expi . Specification (5) is identical to (2) but allows
          for the coefficient to differ in the period prior to the Great Recession. All regressions are weighted by average sales
          of the firm during the sample period. Standard errors are clustered by firm and corrected for heteroscedasticity and

uncertainty by including the interaction between the natural logarithm of EP U and firm’s
exposure to government spending Expi in a specification similar to (2). The estimated ef-
fect of PCI is basically unchanged. Finally, to study whether the results are driven by the
recent financial crisis, I allow the coefficient on the interaction term to be different in the
period prior to 2007 to that following the Great Recession. I compute this using a specifi-
cation analogous to (2), with the independent variable is interacted with a dummy variable
It<2007 = 1 for any year between 1929 and 2006 and zero otherwise; the dummy It≥2007 = 1
is analogously defined but for any year between 2007 and 2015. The resulting coefficients,
shown under Specification (5), are almost identical to each other and close in magnitude to
the coefficient found in the benchmark specification.22 This indicates that the negative effect
of partisan conflict on firm investment rates is not resulting from their behavior in the most
recent recession, consistently with the findings from the VAR model.

                                                                 26
Political contributions In the second strategy, publicly traded firms are differentiated by
their political contribution practices. I use a contribution index developed by Cooper, Gulen,
and Ovtchinnikov (2010), who collect data from the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC)
to create contributions to political campaigns in the U.S made by corporations through their
corporate political action committees (PACs). Under the assumption that firms support a
portfolio of candidates on presidential and mid-term elections, it is possible to sum up, over
a rolling multiyear window, the number of candidates that each firm supports. Because the
ability of the candidate to actually help a particular firm through policy depends on other
factors, the index only includes candidates that hold office in the same state in which the firm
is headquartered, and it is adjusted by the candidate’s strength (defined next). In particular,
letting Contit denote the contribution index in period t, we have that
                                            J
                                            X              N V Cjt
                                 Contit =          Ijt ×           × Hjt,t−5 ,
                                                           N OVjt
                                             j=1

     where Ijt is a dummy variable that equals one if candidate j is in office at time t, and zero
otherwise; N V Cjt denotes the number of votes that candidate j’s party holds in office at time
t whereas N OVjt is the number of votes that candidate j’s opposing party holds in office at
                          N V Cjt
time t. Hence, the ratio N OVjt   reflects the party’s strength relative to the opposition. Finally,
Hjt,t−1 is an indicator variable that equals one if candidate j is running for office from the
state in which firm i is headquartered and zero otherwise. The variable J denotes the total
number of candidates that receive contributions from firm i. The authors compute this index
for a series of presidential and mid-term elections between 1984 and 2004. In P     the estimation,
I focus on the average value of the index over this interval of time, Conti = t Contit so it
is time-independent. This variable is interacted with the partisan conflict index. Intuitively,
firms with high average contribution indexes are relatively more affected by political gridlock,
as the ability of the candidates they support to enact favorable policies is lower. Therefore,
we expect the coefficient on ln(P CIt ) × Conti to be negative.23
     The main investment rate specification takes the following form
                       Iit
                            = αi + β ln(P CIt ) × Conti + γMt + QRTt + it ,
                      Kit−1
which is analogous to the previous model with the exception that now the interaction term
is ln(P CIt ) × Conti .
    The first column of Table 4 reports the coefficient of ln(P CIt ) × Conti , controlling for
firm fixed-effects and time fixed-effects (this is a specification equivalent to the one in col-
umn (1), but considering contributions rather than exposure to government spending). The
  23
    An alternative interpretation could be that firms mostly try to buy inaction from policymakers through
campaign contributions. This would be the case if firms were more interested in preventing new regulations
than in repealing existing ones or in preventing the introduction of new regulations. If that were the case,
we would expect the coefficient on ln(P CIt ) × Conti to be positive or insignificant, as firm would actually
benefit from gridlock. As we see from the result of the empirical model, the coefficient is actually negative,
supporting the hypothesis that partisan conflict is worse for firm that contribute a lot. I would like to thank
an anonymous referee for pointing this alternative hypothesis.

                     variable. The investment rate is defined by Iit /Kit−1 . The independent vari-

                     ables in specification (1) are the natural log of PCI, ln(P CIt ) interacted with
                     political contributions Conti , lagged GDP growth, firm-fixed-effects, and time-
                     fixed effects. Specification (2) considers ln(P CIt ), the moving average of P CI
                     between elections, interacted with political contributions. Specification (3) con-
                     trols for EPU, by interacting ln EP U × Conti . All regressions are weighted by

number of observations is much smaller than in the previous section for two reasons. First,
because the sample period under consideration is restricted to coincide with the period in
which the contribution index is computed, namely 1985:Q1 to 2004:Q4. Second, because
only about 9% of Compustat firms engage in contributions through PACs. As a result, the
sample consists of only 661 firms and 35,041 firm-quarter observations (relative to 11,419
firms and 391,616 firm-quarter observations in the previous specification). These firms have
slightly different characteristics: they tend to be significantly larger (average sales are three
times larger) and have lower investment rates (median investment rates are 2.4% versus 3.4%
before). The estimated coefficient is negative and significant. Considering that the median
firm (measured in terms of sales) in this sample has a contribution index of 2.6, a one percent
increase in the partisan conflict index is associated with a decline in the investment rate of
−0.0109 = −0.00419 × 2.6. This number is slightly below the one computed when firms were
differentiated by their exposure to government spending, but because the investment rate is
actually smaller, it corresponds to a 0.45 percent change in the investment rate of the median
firm (0.45 = −0.0109/2.4 × 100). The second column re-computes Specification (1) but using
the moving average of partisan conflict instead of the PCI interacted with the firms’ contri-

bution index. This specification is analogous to the one estimated in column (2) of Table
3. As in the previous case, the resulting coefficient −0.00539 is larger, indicating that a one
percent increase in expectations about partisan conflict discourages investment even more
than a one percent increase in PCI. Notice that the last two specifications are estimated in
a period that precedes the Great Recession (e.g. it ends in 2004). This is reassuring, as the
effects of news about political discord identified in this paper are not just driven by abnormal
trends taking place during the Great Recession. Finally, the last column controls for EPU by
including the interaction between ln EP U and the contribution index Conti . The negative
and statistically significant coefficient on PCI indicates that the findings are not confounding
the effects of the EPU indicator.


4    Conclusion and extensions
This paper investigates whether news about partisan conflict and private investment are neg-
atively related. I develop an index of partisan conflict based on a semantic-search approach
on newspaper articles. I show that the indicator has a plausible behavior, as it is consistent
with that of other variables determining the political process (such as polarization and po-
litical power), as well as trends in media coverage, and short-term shocks that are expected
to affect true partisan conflict. Using historical data (e.g. 1929 to 2013), I show that the
index is negatively associated with real aggregate investment in the US. I also show that
innovations to the PCI result in lower investment rates at the firm level.
     This is a first step towards understanding the effects of political disagreement on economic
outcomes, and as such it could be improved in several dimensions. First, the index only
considers the frequency of articles reporting political discord but ignores the intensity and
relevance of alternative news articles. Second, the analysis makes exclusive use of newspapers,
ignoring other sources of news such as cable TV or internet outlets. It may be interesting
to study the effect of these alternative sources of information, particularly social media, on
investors’ expectations in future work. Analyzing the effects of partisan conflict on the US
budget cycle (following Alt and Lassen, 2006), its effects on the composition of durable and
nondurable consumption, on employment levels, or on foreign direct investment could also
be interesting extensions to this work.

5     Appendix
5.1   Partisan conflict and economic policy uncertainty
The methodology used to compute the PCI is similar to the one Baker, Bloom, and Davis
(2016) followed to construct EPU. While we both use a semantic search approach to identify
relevant newspaper articles, the set of words used in the searches is dramatically different.
While these authors include the words ‘economic/economy,’ ‘uncertainty’ and an proxies for
‘policy,’ I search for words that indicate disagreement between policymakers.
    In addition, as EPU and PCI represent different concepts, they are characterized by dis-
tinctive features. High levels of partisan conflict are interpreted as situations where agreement
between two parties that share decision-making power is hard to reach, so policies are ex-
pected to be less effective at preventing recessions and tail risks. Moderate levels of partisan
conflict should be associated with positive economic policy uncertainty, as investors cannot
predict which policies will be undertaken. Examples are the debt ceiling debate (will the
government change taxes to avoid a fiscal cliff?), the passage of Obamacare (will Congress
modify the health care system effectively, or will this result in an explosion of public debt?),
or the uncertainty associated with tax expirations (will tax cuts expire or will the two parties
agree on further extensions?). In situations like these, we would expect government dysfunc-
tion to induce economic policy uncertainty and the two indexes to move in tandem. Figure
13, which depicts the PCI (solid line) together with the news-based EPU index (dashed line),
shows that the indexes share a similar trend.

Figure 13: Partisan conflict (solid) and news-based economic policy uncertainty (dashed). Shutdown
spike truncated for readability.


    Partisan conflict need not, however, always cause economic policy uncertainty to increase.
Under extreme levels of partisan disagreement (e.g., when Congress is divided and polariza-
tion levels are high) the government may enter a gridlock state, or even a shutdown and the
relationship between EPU and PCI may break, at least in the short-run. This is consistent
with the behavior of the series in Figure 13 around the 2013 shutdown. Notice, however, that
shutdowns may still be detrimental for the economy. When the PCI reaches extreme values,
investors become very pessimistic about the ability of the government to take the appropriate
measures to reduce tail risks or recessions, and this may depress investment.
    There is no clear relationship between cyclical PCI and EPU (that is, between deviations
from trend of these two variables). This happens because measured EPU may fluctuate
as a consequence of factors unrelated to policy and regulation determined by the executive
and legislative powers, and thus to partisan conflict. Inspecting Figure 13, we can see that
EPU is affected by monetary policy (such as interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve) but
the PCI is completely unresponsive to it. This is reasonable, as monetary policy is chosen
by an independent authority, but may cause (monetary) policy uncertainty. Finally, there
are important differences in the behavior of the two variables in the presence of military
conflict: While the EPU increases during wars or under national security threats (for example,
9/11 or the Gulf Wars), partisan conflict tends to remain relatively low or even decrease.
The fact that the EPU increases sharply during these events indicates the existence of a
substantial proportion of newspaper articles discussing government policy. These articles are
not, however, reporting high levels of conflict between parties. This suggests that lower-than-


                                                                                                                                32
average values of the PCI during national threats do indeed reflect rallies around the flag,
rather than just being a by-product of changes in media coverage toward war-related news.
Because of all these factors, the correlation between partisan conflict and the news-based
index of economic policy uncertainty developed by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) is only
0.34 in the recent period (1985-2015).24

Figure 14: Partisan conflict (solid) and news-based economic policy uncertainty (dashed). Both
series are normalized to 100 in 1990.

    The last important difference between the two series lies on the fact that there exist two
types of EPU. The first one, which has been explored in the theoretical section, relates to
which policies would be chosen at each point in time, or more specifically, whether preventives
policies would be implemented at all. The second one is associated with the uncertain conse-
quences of policies that have already been chosen by the government (see Pastor and Veronesi,
2013 for a theoretical discussion). Partisan conflict only causes the first type of uncertainty.
Discussions surrounding the approval of a stimulus package or whether the debt-ceiling would
be lifted to avert default are clear examples. The policies implemented in response to the
Great Depression, 9/11, or the Iraq wars, on the other hand, faced little or no opposition,
in a period of low PC. For example, the New Deal was easily approved with a Democratic
supermajority in both houses. The response to the terrorist attacks in 2001 was clearly a
bipartisan effort. The large spikes observed in the EPU series result from uncertainty about
whether the implemented policies would be effective (to end the Great Depression, to dis-
courage further attacks, or to avoid a war with other Middle-Eastern countries), rather than
  24
     This correlation is computed using only the news-based index of economic policy uncertainty and not the
final EPU. The reason is that tax expirations account for about one-third of the EPU index, which I wanted
to exclude to make the comparison. If I use the benchmark EPU measure, which includes tax expirations, the
correlation between the two indexes is about 0.47.

in these episodes is evident by looking a the historical partisan conflict and economic policy
uncertainty series, in Figure 14.

In addition, news items are restricted to at least 200 words. In addition, I exclude editorials
and commentaries from the search in an attempt to reduce potential ideological biases (see
the work by Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010, on media slant).


6     Words used in Search Query
The set of words used in the Factiva query follows:
    Political Disagreement: standstill, stalemate, gridlock, disagreemein, fail to compro-
mise, polarization, polarized, dysfunctional, ideological difference(s), deadlock, budget battle
/ fight, filibuster, standoff, veto, vetoes, vetoing, delay /oppose bill.
    Government: White House, senate, senator, Capitol, Congress, congressman(woman),
party, partisan, Republican, GOP, Democrat, political, politician, legislator, lawmaker, ”the
President”, Appropriation Committee, Finance Committee, Ways and Means Committee,
federal government.


6.1   Robustness to the set of words
In this subsection, I analyze whether the PC indicator is robust to restricting the search
to involve specific terms related to fiscal policy. The article search focuses on political dis-
agreement, without being specific about particular policy terms. For a robustness check, I
recomputed the historical index conditioning articles to involve specific public policies. The
index is computed using articles containing at least one word at the intersection of the fol-
lowing three categories: (i) political disagreement, (ii) government, and (iii) public policy.
The terms involved in the first two categories are identical to the ones used to construct the




                                                35
historical index. The list of terms used in the third category can be found below.25
    On average, these articles correspond to about 60% of the total number of counts obtained
in the original search, with the ratio increasing to over 76% since 2006.

Figure 15: Partisan conflict: historical series (dashed) vs. partisan conflict over specific policies
(solid).

    The resulting index (computed following the methodology described in Section 2.1), Par-
tisan conflict over policies, can be found together with the historical series in Figure 15.
When conditioning the search to contain specific policy terms, the resulting index is on av-
erage lower than the historical one until about 1968, year after which the two series become
virtually identical. This is consistent with the observation that race and religion (rather
than wealth) were the dominant determinants of political ideology before the 1970s. For
example, the policy terms listed above do not capture terms related to the debate on voting
participation that lead to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

  Notes: The sample period is 1985:Q1-2015:Q1. The dependent variable is the the investment rate I/K of
  firm i in quarter t. Capital Kit is measured with (Net) Property, Plant, and Equipment and investment Iit
  with the change in this variable. The investment rate is defined by Iit /Kit−1 . The independent variables
  in specification (1) are the natural log of PCI, ln(P CIt ) interacted with firm exposure Expi , lagged GDP
  growth, firm-fixed-effects, and time-fixed effects. Specification (2) considers ln(P CIt ), the moving average
  of P CI between elections, interacted with firm exposure. Specification (3) controls for EPU, by interacting

  ln EP U × Expi . Specification (4) is identical to (1) but allows for the coefficient to differ in the period
  prior to the Great Recession. All regressions are weighted by average sales of the firm during the sample
  period. Standard errors are clustered by firm and corrected for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation;
  they are shown in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
