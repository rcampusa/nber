Product Quality and Market Size

                                           ABSTRACT

Recent literature notes that when quality is produced with fixed costs, a high quality firm can
undercut its rival's prices and may find it profitable to invest more in quality as market size grows
large. As a result, a market can remain concentrated even as it grows large. When quality is

produced with variable costs, by contrast, a wide range of product qualities can coexist in the market
because they are offered at different prices. Larger markets will fragment and offer products with

a wider range of qualities. Using US urban areas as markets, we examine the relationships between
market size and product quality - and between market size and product concentration - for two
industries that differ in their quality production process. We document that in the restaurants
industry, where quality is produced largely with variable costs, the range of qualities on offer

increases in market size, with each product maintaining a small market share. In daily newspapers,
where quality is produced with fixed costs, the average quality of products increases with market
size, and the market does not fragment as it grows large.

1       Introduction
Is it true, as casual empiricism suggests, that larger markets offer not only more
but better products? Urban economists traditionally understand cities to balance
negative externalities of congestion against the positive effects of agglomeration
on productivity and consumers (Henderson, 1969). It is commonly assumed that
that agglomeration promotes product variety.1 Here we explore a related but dis-
tinct effect on consumers, the effect of agglomeration (or city size) on product
quality. This question is interesting in itself and also because high quality prod-
ucts may provide a source of attraction to productive residents (Jacobs (1961),
Glaeser, Kolko, and Saez (2001).)
     Recent theoretical developments in industrial organization provide an invalu-
able framework for thinking about the relationship between product quality and
market size. In a series of important books and articles, Shaked and Sutton (e.g.
Shaked and Sutton (1987) and Sutton (1991)) have sought to explain the circum-
stances in which markets remain concentrated as they grow large. In particular,
Shaked and Sutton show that , then as markets grow large in industries where
quality is produced mainly through outlays on fixed costs, at least one firm will
have an incentive to invest in quality. Because quality is produced with fixed
rather than marginal costs, a higher quality firm can undercut its rivals’ prices and
attain substantial market share. As a result, product quality in some industries
will increase in market size, even as product variety need not increase (because
markets remain concentrated at the product level.) Just as the Dixit and Stiglitz
(1977) model of monopolistic competition has been useful for understanding ben-
efits of product variety in economic geography, application of Sutton (1991) can
help guide insight into the relationship between product quality and market size.
     While the outcome of the relationship between product quality and market size
is of interest to urban economists, the process of quality competition is also of in-
terest to industrial organization economists for what it reveals about how markets
function when firms compete in quality (i.e. via vertical differentiation.) The re-
lationship between product quality and market size may also be of interest as a
purely descriptive matter, adding to previous studies that look at the relationship
between market size and the number and size of establishments. In this paper
we will examine descriptive data on the relationship between product quality and
market size, where the observations are a cross-section of U.S. metropolitan areas.

2    Background on Cities and Product Differentiation
In the revival of spatial economics following on the suggestions of Krugman
(1991), it is traditional to emphasize three reasons for the creation of cities. First,
there may be locally abundant factors that attract production; these could be partly
exogenous (ports) or else partly resulting from other endogenous factors (abun-
dant high-quality labor.) Second, there may be direct production externalities, as
in knowledge spillovers. Finally, there may be indirect, market-mediated exter-
nalities, as in those modeled by Krugman that come from the interaction of fixed
costs, imperfect competition and transportation costs. For example, if fixed costs
dictate one production location, then minimizing transportation costs suggests lo-
cating near the largest aggregation of consumers.
    Krugman employs a Dixit-Stiglitz model with economies of scale via exoge-
nous fixed costs and symmetric, horizontally differentiated products demanded by
a representative consumer. This set-up allows for a welfare benefit to consumers
in larger cities, which comes only from additional symmetrically differentiated
products.
    Dixit-Stiglitz models are useful for presenting a simple equilibrium analysis
of optimal city sizes or a simple welfare analysis of optimal numbers of products.
However, Dixit-Stiglitz models are not used much in the empirical study of actual
industries because of their very restrictive assumptions. The product space of an
actual industry is rarely symmetric, and it is typically not helpful to think of de-
mand as being generated by a representative consumer, as much of the rationale
for differentiated products comes from the heterogeneous tastes of consumers.
Further, Dixit-Stiglitz models abstract from questions of product quality, as op-
posed to product variety. In the Dixit-Stiglitz framework, a larger city can have
more products, but not fundamentally different products.
    When the demand for different products comes from heterogeneous consumers,
firms face the choice of not just whether to enter with a symmetric product, but
they also face the choice of where to locate in vertical and/or horizontal product
space. Larger markets may support better products, not just more products. This
reinforces a view that cities may be driven by consumption externalities (Glaeser,
Kolko, and Saez (2001)) and not just the more commonly-cited production exter-
nalities.
    Our current paper might be thought of as part of a larger research agenda which
follows on Krugman’s introduction of models of product differentiation and fixed
costs into trade and urban economies, but looks to introduce richer and more more
realistic forms of differentiation and competition. Here, we specifically want to

                                          2
introduce models of endogenous product quality, where product quality is poten-
tially produced via an increase in fixed costs.
     Our paper builds, and in some ways, improves upon some existing empiri-
cal research on product quality and market size. First, although the theoretical
relationship between product quality and market size has been well explicated,
it has been difficult to document empirically in a fully satisfactory way. Sut-
ton (1991), for example, uses cross-country case studies to document that many
consumer goods industries remain concentrated in large markets. While highly
suggestive, cross-country comparisons suffer from the problem that much more
than market size is changing (and indeed Sutton’s case studies emphasize this, but
the problem is complicated enough to perhaps defy traditional econometric anal-
ysis.) For empirical work, cross-city comparisons within a single country may be
easier to interpret. Ellickson (2001) does consider markets of varying size within
the United States (his markets are supermarket distribution regions, not cities.)
Ellickson’s focus, following Sutton’s theory, is on concentration market structure.
We will add a focus on direct measures of product quality and we will juxtapose
two contrasting industries.
     Our paper also contributes to the literature that documents the relationship
between market size, entry and product variety; e.g. Bresnahan and Reiss (1991),
Berry and Waldfogel (1999) and Campbell and Hopenhayn (2002).


3    Review of the Theory of Product Quality
There is a well-developed literature in IO on product quality in market equilibrium
that we can draw on to motivate the empirical illustrations in this paper. We infor-
mally review and illustrate that theory here; these arguments are also summarized
in a slightly different fashion in Sutton (1991) and related works.
    To address the issues in this paper, we begin with a simple vertical quality
model. Suppose that the utility to consumer i of product j is

                                 uij = θi δj − pj ,                             (1)

where δj is product quality and pj is price. Note that we have assumed away
income effects, and utility is measured in dollars, so that θi is the consumer’s
willingness-to-pay for quality. We assume that θi is distributed on the interval
(0, ∞) so that there are some consumers with arbitrary high θ’s who will pay for
an increase in quality to any level. We also assume that there is a “outside” good


                                         3
of quality zero, available at a price of zero (which is the marginal cost of a zero
quality good.)
    Turning to the cost side, Shaked and Sutton emphasize that increases in quality
can involve increases in fixed and/or marginal cost. The relationship between
market size and the distribution of quality depends on whether quality is produced
primarily through fixed or variable (with respect to output) costs. In particular,
if marginal cost increases only slowly in quality (so that the cost of quality is
borne largely by fixed cost), then high quality products can use price to undercut
lower quality products, potentially driving them out of the market and leading to
a situation where there are a limited set of product qualities on offer, including at
least one high quality good.
    Assume for simplicity that marginal cost, mc, is constant in quantity (qj ) and
is (weakly) increasing in quality, so that variable cost is

                               C(qj , δj ) = qj mc(δj ).                          (2)

Fixed costs also depend on quality:

                                   F C = F (δj ),                                 (3)

but by definition do not depend on qj . We assume that fixed costs are strictly
positive (so there are always economies of scale) and that fixed costs are weakly
increasing in quality.
    Let market size be M and assume some model of price-competition (as in
Nash pricing for single-product firms), so that a quality vector δ leads to some per-
capita variable profit function V (δj , δ−j ). Assuming single-product firms, firm j’s
profit function is then
                                M V (δj , δ−j ) − F (δj )                          (4)

Product Proliferation when Quality increases MC
In discussing the possible proliferation of products, one crucial point is the possi-
bility that a high quality product could undercut a lower quality product and drive
its sales to zero. If marginal cost is convex in quality (as opposed to utility which
is assumed linear in quality), then such undercutting is not profitable when the
lower-quality firm is pricing very near marginal cost. In very large markets, even
prices near marginal cost can generate enough variable profit to cover fixed costs
and so this allows products of many quality levels to survive in equilibrium.


                                          4
    Given marginal costs that are increasing and convex in quality, the appendix
reviews the formal argument that the space of product qualities will fill in and the
maximum quality offered in the market will increase as market size increases. The
intuition is that the vertical model with increasing convex marginal costs is very
much like a horizontal model. Given marginal cost pricing, different consumers
prefer different goods. Assuming marginal cost pricing, the utility function be-
comes:
                                uij = θi δj − mc(δj )                            (5)
and the first-order condition for consumer i’s optimal quality is
                                          ∂mc
                                   θi −       =0                                   (6)
                                          ∂δj

with second-order condition
                                     ∂ 2 mc
                                            > 0.                                   (7)
                                      ∂δj2
The second-order condition is satisfied if marginal cost is convex in quality and it
is easy to state regularity conditions under which there is a unique solution to the
first-order condition for every θ, with higher θ’s demanding higher qualities.
     In considering different real world markets, it will not be obvious whether
marginal cost is convex in some abstract measure of quality. However, the key
empirical idea is that marginal cost rises sufficiently fast in quality so that higher-
quality firms cannot undercut low quality firms in price. In this case, we expect
that as market size increases, products will proliferate so that every segment of
the quality line will eventually be offered by some product. In particular, larger
markets can support more high-quality goods and (if the support of θ is unbounded
at the top) there is a upper bound on the maximum quality level that increases in
market size.
     The product proliferation result also guarantees that product-concentration
will go to zero as market size increases. Sutton (1991) emphasizes that firm-level
concentration indexes may not go to zero even in this case, because multi-product
firms are common in differentiated products industries. However, we will con-
sider simple product-level measures in this paper, which to some degree obviates
use of the “bounds” approach of Sutton’s case studies made necessary by Sutton’s
use of firm, rather than product-level data.




                                          5
Quality and Concentration when Quality increases Fixed Costs
If higher-quality firms can undercut low-quality firms (even when the lower qual-
ity firms are pricing near marginal cost), then product proliferation becomes un-
likely. This case occurs when marginal cost is constant in quality and can also
occur when marginal cost is increasing but concave in quality. When increased
quality does not greatly increase marginal cost, it seems empirically reasonable to
think that the cost of quality may be born in part by fixed costs. Such “endogenous
sunk cost” models are reviewed in Shaked and Sutton (1987) and related works.
    In the appendix, we review Shaked and Sutton’s argument that when the bur-
den of quality improvements falls on fixed costs, product proliferation will not
occur. Instead, the concentration of products within the market will not go to zero
as market size increases, but will have some lower bound. In particular, there is a
lower bound (independent of market size) to the market share of largest product,
and there will be at least one high-quality product in the market (which may or
may not also be the largest product in the market.) The maximum quality level
offered in the market is constrained by market size, but will go off to infinity as
market size increases.
    Thus, the direct empirical implications of the Shaked and Sutton model are
for the market share of the largest product (which should have a lower bound in
market size) and for the maximum quality level in the market. More generally, we
might expect to see high levels of product concentration even in larger cities and
we might also expect to see higher quality products in larger cities.

Extensions and Caveats
The literature shows that the flavor of these results does not depend on the extreme
assumptions. For example, one could add a horizontal dimension of quality as in
the utility function
                         uij = θi δ − αi pj − γ(νi − xj )2 ,                      (8)
where νi is the preferred horizontal location of consumer i and xj is the horizontal
location of product j. In this case, demand is a mixture of pure vertical models,
with each small interval of the horizontal line giving rise to a “nearly” vertical
model. Given the horizontal dimension, there will be more entry and more product
variety than in the pure vertical model. Especially if there is a correlation between
νi and θi , there may be very popular low quality products even in the endogenous
fixed cost case. However, the Shaked and Sutton result can still go through so that
there is a lower bound to the one-firm concentration ratio.

                                         6
    One might also consider economies or diseconomies of scale in the variable
production function. Diseconomies of scale will strengthen the product prolifer-
ation result, while further economies of scale will strengthen the Shaked-Sutton
concentration result.


4     Industry Background and Data Sources
The basic data for this study are cross sections of product quality measures and
measures of entry and product consumption - and therefore market share and con-
centration - for local markets in the daily newspaper and restaurant industries.
The data are drawn from a variety of sources, and different sorts of measures are
available for different industries.

4.1    Newspapers
Across markets, daily newspapers offer strikingly different product characteris-
tics. Some newspapers offer only a dozen or so pages of news, together with
a limited number of specialized sections (such as sports) and a limited number
of advertisements. Other newspapers offer hundreds of pages of news, adver-
tisements and specialized content. Many newspapers produce a large number of
original news and feature articles, whereas other papers rely largely on outside
news services and syndicated content. Clearly, the quality of a newspaper is an
endogenous choice of the publisher.
    Furthermore, much of the cost of quality is fixed with respect to output. In par-
ticular, the marginal cost of more and better content is limited to the cost of paper,
printing and distribution, whereas the salaries of more (or better) reporters and
editors are fixed with respect to output. These facts, together with the existence,
in the US, of [i] a large number of separated metropolitan newspaper markets of
varying sizes and [ii] a number of good direct measures of product quality, seem
to make newspapers the ideal empirical embodiment of the Shaked and Sutton
endogenous fixed cost theory.
    In the newspaper industry, there may also be some economies of scale in
the variable production function (that is, in printing and distribution.) This will
tend to reinforce the Shaked and Sutton effect. However, note that daily newspa-
pers survive in very small markets without charging unusually high prices, so the
economies of scale in printing and distribution cannot be overwhelmingly large.



                                          7
     We recognize that newspapers derive revenue from both readers and adver-
tisers. In this paper we analyze product quality and market share from the per-
spective of readers. Implicitly we are treating advertising revenue as a per-reader
proportional subsidy.
     Intuitively (and from a casual examination of newspaper pricing) it seems at
least plausible that the increase in marginal cost from high quality is sufficiently
low that high quality newspapers can undercut lower quality papers and therefore
drive low quality competitors from the market. However, this competitive effect
will be offset by some degree of product differentiation. For example, when there
are two competing major metropolitan dailies within one market, they often dif-
fer in format (tabloid versus broadsheet) and in politics (with editorials leaning
somewhat more to the left or right.)
     Also, within a broad metropolitan area there can be a large number of daily
newspapers with a tight (typically suburban) geographic focus. For example, Ta-
ble 1 shows a list of daily newspapers in the general New York city metropolitan
region as of late 2001. In our data, only New York City has three major metropoli-
tan dailies and all the other daily newspapers in the metropolitan region have a
tight regional (or ethnic) specialization, almost always specializing in a particular
county. Indeed, web sites for some of the suburban papers boast of their regional
monopoly status (“Ocean County’s only daily newspaper”).
     This raises an important issue of the market definition. We will in some cases
look just at the major metropolitan dailies, but we will typically err on the side
of caution and include all the daily newspapers in the MSA. One should keep in
mind, then, that our results will hold despite a purposeful introduction of a large
degree of horizontal (geographic) differentiation.
     Much of our data on daily newspapers comes from Burrelle’s Media Direc-
tory which provides information on each daily newspaper published in the US.
We have the name of the newspaper, the language of publication, the “target au-
dience” (e.g. general interest), and the circulation. From the circulation figures,
we can compute measures such as the market share of the largest firm (the 1-firm
concentration ratio) as well as traditional measures like the product-level HHI or
its reciprocal, the number of “newspaper equivalents”. We exclude non-English
newspapers, as well as daily newspapers with a specialized business audience (e.g.
Platt’s Oil Gram or Daily Variety.)
     Turning to the level of geographic aggregation, our data are at the level of the
Census Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for urban areas greater than 50,000.
An MSA consists of a city, plus its surrounding county, plus any adjacent counties

that are considered to be part of the same urban agglomeration.2
    Turning to newspaper quality, we have three measures. The first is the size
(number of pages) of the paper. More content is presumably preferred to less
and therefore the size of the paper is a natural vertical quality attribute.3 Our sec-
ond measure is the is number of reporters on staff (from Burrelle’s), which may be
thought of a measure of locally produced (as opposed to syndicated) content. This
is a measure of inputs rather than output and is therefore similar to Sutton’s mea-
surement of, for example, R&D expenditure. We aggregate pages and reporters to
the market level weighting by circulation.
    Our third measure is a direct output measure of how good the reporters are,
the number of Pulitzer Prizes awarded, 1980-1999. We aggregate across 20 years
to reduce the lumpiness of the measure. We exclude the breaking news category
from the tally because they appear to be awarded to the paper in the locale of the
year’s calamity.4 The are some possible biases in the Pulitzer prize process (such
as a bias toward New York City), that we consider in the empirical analysis below.
    Table 2 shows that our broad MSA newspaper dataset has data on 283 metropoli-
tan areas with an average of about 3 newspapers (including suburban dailies.)
As expected, the distribution of market shares is quite skewed, with the aver-
age product-level Herfindahl index being larger than the Herfindahl of a two-firm
duopoly market (0.69 versus 0.50).

4.2 Restaurants
Product quality is also endogenously chosen by restaurants. However, increased
restaurant quality arguably raises marginal cost at a fairly rapid rate. It seems
plausible that if a high quality French restaurant priced its meals at marginal cost,
there would still be a market for McDonald’s. The French restaurant’s quality
comes in part from expensive ingredients, expensive labor of the kitchen staff
and intensive and customized table service. This does not rule out an increase in
   2
      This can be contrasted with “Primary” MSA’s (PMSA’s), which aggregate less and which can
contain only parts of counties. On the other side, “Consolidated” MSA’s aggregate larger areas.
Our restaurant data contain some PMSA (and some similar “New England County Metropolitan
Areas”.
    3
      Number of pages of the paper might be alternatively thought of as a measure of one input into
the content of the newspaper.

      In the last seven years, four of the breaking or spot awards for journalism have gone a pa-
per local to: the Columbine High School shooting, the crash of TWA flight 800, the Northridge
earthquake, and the bombing of the World Trade Center. See www.pulitzer.org.

restaurant fixed cost as well, but the theory does not require exogenous fixed cost,
just a marginal cost function that allows for product proliferation.5 Restaurants
seem to be a good industry to illustrate product proliferation.
    Even more than in newspapers, the restaurant industry is also marked by hor-
izontal differentiation, in type of cuisine, in the quality of the service and decor,
and in geography. The geographic dispersion of restaurants is particularly tricky
and raises the issue of whether all restaurants in an MSA are properly thought
of as being in the same market. We can imagine two extreme scenarios. In one
scenario, everyone eats in restaurants in their own neighborhood. The growth of
cities, in this scenario, just adds new neighborhoods. If the number of restaurants
per neighborhood is constant, then the number of restaurants will have a linear
relationship to city size, but there is no clear utility gain to consumers. In this sce-
nario (with consumption of only “local” restaurants), a welfare gain would come
   5
    The compensation of the head chef, for example, may be a fixed cost that increases in product
quality.


                                               11
only from an increase in restaurants per capita (meaning more restaurants per
neighborhood.). However, in another extreme scenario (perhaps more applicable
to high quality establishments), every restaurant serves all consumer in the metro
area equally. In this case, any increase in the number of restaurants is a welfare
gain, even if the per-capita number of restaurants does not increase. As the truth
is probably between the two scenarios (even for high-quality restaurants), we will
present information on both per-capita and total numbers of restaurants.
    For restaurant quality we have two sources of data. First, we have the number
of restaurants given four or five Mobil stars, from America’s Best Hotels and
Restaurants (Connolly 1998). Mobil employs the same quality criteria throughout
the country, so the number of restaurants earning 4 or 5 stars provides a measure
of the number of restaurants in the locale with quality above some absolute level.6
    Table 2 shows that there are a total of 131 4 or 5-star restaurants in our 316
MSA sample of restaurant data. Most markets (87 percent) have no 4 or 5-star
restaurants.
    Zagat’s local surveys of restaurants provide our second source of quality data.
Zagat’s provides ratings of restaurants within each of 43 US markets. These rat-
ings are based on surveys of residents of the respective cities. Hence, the ratings
are not comparable across markets. In addition to the basic Zagat ratings (based
on price, food quality, service, and decor), in 1999 Zagat’s also provided “popu-
larity” rankings of the top 20 restaurants, among three age groups, in each of 20
US markets at their website (www.zagat.com). The age groups are 20-29, 30-39,
and 40-49.
    Chain restaurants - with more than one location - frequently appear among
Zagat’s most popular top 20 restaurants in a locale. Of the 460 restaurants in
the sample, 30 correspond to restaurants that appear in more than one sample
market. For example, California Pizza Kitchen is present in 12 of the 20 covered
markets and appears in 26 of 60 Zagat’s age-group-specific top 20 rankings for the
20 covered markets. Assuming that restaurants within a chain offer equal quality
wherever they are located, we can use the Zagat’s data to determine whether larger
markets have more restaurants above some quality threshold by asking whether,
for example, California Pizza Kitchen is lower-ranked in larger markets.
    The US County Business Patterns databased provides data on the number of
   6
     According to the Mobil guide, restaurants receive stars “after an extensive review of inspection
reports from experienced field representatives, the written evaluations of experts who stay and dine
anonymously... A Five-Star lodging or restaurant is one of the best in the country, while a Four-
Star property is outstanding and worth a special trip.” (Connolly 1998)



                                                12
eating and drinking establishments by MSA.7 In addition to the total number of
establishments, the retail census also reports the size distribution of restaurants
according to employment. We use these data to calculate numbers of restaurants
and measures of concentration. Using employment figures to calculate concentra-
tion assumes that output is roughly proportional to employment, which (while not
perfectly correct) doesn’t seem too bad for this industry.


5       Empirical Results on Market Size, Variety and Con-
        centration
To review, theoretical considerations, together with our beliefs about the cost
structure of the industries, lead us to expect the following: 1) larger markets will
have more restaurants of all types, including higher quality restaurants, 2) the
quality of the best newspapers in a market will improve in market size, 3) there
should be lower bound to the market share of the largest newspaper in a market
and 4) the number of establishments will increase in market size for both indus-
tries, but presumably much less rapidly for newspapers than for restaurants.

5.1     Market Size, Maximum Share, Concentration and Num-
        bers
As expected, across the two industries there is a strikingly different relationship
between market size, the number of products and the distribution of market shares.
Figure 1 plots the number of products in the MSA by the population of the MSA.
The upper-left plot graphs both relationships on the same graph – there are obvi-
ously many more restaurants than newspapers. Graphing restaurants alone (upper
right) shows a nearly perfectly linear relationship, consistent with the finding (on
nearly the same data) of Campbell and Hopenhayn (2002). The number of news-
papers also increases, although not in nearly as systematic a fashion (lower left).
    Sutton (1991) emphasizes the prediction for the maximum share. Figure 2a
graphs the maximum market share of the newspapers in the MSA. There appears
to be a lower bound to this share, of about 0.2, even as the cities become very
large.

    If we take the suburban dailies out of the data, the results on numbers and
market shares for newspaper become more dramatic. Figure 2b considers data
on the major metropolitan dailies for the 25 largest US cities (as classified by
industry sources.) The market share on the vertical axis is the share of the largest
metropolitan daily as a fraction of all the metropolitan dailies. The symbols on the
figure indicate the total number of such dailies; only in New York is the number
as large as 3. Strikingly, the lower bound on the largest share seems to be about
50%.8

    We could try to graph the maximum share of restaurants by market size, us-
ing the employment classes in the CBP data to approximate size. However, the
              8
     This is another way of saying the number of products almost never drops below 2; however, in
the one 3 paper town (New York), the maximum share is still nearly half. The result of apparently
bounded maximum share also holds up, again at a different level, to graphing maximum product
share as fraction of population instead of as a fraction of total output.



                                                      16
maximum share of a restaurant is always very small and gets even smaller in large
cities. There is no clear lower bound to the maximum share, other than zero.
     The maximum market share is a traditional “one-product concentration ra-
tio.” As a descriptive matter, we can also measure concentration by a traditional
product-level HHI, showing how it varies by market size in restaurants and news-
papers. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of HHI’s by market size; in this figure
the HHI’s are the sum of squared percentage shares, so they vary from zero to
10,000. The HHI figures are hard to graph on a scatterplot, because of a build-up
of points on perfect concentration (in newspapers) and virtually zero concentra-
tion (for restaurants). Instead of a scatterplot, we use a STATA-generated box-and-
whisker plot, where the x-axis plots deciles of the population distributions and the
box-and-whisker figures summarize the distribution of HHIs on the y-axis. The
three lines in each box are, from the top, the 75th 50th, and 25th percentiles of the
distribution. The lines outside the box are the 90th and 10th percentiles, and the in-
dividual circles (not always shown) give outliers. The box partly collapses when,
for example, the median and 25th percentile are equal, completely collapses when
the 75th and 25th percentiles are equal and even the whiskers disappear when the
10th percentile equals the 90th.
     In Figure 3, we see that concentration is, of course, much lower in restau-
rants than in newspapers. The juxtaposition of figures 3b and 3c, however, shows
that concentration falls in market size in restaurants while it is relatively constant
even as market size increases in newspapers. Even though the largest markets
have roughly 20 dailies (including suburban papers, etc.), the median newspaper
HHI even across markets in the top decile is roughly 5000, the same level as in a
symmetric duopoly.
     So far, we have been considering only plots of the data with no tests of signif-
icance or controls. Table 3 reports regressions of the numbers of newspapers (and
restaurants) on market size. In addition to the log of the raw number, the table
gives results using as the dependent variable the log of the “numbers equivalents”
(the inverse HHI.) The coefficient on market size (log population) is much smaller
for newspapers than for restaurants. While the restaurant coefficient in the ln(N )
regression without controls (column two) is roughly one (indicating proportion-
ality), the newspaper coefficient on ln(N ) is 0.5 and on the numbers equivalent
is less than 0.23. The numbers of both newspapers and restaurants increase in
market size, but the increase is much slower for newspapers.
     The fourth and last columns give results using a limited number of demo-
graphic controls. The percentage of the population with some college has a sta-
tistically significant positive association with the restaurant log numbers equiva-

equilavent for newspapers and the “% Old” (those over 65) has a smaller and pos-
sibility insignificant effect (note that those “middle-aged”, the omitted category,
seem to be the newspaper readers.) The bottom line is that the contrast between
the two markets remains in the presence of demographic controls. Further, that
constrast is robust across regressions (not reported here) that vary the definition
of the dependent variable (levels vs. logs), the list included demographics and the
set of markets in the sample.

 Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. The unit of observation for newspaper data is msa/cmsa.
For restaurants, data are available by necma/msa/pmsa. Consequently , sample sizes differ. Also,
  our demographic data match the msa/cmsa and in Column 4 (restaurants with demographic
      controls) we simply drop the restaurant markets that do not match the msa/cmsa data.

   To conclude this section, then, we have illustrated dramatic differences, across
market size, in the share distribution of the two industries. We have argued that
quality is endogenously choosen in each industry, but the fact that newspaper

                                              19
quality is largely fixed with respect to output means that the maximum share of a
newspaper should have a lower bound. Figure 2b provides the most dramatic il-
lustration of this, showing that the number of major metropolitan dailies hardly in-
creases, constrasting greatly with the linear increase in the number of restaurants.
The qualitative nature of this result is robust to alternative market definitions and
measures of concentration.

5.2    Product Quality
We expect to find that the quality of the best newspaper in a market increases
dramatically, while restaurants should be filling out the entire quality distribution
(including at the top).

Newspapers and Quality
While the number of newspapers changes relatively little (especially aside from
the horizontally differentiated suburban dailies), the nature and quality of news-
papers change very dramatically across market size. Figure 4 shows box-and-
whisker plots of various maximum quality measures across market size. These
box-and-whisper plots give a simple descriptive and “non-parametric” feel for the
distribution of the maximum quality levels across the market sizes.
     Figure 4 demonstrates the large changes in the nature of newspapers across
markets. The physical page size of the papers increases (see the upper left panel),
which is associated with both more news and more advertising, both of which
are valued by some consumers. The local journalistic staff increases (upper right
panel), indicating that more news is produced with a local angle (as opposed to
relying on wire reports.) (The staff size variable is especially obvious as a com-
ponent of fixed but not marginal cost.)
     The staff may be of higher quality in larger cities, as well. The larger cities
appear to win more Pulitzers per staff member (lower panels of Figure 4). This is
observed not just in the largest cities, as the pattern clearly remains when the top
decile of the distribution is removed (in the lower right panel.)
     While we have only imperfect measures of quality, the same pattern shows
up using each measure. It is clear that the nature of the papers is changing much
more than the number of papers.
     In our (biased) opinion, the across-metro area U.S. newspaper data is the
cleanest empirical example of Sutton’s endogenous sunk cost argument, because
[i] the market size “experiment” is (relatively) clean, [ii] there is clear prior reason

                                          20
to believe that the cost of quality is largely fixed with respect to output, [iii] the
total number of products increases fairly slowly in market size, [iv] there is a clear
lower bound to the maximum share and [v] we have direct measures of quality,
which increase very rapidly in market size.
    The descriptive results on newspaper quality are robust with respect to the
introduction of controls in a regression analysis, as shown in Table 4.

Restaurants and Quality
In restaurants, we predict that the full distribution of quality levels will fill in. We
would like data on the quality of each restaurant in the market. Our actual data fall
short of the ideal but still allow us to test for these effects. Rather than observing
the full distribution of qualities, in the Mobil restaurant data we instead observe
the number of restaurants in each market above a (high) absolute quality threshold.
Furthermore, using the Zagat’s data we can examine whether the distribution fills

out in larger market above the (somewhat lower) thresholds defined by various
multi-city chain restaurants. Finally, since the number of “lower quality” restau-
rants is the total number minus the number of “higher quality” establishments, we
also have information on the lower end of the quality distribution.
    Figure 5 characterizes the relationship between top restaurant availability and
market size. The box-and-whisker plots are again very useful here, as it is hard
to plot the very large number of zeros in the data. The figure shows a clear posi-
tive relationship: there are more top restaurants in larger markets. New York City
alone has 31 such restaurants. The relationship does not depend on the inclusion
of New York, however. The upper right panel excludes the top decile, and the pos-
itive relationship remains clear. The lower panels reproduce the upper panels, but
using top restaurants per capita instead of the total number of restaurants. These
last figures are consistent with the number of high quality restaurants increasing
faster than population, which suggests that the “neighborhood replication” (geo-
graphic dispersion) argument discussed above does not entirely explain the market
size / top restaurant relationship.
    Figure 5 cannot control for other observable variables, or for the implicit cen-
soring problem that many cities have zero top restaurants. Table 5 reports re-
gressions of the top restaurant count on population and controls, and the positive
relationships evident in Figure 5 appear here as well and are statistically signifi-
cant. We estimate both OLS and tobit models.
    We take the evidence in Figure 5 and Table 5 as a clear indication that the num-
ber of high quality restaurants increases in market size and that even the number
of high quality restaurants per-capita is higher is larger cities.
    What about the remainder of the restaurant quality distribution? We have two
ways to address this. First, consider figure 2 showing the relationship between
market size and the total numbers of restaurants (and newspapers). Clearly, the
number of “non-top” restaurants is increasing in market size as well. This re-
lationship is nearly linear, which does not rule out the neighborhood replication
argument for lower-quality restaurants (as would make sense if consumers will
not travel very far for lower quality restaurants.)
    The Zagat’s data allow us to examine the filling out hypothesis for other cut-
offs. To use the Zagat’s chain restaurant data, we have to assume that the “true”
quality of chain restaurants is the same in even city in which they operate. (Chain
management is typically designed to ensure that this is so.) Each chain then de-
fines a quality level that is constant across cities and we can check for the number
of restaurants above each quality ranking. In fact, we don’t observe the total num-
ber of restaurants above a quality threshold, but we do have the data on the Most

Popular Top 20 restaurants (by age group). Thus, we know the [censored at 20]
number of restaurants considered by each age group of Zagat respondents to be
“better” than a given chain, censored at 20 and above.
    Figure 6 shows the tendency for the most widespread chains to appear in the
“Popular Top 20” when operating in smaller and larger markets. First, the data is
divided into large and small markets (the dark and light bars). Each panel repre-
sents a different age group: the decades of the 20s, 30s and 40s. Each restaurant
chain has a bar of dark/light bars representing the % of (large or small) markets
featuring that chain in the top 20. Long bars are indications of low market quality
(in the sense of a low number of restaurants above the assumed threshold). In
all cases but one, the dark (small markets) bars are longer than the large market

bars so, with one exception, a chain’s restaurants are more likely to be highly
ranked when operating in smaller markets. The figure doesn’t address the issues
of heterogeneity in markets and in restaurant chains, so Table 6 presents regression
evidence with controls.
    Table 6 presents the results of Tobit regressions of censored chain rank on pop-
ulation, MSA demographics and survey respondant age. The regression includes
restaurant-chain fixed effects.9 All models confirmed the following result: chains
appearing in multiple markets are ranked lower in larger markets. Assuming that
the quality of a given chain restaurant is constant in all markets, this result con-
firms our prediction that larger markets have more restaurants above particular
quality thresholds.

   Notes: Tobit estimates with restaurant-chain fixed effects. Dependent variable is rank if the
   restaurant appears in the Zagats popularity top 20; if the chain is present in the market but
unranked and its rank is presumed to be worst than 20 (i.e. rank > 20). A larger rank means there
  are more restaurants above the quality threshold defined by the chain. Only chain restaurants
                        (with locations in multiple markets) are included.

     The results in Table 6 pool the data on each age category, but include age dummies as controls
in the regression, imposing that the chain fixed effects (as well as the other slope coefficients) do
not change in age. The number of observations for each fixed effect is then the number of MSAs
times 3 age groups. This greatly aids in the estimation of the non-linear fixed effects. Note that we
obtain virtually identical results with random effects or conventional tobits. Note that we constrain
the slope coefficients to be constant across restaurants and across age groups.

    The positive relationship between market size and the number of restaurants
above various quality thresholds has two potential “horizontal” explanations, in
addition to the “vertical” explanation of filling in the range of available qualities.
First, it may reflect “neighborhood replication” in market size; this involves horiz-
tonal differentiation in geography. Second, it may reflect growth in the types of
food (cuisine) that is offered in each location. In practice, there may be some pro-
liferation in horizontal dimensions together with some proliferation in a vertical
dimension and the distinction may matter very little in most policy applications.
However, for the purpose of comparing Sutton-like predictions across city-sizes,
it may be of interest to know if the proliferation in restaurants is largely vertical
or else appears to be largely horizontal.
    As for the neighborhood replication argument, the chain restaurants actually
do appear in multiple locations. One might think this would give them a special
advantage in large cities, but they are not more popular in larger cities.
    On balance then, we doubt that the neighborhood replication argument ex-
plains the relationship between market size and high quality restaurants. First,
on a priori grounds we suspect that high quality restaurants, unlike neighborhood
pizza joints, serve entire metropolitan areas. Second, our results show that market
size is positively related to not only the number of high quality restaurants but
also the per capita number. Finally, under the neighborhood replication argument,
restaurants with multiple locations within a market would tend to achieve higher
popularity rankings than standalone neighborhood restaurants, contrary to the re-
sults in Table 6. However, for lower quality restaurants, the “neighborhood repli-
cation” argument (under which city neighborhoods would offer about the same
choices in small and large cities) is difficult to rule out with our present data.
The number of lower-quality restaurants does appear to increase approximately
proportionately to market size.
    What about horizontal proliferation through the proliferation of types of cuisines?
Data available at the Yellow Pages web site10 give the number of restaurants in
each city in each of 49 different cuisine categories. We obtained these for the top
25 cities (not metropolitan areas). The number of restaurants in these cities ranges
from 758 in El Paso to 5574 in New York. The number of distinct cuisines avail-
able ranges from 27 in Detroit to 46 in Chicago. A regression of the log number
of restaurants on log population yields a coefficient of 0.72 (s.e.=0.095). Since the
number of restaurants is the product of the number of cuisines available (NC) and
the number of restaurants per cuisine (N/NC), we can decompose the log poop-

                                               28
ulation coefficient of 0.72. A regression of log(NC) on log population gives a
coefficient of 0.098 (s.e.=0.029), while a regression of log (N/NC) on log popula-
tion yields a coefficient of 0.624 (s.e.=0.75). This is consistent with a belief that
only small fraction of restaurant growth in market size is cuisine differentiation as
measured by Yellow Pages data. Of course, we can not rule out more subtle forms
of horizontal differentiation.
    To summarize the restaurant quality evidence, then, we find that the entire
distribution of restaurants fills out in larger markets, giving rise (among other
things) to more high quality restaurants, even per capita. However, the increase
in the number of products is at least as dramatic as any changes in the quality of
the products and we can present no evidence that average quality increases at all.


6    Concluding Discussion
In this paper, we have presented evidence, consistent with Shaked and Sutton
(1987), that the distribution of product quality bears different relationships with
market size depending on the process for producing quality. In one market (restau-
rants) where quality is created largely through variable costs, markets fragment as
they grow large, and the number of varieties – including levels of quality – in-
creases. Consequently, the number of high-quality products increases in market
size as well. In another market (newspapers) where the cost of creating quality is
largely fixed with respect to output, markets do not fragment as they grow large
and average product quality increases in market size.
    Our empirical evidence is descriptive and does not provide parameter esti-
mates of an underlying model. Nonetheless, our evidence may improve on ex-
isting cases studies (e.g. Sutton (1991)) by focusing on a cross-section of U.S.
metropolitan areas (instead of relying on cross-country regressions) and by em-
phasizing direct measures of quality in addition to evidence on market structure.
In newspapers, we show that the number of metropolitan dailies hardly changes
at all, while the quality of the product increases greatly in market size. We think
this provides the best descriptive example to date of the Shaked and Sutton the-
ory of endogenous fixed costs. The contrast to an industry like restaurants (where
maximum quality increases but the market fragments as size increases) is vivid.
    The evidence in this paper has implications for a number of areas of eco-
nomics, including entry, trade and rationales for urban agglomeration. Much of
the empirical entry literature is driven off the assumption that different sized mar-
kets can accommodate different numbers of firms. For example, some authors

                                         29
seek to draw inferences about how prices fall with entry from the relationship be-
tween market size and the number of firms operating. This literature would be
greatly complicated by quality competition, which implies that both fixed costs
and product characteristics change in market size. Future structural work might
profitably explore the endogeneity of quality and sunk costs.11
     As noted, there is a large economic literature on rationales for cities. The
vast majority of this literature focuses on various production-side rationales for
cities. However, the empirical literature in industrial organization has already doc-
umented the consumption-side benefit of increased product variety: recent work
documents the relationship between market size and the number of local options
in retail, radio, television, newspapers, and the Internet.12 This work, predicated
explicitly on the presence of exogenous fixed costs, implies that consumers face
more options and therefore achieve more satisfaction in larger markets.13 The
present paper shows that the welfare benefits of larger markets are driven not only
by the number of products but also by the kinds of products available in larger mar-
kets. The presence of higher quality goods in larger markets presumably heightens
the consumption-side benefits of agglomeration.
     A separate literature examines urban quality of life, explaining land values as
capitalized amenities, where the fundamental amenities include weather, pollution
and local tax and spending mixes (for example, see Gyourko and Tracy (1991)).
To our knowledge this literature ignores effects of endogenous product quality and
availability on consumer welfare. Given the rather substantial differences in the
nature of products in local service industries like media, restaurants and retail this
omission may be important.
     As noted by Krugman, there is a good deal of overlap between the study of
geography and the study of trade. In Krugman style trade models, one major ben-
efit of trade is an increase in product variety. In media markets like newspapers,
trade may do more to change the quality of the product than to change the vari-
ety of products available, as higher quality products (spreading the cost of quality
   11
      Some preliminary structural results are in the Berry and Waldfogel (1999) study of entry in
local radio broadcasting markets, which finds a strong relationship between station fixed costs and
market size. That study, however, does not take the further step of endogenizing product quality.
   12
      Studies include Bresnahan and Reiss (1991), Berry and Waldfogel (1999), , Waldfogel (forth-
coming), Waldfogel (2001), George and Waldfogel (forthcoming), Sinai and Waldfogel (2001)
and Campbell and Hopenhayn (2002).
   13
      Of course, these consumption benefits might be offset by congestion, crime and other urban
disamenities. In the traditional model of production externalities, it is these disamenities that limit
the size of cities.

across a world market) drive local alternatives out of business. As in newspapers,
horizontal differentiation will keep some local alternatives alive.
    In light of arguments in this paper, the market for content on the Internet pro-
vides an interesting possible case study. The Internet, and attendant information
technologies, have simultaneously reduced exogenous fixed product costs and,
by wiring geographically dispersed consumers together, increased market size.
Under conventional understandings of entry, this would be expected to lead to a
proliferation of firms and products. Some observers herald a new retail and media
landscape where a great diversity of sellers and voices will be available and heard.
Yet if fixed costs are determined endogenously by a quality competition process,
then the new information and retail economy may remain as concentrated as the
old.


A      Appendix
In this appendix, we lay out some of the mathematics behind the review of theory in the
text.


A.1     Pricing in the The Vertical Model
Consider the utility function of consumer i for product j of
                                        uij = θi δ − pj ,                              (9)
where θi is willingness-to-pay for quality. If an ordered set of products δ1 < δ2 <
δ3 < . . . < δJ are all purchased by some consumer, then it is easy to show that each
product substitutes only with the next-highest and next-lowest product in quality. The set
of consumers who prefer product j to the lower quality product j − 1 is then defined by
θi ’s that satisfy:
                             θ i δ j − pj   > θi δj−j − pj−1 ⇒                       (10)
                                              pj − pj−1
                                      θi    >            .                           (11)
                                              δj − δj−1
Similarly, j is preferred to the next higher quality product if
                                               pj+1 − pj
                                        θi <             .                           (12)
                                               δj+1 − δj
The last two conditions are jointly satisfied only if
                                   pj+1 − pj   pj − pj−1
                                             >           .                           (13)
                                   δj+1 − δj   δj − δj−1

                                                31
    This in turn places a restriction on the price of good j – if pj is too high then no one
will buy product j. In particular, there is a kind of convexity restriction – with δ on the
horizontal axis and p on the vertical axis, the the slope of the line between (δj−1 , pj−1 )
and (δj , pj ) has to be less than the slope of the line between (δj , pj ) and (δj+1 , pj+1 ).
Formally, we can re-write (13) as:
                                   pj < λpj−1 + (1 − λ)pj+1                               (14)
where λ = (δj − δj−1 )/(δj+1 − δj−1 ) so that δj = λδj−1 + (1 − λ)δj+1 . Thus, we find
that prices as a function of δ must be convex in δ if every product is to be purchased.
    This result on the convexity of prices relates to the shape of marginal cost in quality.
If marginal cost is concave in quality, then a higher price good can price above its own
marginal cost and yet drive a lower price good out of the market. This is not true in the
case of convex marginal cost. The potential ability to price lower-quality products out of
the market in turn has large effects on the incentive to product both high and low quality
goods.

Product Proliferation and Convex Marginal Costs
Here we show that the product-quality line will fill in as market size increases if: marginal
costs are increasing and convex in quality (and constant in quantity), demand is generated
by the vertical model and θ has positive density on (0, ∞) That is, under these assump-
tions, as as market size goes to infinity, there will be a product on every quality segment
of positive length on (δ, ∞), where δ is some lower bound on quality.
    We consider simultaneous move equilibria in prices and qualities. There are an infinite
number of potential firms, each of whom can offer any combination of products with any
price and quality combinations. As is typical in this literature, we don’t try to establish
the existence or uniqueness of equilibria (which is very difficult), but we instead consider
outcomes that necessarily occur in any equilibria.
    In this paper, we are not much concerned with what happens on the lower regions
of the quality, because we don’t have good data on low quality products. Suppose then
as market size increases, at some point there are two goods, δ1 and δ2 (this is easy to
establish given some conditions on the outside good.) We will then show that the quality
levels above δ1 will eventually fill in.14
    First suppose that there is no product on a segment (δ1 , δ2 ) and consider the profits of
a potential entrant into that segment. The worst-case scenario for the potential entrant into
the segment is that the products at δ1 and at δ2 are pricing at marginal cost. In this worst-
case scenario, the potential entrant will make positive sales by entering at δ ∈ (δ1 , δ2 )
(and a price of p) if the condition in (14) holds:
                             p < λmc(δj−1 ) + (1 − λ)mc(δj+1 ),                           (15)
  14
       Of course, new products below δ1 may also be introduced.

                                               32
with λ = (δ − δ1 )/(δ2 − δ1 ).15
     The new entrant can set such a low price, and yet still price above marginal cost, if
marginal cost is convex in quality. Since sales are then a positive fraction of the market
and price is above marginal cost, per-capita variable profits V are positive and no matter
what is the (finite) level of fixed costs F (δ), eventually as M grows large M V (δ) − F (δ)
will be positive and so a product must be offered in that segment in any equilibrium. Note
that since a product is offered in every segment above some minimum level, “product
concentration” declines – the maximum share of any product goes to zero.
     Now consider a high-quality segment, (δ2 , ∞), that does not have a product (for any
finite δ2 ). At any price p, there are some θ’s that will prefer a higher quality good, with
quality δ > delta2 . Specifically, the set of consumers that will buy the good satisfy
θ > (δ − δ2 )/(p − p2 ). By choosing p > mc(δ), once again the per-capita variable profit
for this product is positive and so as M increases the product is eventually offered.16
     So, in this sub-section we have established that when marginal cost is increasing and
convex in quality, then as the market size increases products proliferate, filling in the
product space (so that product-concentration declines) and also the maximum quality in
the market increases.


A.2     Sutton’s “Endogenous Fixed Cost Models”
Shaked and Sutton (1987) consider models where products do not proliferate as market
size increases, but rather where some high-quality products maintain some fixed minimum
fraction of the market even as market size increases. In the vertical model where marginal
cost is not convex is quality, higher quality products can possibly undercut lower-quality
products and drive them from the market, thus taking a significant fraction of the market.
Shaked and Sutton show conditions under which this action can lead to concentration in
the limit. We also emphasize that once again the maximum quality in the market increases
and indeed the mechanism for maintaining share in the face of increased market size is to
continue to increase quality.
     Shaked and Sutton consider a general class of vertical models in which a high quality
product can capture a fixed level of per-capital products via a sufficiently high increase
in quality. Specifically, suppose that if δj is k times higher then any other δ, a firm can
in equilibrium capture some fraction, α, of total income, M Ȳ as variable profit. That is,
if δj is k times higher than any other δ, then the firm producing j has profits of at least
M αȲ . This is certainly true in the vertical model if marginal cost does not increase in
quality and if some (possibly small) fraction of consumers will pay for increased quality.
  15
      As long as the sales of δ1 and δ2 are positive in the absence of the new good good, then we
don’t have to worry about competition with the other goods of even lower and even higher quality
– as long as the condition is met then the sales of the new good are positive.
   16
      Note that this last result does not depend on the convexity of marginal cost.


                                               33
     For example, consider the vertical model where marginal cost, mc, is constant in
quality and where currently purchased products are (δj , pj ; j = 1, . . . , J). Now consider
a new product with quality δj = kδJ , where J indexes the highest quality existing product.
Let the new product have price pJ+1 = pJ + DδJ , where D is any constant. Since pJ
exceeds marginal cost, the markup on the new product is at least DδJ . The new product
is preferred to the old highest quality product for consumers whose tastes θ satisfy:
                                      (pJ+1 − pJ )    D
                                θ>                 =                                      (16)
                                       (kδJ − δj )   k−1
The last inequality does not depend on δj – one can always get a fixed positive share of
sales by increasing quality k times and setting price as described. Further, given constant
marginal cost in quality (or marginal costs that do not increase too fast in quality) the price
increase is sufficient to generate a positive markup per sale (and the markup increases in
the quality of the best rival and so has some lower bound as long as equilibrium quality
has some lower bound). This is just one example of how the Shaked-Sutton conditions
on the variable profit function can be satisfied when marginal costs do not increase at a
convex rate.
     As for fixed costs, Sutton assumes that ∂ln(F  )
                                               ∂ln(δ) < β. That is, increasing δ by k times
drives up fixed costs by less than k β times. This insures that fixed costs are not increasing
at some unbounded rate in quality.
     Define market share as the revenue of product j as a fraction of the total market
income. Shaked and Sutton then show a lower bound to the maximum market share. In
particular, they prove that there is an  so small that if the largest firm’s market share fell
below , then that firm would increase δ enough to get a share above that level. Further,
       1
 ≡ 1+k  β.
     To establish this result, again following Shaked and Sutton, let us suppose to the con-
trary that the maximum market share is below the alleged lower bound. In this supposed
equilibrium, variable profits are no more than M Ȳ and fixed costs are also no larger
(because profits are positive). Now suppose that a firm deviates from the proposed equi-
librium and chooses a quality level k times higher than the maximum quality. In the new
equilibrium, the deviating firm gets variable profits of at least αM Ȳ and has fixed costs
of no more than k β M Ȳ and so the deviating firm has profits of at least

                                     αM Ȳ − k β M Ȳ .                                  (17)

This deviation is certainly profitable if

                             αM Ȳ − k β M Ȳ   > M Ȳ ⇒                                (18)
                                                     α
                                                <        ,                               (19)
                                                   1 + kβ
which completes the proof.
