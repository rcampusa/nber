                                          ABSTRACT

Using data from the Health and Retirement Survey, we document the changes in assets that occur
before a person's death. Applying an event study approach, we find that during the 6 years
preceding their deaths, the assets of single decedents decline, relative to those of similar single
survivors, by an additional$20,000 on average. Over the same time span, the assets of couples
who lose a spouse fall, relative to those of similar surviving couples, by an additional $90,000 on
average. Households experiencing a death also incur higher out-of-pocket medical spending and
other end-of-life expenses. This elevated spending is sufficient to explain (in accounting terms)
the asset declines observed for singles but falls short of explaining the declines observed for
couples. Bequests from the dying spouse to non-spousal heirs such as children are more than
sufficient to explain the remainder.

1       Introduction
Almost 40% of U.S. wealth resides in households whose head is 65 years old or older.1
These older households tend to run down their wealth slower than that implied by a
basic life-cycle model in which the time of death is known. An active research literature
has risen around this "retirement savings puzzle"(De Nardi et al., 2016). One potential
solution to this puzzle is that older households are holding their assets because they fear
incurring high medical expenses at the ends of their lives. Another potential explanation
is that the elderly are accumulating assets to bequeath to their heirs.2 Determining which
of these motives is more powerful has proven challenging, in large part because the two
motives generate similar saving behavior (Dynan et al. 2002; De Nardi et al. 2016).
    One strategy for differentiating these saving motives is to analyze dissaving decisions
near the end of one's life. If older households are saving to cover end-of-life medical spend-
ing, we should observe at least some households incurring significant medical expenses in
their final years of life, and experiencing concomitant falls in their wealth.3 On the other
hand, if medical expenses do not rise at the end of life, and people are not concerned with
leaving wealth to their heirs, we should see households consuming their assets faster as
death becomes imminent.
    In this paper, we take a first step toward such an analysis by documenting the dynamics
of wealth and medical expenses around the time of a person's death, using data from
the oldest cohorts of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To do so, we employ
an event study approach. For each "treatment" household experiencing a death, we
identify another, similar, "control" household who experienced a death 6-10 years later.
Using fixed effects regression, we then estimate the asset trajectories of the treatment
households as their death approaches, along with the asset trajectories of their matched
control households over the same time period. We find that in the 6 years preceding
their deaths, the assets of singles decline on average, relative to those of survivors, by an
additional $20,000 on average. Correspondingly, over the same time span, the assets of
couples who lose a spouse fall by an additional $90,000 on average compared to those of
similar surviving couples. Households experiencing a death also incur higher out-of-pocket

Federal Reserve System 2019, Tables 1 and 4.

     A third possibility is that the elderly place a high value on remaining in their own homes for as long
as possible (Nakajima and Telyukova, 2017, 2019; Cocco and Lopes, 2019; McGee, 2019).
   3
     We focus on expenses that are uninsured. For a discussion of why households concerned about
medical expenses, especially long-term care, would fail to buy insurance against them, see French et al.
(2018), Ameriks et al. (2018) and Braun et al. (2019).

medical spending. Elevated medical spending is sufficient to explain (in accounting terms)
the asset declines observed for singles, but falls short of explaining the declines observed
for couples. Bequests from the dying spouse to non-spousal heirs such as children are
more than sufficient to explain the remainder.
     Our paper is in large part a follow-up to French et al. (2006), enhanced by an additional
12 years (6 waves) of data. French et al. (2006) found that the assets of single households
fell by 30% in the year preceding death. About 37% of that decline was attributable to
increased medical spending or burial costs. In addition to expanding the sample period,
we extend this analysis to couples, examining how assets and medical spending behave
when a spouse dies. The declines found by French et al. (2006) are much larger than the
ones reported here; we argue below that the difference is mostly due to our (considerably)
longer sample.
     Other related papers include Poterba et al. (2011), who also work with HRS data.
They find little dissaving among intact households, but significant declines in assets when
a household member dies. We extend their analysis to better understand the importance
of end-of-life expenses relative to transfers made around the time of death.
     Kopczuk (2007) analyzes estate tax data (covering roughly 6% of U.S. adult deaths)
and finds that individuals with longer terminal illnesses tend to leave smaller estates, and
argues that the difference is too large to be fully explained by end-of-life expenses. He
concludes that the additional asset declines most likely reflect "deathbed estate planning."
Kvaerner (2019) uses Norwegian administrative data to track single individuals who have
been diagnosed with cancer. Because of generous public health insurance, in Norway a
cancer diagnosis signals a reduced lifespan without signalling a meaningful increase in
out-of-pocket medical expenses. Kvaerner (2019) finds that individuals with a cancer
diagnosis make significant inter-vivos transfers to their children as measured by asset
increases of the children, which suggests that altruism is an important saving motive for
the elderly.4 Suari-Andreu et al. (2019) report similar results for the Netherlands, which
also has universal insurance. They find that households experiencing "non-sudden deaths"
have less wealth at the time of death. Relative to these studies, an attractive aspect of
our study is that we use the same dataset to measure assets, end-of-life expenses such as
medical and burial expenses, and transfers to children and others.

    The choice between inter-vivos transfers ­ transfers made while the giver and recipient are still alive
­ and bequests likely depends on multiple factors. One is that inter-vivos transfers may allow the parties
to avoid the estate tax: Kvaerner (2019) finds that inter-vivos transfers are more prevalent among the
wealthy. A second is the strategic bequest motive (Bernheim et al., 1985), where parents withhold
transfers to elicit care from their children. Kopczuk (2007) discusses several considerations.



                                                    3
    Poterba et al. (2017) use the HRS to estimate the "asset cost of poor health." They
document that within each 1994 asset quintile, individuals in the top third of the 1994
health distribution have, in 2010, 50% more wealth than those in the bottom third.
They argue that these differences appear too large to just reflect the direct imposition of
medical expenses. De Nardi et al. (2019) reach a similar conclusion in the context of a
structural model. Poterba et al. (2018) consider the distinct question of whether old-age
health shocks bring down household wealth. They find that the onset of a major health
condition or the death of a spouse after age 65 increases the likelihood of low wealth in
the subsequent period, but by only a modest amount. They do not quantify the effect on
asset levels.
    The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the HRS data that
we use in our analysis. In Section 3 we describe our empirical methodology, in Section 4
we discuss our results, and in Section 5 we conclude.


2     Data
The data that we use were compiled as inputs for the structural model of savings for cou-
ples and singles developed and estimated in De Nardi et al. (2019). Thus, our description
of the data borrows heavily from the text of that project, as well as French et al. (2006)
and Jones et al. (2018).


2.1    Sample composition
We use data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD)
cohorts of the HRS. The AHEAD is a sample of non-institutionalized individuals aged 70
or older in 1993. These individuals were interviewed in late 1993/early 1994, and again
in 1995/96, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. We use data for 10
waves, from 1995/96 to 2014. We exclude data from the 1994 wave because both assets
and medical spending are underreported (Rohwedder et al. (2006)).
    We only consider retired households, defined as those earning less than $3,000 in every
wave. In our analysis, we track each household until all of its members die; attrition for
other reasons is low. To streamline the interpretation of our results, the only demographic
transition we consider is death. We therefore drop households who get married or divorced,
or report other marital transitions not consistent with our framework. We also drop
households who: have large differences in ages; are same-sex couples; are cohabiting


                                            4
couples; have no information on the spouse; or are missing asset data. Finally, we remove
observations with assets at or above the 99th percentile of the asset distribution (with
separate thresholds for singles and couples). Applying these criteria leaves us with 4,169
households in 1995, of whom 1,221 are initially couples and 2,948 are singles. Some of
these households are missing for reasons other than death in later waves, but the fraction
never exceeds 5%.

              Note: Parentheses contain sample percentages.


    Table 1 documents the demographic transitions for households who in 1995 were mar-
ried couples. Most couples in the AHEAD stay intact for only a few waves. By 2002, 59%
of married households had lost one or both spouses. The modal transition for couples is
to become widows (31% in 2002), but a significant number become widowers (11%) or
lose both spouses (16%).
    Table 2 shows transitions for individuals who were single in 1995. This group combines
individuals who were married prior to 1995 with those who were single throughout their
entire lives. As expected, women live longer than men: by 2004, over 74% of single men
have died, as opposed to 59% of single women.


2.2    Variables
The HRS includes a large number of financial variables, including detailed asset and
liability measures. Table 3 shows means and medians for several asset categories, measured
in 2014 dollars, for all households with at least one surviving member. The HRS wealth
data have the usual rightward skew, with mean values well in excess of medians. Most

notably, the median household holds no stocks whatsoever, while stockholdings are in
some waves the second- largest component of mean wealth.
    An important feature of the AHEAD data is that when a household member dies,
survivors of the deceased (usually either a surviving spouse or a child) are interviewed. A
key variable for our analysis is the value of the estate. This data allows us to accurately
measure the wealth of single individuals who die at the time of their death. If one member
of the household dies and the other survives, we measure the survivor's wealth using the
usual asset variables. The HRS also asks survivors, however, if the dying spouse has left
assets to non-spousal heirs. We report these "side bequests" below, along with the estates
left when the final household members die.
    The HRS collects data on all out-of-pocket medical expenses, including private insur-
ance premia and nursing home care. French et al. (2017) show that the HRS out-of-pocket
medical spending data match up well with data from the medical spending data from the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. When
a household member dies, the survivors are asked about insurance payments, medical
expenses immediately preceding death, and death-related costs such as burial expenses.
Fahle et al. (2016) show that the HRS exit interviews are essential to appropriately capture
the rise of medical spending before death.
    To control for socioeconomic status, we construct a measure of lifetime earnings or
"permanent income" (PI). We first find each household's "non-asset" income, a pension
measure that includes Social Security benefits, defined benefit pension income, veterans
benefits and annuities. Because there is a roughly monotonic relationship between lifetime

earnings and these pension variables, post-retirement non-asset income is a good measure
of lifetime permanent income. In earlier analyses of single households, we found that PI
helps predict health, mortality and medical spending (De Nardi et al., 2009, 2010). To
create a PI measure common to both couples and singles, we follow De Nardi et al. (2019)
and remove household size effects using a fixed effects regression. (See also Jones et al.
2018.) In particular, we assume that the log of non-asset income for household i at age t
follows
                                ln yit = i + (t, fit ) + it ,                         (1)

where: i is a household-specific effect; (t, fit ) is a flexible function of age and family
structure fit (i.e., couple, single man, or single woman); and it represents measurement
error. The percentile ranks of the estimated fixed effects, i , form our measure of perma-
nent income, Ii . Because we study retirees, we treat Ii as time-invariant.

2.3     Asset profiles
Before beginning our main analysis, it is useful to assess overall trends. We begin by
returning to Table 3, which aggregates over all surviving households. Table 3 illustrates
the retirement savings puzzle: mean and median wealth fall little, if at all, between 1995
and 2014. This finding is in part an artefact of mortality bias.5 Because the data behind
Table 3 form an unbalanced panel, the tendency of wealthier households to live longer
causes observed wealth to rise over time (Shorrocks 1975; De Nardi et al. 2016). To
control for mortality bias, our preferred approach in this paper is to employ a matching
estimator and exploit the panel dimension of the HRS.
    A more disaggregated picture emerges in Tables 4 and 5, which track the mean assets
of initial couples and singles, respectively, as household members die. Table 4 shows mean
assets of intact couples rise markedly over time, from $389,200 in 1995 to $523,600 in 2014.
Much of this increase is due to changes in sample composition, as the poorer members
of couples die off, and only the richest couples survive to 2014. As Table 1 shows, the
number of intact couples fell dramatically over the same period. The assets of singles
show less of a trend. Newly single households, who were couples in the previous wave,
have more wealth than households who had been single for longer periods of time. This
can be seen by comparing the column for the newly single with that for all singles.
    Table 4 also shows bequests. When one spouse dies, the couple's wealth is divided
between the surviving spouse and other heirs, such as children. Comparing the wealth of
the newly single with non-spousal bequests shows that most of the wealth is left to the
surviving spouse; in several years, assets left to non-spousal heirs are less than one-quarter
the size of spousal bequests. The final column of the table shows the bequests left when
the final household member dies. (This includes cases where both spouses die in the same
interval.) Final estates are almost always smaller than the assets of the living.
    Table 5 shows asset trajectories for households who were already single in 1995. The
profiles for this group have much less of an upward slope than their counterparts in Table 4,
suggesting that single households are more likely to decumulate their wealth; De Nardi et
al. (2019) report similar findings. Mean estates tend to be smaller than the mean asset
holdings of survivors, but this is not always the case.
   5
    Correcting for mortality bias is not sufficient to eliminate the elderly savings puzzle (De Nardi et al.,
2010, 2016).

3     Methodology
To measure how assets evolve around the time of death, we compare the assets of house-
holds experiencing a death to those of households who did not. Our principal econometric
concern is that these groups might differ systematically for reasons besides death. For
example, poorer households tend to die at younger ages. Therefore, at any age house-
holds with deaths will have fewer assets, not because they ran down their wealth as death
approached, but simply because they were more likely to have been poor all along.
    In a nutshell, our approach for dealing with this problem is to construct a control group
that is, except for not experiencing a death, similar to the treatment group suffering the
deaths. To describe our approach formally, let Ai,t denote measured assets for household
i at time t. We allow Ai,t to be mismeasured, but assume that any such mismeasurement
takes the form of zero-mean classical measurement error. Next, let Ti denote the calendar
year of the HRS wave when household i reports a death. By way of example, if the
husband in couple i dies in 1999, Ti will equal 2000, the year of the next HRS wave.
Finally, let di (t) = t - Ti measure the distance between the current period and death, and
let Ai,d denote the assets held by household i when its death is d periods away.
    We proceed in two steps. First, among couples that lose a spouse,6 we estimate the
fixed-effects regression

        Ai,t = Ai,di (t)
              = fi + a1 × 1{di (t) = -4} + a2 × 1{di (t) = -2} + a3 × 1{di (t) = 0}               (2)
                  + a4 × 1{di (t) = 2} + a5 × 1{di (t) = 4} + ei,t ,

using the 0-1 indicator function 1{·} to denote distance-from-death dummy variables. We
estimate a similar regression for singles, but by necessity stop at the date of death. Because
the fixed effect fi is potentially correlated with the date of death, the key coefficients in
equation (2) are a1 through a5 , which show the extent to which assets rise or fall relative to
their value 6 years before death (the omitted indicator category). The transitory residual
ei,t is zero mean and by by assumption uncorrelated with di (t).
     Second, we construct and analyze a control group. For each household i in the treat-
ment groups above, we find in the data a household m(i) that did not experience a death
at Ti but is otherwise similar to i. In particular, for each household i we find the set of
   6
     We restrict the treatment group to couples whose deaths occur no earlier than 2000, giving us at
least 2 waves of pre-death data. We also remove observations more than 3 periods before death (d < -6)
or more than 2 periods afterward (d > 4).


                                                 10
households that: experience a death 6-10 years after Ti ;7 are observed at date Ti ; have the
same initial (1995) household composition; differ from i in age by no more than 10 years;
differ from i in PI percentile by no more that 15 percentage points; differ from i in terms
of 1995 assets by less than $5,000 or 2.5%.8 We then use a random number generator to
pick one household out of this set, giving all members in the set the same probability of
being selected.
    Household m(i) is given the same "death date" (Ti ) as household i and thus the same
values of d. We then estimate

         Am(i),t = fm(i) + b1 × 1{di (t) = -4} + b2 × 1{di (t) = -2} + b3 × 1{di (t) = 0} (3)
                       + b4 × 1{di (t) = 2} + b5 × 1{di (t) = 4} + em(i),t ,

The differences between the treatment group coefficients in equation (2) and the control
group coefficients in equation (3) are our measure of the asset decline associated with
death.


4         Results
4.1         Total wealth
Figure 1 shows the asset trajectory of couples who lost a spouse (labelled "Death in House-
hold"), along with the asset trajectory for couples in the control group ("No Death"). Six
years prior to the spouse's death ­ the point labelled "-6" on the horizontal axis ­ both
groups have average asset holdings of around $320,000. Initially the control group holds
almost $20,000 less, but by the time of death, the gap between the groups has widened to
around $70,000. This suggests that assets fall by about $90,000 in the 6 years preceding
the death of the spouse because of his or her death. Much of the decline occurs in the final
two years before death. The gap between the treatment and control groups continues to
widen in the years following the death. This may reflect additional death-related effects,
the loss of one spouses's income ­ when a spouse dies, annuitized income falls by around
one third (De Nardi et al., 2019) ­ or still other differences between intact couples and
singles.
    In Figure 2, we sort couples by initial wealth ­ above and below the median ­ and
repeat the comparisons. Comparing the left- and right-hand panels of this figures reveals

        Fadlon and Nielsen (2015) impose a similar restriction in their analysis of health shocks.

        If we are unable to find a potential match, we relax the asset criteria to either $10,000 or 5%.

survivors. Comparing the two profiles indicates that assets fall by $20,000 around the
time of death. Figure 4 provides separate comparisons for the high- and low-wealth

death-related decline at all.

4.2                           Home Equity
Table 3 shows that a significant fraction of household wealth takes the form of home
equity. Housing is typically less liquid than other assets: there are transaction costs
associated with selling a house (Yang, 2009), and research suggests that older individuals
place a high weight on remaining in their homes (Nakajima and Telyukova 2019, 2017;
McGee 2019). Nonetheless individuals nearing the ends of their lives may need to enter
long-term care facilities, freeing their homes for sale.9
   In Figures 5 and 6, we divide total assets between home equity and the remainder,
which we label "financial wealth", and compare the treatment and control groups along
these two dimensions. Figure 5 shows that among couples, home equity falls by less than
$15,000, while financial wealth falls by about $70,000. In contrast to couples, who mostly
deplete financial wealth, Figure 6 shows that singles treat home equity and financial
wealth in similar ways. Because we are unable to decompose the estate data, for singles
the comparison ends one wave before death. (The treatment group is given a placeholder
value at d = 0.) Both asset groups show a decline of about $10,000.10

     A related question is whether nursing home residents who receive Medicaid benefits must sell their
homes. If only one of a couple is institutionalized, the other spouse can, within limits, keep the marital
home. The treatment of housing for institutionalized singles is more involved (De Nardi et al., 2012).

     The measured declines in home equity and financial wealth do not sum to the measured decline in
total wealth because of missing data.

4.3                             Medical Expenses
Figures 1-6 show that assets decline significantly around the time of death, especially for
wealthier households. How much of this decline is attributable to medical expenses? Panel
(a) of Figure 7 shows that by the time of death out-of-pocket medical expenditures for
single households have risen by $9,300 per year. Our medical spending measure includes
death expenses such as funeral expenses. Interpreting this number is not immediate.
Each wave, the HRS asks respondents how much they spent in the previous two years.
Dividing this number by two produces an annual value. The $9,300 increase in annual
medical spending thus represents an additional $18,600 of expenses during the two years
prior to death.11 Of this amount, funeral and other death expenses account for more
than $7,200. Including the additional spending incurred in the preceding 2 years (the axis
interval -4 to -2) generates another $7,500, along with another $3,900 in the two years
preceding that. In short, medical expenses are more than sufficient to explain the $20,000
decline in assets observed in single households.
    This is not the case for couples. As a spouse approaches death, average household
medical spending for couples increases by about $8,000 per year. This is slightly smaller
than the increase in expenses experienced by singles. The gap may reflect the ability of
one spouse to care for the other, or differences in the age and sex of the deceased; because
women live longer than men, the husband is usually the first spouse to die, while most
older singles are women. Overall, in the 6 years preceding death, couples incur just over
    11
    Although most individuals die less than two years after their last interview, for simplicity we divide
their terminal spending by 2.

$22,000 of additional spending, less than one quarter of the asset decline of $90,000 shown
in Figure 1. Where might the remainder come from?
    One possibility is that transfers to non-spousal heirs increase around the time of the
first spouses' death, either inter-vivos or through bequests. The non-spousal bequests
shown in Table 4 are in fact more than sufficient to explain the difference: the households
included in our event study on average bequeathed over $105,000 to their non-spousal
heirs.
    Another possibility is an increase in non-medical consumption. For example, some
health-related expenditures, such as stair lifts, might not be recorded as medical spending.
Alternatively, couples may expect a fall in consumption after a spousal death that is larger
than the fall in future annuity income. This would encourage couples to consume more
when a spouse's death is imminent. In the absence of detailed consumption data, such
possibilities are difficult to assess.


4.4                              Comparison with French et al. (2006)
The exercises most similar to ours appear in Figures 1 and 2 of French et al. (2006).
Figure 1 of that paper showed that the assets of dying singles fell, relative to their surviving
peers, by about $64,000 in 1998 prices; applying the CPI-U, this translates to $93,000 in
2014 prices. Figure 2 of the paper showed that as individuals approach death, their out-
of-pocket medical spending rose by $5,500 in 1998 prices ($8,000 in 2014 prices). While
the increase in out-of-pocket spending estimated in French et al. (2006) is similar to ours

           Note: Assets measured in thousands of $2014.


(see Figure 7), their estimated fall in assets is nearly four times as large.
    There are several potential explanations for this discrepancy. First of all, the HRS
has updated the way in which it collects and processes its asset measures and especially
bequests. These changes take many forms. For example, the families of many who have
died were later interviewed in "post-exit" interviews. Post-exit interview data are used
in the current paper, but were not used in French et al. (2006). In addition, we made
several improvements to our procedures to impute assets for those who died.
    To measure the effects of the data revisions, in Table 6 we update part of French et
al.'s (2006) Tables 4 and 5 with our data and compare it to the original results. Table 6
compares the assets of households who experienced a death by 2002 to the assets of
households who remained intact. The top panel contains the original results in French
et al. (2006), updated to 2014 prices. The first two columns of this panel reveal that
the assets of surviving singles change little over the 7-year interval, while the assets of
households with deaths fall by about $67,000. The second panel contains shows results
derived from the updated data prior to our truncation procedures. The updated results
for singles are fairly similar to those for French et al. (2006); the fall in assets is about
$13,000 smaller in the updated data, but still in excess of $50,000 in magnitude. The
results for couples, who are not the main focus in this section, change a bit more.
    The third panel of Table 6 shows the results that emerge after we drop observations


                                               17
with assets above the 99th percentile. Background estimates show that even though
our truncation procedure reduces mean assets in general, it has only a modest on our
estimated asset dynamics, reducing the fall in assets associated with the death of a single
by $5,000. However, within the subset of the data corresponding to French et al.'s (2006)
Tables 4 and 5, truncating the top 1% of the asset distribution significantly reduces the
measured decline in assets. Surviving singles now see their assets fall by about $16,000,
while singles who die see their assets fall by about $40,000.
    A second difference is that we now have more years of data. To assess the importance
of this change,the left-hand-side of Table 7 shows the assets of singles in the two waves
preceding deaths, along with their estates.12 Each row of the table indexes a particular
wave, allowing us to compare the asset trajectories of people who die in early waves to
those of people who die later. The first two rows of Table 7, for those who die in 2000 and
2002, use data from waves available to French et al. (2006). The average asset drop for
this group is almost $40,000. This is a larger than the overall sample average of $26,000,
suggesting that using later waves might help explain why our results differ from French
et al.'s (2006). Once again data improvements almost surely play a role. The newer
waves of "exit data" ask whether the reported value of the estate includes the value of the
decedent's home. If the respondent states that the value of the estate does not include the
value of the home, we add the home's value to the total. (This happens about 7% of the
time.) This question was not asked in the earlier waves available to French et al. (2006),
leading to a downward bias in the estate measure and an upward bias in the estimated
fall in assets.
    The right-hand-side of Table 7 shows results for couples who become singles. In
contrast to the death of a single, the asset declines associated with the death of a spouse
are larger in later waves.


5      Conclusions and Future Work
We find that a household's wealth declines significantly when one of its members dies.
Our estimates suggest that in the 6 years preceding their deaths, the assets of dying
singles decline by $20,000 more than those of otherwise similar survivors. The assets of
couples who lose a spouse fall by $90,000, a much larger amount. These falls in wealth are

wealth distribution experience virtually no death-related declines whatsoever.
    Having established that assets fall at the time of death, the next order of business
is understanding why. From an accounting perspective, elevated medical spending can
account for all of the average asset decline observed for singles and around one-quarter
of the decline observed for couples. This leaves much of the asset decline for couples
unexplained, but bequests from the dying spouse to non-spousal heirs such as children
are enough to cover it. These "side" bequests are in fact larger than the unexplained de-
cline. Thus, more empirical work on these bequests, along with similarly-timed inter-vivos
transfers, is in order. It is also important to examine the potential economic motivations
behind side bequests. In De Nardi et al. (2019), we consider this issue, and the saving of
older households in general, through the lens of a structural savings model.
