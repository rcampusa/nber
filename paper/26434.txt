                                          ABSTRACT

We find that Republican candidates lost support in the 2018 congressional election in counties
more exposed to trade retaliation, but saw no commensurate electoral gains from US tariff
protection. The electoral losses were driven by retaliatory tariffs on agricultural products, and
were only partially mitigated by the US agricultural subsidies announced in summer 2018.
Republicans also fared worse in counties that had seen recent gains in health insurance coverage,
affirming the importance of health care as an election issue. A counterfactual calculation suggests
that the trade war (respectively, health care) can account for five (eight) of Republicans' lost
House seats.

1         Introduction
In early 2018, President Donald Trump launched a series of unprecedented actions to raise tariffs
against major US trading partners. By September 2018, newly-introduced duties covered over 12% of
US imports (Bown 2019). These tariffs were met with swift retaliation against US exports, especially
on agricultural products, by China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, and others.1 While new
US tariffs offered some protection for certain import-competing industries, retaliatory tariffs hurt
other US producers. The export-dependent agricultural sector was especially hard-hit, prompting
the Trump administration to announce a $12-billion subsidy program in summer 2018.
        These trade-related events were exceptional in scope and scale, and by the eve of the November
2018 midterm elections, the potential repercussions of the trade war were widely publicized in both
national and local media. But did voters care? This paper maps the geographic distribution of
exposure to the 2018 trade war, including the subsequent agricultural subsidies, and evaluates whether
this exposure varied systematically with voting patterns in the 2018 elections for the US House of
Representatives.
        We measure the extent to which US counties were protected by new US tariffs, the extent to which
they were hit by retaliatory tariffs, and the degree to which they stood to benefit from agricultural
subsidies extended under the 2018 Market Facilitation Program (MFP). Given the central role of
health care policy in 2018 election rhetoric, we control for the extent of local health insurance coverage
potentially vulnerable to repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We combine these key explanatory
variables with a rich set of demographic and economic covariates to examine the relationship between
voting patterns and county-level policy exposure.
        The evidence reveals a modest but robust negative relationship between local employment expo-
sure to the 2018 trade war and support for Republican House candidates. Republican candidates lost
ground in counties that were adversely affected by retaliatory tariffs, but saw no discernable gains in
counties where workers were disproportionately protected by new US tariffs. The negative relation-
ship between retaliatory tariffs and Republican support was concentrated in politically competitive
counties where Trump narrowly lost the popular vote in 2016, and in counties hardest hit by retal-
iatory tariffs on agricultural products, particularly those imposed by China. The 2018 agricultural
subsidies only partially mitigated this negative relationship, although this offset was substantial in
counties receiving the largest MFP payments. We also find that Republican support fell systemati-
cally in counties where recent increases in health insurance coverage had been greatest, underscoring
how health care policy worked against Republican House candidates as an election issue.
        Quantitatively, our regression estimates suggest that the trade war can account for roughly one-
tenth of the observed nation-wide decline in Republican House candidates' vote share between 2016
and 2018. In comparison, the role of health care policy accounts for about one-fifth of the decline in
    1

Republican support at the national level. Focusing on politically competitive counties, the estimated
effect of retaliatory tariffs is substantially stronger and quantitatively commensurate to that of health
care, with each force large enough to account for one-quarter of the decline in Republican support
in these counties. The trade war and health care thus appear to have hurt Republican candidates
where swing voters matter most.
   We also translate our regression results into counterfactual Congressional election outcomes.
Mindful of the complex US electoral geography, we consider several alternatives to apportion es-
timated county-level vote changes to congressional districts (CDs). The resulting predictions suggest
that voters' response to the trade war could account for Republicans' (net) loss of five House seats
in 2018, while concerns over health care coverage may have cost eight House seats. These findings
suggest that both the trade war and health care policy contributed meaningfully to the 2018 `Blue
Wave', in which Republicans lost a total of 40 House seats.
   Our study builds on earlier work examining how economic openness, particularly US-China trade,
impacts US domestic politics. Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Majlesi (2017) and Che, Lu, Pierce, Schott,
and Tao (2016) examine how the mid-2000s Chinese import surge (the `China Shock') affected po-
litical polarization and voting. Following these papers, we adopt a shift-share approach ­ combining
product-level tariffs with information on counties' initial industry employment mix ­ to measure
local tariff exposure. We stop short of claiming causal identification, however. Although a county's
employment composition is plausibly pre-determined, the 2018 tariffs were not orthogonal to future
US political considerations: Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2019) and Fetzer and
Schwarz (2019) find that the geographic incidence of the 2018 tariffs is correlated with Republicans'
prior election performance. Our exercise therefore should be understood as an ex-post evaluation of
the extent to which the tariffs may have influenced the 2018 House elections.
   Our work is also related to the mounting evidence that US consumers have borne the brunt
of higher prices from the new US tariffs (Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019), Cavallo, Neiman,
Gopinath, and Tang (2019), Flaaen, Hortacsu, and Tintelnot (2019), Waugh (2019)). Our comple-
mentary research highlights potential consequences of producer-side exposure to the trade war via
the local employment composition of US counties. To the extent that voters also responded politi-
cally to the consumer-side impact of tariffs, or even the broader rhetorical influence of the trade war
(Mansfield and Mutz 2009), these additional responses will be captured (to an extent) by state fixed
effects in our empirical specifications. Our findings therefore may constitute a lower bound for the
overall political impact of the trade war.
   Two related papers touch on the relationship between the trade war and the 2018 elections.
Fetzer and Schwarz (2019) briefly assess whether the trade shock influenced voting outcomes, and
Chyzh and Urbatsch (2019) find a systematic pattern of Republican electoral losses in counties that
produce more soybeans. Our results are consistent with these papers, but we are the first (as far as
we know) to find evidence of disproportionate political responses in politically competitive counties,

                                                   3
and to demonstrate the influence of agricultural subsidies and health insurance for voting patterns.
Our approach also allows us to characterize the consequences of the trade war in terms of both the
Republican vote share and the number of seats lost.


2         Data

2.1        Elections
We adopt counties as the unit of analysis, this being the most disaggregated geographic unit with
readily-available voting and socioeconomic data. The voting data are from David Leip's US Election
Atlas. For each of the 2012-2018 US House elections and the 2016 Presidential election, we construct
the county-level vote share received by Republican candidates.2 Our sample comprises all US counties
outside Alaska, which does not report county-level election returns. While the majority of counties
­ 2,633 out of 3,011 in our sample ­ are located within a single congressional district (CD), some
counties are split across multiple CDs; we return to the implications of these `splits' later.
        Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics on these voting outcomes. Across counties, Repub-
lican House candidates lost 6.4 percentage points of vote share on average between 2016 and 2018.
These losses unwound the Republicans' gains from the 2014-2016 and 2012-2014 election cycles, of 3.5
and 2.3 percentage points respectively. These changes exhibit considerable variation across counties:
Republican candidates lost over 22 percentage points in the bottom decile of counties but gained
nearly 3 percentage points in the top decile.
        We further group the counties into six quantiles according to voting outcomes in the 2016 Presiden-
tial election, to capture how competitive the electoral landscape was leading into the 2018 midterms.
Specifically, we bin the counties according to whether Trump garnered less than 30%, 30-40%, 40-
50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, or over 70% of the vote. Panel C of Table 1 provides summary statistics
for each "competitiveness bin". The total US population is divided roughly evenly across the six
quantiles, except for the 40-50% bin, which is larger. Notice that the average population falls sys-
tematically across quantiles, reflecting the well-known pattern of stronger Republican support in less
densely-populated areas.


2.2        The 2018 Trade Shock
Our county-level measures of the 2018 trade shock capture voters' potential tariff exposure through
the industry composition of local employment. We construct: (i) the US Tariff Shock, defined as a
county's average per-worker exposure to the increase in US tariffs on imports; and (ii) the Retaliatory
    2
    We compute the `two-party vote share', defined as the number of Republican votes divided by the total votes for
Republican and Democratic candidates. We limit our attention to the 2018 House races, since Senate elections take
place on a six-year cycle that would lead to a non-representative panel across states.

 Notes: Summary statistics across N = 3, 108 counties, excluding Alaska. Voting outcomes in Panel A are from the Election Atlas; the Republican
vote share is the number of votes for the Republican candidate out of total votes cast for the Democrat and Republican candidates. For Panel
B, the US Tariff Shock, Retaliatory Tariff Shock, and agricultural subsidy measures are each in units of $1,000 per worker. The share of the
civilian non-institutionalized population with health insurance is from the American Community Survey (five-year average series). The total county
population data in 2016 are from the US Census resident population estimates. Panel C provides descriptive statistics on counties by electoral
competitiveness bins, based on the Republican vote share in the 2016 Presidential election. For each bin, we report the number of counties, average
population per county, total population across all counties, mean US Tariff Shock, mean Retaliatory Tariff Shock, and mean estimated Ag. subsidy
per worker. Note that the total population is reported as a count variable. The standard deviations of the two tariff shock variables and the Ag.
subsidy variable are reported in parentheses.

Tariff Shock, defined as the corresponding per-worker exposure to the retaliatory tariffs against US
exports.
      We briefly describe the construction of these two Tariff Shock variables here; further details are
in the Appendix. We use HS 8-digit product-level data collected by Bown (2019) to identify tariff
increases that had come into force by October 2018. The US Tariff Shock incorporates the tariff
actions against washers and solar panels (Section 201), steel and aluminum (Section 232), and a
broad swathe of imports from China (Section 301).3 The Retaliatory Tariff Shock comprises the
tariff responses by the US' four largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, China, and the EU. To
construct each Tariff Shock, we multiply the tariff rate increase by initial bilateral trade values,
which we then concord to NAICS 3-digit industries. This yields measures of the tariff change in
dollar terms in industry i, for US imports from country o, T Sio,U S , and for US exports to country
d, T SiU S,d . We then map these industry-i tariff shocks to individual counties, indexed by c, by
apportioning the national-level shock according to each county's share of national employment in
              Li,c
industry i,   Li
                   ,   taken from the 2016 US County Business Patterns. The final step aggregates the
tariff shocks experienced by each county across industries and trading partners, and divides by total
county population between ages 15-64, L¯ c . This yields our US and Retaliatory Tariff Shock measures,
in dollars per worker:

      The above measures focus on counties' tariff exposure through local employment that is directly
affected. To the extent that local labor market outcomes were among voters' relevant concerns in
the 2018 election, we would expect a decline in Republican vote share in counties more exposed to
the Retaliatory Tariff Shock, all else equal.4 Conversely, to the extent that new US tariffs protected
American workers from foreign competition, as was the Trump administration's stated intention, we
might expect Republican voter support to be positively correlated with the US Tariff Shock. We
readily acknowledge that these simple predictions may be offset by other channels: higher US tariffs
impose costs on consumers, as well as on downstream, using-industries; or conversely, voters may
be willing to bear with retaliatory tariffs if they believe the trade war will eventually give the US
leverage to improve market access or intellectual property protection. Such forces, if pertinent to
voters and correlated with county employment, would generally bias the estimated political effects
  3
     These include the initial July-August 2018 round of tariffs on $50 billion of US imports from China, and the
September 2018 round on an additional $200 billion of US imports.
   4
     Scheve and Slaughter (2001), Mayda and Rodrik (2005), and Fordham and Kleinberg (2012) find that voters'
economic self-interest shapes their preferences over trade policy.

of T Sc  and T Sc towards zero.
    Table 1 reports summary statistics for the US and Retaliatory Tariff Shocks across counties. On
average, the county-level producer-side exposure to the US tariffs was $219 per worker, higher than
                                                                       US        R
the retaliatory tariff exposure at $166 per worker. An advantage of T Sc  and T Sc as constructed
is that each can be decomposed additively into the tariff shocks by product and by partner country.
Table 1 confirms that the bulk of US import protection covered non-agricultural (manufacturing)
goods. The retaliatory tariffs were more evenly balanced between agricultural and non-agricultural
products; in particular, retaliation on agricultural products came primarily from China.
    Note further that the Retaliatory Tariff Shock is increasing modestly across the political com-
petitiveness bins, as ordered by the 2016 Republican Presidential vote share (Table 1, Panel C). On
the other hand, the US Tariff Shock exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with 2016 voting patterns
that peaks in the 60-70% bin. These broad patterns are also documented in Fajgelbaum, Goldberg,
Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2019) and Fetzer and Schwarz (2019) using different definitions of the
tariff shock measures.5 The focus of our paper is not to explain these county-level tariff shocks,
however, but to evaluate their consequences for voting outcomes in the 2018 House elections.
    Figure 1 maps the US Tariff Shock (Panel A) and the Retaliatory Tariff Shock (Panel B) across
counties. These shocks do not overlap neatly, though they are positively correlated (correlation coef-
ficient: 0.22). Both shocks exhibit considerable variation across the US geography, with a handful of
counties receiving either a disproportionate amount of US tariff protection or costly tariff retaliation.


2.3     Agricultural Subsidies
In summer 2018, the US government announced a Market Facilitation Program (MFP) designed to
mitigate the negative consequences of retaliatory tariffs for US farmers. Administered by the US
Department of Agriculture, the program consisted of roughly $12 billion in subsidies to be paid to
farmers growing soybeans, sorghum, corn, wheat, and several other products adversely affected by
new foreign tariffs. To construct estimates of the total MFP subsidies received in 2018 at the county
level, we combine the announced subsidy rates for key commodities with information on production
or inventory from preceding years. (See the Appendix for the full list of commodities included and
data sources.) We construct the variable AgSubsc as the estimated total subsidy received by each
county c, divided by its working-age population.
    These MFP subsidies were narrowly distributed. Across counties, the mean per-worker subsidy
was $429, while the median value was $27 (Table 1, Panel B); the largest beneficiaries were moreover
rural, Republican counties (Panel C). Figure 1 illustrates the limited geographic scope of the program,

     Similar to Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2019), we recover an `inverted U-shape' when re-

are not always statistically significant. Likewise, we obtain an upward sloping relationship when regressing T Sc on
the set of competitiveness bin dummies. (See Table A.6 in the Appendix.)

2.4     Health Care
The potential overhaul of US federal health care policy was a central issue in many Congressional
campaigns in 2018 (e.g., Lowrey (2018)). In early 2017, the Republican House leadership began
to introduce controversial legislation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or
`Obamacare'. Although the efforts were ultimately thwarted in the Senate by the late John Mc-
Cain's deciding vote in July 2018, health care remained a galvanizing campaign issue in November
2018. Preserving access to health insurance was particularly important for Democratic-leaning voters
according to survey data (Blendon, Benson, and McMurtry 2018), while health care policy domi-
nated Democratic campaign advertising in October 2018 (Wesleyan Institute for Advertising Research
    6
      The cross-county correlation between the MFP subsidy per worker and the Retaliatory Tariff Shock is a modest
0.19. This is likely because more products were targeted by tariff retaliation than the Trump administration made
eligible for subsidies. Even within agriculture, the tariff retaliation had a broader reach, since the MFP omitted most
fruits, nuts and fishery products.

2018).
       We thus include two county-level variables from the American Community Survey (ACS) in our
analysis: the share of the population with health insurance just prior to the 2018 elections, and the
change in the share with health insurance in the years since the ACA was enacted in 2010.7 The first
variable accommodates the possibility that counties with high rates of health care coverage may have
seen preservation of the ACA as politically less important. The second variable proxies for changes
in health insurance coverage since the ACA came into effect; following Hollingsworth, Sonil, Carroll,
Cawley, and Simon (2019), we expect greater gains on this front to be negatively correlated with
support for Republican House candidates in 2018.
       County-level health insurance rates rose on average by roughly 4 percentage points in the five
years since the ACA was enacted (Table 1, Panel B).8 The gain was below 1 percentage point for
the 10th percentile county, but nearly 8 percentage points at the 90th percentile. Panel D of Figure
1 confirms that the increases in health insurance coverage were spread across the United States; the
geographic distributions of the tariff shocks and (especially) the 2018 agricultural subsidies were more
narrow in comparison (Panels A-C).


2.5       Other Control Variables
We include a broad set of county-level demographic and socioeconomic covariates, guided by the
considerable empirical literature on determinants of electoral outcomes.9 To control for demographics,
we include population shares by age group, gender, and race, from the US Census. To control
for differences in economic composition across counties, we include employment shares by sector
(agriculture, mining, manufacturing), from the County Business Patterns dataset. We also include
the unemployment rate, (log) mean household income, and share of the population with a college
degree, from the American Community Survey. For all of these variables, we include both pre-election
levels and pre-trends as controls. Construction of these variables is detailed in the Appendix, with
summary statistics reported in Table A.1.
   7
     We use respectively the ACS 5-year average between 2013-2017 (to reduce potential noise in yearly reporting), as
well as the difference between the 2013-2017 average and the 2008-2012 average.
   8
     This figure is comparable to the CBO (2017) estimate for the number of Americans ­ 17 million ­ that would no
longer have held health insurance in 2018 had the repeal legislation passed.
   9
     Theiss-Morse, Wagner, Flanigan, and Zingale (2018) and Kondik (2019) provide detailed treatments. Shafer and
Wagner (2018) argue that the fundamental drivers of US voting patterns were largely unchanged in the 2018 election.

exposure to the US and Retaliatory Tariff Shocks, respectively. AgSubsc is the estimated county-
level agricultural subsidy per worker received under the 2018 Market Facilitation Program; we also
                                               R
include the interaction between AgSubsc and T Sc to examine whether the subsidies directly offset
any of the Retaliatory Tariff Shock. HInsurc is a two-dimensional vector that comprises the average
health insurance coverage share in 2013-2017, and the change in this local coverage share since the

county-level initial characteristics covering demographics, employment shares by sector, and eco-
nomic conditions ­ and their pre-trends ­ listed in Section 2.5. Xc also includes: (i) a set of four
dummy variables that equal 1 if the county was uncontested by one of the major parties in either
2016 or 2018, but contested in the other year (to capture what would otherwise show up as a large
swing in vote share); and (ii) a dummy variable for counties that are split across multiple CDs.11
    Our model includes state fixed effects (Ds ), which absorb any voting pattern differences arising
from state ballot initiatives, Senate or Gubernatorial races. Equation (3) thus estimates the relation-
ship between the 2018 trade shock and voting outcomes using within-state, cross-county variation.
Throughout, we weight counties by population to avoid systematically over-representing rural voters.
We also cluster standard errors two-ways by state and by commuting zone to allow for correlated
shocks in the     c   residuals, which could reflect unobserved political or economic forces along these
geographic dimensions. Our analysis excludes counties where the same party won uncontested in
both 2016 and 2018. We also report results excluding counties in Pennsylvania, which saw significant
redistricting leading up to 2018; the estimates (available on request) are similar when these counties
are included.

heterogeneous effects on voting outcomes, depending on the competitiveness of the electoral landscape

Here, 1(c  B b ) is a dummy variable that equals 1 when county c belongs to "competitiveness bin"
B b , where b = 1, 2, . . . , 6 refer respectively to the set of counties where the 2016 Trump vote share
was 0-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, and 70-100%.12 We view the 40-50% and 50-60% bins
as the most politically competitive, since these are counties where Trump either narrowly lost or won
the 2016 popular vote.


4      Results

4.1      Baseline Findings
Table 2 presents the main results. Panel A reports the ordinary-least-squares estimates of (3),
while Panel B contains results from (4). To limit table length, we report only the key coefficients of
interest here; Table A.2 in the Appendix reports the full set of coefficients for the control variables and
pre-trends. In Column 1, we exclude from the estimating equation all terms related to agricultural
subsidies (both AgSubsc and its interactions) and to health insurance (the vector HInsurc ). Column
2 introduces HInsurc to the right-hand side, while Column 3 is the full specification as in (3) and
(4).
    Focus first on Panel A. Republican candidates lost vote share in the 2018 House election (relative
to 2016) in counties where workers faced greater exposure to the Retaliatory Tariff Shock. The
coefficient is stable across all three columns, ranging from -0.034 in Column 1 to -0.041 in Column
3. This last estimate implies that a one standard deviation increase in exposure to retaliatory tariffs
(0.294, from Table 1) is associated with a 0.041 × 0.294  1.2 percentage point loss in vote share;
in comparison, the mean cross-county drop in voter support for Republican House candidates was
-6.4 percentage points. At the same time, we find no statistically significant relationship between
exposure to the US Tariff Shock and RV oteSh18

    The health care variables are also systematically related to the observed shifts in voting patterns.

     Equation (4) does not include a main effect term for T Sc      , as this is already subsumed by the full set of interaction
terms, 1(c  B b ) × T ScR
                          , for b = 1, 2, . . . , 6. For an analogous reason, we do not spell out the main effect terms for

 Notes: All estimates are from least squares regressions, with observations weighted by total county population in 2016. The sample excludes counties
in Pennsylvania (due to congressional redistricting), and counties where the same party won uncontested in both 2016 and 2018. All columns control
for: county age, gender, and race shares in 2016 (from the US Census), as well as pre-trends between 2013-2016; county employment shares in
agriculture, mining, and manufacturing respectively in 2016 (from the County Business Patterns), as well as pre-trends between 2013-2016; the
county unemployment rate, log mean household income, and share with some college education in 2013-2017 (from the American Community
Survey), as well as pre-trends between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017. All columns also include: (i) four indicator variables for counties contested by only
one party in 2016 or 2018, but not both years; and (ii) an indicator variable for counties that are split across multiple congressional districts. We
control in Panel B for the main effects of 1(Pres. vote  (0.3, 0.4]),. . ., 1(Pres. vote  (0.7, 1]), and in Column 3 for the double interaction terms in
Ag. subsidy × 1(Pres. vote  [0, 0.3]),. . ., Ag. subsidy × 1(Pres. vote  (0.7, 1]), although the coefficients are not reported to save space. Standard
errors are two-way clustered by state and commuting zone.

                                                                                  12
The coefficient on the initial (2013-2017 average) share of health insurance coverage is positive,
suggesting that counties with greater coverage were more likely to support Republican candidates.
Holding the level of coverage in 2013-2017 constant however, Republicans lost vote share in counties
that saw larger increases in health insurance coverage following the passage of the ACA (relative to
2008-2012). This effect is economically meaningful: a one standard deviation greater expansion in
health insurance coverage (0.031, from Table 1) is associated with a 0.245 × 0.031  0.8 percentage-
point loss in vote share.
       Agricultural subsidies played a more subtle role. In Column 3, although AgSubc exhibits no
systematic relationship with voting patterns on its own, the positive coefficient (0.015) on the inter-
action term indicates the subsidy dampened Republicans' electoral losses from the retaliatory tariffs.
In particular, the point estimates suggest that the MFP would have more than offset the Retaliatory
Tariff Shock in the 124 counties that received subsidy amounts above (0.041/0.015) × $1000  $2, 733
per worker. That said, these counties accounted for only 0.2% of the total US population in 2016.
       The negative coefficients on the Republican vote share changes from the 2014-2016 and 2012-2014
election cycles suggest mean reversion: Republicans lost ground in counties where they had gained
the most in the prior two House elections. Finally, as reported in Table A.2, several other county-level
controls exhibit well-known relationships with voting outcomes: Republican candidates continued to
fare better in counties with more old or white voters, and with lower rates of college education.
       Panel B investigates whether the effects of the tariffs varied with the political competitiveness
of the county. We find no statistically significant relationship between US tariff protection and vote
share in any competitiveness bin. In contrast, the estimated effects of the Retaliatory Tariff Shock
and agricultural subsidies are concentrated in counties where the Republican party narrowly lost
the majority vote in the 2016 Presidential election.13 The magnitude of the coefficients for this
40-50% bin are also larger than the average effects estimated earlier in Panel A: a one standard
                         R
deviation increase in T Sc (0.18 among these counties, from Panel C of Table 1) is associated with a
0.178 × 0.18  3.2 percentage point loss in the Republican House vote share.14
                                                                                     R
       Table 3 explores the sectoral dimension of the tariffs. Here, we decompose T Sc into the respective
components due to tariffs on agricultural versus non-agricultural products. Columns 1 and 2 indicate
that tariffs on agricultural products are driving the negative relationship between the Retaliatory
Tariff Shock and Republican support, with no significant relationship detected for the non-agricultural
component. Interestingly, we now find in Panel B a negative and statistically significant relationship
between Republican support and retaliatory tariffs in both the 40-50% and 50-60% competitiveness
bins. These patterns are broadly replicated in Column 3, where we further limit the agricultural and
non-agricultural retaliatory shocks to that imposed by China; the results suggest that China's tariffs

     Figure A.1 in the Appendix illustrates that these pivotal counties are spread out throughout the US, albeit with
fewer such counties present in the central plain states.

     In an analogous exercise, Table A.5 finds that the negative relationship between recent health insurance coverage
gains and Republican support were concentrated in the 50-60% bin.

on US farm exports may have played a particularly strong role in eroding the Republican vote share
in the 2018 election.
       We conduct additional robustness checks, described in detail in the Appendix. First, we consider
alternative treatments of the electoral competitiveness of counties that are split across multiple CDs,
and which are therefore exposed to forces from more than one House race. Our key results are
robust even among just the subset of counties that fall in only one CD. Our results also hold when
using a weighted-average of the CD-wide Republican vote shares in the 2016 Presidential election to
define competitiveness bins (Table A.3). Second, we examine whether tariff shocks at the broader
commuting zone (CZ) level might spill over to influence voting patterns. Again, our key results are
robust. Moreover, controlling for county-level exposure, we find that the tariff exposure of the rest
of the CZ has no discernible relationship with voting (Table A.4).

terms of changes in average vote shares overlooks how the specific geographic incidence of the trade
shock may have affected actual election winners and losers. In this section, we translate our regression
results into counterfactual aggregate election outcomes: how many more House seats Republicans
would have won but for the estimated influence of the trade war and health care policy.
       We consider three counterfactual scenarios, namely how Republicans would have fared: (i) absent
the trade war writ large (i.e., removing the estimated effects of retaliatory tariffs and agricultural
subsidies); (ii) absent the agricultural subsidies only (but including the estimated political con-
sequence of retaliatory tariffs); and (iii) absent the political influence of recent health insurance
coverage gains. Table 4 summarizes our findings, which are calculated based on the point estimates
from the full specification in Panel B, Column 3 of Table 2. In scenario (i), for example, we ob-
                                                                                   6

       The upper panel reports implications for the Republican vote share, aggregating over all House
races to the national level.15 The first column reports the actual data as a benchmark, followed
by results under each of the three scenarios. In the data, Republican House candidates saw a 4.83
percentage point decline in vote share nationwide, compared to 2016.16 Comparing this figure to
our estimated counterfactuals across the first row, we find that the trade war (including remedial
agricultural subsidies) can account for (0.048 - 0.043) × 100 = 0.5 percentage points, or about one-
tenth of the observed decline in Republicans' nationwide House vote share. In contrast, removing

     Throughout the counterfactuals, we hold constant the total number of votes cast in a county, while altering the
Republican share of votes according to our regression estimates.

     Note that the average cross-county change of -6.4 percentage points reported in Table 1 is an unweighted mean
across counties. Weighting the change in county-level vote shares by total county votes, the two figures coincide (by
definition).

 Notes: Implied effects are computed based on the coefficient estimates from the regression in Panel B, Column 3, Table 2. The four
columns report effects respectively: from the data; under a scenario where both the retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies are
removed; where only the agricultural subsides are removed; and where the five-year average gains in health insurance coverage are
removed. The top panel reports the implied change in the Republican vote share; the vote share changes at the county level are first
computed, and then aggregated up to either the national level or by electoral competitiveness bins. The bottom panel reports the net
gain in House seats for the Democratic party, namely the number of seats where the Republican two-party vote share was > 0.5 in
2016 but the predicted vote share dropped to < 0.5 in 2018, less the number of seats where the Republican two-party vote share was
< 0.5 in 2016 but the predicted share was > 0.5 in 2018. The first row is computed on the assumption that the vote share received
by the Republican party is uniform within each county across all constituent county-by-CD partitions. The remaining rows relax this
uniformity assumption, using instead the reported share of Republican (respectively, Democratic) votes within a county accounted for
by each county-by-CD to break up the Republican (respectively, Democratic) predicted vote at the county level, before aggregating to
the CD level; the second row does this on the basis of the 2016 county-by-CD voting outcomes, while the third row uses the 2018 voting
outcomes. The sample considered here excludes Pennsylvania due to redistricting; adding the net gain of 4 seats for the Democratic
party in Pennsylvania would bring the actual total net gain to 40 seats.


only the agricultural subsidies would have had a negligible effect on Republican support. Although
the subsidies are important for the largest recipient counties, these are also counties with such small
populations that there is little influence on nationwide vote totals. In contrast, health insurance
accounts for (0.048 - 0.039) × 100 = 0.9 percentage points, or about one-fifth of the erosion of
Republican vote share. Health care was thus independently important and, on average, about twice
as influential as the trade war. Nevertheless, in the most competitive counties where Trump narrowly
lost a majority in 2016 (the 40-50% bin), an analogous calculation finds the trade war and health
insurance to have commensurate and larger influence than at the national level. Each force accounts
for about one-quarter of Republicans' vote share losses in such counties.
   The lower panel translates the vote share changes into implied House seats. This exercise requires
making assumptions about how to apportion the implied change in county-level voting when counties
are split across multiple CDs. Our first and simplest approach assumes that a county's Republican


                                                                 16
vote share is uniformly distributed across any CD with which it overlaps. Under this assumption,
we divide the votes cast at the county level for each party in the 2018 House elections into each
county-by-CD partition, in proportion to the total votes cast (summed over both parties) in each
county-by-CD partition from the earlier 2016 House elections (from Election Atlas).17 Aggregating
to the CD level, we can then count the implied number of seats won by each party. That exercise,
reported in Column 1, yields a net swing to the Democratic party of 53 seats, which exceeds the actual
swing of 36 seats observed in our sample (excluding Pennsylvania). This difference in the predicted
versus actual seat swing can be interpreted as the number of additional seats that Republicans may
have lost, absent the strategic gerrymandering of CD boundaries.
       A second approach allows each county-by-CD partition to differ in importance to each party.
Here, we divide the votes cast at the county level for the Republican party (respectively, Democratic
party) using weights that are proportional to the Republican (respectively, Democratic) votes in
each county-by-CD partition. Basing these weights on the county-by-CD figures from the 2016
House election, we obtain an under-estimate ­ a net swing of 24 seats ­ towards the Democrats.
In contrast, using weights based on the 2018 county-by-CD figures yields exactly the net swing of
36 seats. This makes intuitive sense, as the 2018 data incorporate information about shifts in the
importance of each county-by-CD partition for each parties' county-level performance.
       We compute the implied seat swing for the three hypothetical scenarios by converting the coun-
terfactual county-level vote shares to CD-level race outcomes, under each approach. Focusing on
the last row in Table 4, which adopts the more realistic (non-uniform) apportioning rule based on
the 2018 party-specific county-by-CD weights, our regression results suggest that the trade war cost
Republicans a net 36-31=5 House seats. Under scenario (ii), where the retaliatory tariffs are in place,
but no agricultural subsidies were extended, we find that the subsidies had no estimated impact on
the predicted number of House seats. The MFP thus appears to have had minimal bearing on race
outcomes, likely due to the geographically-narrow impact of the subsidies. Under scenario (iii), we
find that the removal of health insurance as a policy issue would have resulted in a net swing of
28 seats, accounting for 36-28=8 Republican seats lost. This larger estimated impact of health care
policy on House seats is consistent with the broader geographic spread of health insurance coverage
gains in preceding years across the US, which likely put more CDs `in play' than the Retaliatory
Tariff Shock. Finally, if we were to combine scenarios (i) and (iii), we would obtain a net swing of 15
seats lost; the two forces thus overlap to jointly push several marginal CDs over from the Republican
to the Democratic win column. (Appendix Figure A.2 presents a CD-level visualization for these
counterfactual estimates of how much the trade war and health care policy affected the Republican
party in the 2018 House elections.)

5      Conclusion
We find that greater local exposure to the economic consequences of the trade war was associated with
a decline in support and a loss of seats for Republican candidates in the 2018 House elections. This
negative association was driven largely by retaliatory tariffs on agricultural products, particularly
in political swing counties where Trump narrowly lost the popular vote in 2016. At the same time,
the 2018 agricultural subsidies offset some of the Republican loss in vote share, although this was
likely immaterial to the swing in House seats due to the narrow set of recipient counties. Our results
are robust to a host of alternative specifications and control variables, including proxies for the
importance of health care as central policy issue during the 2018 election.

A.1     Data Details
Tariff Rates: The information on the tariffs introduced by the Trump administration, and in
response by the US' major trading partners, was collected by Bown (2019). These were compiled for
product codes at the tariff-line level. For the tariff increases levied by the US, the data cover the
following: (i) on washers and solar panels, under Section 201, implemented in February 2018; (ii)
on steel and aluminum, under Section 232, implemented in March and June 2018; (iii) on China,
under Section 301, three separate lists of increases implemented in July, August and September 2018.
(Note that for the tariffs on China, the increases implemented in July and August 2018 were the
so-called `$50 billion tariff list', i.e., covering $50 billion of US imports from China; the subsequent
increases in September 2018 covered an additional $200 billion of US imports from China.) For the
retaliatory tariffs, we include the tariff responses enacted by Canada, Mexico, China, and the EU to
the above increases; these trading partners are the four largest sources of US imports, accounting for
about two-thirds of the total value of US imports in 2017. (For a comprehensive timeline of US and
retaliatory tariff actions, see Bown and Kolb (2019).)
    County-level Tariff Shocks: We construct the county-level tariff shocks from the raw tariff
rate increases as follows. Let ( o,U
                                 p
                                     S
                                       ) denote the tariff rate change imposed by the US on imports
from country o in HS product p; as a convention, the first superscript denotes the origin country of
the trade flows while the second superscript denotes the destination country. Thus, ( U
                                                                                      p
                                                                                        S,d
                                                                                            ) refers
instead to the retaliatory tariff rate increase on US exports to country d in product p. Next, define
 o,d
Xp   to be the value of product-p trade flows from country o to country d in an initial pre-tariff year.
In practice, we use 2017 trade data from the World Bank WITS database for all countries, except
for Canada where the most recent available year is 2016. The impact of the product-p tariff increase
                                        o,d    o,d
in dollar terms is then captured as: T Sp   = Xp   ( o,d
                                                     p ), this being the magnitude of tariff revenues
that would be raised holding trade flows constant at their initial level.
    We map these product-level shocks to US counties in two steps. As the US county-level data
on industry composition is in NAICS codes, we first map the HS 6-digit tariff shocks to NAICS
3-digit industries, using HS-to-NAICS concordance weights constructed from the US customs data
in Feenstra, Romalis, and Schott (2002). We use the US import data from 2002-2006 to construct
weights for the US tariffs, while we use the US export data from those years to construct weights for
the retaliatory tariffs. (We use 2002-2006 as these are the latest years available in Feenstra, Romalis,
and Schott (2002); we exclude years prior to 2002 as there was an update to the HS codings in 2002.)
The tariff shock from the US tariffs levied against country o that is experienced by NAICS industry i
is then computed as: T Sio,U S =   p   U Simp
                                       p,i
                                                 o,U S
                                              T Sp     , where  U Simp
                                                                p,i    is the share of US imports (summed
over 2002-2006) in product p that is simultaneously classified in the US customs data as being in
NAICS industry i. Similarly, the retaliatory tariff shock levied by country d that falls on NAICS
industry i is computed as: T SiU S,d =       p   U Sexp
                                                 p,i
                                                           U S,d
                                                        T Sp     , where  U Sexp
                                                                          p,i    is the share of US exports


                                                      20
(summed over 2002-2006) in product p that is classified in the US customs data as being in NAICS
industry i.
   The second step is to map the above industry-level tariff shocks experienced at the national level to
the county level. For this, we use data on employment patterns by county and NAICS industry from
the 2016 County Business Patterns (CBP). Let Li,c denote total employment reported in industry
i and county c (from the CBP); Li denote the total employment in that industry in the US (from
the CBP); and L¯ c denote the total workforce size in that county (proxied for by the population aged
15-64, from the US Census county-level estimates for 2016). The county-level tariff shocks arising
from the US tariff action and from the retaliatory tariffs are respectively constructed as:

                                 T Sc    =                     ¯ c , and                          (A.1)

                                  T Sc =                       ¯c .                               (A.2)

Intuitively, this apportions the tariff shock at the NAICS industry level to each county, according to
the county's share of US employment in NAICS industry i, and then sums the tariff shock across
all industries i and US trade partner countries (respectively, o and d) being considered. We further
divide by L¯ c to arrive at a per-worker effect for county c.
   Note that the tariff shock measures as constructed are additive across industries i and partner
countries (o or d). For the purposes of Table 3, the agricultural sector tariff shocks are thus obtained
by restricting the summations in (A.1) and (A.2) to NAICS industries i that start with the digit 1; the
non-agricultural tariff shocks are the corresponding sums taken over all other industries. Likewise,
the agricultural sector tariff shock arising from retaliation from China is obtained by limiting the
summation in (A.2) to d = CHN and NAICS industries i that start with the digit 1.
   In practice, the CBP does not report employment data for NAICS 111 ("Crop production),
NAICS 112 ("Animal production and aquaculture"), and NAICS 113 ("Forestry and logging"), even
though trade in these industries was affected by the tariff increases. Instead, employment in "Support
Activities" for these respective industries is reported under NAICS 1151, 1152, and 1153. As agri-
cultural employment in these support activities would be impacted by the tariff action, we associate
the labor employed in NAICS 1151 to NAICS 111, in NAICS 1152 to NAICS 112, and in NAICS
1153 to NAICS 113, when we construct the county-level tariff shock measures in (A.1) and (A.2).
For confidentiality reasons, the county-level employment observations from the CBP are routinely
infused with a small amount of white noise. We use the reported figures with noise as given, since
these are in principle mean-unbiased observations. For a number of entries, the CBP suppresses the
actual figures and reports instead an employment size "class flag", i.e., a letter code indicating the
range within which the actual employment lies. If the employment of a NAICS 3-digit industry is
suppressed in this manner, we replace it with the total employment at the corresponding NAICS
2-digit level less employment in all other 3-digit industries with the same leading two digits. If

                                                  21
there are multiple 3-digit industries with suppressed employment flags under a given NAICS 2-digit
heading, we first compute the total employment that can be attributed to these undisclosed 3-digit
industries, and then reapportion this total employment in proportion to the midpoint of the "class
flag" bin for the undisclosed 3-digit industries. If the employment at the NAICS 2-digit level is itself
suppressed, we assign to it the midpoint of the "class flag" bin; although this last step can result in a
negative employment estimate for some 3-digit industries, this happens very rarely in practice, and
we replace any such observations with a zero.
   Market Facilitation Program (MFP) Agricultural Subsidies: We estimate the total sub-
sidies received by each county under the 2018 MFP, by combining information on: (i) the announced
subsidy rates by commodity, and (ii) the initial output or inventory of each county by commodity.
On (i), the subsidy rates are taken from the Congressional Research Service report on "Farm Policy:
USDA's 2018 Trade Aid Package" (19 June 2019 update); see in particular Table 2 of the report.
The set of commodities we consider and their associated subsidy rates are: Soybeans ($1.65 per
bushel), Hogs ($8.00 per head of inventory), Cotton ($0.06 per pound), Sorghum ($0.86 per bushel),
Milk ($0.12 per hundred pounds), Wheat ($0.14 per bushel), and Corn ($0.01 per bushel). On (ii),
we use annual county level crop output data from 2017, as downloaded from the US Department
of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The two exceptions are: Hogs, where we
use annual inventory data from 2017, and Milk, where we use 2012 output data as that is the most
recent available year. This covers all agricultural commodities included in the MFP, except the two
smallest commodities by total output ­ Fresh sweet cherries and Shelled almonds ­ for which county-
level output data are not available. The MFP subsidy per worker is calculated by summing across
the estimated total subsidy disbursed across commodities to each county, and then dividing by the
county population between ages 15-64, L¯ c (from the US Census, 2016 population estimates).
   We have cross-checked the validity of our MFP subsidy estimates against information on actual
disbursements from the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Farm Subsidy Database. The EWG
has been obtaining information on MFP subsidy disbursements from the USDA through a Freedom
of Information Act request, and has made publicly available a list of the largest beneficiaries from
the 2018 MFP subsidies. Using the "Top Recipients" file as of October 2018, and aggregating the
available data up to the commodity by state level, we find a positive correlation of 0.79 between the
EWG data and the MFP subsidy estimates we have computed.
   Election Data: From David Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections, for the 2012, 2014,
2016, and 2018 House elections, as well as the 2016 Presidential election. We use the data on voting
results at the county level, as well as at the county-by-CD level. The raw data can be purchased at:
https://uselectionatlas.org.
   Employment shares: From the 2016 and 2013 County Business Patterns. The data by NAICS 3-
digit industries were cleaned, with employment estimates computed for the suppressed data cells using
the procedure described above in the discussion of the construction of the tariff shock measures. The
agriculture, mining, and manufacturing sectors are defined respectively as the NAICS industries with


                                                   22
leading digit 1, with leading digits 21, and with leading digit 3. In the regressions, the employment
shares from 2016 are used as initial controls, while the corresponding changes in shares in 2016
relative to 2013 are used as pre-trend controls.
    Demographics: From the US Census Bureau, 2016 and 2013 estimates of county population
by characteristics. We use the population shares by age group (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65 and
over), by gender (female), and by race (black, white non-Hispanic, Hispanic). In the regressions, the
population shares from 2016 are used as initial controls, while the corresponding changes in shares
in 2016 relative to 2013 are used as pre-trend controls.
    Unemployment rate, Mean household income, Education, Health insurance coverage:
From the American Community Survey, five-year averages for 2013-2017 and for 2008-2012. The
education variable used is the share with some college education. The health insurance variable used
is the share of the civilian noninstitutionalized population with health insurance. In the regressions,
the five-year averages for 2013-2017 are used as initial controls, while the corresponding changes in
five-year averages in 2013-2017 relative to 2008-2012 are used as pre-trend controls.

    Figure A.2 below is a Congressional District map that illustrates the predicted decrease in Re-
publican House vote share that can be accounted for by the trade war (Panel A) and by health
care policy (Panel B). These are computed from predicted county-level vote share changes, using the

`non-uniform' party-specific county-by-CD weights from 2018 (described in Section 4.2) to apportion
the votes for counties that are split across multiple CDs. Panel A is based on the counterfactual
where the effects related to both the retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies are removed; this
is scenario (i) from Section 4.2. Panel B is based on the counterfactual where the effects related
to gains in health insurance coverage are removed; this is scenario (iii) from Section 4.2. The map
excludes Pennsylvania, where the redistricting of CD boundaries precludes making predictions about
how county-level vote shares would aggregate to the CD level, and Hawaii, where both CDs remained
firmly in the Democratic column.

C      Further Details of Analysis
Section 4.1 (Robustness): We elaborate on the two sets of robustness checks that are briefly
described at the end of Section 4.1. (Note that the appendix tables below report specifications that
are based on those in Columns 2 and 3 of Table 2 in the main paper.)
    In Table A.3, we examine alternative treatments to capture the inherent electoral competitiveness
of a county. The underlying concern is that the county-level Republican vote share in the 2016
Presidential election may not adequately reflect the electoral competitiveness of a county that is split
across multiple CDs, if there are forces specific to Congressional races that may have influenced voting
patterns in the 2016 presidential race. Columns 1 and 2 adopt a blunt approach to address this issue,
namely dropping from the sample all counties that overlap with multiple CDs; this nevertheless leaves
2,633 counties in the sample. We continue to obtain a negative effect of the Retaliatory Tariff Shock
in those counties where the Trump vote share in 2016 was between 40-50%, with the coefficients
remaining significant at the 10% level. Interestingly, we now obtain a positive and significant effect
of the US Tariff Shock in the 50-60% "competitiveness bin", although this finding is likely driven
by the composition of counties that remain in the sample. In Columns 3 and 4, we instead consider
an alternative measure of electoral competitiveness that takes into account CD-wide conditions.
Specifically, for each county, we calculate the weighted average of the CD-wide Republican vote
share in the 2016 Presidential election, where the weights used are proportional to the total number

                                                  24
of votes cast for the two major parties' candidates in the 2016 House election in each county-by-CD
partition. (To be clear, the CD-wide vote share includes all votes cast in the CD, including the
parts of the CD that are outside the county in question.) We then re-group the counties into the six
competitiveness bins on the basis of this weighted-average measure. The regressions here continue
to point to the effect of the Retaliatory Tariff Shock being concentrated in `close' counties, with a
negative and significant effect estimated in the 40-50% competitiveness bin, and now even in the
30-40% competitiveness bin.
   Table A.4 explores the potential for spillover effects of trade shocks experienced in other parts of
a county's commuting zone (CZ) to influence voting in the county. We construct the "Rest-of-CZ
tariff shock" measure by aggregating over the US (respectively, Retaliatory) Tariff Shocks in the CZ,
                                                                Li,c
but outside the county in question. Specifically, we sum the    Li
                                                                     T Sio,d   terms in equations (A.1) and
(A.2) across all counties within the CZ, except the county c in question; we then divide by the total
working age population (between ages 15-64) located in the CZ, but outside the county c. (The
mapping of counties to commuting zones is from: https://www.ddorn.net/data/cw cty czone.zip.)
Columns 1 and 2 of this table show that accounting for the county-level exposure to the tariff shocks,
the exposure of the rest of the CZ has no discernible relationship with voting outcomes, while the
county-level estimates remain robust. In Columns 3 and 4, we examine an alternative "Full trade
value" construction of the tariff shock measures. Specifically, we replace the product-level tariff shock
        o,d    o,d
with T Sp   = Xp   in the construction of the trade shocks; this is in contrast to the baseline, where
   o,d
T Sp   was instead obtained by multiplying the initial value of trade by the tariff rate increase (i.e.,
   o,d    o,d
T Sp   = Xp   ( o,d
                p )). Our key findings on the negative impact of the Retaliatory Tariff Shock on
the Republican House vote share, and the mitigating effect of the agricultural subsidies, remains
unaffected under this alternative construction.

Section 4.2 (Counterfactuals): In this part of the Appendix, we document formally how the
counterfactual implications of the regression model in (4) for county-level vote shares and CD-level
race outcomes are computed.
   Let RV ote18          18
             c and DV otec denote the number of votes cast for Republican and Democratic can-
didates respectively in county c in the 2018 House elections, as reported in the Election Atlas. Let
T V ote18       18        18
       c  RV otec + DV otec be the total number of votes cast in county c for Republican and
Democratic candidates. In turn, define RV oteSh18       18        18
                                               c  RV otec /T V otec to be the `two party vote
share' received by Republican House candidates in county c, as computed directly from the Election
Atlas data.
   In what follows, we will use `hats' (x) to denote predicted or counterfactual values of a variable x.
Section 4.2 considers three hypothetical scenarios (i)-(iii). The counterfactual 2018 Republican House
                      18
vote share, RV oteShc , is computed by subtracting from RV oteSh18
                                                                c the terms on the right-hand
side of (4) that capture the forces of interest each scenario. Specifically:

   · under scenario (i), where the effects of both the retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies are


                                                   25
                                                                                                 18
     removed, we compute the counterfactual Republican vote share as: RV oteShc = RV oteSh18
                                                                                          c -
        6                                     6
        b=1   b       b       R
              2 1(c  B ) × T Sc -             b=1   b       b                 R
                                                    1 1(c  B ) × AgSubsc × T Sc ;


   · under scenario (ii), where only the effect of the retaliatory tariffs is removed, we instead have:
                   18                         6
     RV oteShc = RV oteSh18
                         c -                  b=1   b       b       R
                                                    2 1(c  B ) × T Sc ; and
                                                              18
   · under scenario (iii), we compute RV oteShc as RV oteSh18
                                                           c minus the effect of recent health
     insurance coverage gains (i.e., the increase in the county-c health insurance coverage share
     between 2008-2012 to 2013-2017 times its estimated regression coefficient).

Note that we use the point estimates from the full specification in Panel B of Table 2, Column 3, to
calculate the above counterfactual vote shares.
   We next convert these county-level implications to nation-wide vote share changes. For each
scenario (i)-(iii), we compute the counterfactual number of votes received by Republican (respectively,
Democratic) candidates in county c in 2018 as:
                                          18                        18
                                   RV otec      = RV oteShc × T V ote18
                                                                     c , and
                                          18                             18
                                   DV otec      = (1 - RV oteShc ) × T V ote18
                                                                            c ;


note that this calculation is made holding constant the total number of votes cast for the major party
candidates (T V ote18
                   c ) at the counts observed in the Election Atlas. Aggregating across the House
races in all counties in our sample, we then obtain the counterfactual nation-wide Republican vote
                        18               18                    18
share as:     c   RV otec /(   c   RV otec +         c   DV otec ). We subtract from this the Republican House
vote share in 2016 aggregated over the counties in our sample (computed directly from the Election
Atlas data), to arrive at the Republican vote share change under each of the three counterfactual
scenarios. These are the results reported in the upper panel of Table 4.
   We further infer the implications for the number of House seats won by each party under each of
the three scenarios. Let Hc denote the set of CDs which overlap with county c. For any given set of
counterfactual vote counts, these now need to be apportioned for each county c to the CDs h  Hc
which overlap with the county. Let  R
                                    c,h  [0, 1] denote the weight used to apportion the Republican
                                    18
votes cast in county c, RV otec , to each of the CDs h  Hc , where:                  hHc   R             D
                                                                                           c,h = 1. Let  c,h  [0, 1]
                                                                    18
denote the analogous weight for apportioning DV otec , with                   hHc   D
                                                                                    c,h = 1.
   Our baseline `uniform vote share' assumption sets:  R      D            16         16           16
                                                       c,h =  c,h = (RV otec,h +DV otec,h )/(RV otec +

      c ). Here, RV otec,h (respectively, DV otec,h ) is the number of Republican (respectively, Demo-
cratic) votes in the 2016 House election recorded in the county-by-CD partition where CD h overlaps
with county c, as reported in the Election Atlas. At the same time, RV ote16                     16
                                                                          c (respectively, DV otec )
is the number of Republican (respectively, Democratic) votes cast in the 2016 House election in all
of county c. Intuitively, these weights assume that Republican (respectively, Democratic) voter sup-
port is distributed uniformly across the CDs within a county, so that the Republican (respectively,
Democratic) vote share is identical within each county-by-CD partition; the  R        D
                                                                             c,h and  c,h weights are

thus identical for both parties and proportional to the total number of votes cast (summed over the
two parties) in the county-by-CD partition.
   Under the `non-uniform vote share' assumption, we instead allow for each county-by-CD par-
                                                                                 y
tition to differ in importance to each party. Specifically, we set:  R                      y
                                                                     c,h = RV otec,h /RV otec and
            y
D                      y
c,h = DV otec,h /DV otec , where y = 16 or 18 depending respectively on whether we use 2016 or
2018 Election Atlas data to construct these weights.  R        D
                                                      c,h and  c,h would therefore split up the

counterfactual county-level vote counts, RV otec and DV otec , according to the share of Republican
(respectively, Democratic) votes cast within each county-by-CD partition in either the 2016 or 2018
House elections.
   We can now compute the counterfactual vote counts for each party at the CD level as follows.
Let Ch denote the set of counties c that overlap with CD h. The counterfactual vote counts for CD
h in the 2018 House elections are then given by:
                                       18                        18
                                RV oteh     =          R
                                                       c,h RV otec , and
                                                 cCh
                                       18                        18
                                DV oteh     =          D
                                                       c,h DV otec .
                                                 cCh


This calculation can be performed for each of scenarios (i)-(iii), under each of the apportionment
                                                                                      18         18
assumptions in turn. We then count up the number of House seats h for which: RV oteh /(RV oteh +
      18
DV oteh ) < 1/2 and RV ote16        16       16
                          h /(RV oteh +DV oteh ) > 1/2; we interpret these as seats that would have
swung from the Republican to the Democratic win column from 2016 to 2018. Likewise, we count the
                                            18             18          18
number of House seats h for which: RV oteh /(RV oteh + DV oteh ) > 1/2 and RV ote16        16
                                                                                 h /(RV oteh +
DV ote16
      h ) < 1/2; these are seats that would have swung in the opposite direction, from the Democratic
to the Republican party. We then take the difference between these two counts to infer the net swing
in seats. The results for each of scenarios (i)-(iii), under each apportionment rule, are reported in
the lower panel of Table 4.

 Notes: The above table reproduces the regressions from Table 2, with coefficients of all control variables reported in full. The dependent variable
is the change between 2016 and 2018 in the county-level two-party Republican House vote share. All estimates are from least squares regressions,
with observations weighted by total county population in 2016. The US tariff shock, retaliatory tariff shock, and Ag. subsidy variables are in units
of $1,000 per worker. The sample excludes counties in Pennsylvania (which saw congressional redistricting between 2016 and 2018), and those
counties in which the same party won uncontested in both 2016 and 2018. Standard errors are two-way clustered by state and commuting zone.

 Notes: Columns 1 and 3 follow the specification in Table 2, Column 2, while Columns 2 and 4 follow Table 2, Column 3. In Columns 1-2, the sample drops counties that are split
across multiple CDs. In Columns 3-4, the 2016 competitiveness bins are constructed as a weighted-average of CD-level Republican two-party vote shares in the 2016 presidential
election; for each county, this takes an average of the CD-level vote share across all CDs that overlap with the county in question, using the total number of votes cast for the
Republican and Democratic parties in the 2016 House elections at the county-by-CD level as weights. Standard errors are two-way clustered by state and commuting zone.

 Notes: Columns 1 and 3 follow the specification in Table 2, Column 2, while Columns 2 and 4 follow Table 2, Column 3. In Panel A, Column 1 controls additionally for
the Rest-of-CZ US and retaliatory tariff shocks, namely: the tariff shocks experienced in the rest of the commuting zone, excluding the county in question. Column 2 further
includes the interaction between the Rest-of-CZ retaliatory tariff shock and the county-level Ag. subsidy. In Panel B, Column 1 controls additionally for the Rest-of-CZ US and
retaliatory tariff shocks interacted with the 2016 presidential vote competitiveness bin dummies. Column 2 further includes the triple interaction terms between the Rest-of-CZ
retaliatory tariff shock, the county-level Ag. subsidy, and the competitiveness bin dummies. None of the Rest-of-CZ US or retaliatory tariff shock double or triple interaction
coefficients in Panel B are statistically significant; these are not reported to save space. Columns 3 and 4 use county-level US and retaliatory tariff shocks measures that are
constructed using the full value of trade flows affected, rather than the tariff rate multiplied by the value of trade. All alternative tariff shock measures are in units of $1,000
per worker. Standard errors are two-way clustered by state and commuting zone.

 Notes: The dependent variable in Panel A is our US tariff shock measure, while that in Panel B is our retaliatory tariff shock measure, both
in units of $1,000 per worker. All estimates are from least squares regressions, with observations weighted by total county population in 2016.
The key explanatory variables are indicators for the county-level two-party Republican vote share in the 2016 Presidential Election. Column
2 includes the "FGKK" set of controls (reconstructed as best we can): employment shares in agriculture and manufacturing in 2016 (from the
County Business Patterns), together with pre-trends between 2013-2016; the unemployment rate, and log mean household income in 2013-2017
(five-year averages from the American Community Survey), together with pre-trends between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017; the white population
share in 2016 (from the US Census), and the share with some college education in 2013-2017 (from the American Community Survey). Columns
3 and 4 include the full "BBC" set of county initial controls and pre-trends used in Tables 2 and 3 in the main paper. Column 4 restricts the
sample to 15 swing states: AZ, CO, FL, GA, IA, MI, MN, NC, NH, NM, NV, OH, PA. We further report the p-value of a two-sided coefficient
test of equality for the coefficients of the 1(Pres. vote  (0.5, 0.6]) and 1(Pres. vote  (0.7, 1]) bins. Standard errors are clustered by state.
