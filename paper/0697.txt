  Implications of the Changing U.S. Labor Market for Higher Education



                               ABSTRACT


     This paper examines evidence regarding the impact of the changed labor

market on the higher educational system. Four basic propositions can be

drawn from the paper's findings.

     Firstly, the labor market for the highly educated underwent a downturn

in the 1970s, reducing the relative earnings of new college graduates and

forcing them into jobs not normally considered as requiring college training.

Secondly, this downturn resulted in a levelling off, and, in the case of

white males, a sharp decline, in college enrollment. Statistical and

survey questionnaire data show that this is due to the economic responsiveness

of potential students to market incentives.

     The effects of this labor market change were most severe in the liberal

arts, teaching, and academic and research—oriented occupations. In other

business—oriented fields such as management and accounting, and in engineering,

economic opportunities remained substantial or in some cases improved. Con-

sistent with these changes were changes in enrollments and degrees. Depressed

job markets experienced rapid declines in enrollment, while fields such as

engineering experienced an increase in enrollment. Concurrently, professional

schools benefitted while liberal arts schools suffered from labor market

induced patterns of change in enrollment.

        The decade of the 1970s was one of significant change in the labor

market for college—trained manpower. The once high and in some areas

rising economic reward to college—going declined and many recent graduates

found themselves with serious labor market problems. Newspaper and

magazine articles turned attention to the unemployed teacher, the doctorate

taxi driver, the college graduate employed in the factory. Throughout

the society questions arose regarding the economic value of higher education,

motivated such books as my Overeducated American (Academic Press, 1976).

       The   Brea;.i or Labor Statistics, among others, forecact significant
surplicec of college graduates, in sharp contrast to traditional forecasts
of shortages. State legislatures, federal agencies, students and their
parents reacted to the new realities, placing academic institutions in a very
different environment from the one they had enjoyed in previous decades.
       Rapid growth of higher   education turned into stagnation and academic

institutions were forced into modes of behavior quite different from those in

previous periods of high demand for college education.

        The purpose of this essay is to examine evidence regarding the impact

of t:he changed labor market on the higher educational system. Special attention

is given to late 1970s developments t:b.at were not examined in early studies of

the declining college job market. Section I reviews the pattern of change in

the market for college trained workers. It seeks to determine the extent to

which the dceline in the college job market has decelerated and the extent to

which the graduates of the early seventies have recouped their economic position.

Then it considers the way the market changes have altered the number of
                                             —2—


students seeking higher education. Section 2 turns to the questions of the

impact of the market changes on the higher educational system. Section 3 sum-

marizes our findings and evaluates the ways by which the higher educational

system is adjusting to swings in the labor market.



I. What We Know (Or Think We Know) About the Changing Labor Market for College

    Educated Workers

          A wide variety of evidence on the changing market for college educated

workers has cumulated in the past few years. While there is some disagreement

regarding interpretation of the evidence which I first analyzed in 1975 and

1976, developments in the latter part of the seventies appear to confirm the

basic   finding regarding the "turnaround" in the college job market that dif-
ferentiated the decade from earlier post—World War II years. In this section, I
resiiew the nst       recent evidence of change in the college lob market ——   the
experimental variation which enables us to probe the link between the labor

market and higher education ——      in   order to assess the dimensions of changes. The

most important findings which emerge from this analysis can be summarized in

four basic propositions which constitute what we "know" about the changing labor

market:

   i) The labor market for the highly educated underwent a marked downturn in

          the decade which substantially reduced the relative earnings of new

          college graduates and which forced many into jobs not normally viewed as

          requiring college training. Measured as a rate of return, the return to
          four years of college fell from perhaps 11% to 7%. While the decline in
                                      —3—



    the economic opportunities for college workers decelerated or improved

    slightly at the end of the 1970s, there is no indication of a recovery

    of previous economic advantages by that time.

2) The downturn differentially    affected fields, being   most severe in   liberal
    arts,   teaching, academic and research oriented occupations. The downturn
    was more severe at the doctorate level than at other levels. P'
    contrast, in certain business—oriented fields, such as management and
    accounting, in engineering, and in selected other specialities, economic
    opportunities remained substantial or in some cases inproved contrary to
    the overall pattern.
3) There as a significant supply response to the market turnaround, with
    the proportion of young persons enrolling in college leveling off for
    some groups and actually falling sharply for white males. Both statisti-
    cal and survey questionnaire data indicate that the    changed   enrollments
    reflect economic   responsiveness of potential students to market

    incentives.

1) Consistent with the pattern of change in earnings and opportunities

   across   fields, there was considerable 'variation in changes
   in enrollments and degrees. Fields with depressed job markets like
   teaching experienced rapid declines in enrollments while those with
   opposite markets like engineering had large increases in enrollments.
   Professional schools benefitted while arts and sciences suffered from
   the labor—market induced patterns of change in enrollment.

       All   told, the labor market for college—trained workers underwent extraor-

dinary change in   the   1970s, with significant implications for higher educational

institutions.

       I consider next the evidence for the four propositions, contrasting where

relevant the patterns in the latter half of the decade with those in the 1969—15

period on which rmy earlier work focused.


1. The Overall Decline

       The evidence that the labor market for the highly educated, especially

new college graduates, underwent a major, unprecendented downturn in the 1970s

is impressive. Statistics on incomes and starting pay show a marked deteriora-

tion in the economic status of graduates relative to other workers, while data

on employment shows an increasing number of college graduates ending up in posi-

tions outside of traditional college—level job areas.

       Table 1 summarizes data on the overall pattern of change in the earnings

of college graduates. It compares several measures of the earnings of college

graduates relative to the earnings of other workers from 1969, when

the college marketplace was strong, to l914 when it was substantially depressed

and then to 1978 — 1980.      To minimize the impact of cyclic changes on the

comparisons, the data relate to the earnings of year—round full—time workers and

actual monthly salary rates. Annual income figures which include the income of

those without work for part of the year show similar patterns.

       The table shows a sizeable drop in the relative position of

highly educated during the period under study, especially among the young.      From

1969 to 1974 the income of 25—34 year old male college graduates relative to

high school graduates dropped sharply, then rose modestly over the next four

years, when the Current Population Survey underwent a modest change in method-

ology. For all men the pattern is similar, with an income ratio of 1.53 falling

to 1.35 and then rising somewhat to 1.40. For women, the pattern is quite

different, but still evinces a declining advantage to the college trained.

For 25—34 year olds there is a sharp drop from 1969 to 1974, followed by a

slight decline thereafter whereas for all women income ratios are steady from

1969 to 1974, but appear to fall in the latter part of the decade.

          The pattern of falling relative income of college workers is also found

in the ratio of starting salaries of graduates to average annual earnings shown

in lines 5 and 6 of the table, which shows the bulk of the drop

occurring in the early 1970s and some upturn in the latter part of the

decade.

          Overall, we see that while there is some indication of a modest recovery

in the college market from the severely depressed conditions of 1974, the recovery

is insufficient to come even close to restoring the earlier income advantage

of graduates. The market was depressed for graduate manpower throughout the

decade following the heralded turnaround.

          Parallel to the drop in the relative income of college students was a

deterioration in employment opportunities. This deterioration forced an

unprecedented number of college graduates, particularly those starting their

careers, into non—- ierl jobs. Also jobs outside their area of study, or into

unemployment.

       Table 2 examines this aspect of the changing college job market. It

compares the types of jobs and difficulties in obtaining positions in 1969 with

the situation in 1975 and in 1979. Lines 1 and 2, which give the most compre-

hensive   statistics on the employment of graduates, show that the proportion

employed in the traditional occupational area of the college—educated, the

professions, fell sharply in the period, by 9 percentage points for men and

16 percentage points for women.

      The data on employment of college graduates is organized in line 3 in a

different fashion to focus on the likely occupations of the new cohorts of

graduates. From 1962 to 1968, the number of college graduates in the labor

force grew by 4,0l1,000. The number obtaining professional jobs grew by

2,915,000 —   implying   that 73% of the additional college workers got professional

employment. From 1969 to 1916, by contrast, when the number of graduates grew

by 8,096,000, the number obtaining professional jobs grew by just 3,751,000 — a

1t6% rate of increased employment in the professions. From 1916 to 1919, the

number of graduates increased by 3,706,208, while the number working as pro-

fessionals increased by 1,627,000 — a 44% rate of increased employment in the

professions. s in earlier calculations, we find a dramatic change from the

1960s to the 1910s, with the rate of deterioration lessening; in this case,

leveling off in the late 1970s.

    Rates of Return

       The decline in the economic position of college workers in the l9lOs was

accompanied by continued rises in the direct cost of education, with the

necessary consequence that the rate of return to investment in college fell.

Table 3 compares costs of training with the income rewards accruing to young

(25 -to 3)4 year old) male graduates. For historic perspective, the table covers

a longer period than tables 1 and 2; for comparability of incomes over time, it

deals with income of all workers rather than year—round full—time workers.

Line 1 shows a rough stability/modest increase in the real cost of college in

the l970s, with tuition and fees in public colleges falling by 4%,   tuition

and fees in private institutions rising by 2% and total cost per pupil decreas—

ing by 2% in the 1969—78 period. Line 2 turns to the benefit side of the

picture. It records the difference between the income of college and high school

graduates. Consistent with the picture in table 1, the data reveal a marked

drop in the absolute real differential between young male college and high

school workers in the period. Whereas in 1969, 25—34 year old college men

earned $2408 more than similarly aged high school graduates, in 1978, their

advantage was just $1440, a striking 40 percent decline. Note, however, that

in these comparisons as in the others, the bulk of declines occurred in the early

part of the decade, with the position of young male college graduates improving

somewhat after the mid—l970s.

       The way in which these changes affect rates f return depend on assurip—

tions about future income profiles. If the college graduates of 1910s are on

permanently lower trajectories than has traditionally been the case, the return

to their investment will be lower than if they manage to recoup at least some of

the relative income losses of the period. In their critique of r analysis,

delch and Smith argued that college graduates are, in fact, likely to make some

relative gains in the future, which implies that the analyses based on starting

salaries of the earnings of young college graduates exaggerate the magnitude of

changes. Sufficient time has progressed to allow for some evaluation of this

possibility. To what extent, if any, have the graduates of the early seventies

experienced especially rapid rates of growth in earnings, which would enable

them to recoup traditional college earnings differentials over the life cycle?
                                      —11—


       Three studies have dealt with this question, yielding consistent and

definite results. One, by Marc Meyer, has found that college graduates in

the National Longitudinal Survey ("Parnes" data set) had slower rather than

faster rates of increase in salaries over the period. A second, by Donovan and

Raisan, found that in the Michigan Panel Survey of Income Dynamics college

graduates had slower rates of growth by about 1½ percentage points per year

than high school graduates but that the rates of growth grew closer together

toward the latter seventies. My own work, comparing cohorts in the Current

Population Survey also finds slower growth in the earnings of college men over

the period. All of these studies suggest that, if anything, the diminution in

the advantage of young college graduates shown in tabll and 3 understates

the possible lifetime income loss of the seventies graduates. While the evidence

suggests that the bulk of the turnaround has occurred, it does not support the

notion that the seventies graduates are recouping their economic loss over the

lifecycle. We conclude that the developments of the l970s have caused a real

economic loss.



2. Variation Among Fields

       One of the basic features of the declining college market of the l970s

has been the vastly different experience of diverse fields and degrees.

Generally speaking, the pattern has been of exceptional decline in academic

and research fields in contrast to more modest decline or increases in business—

oriented occupations like business, engineering, and medicine.

      Table 4 documents the differential pattern of change in salaries. The

figures on bachelor's starting rates show sizeable variation in the rate of

decline in the real starting pay of college men from 1969 to 1975 and from

1975 to 1980. Humanities and social science majors experience a loss in real

starting pay of 20 percent in the first period and of 11% in the second period.

Accountants and general business graduates did somewhat less poorly, while

chemists and mathematicians have smaller rates of decline and hold their own

or gain in the '75—'8l period. Engineers do the best, particularly in the

latter part of the decade. As a result of the changes in 1969, the ratio of

the starting pay of B.S. engineers to that of bachelor's humanities and social

science majors was 1.23; in 1981, it was 1.64!

       The rates of change for Ph.D.s and master's graduates tell a similar

story about the locus of the decline by the degree level and field. On average,

from 1969 to 1980, Ph.D. and Master's starting pay fell by nearly

20%. Within the same field, the salary of doctorate and masters personnel

declines more rapidly than that of bachelor's graduates, save for MBAs, where

the rates of change were similar. The escial1y large drop in the real pay of

Ph.D. and MA or MS workers significantly cut their premium over bachelor's

graduates and thus lowered the rate of return to postgraduate training. In

1969, a Ph.D. engineer earned 57 percent and aMS engineer 17 percent more

than a B.S. engineer in the specialty. In 1980, the advantage to the Ph.D.

or MS had fallen to 40 percent and 10 percent respectively. Across fields engi-

neering and to a lesser extent chemistry did relatively well toward the end of

the decade.

       Finally, information on the types of jobs obtained and difficulties in

finding positions by field of study tell a similar story about patterns of change

across fields. According to the surveys of the National Education Association,

elementary and high school teaching was one of the most depressed fields, with

the proportion of new education graduates obtaining teaching jobs dropping from

714 percent in 1962 to 148 percent in   19114 (see N.E.A., 1977). In February 1978, when
5.9% of all 1976—77 bachelor's recipients were unemployed, the rate for arts and science

graduates stood at 7.9%, with a 9.5%    rate   for humanities majors and 11.14% rate
                                       —14—



for B.S. biological scientists (National Center for Educational Statistics,

dition of Education, 1979).

    The drastically different markets for various disciplines has not escaped the

attention of college placement officers, who note, ".   . .what's bad is getting
worse... in general the market in technical areas has been the best that it's been

in years... (whereas) for the kid coming out of a general studies background the

market is flat". In spring 1981 the New York Times summarized the pattern:

    "Engineers are being hungrily wooed with salary offers reaching $30,000 a year,

while liberal arts majors are scraping to find openings that pay $12,000."

       We conclude that the downturn in the college marketplace was substan-

tially concentrated in certain areas and in certain types of degrees, as opposed

to others.


3. Enrollment Response

       The impact of the changing labor market for college graduates on the

higher educational system depend in large part on the supply responsiveness of

young persons to the decline in incentives. Figure 1 presents data on the

enrollment behavior of young persons in the changing college market. It depicts

the proportion of 18 to 19 year olds enrolled in college from 1951 to 19T9 and

the percentage from specific high school graduating classes enrolled as freshmen

in the following year. What stands out in the data is the sudden sharp fall in

the relative number of male college students, which began in 1969 (1968 in the

high school graduate data), when the labor market turned down after more than a

decade of substantial increases. In 1969, 1•Q percent of 18 to 19 year old

male civilians enrolled in college, and 60 percent of new high school male grad-

uates elected to become freshmen (down from 63 percent in 1968). Five years

later, just 33.14 percent of 18 to 19 year old males and 149 percent of male high

school graduates went on to college — remarkable declines of 10.6 and 11 percen-

tage points. Ten years later, the figures are similar, 33.3% of 18 to 19 year

old males enrolled in college and 50% of male high school graduates entered

college. Consistent with our findings about the time pattern of change in rela-

tive earnings and employment, the bulk of the drop in the enrollment proportions

occurred in the first half of the decade, stabilizing thereafter.

      Among women, figure 1 shows a somewhat different story. Here, enrollment

rates level off in the 1970s but do not decline. In 1969, 34.4 percent of women

aged 18 to 19 entrolled in college; in 1974, 33 percent and in 1979, 36 percent.

The proportion of female high school graduates going on to college remained

roughly stable over the same period (47 percent in 1969, 46 percent in 1974 and

48 percent in 1979). As a result of the decreasing proportion of young men

going on to college and the stability in the proportion of young women, the

 female share of entering students rose sharply in the period. In 1979, women

constituted 52 percent of 18 to 19 year olds in college compared to 46 percent

of 18 to 19 year olds in 1969. The stability in female college enrollment

compared to the drop in male enrollments is, it should be noted, consistent with

 the data on relative economic rewards which suggested that the payoff to female

college—going did not decline as quickly or consistently as that for male college—

going in the seventies.

       Was the decline in the proportion of young perso's going to college con-

centrated among persons from less advantaged backgrounds or did it occur more

evenly among those from high as well as low or middle income families?

Surprisingly, perhaps, U.S. Bureau of Census evidence shows relatively little

decline in college—going among persons from very low family income and roughly

comparable declines among those from families above the lowest level:

         Figure 1, No. 360, Table 13.
The fall, in enrollments from the middle and upper classes represents a major

change in the traditional pattern of intergenerational mobility: for the first

time, large numbers of young persons appeared likely to obtain less schooling

and potentially lower occupational status than their parents.

       At the graduate level, the drop in the proportion of young persons from

the relevant supply group — those with college degrees — choosing to enroll for

graduate work had fallen equally sharply. This development is examined in Table

5, which present two sets of figures on graduate enrollments——Office of

Education data, based on surveys of institutions of higher education, and Bureau

of the Census data, which are obtained from the Current Population Survey of

individuals. Lines 1 and 2 record the absolute number enrolled in graduate

programs in 1969, when the market was still strong and in l95, after several

years of downturn. Line 3 gives estimates of the relevant population which

could be expected to go on to graduate studies: college graduates aged 22 to 29

while lines 14 and 5 present the estimated "propensity to enroll for graduate

work," defined as the ratio of the figures in lines 1 and 2 to those in line 3.

According to the statistics, the absolute numbers pursuing graduate work increased

moderately from 1969 to 19T5, but much less rapidly than did the relevant

population of eligibles, substantially reducing the proportion enrolled. From

1975 to 1979, the rate of enrollment appears to have levelled off. For

1919 the Office of Education data show 34% of 22 to 29 year old graduates

were enrolled in graduate/professional schools compared to 2% a decade earlier,

while the Bureau of Census data show 40% enrolled compared to 50% a decade

earlier.


 Interpretation

        An economist finds it natural to link the changes in the job market docu-

 mented under proposition 1 with the observed changes in enrollments examined

 here in terms of the labor supply behavior of potential students and their

 families. Two very different types of evidence support this interpretation.

 First, survey evidence on the reasons young people give for going to college

 find earnings on job opportunities high on the list, which suggests considerable

 supply responsiveness. Nearly 80 percent of freshmen surveyed by. the American

 Council of Education in 1977 agreed, for example, that a major reason for going

 to college was that it would enable them to get a better job. Nearly one—third

 citcd "able to make more money" as a very important reason for going to college.

 Similar results are obtained with questions relating to choice of career. Second,

econometric analysis indicates that the income of graduates relative to other

workers and/or measures of relative employment opportunities does a good job in

tracking actual patterns of enrollment over time. Most other factors which

might be cited as explanations of the observed changes — such as the draft,

cyclical unemployment, inflationary cuts in real family income, do not account

for the observed changes.

    How important are changes in the prepensity of students to enroll in college due,

it appears, to economic incentives in the changing number going to college? Despite

the great emphasis placed in recent discussion of enrollment on demographic

developments, market—induced changes in the proportion choosing to enrollment have

been extremely important. For example, from 1970 to 1979 enrollment of men aged
                                      —20—


18—19 in college fell by 5,000 whereas the 18—19 year old male population increased

by 843,000 (Bureau of the Census, Series P—20). Thedbmiflaflt factor in the change

was the change in propensity to enroll, not the change in the size of the popula-

tion. While the importance of changes in enrollment propensities in altering

flows of students will vary with market conditions, group and time period, it

is apparent that one of the critical aspects of the labor market——higher education

linkage is the supply responsiveness of the young.                            -




4.   Field Variation

     There is a sizeable body of evidence supporting proposition 4——that the

changing market place for college workers affects not only the overall decision

to enroll but also the field of study chosen. In the 1970s the differential

change in the income and employment conditions in the various college—level

occupations appears to have generated a significant supply response from

young persons in the process of choosing their careers. As would be expected

of economically responsive decision—makers, students shifted from fields

facing the worst market conditions to those with relatively better prospects.

     Table 6 documents the overall pattern of change in the career plans of

of entering freshmen. What stands out in the table is the remarkable shift

of both men and women from academic to business—oriented fields, which would

be expected if students were responding to the differential incentives

described earlier. Whereas in 1966, 2.1% of men and 1.5% of women planned

to teach in colleges and 11.3% of men and 34.1% of women planned to teach in

elementary and secondary school, in 1979, just 0.3% of male freshmen and 0.2%

of females intended on college teaching and just 2.7% (male) and 10.4%

 (female) considered elementary or secondary school teaching. The proportion

of both groups intending business careers rose over the entire period, by nearly

sevenfold among women; while the proportion of men intending to enter engineering

fell from 1966 to 1974, then jumped from 1974 to 1979.

     The enrollment and degree data in figure 2 provides

further evidence of the striking changes experienced by diverse fields in

the period:

     —In the hard hit education area, the number of bachelorTs degrees

fell by 19 percent in the 1970—1978 period.

     —Tn physics, whose job market turned down earlier than in other fields,

despite a two—fold increase in the total student body, junior and senior

majors declined from 14,900 (1961) to 10,900 (1971) and first year graduate

enrollments by over one half.

     —In fields with stronger job markets, life sciences, agriculture and

business—oriented specialties, by contrast, degrees increased. The number

of MBA's, for example, grew greatly from 1970 to 1978.

     —Perhaps most impressive in terms of the differential pattern of

changes among fields is the experience of engineering, which throughout the

late l960s and early 1970s had substantially declining enrollments. From

1973 to 1979, first year enrollments in B.S. engineering, which had in 1973

plummetted to its lowest figure since 1949, despite the expansion of higher

education, rose by about 50,000 in accord with the cobweb dynamics that seem

to characterize that field.

     Econometric evidence relating the number of students enrolled or graduating

in various fields to salaries in those disciplines and to salaries in alternative

professions confirm the economic responsiveness interpretation of the patterns.

While precise estimates depend on the specification of models, years covered,

and measures of variables, the general finding is that salaries have a signi-

ficant and large impact on supply decisions. Table 8 summarizes some of the

relevant estimates of elasticities for particular fields and for all freshmen

in college. Column 1 gives estimates of the "short run" effect of salaries,

where short run relates to the response in a given year. Column 2 gives

estimated "long run" elasticities, generally calculated from a partial adjust—

      ment model. Because the models and parameter estimates are crude and subject

      to change given more detailed specification or new observations, the calculations

      are to be viewed as providing orders of magnitude of the behavioral relations.

      The elasticities for specific fields range from 1 to 2 in the short run and

      from 3 to 4 in the long run.

              Even more striking, perhaps, is the remarkable difference in the accuracy

      of projections of future degrees in fields based on supply responsive behavior

      and projections based on traditional trend forecasts. As indicated below,

      in the case of physics forecasts based on economic responsiveness predicted

      not only the decline in PhDs granted in physics, while trend forecasts predicted

      increases, but came within 10% or so of the actual number granted, after

      allowances for increased numbers of foreign students whose behavior would

      reflect opportunities in their country and other factors unrelated to the

      state of the U.S. market for physicists.

Summary of Section I

     Our examination of data on the changing job market for college—trained

workers in the U.S. has supported the four propositions with which we began.

There was a marked decline in the market for college workers which, while

lessening at the end of the decade, did not restore traditional college

advantages. There were sizeable differences in the experience of various

fields in the period which greatly exacerbated differences between academic

and research occupations and business occupations. There was a decline in

the propensity to attend college, apparently due to changed economic in-

centives. There was differential enrollment and degree patterns among fields,

apparently due to their different market conditions.

     How did the higher educational system respond to those developments?

What are the mechanisms by which colleges and universities react to labor—

II. Impact on Higher Education

         The way in which the 1970s turnaround in the college labor market

    affects higher education depends on the operation of the education market

    place. The purpose of this section is to examine this market and to analyse

    the adjustment made by higher educational institutions to the changes of the

    seventies. Because American higher education is highly decentralized, with

    over 3,000 colleges and universities competing for students, the sector can,

    wtth due allowance for its distinct features, be fruitfully analysed in

    terms of the standard economic model of a competitive industry. The standard

    model directs attention to: the exit and entry of institutions, changes in

    prices of output, changes in profits and changes in prices paid factors specific

    to an industry, and changes in product mix, among other things. In this section

    I consider briefly certain distinct characteristics of higher education likely

    to affect these and related modes of adjustment and then examine the changes

    in the period under study.


    Ditinctive features of academe

         The characteristics of higher education most likely to affect the operation

    of the market place are: nonprofit status of enterprises; the relatively small

    role played by the direct price, tuition, in the cost of education and in the

    income of colleges and universities; the extensive employment of highly educated

    workers "produced" within the system; institutional rules which limit

    variation in prices and certain forms of adjustment to. change.

         1. The nonprofit status of colleges and universities can be expected to

    affect the response of higher education to market developments. While it is

    often asserted that nonprofit enterprises are less responsive to economic

    incentives than comparable profit—seeking firms, a simple model of nonprofit
                                  —29—


behavior can be developed to show that the contrary is more likely. Essen-

tially this is because nonprofit enterprises lack a "buffer" in the form of

profits, and thus have to adjust to changes in market conditions entirely

through changes in resource usage whereas at least some of the adjustment of

profit—seeking firms will take the form of changes in profits. If this

argument (given in detail in Freeman, 1975, 1979) has at least some validity,

we would expect considerable adjustment in the academic market to:the seventies

turnaround


     2. In contrast to most goods, whose price is the major component of

cost to purchasers and the major receipt of income by sellers, the direct cost

of higher education——tuition (and roOm and board)——constitutes only a modest

share of the cost to student and of the income of institutions. On the student

side, as Schultz argued years ago, the bulk of the cost of higher education

consists of governmental funds and, in the case of private schools, endowment

and gifts.

     Table 9 documents these two important characteristics of the academic

market place at the end of the l970s. Panel A shows that. in all institutions

tuition constituted just 11% of the total cost of higher education (with

room and board excluded) while tuition and room and board constituted

24% of the total cost. Even in private institutions, no more than 36%

of the cost of higher education is attributed to the direct cost. Foregone

income is the prime private cost in both cases. Panel B (based on a different

but roughly consistent data source) shows that tuition constituted 40% of money

spent on education of students but just 21% of total university income. In

private institutions, however, most of student education expenditures was paid

for by tuition, though tuition constituted only 37% of total private

institutional receipts.

     The low share of direct cost in the private cost of higher education

suggests that demand for higher education will be only modestly responsive to

changes in tuition (and room and board) charges. Empirical analysis supports

the implication. The seven studies cited by McPherson show an elasticity of

enrollments to tuition of about 0.30, on average (Breneman and Finn, p. 181).

The 0.3 estimate is, it should be noted, roughly consistent with

estimates of responsiveness of enrollments to the salaries of

college and high school graduates. Elasticities with respect to

salaries are on the order of 2.00 ; given a tuition share in cost of .15,

one would expect, if tuition was riot a serious bottleneck due to problems of

capital—financing, an elasticity of .30, roughly the McPherson summary

estimate. Such a highly inelastic demand for higher education has one

obvious implication of policy—makers: colleges and universities as a group

could raise receipts by increasing tuition charges. Because tuition consti-

tutes only a modest share of receipts, however, even sizeable increases in

tuition will not greatly raise total receipts. Individual institutions,

however, are unlikely to exploit an inelastic demand curve, for as in other

markets with many competing institutions, demand for the output of a given

institution will be much more elastic than demand for the industry's output.


     3. The production of the major input used in higher education, doc-

torate faculty, and the dependence of the demand for new faculty on changes in

enrollment suggest application of capital goods accelerator models to the

faculty market. Such models highlight the dynamic adjustment

problems of an industry producing and employing a long—lived capital

resource such as faculty and its potential for cyclic adjustment.
                                   —32—



For present purposes what is important is that a deceleration in the

rate of growth of enrollments is likely to have a significant depressant

effect on the demand for new PhDs which in turn can be expected to reduce

demand for graduate training, with further negative effects on demand for

faculty. Since PhD faculty are highly specialized——in some respects a

resource specific to the industry——fluctuations in demand for faculty and

thus in employment and salaries are likely to be sizeable in response to

changes in demand for higher education.


     4. Three institutional features of the academic market are also likely

to affect the adjustment to changed economic conditions. The general goal

for interfield 'tequity" in salaries——defined in terms of making cross—field

differences as small as is feasible given the need to obtain faculty——tends

to limit the ability of higher education to adjust rates of pay across fields

to changes in market conditions. For example, from 1970 to 1975, when the

market for various disciplines changed immensely, the standard deviation of

the log change of the salaries of academic doctorate scientists across fields

was 0.089 while the comparable standard deviation across fields in industry

was 0.385 (Freeman in Lewis, Becker, p. 73). The lack of variation suggests that

the brunt of adjustments across disciplines will take the form of quantity

rather than price changes.

    A second important institutional constraint on higher education is the

tenure system, which guarantees lifetime employment to faculty except for

reasons of institutional financial crisis or incompetency. In periods of

market contraction tenure can become a serious barrier to adjustment, as

colleges and universities will not easily be able to keep on young workers

of relatively high quality due to tenure committments. The institution of

tenure places the onus of adjusting to economic changes on the new PhDs.
                                       —33—



         The recent unionization of colleges and universities (in 1977 over 12 percent

of campuses were organized, compared to no campuses in 1965, (Freeman in Lewis and

Becker, p. 28))may further constrain institutions due to egalitarian goals of

most unions and may further force adjustments onto the young due to the general

pattern for unions to be especially responsive to the desires of older workers.

     To sum up, our analysis of the distinctive characteristics of higher

education suggests that the response of academe to the 1970s turnaround in

the job market will be marked by: sizeable changes in the quantity of resources

used ,   with   considerable impacts on the position of potential young faculty;

adjustments in tuition and potentially large adjustments in the wages of

faculty——the input specific to the sector.


Adjustment in quantities

     Table 10 examines some of the quantitative responses of the higher

educational system to the 1970s turnaround. Line 1 records the number of

institutions in the market: it shows a rapid growth in the number, particularly

of 2 year institutions, from 1960 through 1974, followed by a notable levelling

in the rate of growth. From 1960 to 1974, the number of higher educational

institutions increased by 2.8% per annum compared to a compound growth of

1.0% from 1974 to 1978. Because of the long lead time in construction, the

number of new institutions entering the market did not begin levelling off

until the latter part of the decade. A number of existing institutions

were, however, forced to close their doors in the decade. According to

the National Center for Education Statistics, 144, largely small private colleges.

went out of business (Condition of Education, 1980, Table 4—15). A significant

number of other institutions—--30 universities, 803 4—year colleges and 427 2—year

institutions——reported current fund expenditures greater than current fund revenues,

suggesting that more institutions are likely to go out of business in the

coming decade (Condition of Education 1980, table 4—16).

     Line 2 of Table 10 considers the impact of the 1970s developments on

employment of faculty. It shows a similar marked pattern of declining

growth. From 1960 to 1970, the number of faculty increased by 7.6% per annum;

from 1970 to 1974, by 4.9%; from 1974 to 1978, by 3.9%. Relative to total

employment the faculty share of the employed rose by 0.31 points from 1960

to 1970, by .16 points in the next eight years.

     Line 3 of the table examines the overall flow of resources to higher

education in terms of constant 1978—9 dollars expenditures by institutions.

It shows a levelling off in spending following the booming sixties, with

the ratio of resources going to higher education to total national resources,

as indicated by GNP, stabilizing at .022 in the l970s.

     From the data in the table it appears that the levelling in demand for

higher education produced a parallel levelling in resources going to the

sector. With the number of PhDs increasing in the early part of the period,

the slackened growth in faculty employment shown in Table 10 had a devas-

tating effect on the position of new doctorates and on the age structure of

the faculty. Table 11 shows a huge increase in the proportion of new PhDs

t!seeking appointments" but having no specific prospects over the period,

with it should be noted significant differences across fields. Table 12

shows a notable "aging" in the faculty.

     We conclude that there were significant quantitative adjustments to the

seventies labor market changes, which took the form of slackened growth in

numbers of institutions, culty, and real resource usage. The quantitative

adjustments fell most severely on young academics.

Adjustments in price

     In addition to the quantity adjustments to change in the academic

market, there were noticeable changes in prices, both on the output and

input sides of the market. As we saw in table 3, the constant

dollar tuition and fees, and room and board, and also receipts by

colleges and universities per student (net of scholarship support)

declined after 1974 to levels in most cases below those at the

beginning of the seventies decade. Relative to the family income of the

parents of likely students, the drop is even more marked. Despite all of

the hullabaloo about increasing costs of higher education, and difficulties

of financing higher education the evidence shows the opposite: in a period

of slackening demand, the price of the "output" fell, as would be expected

in a reasonably functioning economic market. Complaints about the cost of

education are probably due to the rise in cost relative to the falling

economic advantage of college training.

     Given the inelastic demand for higher education with respect to tuition,

the reduced tuition changes presumably had only a modest effect on

enrollments and thus tended to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the financial

problems of higher, education.

     Table 13 turns to the price of the principal input specific to higher

education, faculty. It shows a sizeable drop in the real compensation of

faculty in the period, which translates into an even larger decline in the

income of academics relative to other workers. Econometric calculations which

relate salaries to enrollments, numbers of PhDs and the like suggest that

much of the salary responsive reflects the impact of the numbers of PhDs

seeking work relative to enrollments on the salaries.

     We conclude that the changed demand for higher education due to the

changing labor market had sizeable price as well as quantity impacts.




Other adjustments

     In addition to the classic price and quantity adjustments, colleges and

universities sought to adjust to the slackened growth through marketing their

product. In efforts to attract more "paying customers" many colleges took

to advertising in newspapers and magazines, altering curriculum to appeal to

adults, changing their curriculum. I described these efforts in The Overeducated

American as follows:

     "Cazenovia College in upstate New York, for instance, staked its future

in such career—oriented areas as fashion design, and museum studies. "We'll

be involved in a long—term guessing game, trying to keep one jump ahead of

the competition in guessing on the careers students will be prusuing. We're

no longer in the position of telling students what the requirements are if they

want a Cazenovie degree. Now we say:     'You tell us what you want, and we'll

provide it." Other campuses, ranging from Brigham Young University (Utah)

to Oklahoma City University to Massachusetts State College at Boston, began

experimenting with new technologies of education. With federal support,

these schools sought to redefine the goals of liberal education in terms of

practical "marketable" skills, often patterned after the training that companies

provide for executives. Even graduate schools and professional academic asso-

ciations, particularly in history and English, began to consider "what we

might teach master's and PhD's that will be valuable in business employment."

     "Various other recruiting techniques were resorted to. Testing organizations,

such as the College Entrance Examination Board, have sold names and addresses
                                  —40—


to college administrators who used them to solicit applicants. The Riverside

campus of the University of California sent out 12,000 oversized decks of

playing cards carrying campus facts on the back. Some colleges pressure

prospective students with the type of hard sell once associated only with

profit—making proprietary schools or business colleges——mailing out slick

brochures, conducting telephone canvasses, and giving out such gimmicks as

free T—shirts, bumper stickers, and so on. In some cases, public relations

firms have been hired to take over the whole admissions operation, receiving

substantial fees for recruiting. While apparently still rare, the tactic

of bounty hunting——for which proprietary schools have earned much opprobrium——

has appeared, with recruiters paid on the basis of the number of students

"deliveredtt. The job of admissions officers, particularly at weaker institu-

tions, is no longer to weed out unsuitable applicants but to find warm bodies.t'


     Since then, newspaper stories indicate that market efforts have if anything

been expanded, referring to the torrent of direct—mail advertising, marketing

and recruiting in college admissions. Among recent efforts are:

    —preparation of elaborate filmstrips and television tapes;

    —college fairs, which function like trade shows;

    —ads in newspapers and on radio;

    —direct mailing, with the College Board selling names at 12 cents a name

     plus a $100 fixed fee.

Indicative of the pattern, a new quarterly magazine, The Higher Education

Marketing Journal, was instituted to provide information on how best to

expand the market.

    Despite all the marketing efforts, however, from the aggregate data

they appear to have had at most a slight effect on demand for higher education.
                                  —41—



In the face of the economic reality of a declining return it's difficult

to see how such efforts     can have more than a marginal impact, though

particular schools may of course benefit greatly.


Suimnaryof Section II

     In this section I have documented that in response to changes in the

demands for higher education induced largely by the changing job market for

college—trained workers the higher educational system has undergone several

fundamental changes: resources employed have levelled off, tuition and

faculty salaries have fallen and efforts to expand the market have been made.

These adjustments are comparable to those one might expect in other less

idiosyncratic markets facing a change in product demand.
                                     —42—


                                     III    Conclusion

     We have seen in preceeding sections that the college job market underwent

extensive change in the 1970s and that those changes induced significant

adjustment on the part of higher educational institutions. How likely is

it that the market for college workers will remain depressed? What is the

likely future for higher education? Can the way in which the higher educational

system responds to the changes in the market for its output be improved? This

section addresses these questions.

     First, with respect to the future of the job market for college graduates,

my forecasts, and those of others, suggest that the market will indeed rebound

toward the end of the 1980s, due in large part to the reduced supply of new gracuates

resulting from a fall in the size of the youth population. While a smaller

number of young persons will improve the economic stiuation of young graduates,

it will have quite different effects on the economics of colleges and uni-

versities. As Cartter warned years ago, the l980s will be a period of sub-

stantial difficulty for colleges and universities and for academic faculty.

     Because of the nature of the higher education market, there are reasons

to believe that current and potential future adjustments to the changes in

the market are far from optimal. First, as Breneman has noted, the "crazy—

quilt pattern of subsidies and costs't undoubtedly leads institutions, students,

and governmental decision—makers to make policies which, while possibly rational

in terms of the prices facing them, may very well be irrational in terms of the

true costs to the economy. A recent Brookings publication Public Policy and

Private Higher Education, has dealt with some of these issues, as they

impact on the position of private colleges and institutions versus public

colleges and institutions. A major cause of difficulty is governmental

support of higher education through institutional aid rather than through

aid to students. Institutional aid has the disadvantage of by—passing

"purchasers" of education. Another problem is the institutional rules which
                                   —43—


places the burden of adjustment on younger PhDs and faculty. While colleges

and universities are struggling to alter their employment practices to make

adjustments more balanced by age, their success thus far has been modest.

Third is the potential problem of excessive adjustments which overshoot the

socially optimal level of enrollment and degrees. In the area of teacher

education, where the decline in enrollments and degrees was immense in

response to the poor market for school teachers, there are already reports

of potential shortages in the future.

     There are several alternative strategies or changes in modes of behavior

which institutions o higher education may fifld beneficial in the next decade.

     Colleges and universities might ameliorate some of the problems of

declining enrollments by linking liberal arts to vocational non—academic

training, such as for union crafts, possibly through new degree offerings

and operating procedures. By bringing together vocational nonacademic and

liberal arts programs, the opportunity for blue—collar workers to undertake

artistic and intellectual pursuits unrelated to their careers could be

enhanced.

     It may also be desirable to alter tuition charges to better reflect costs

of different educational programs. For example, graduate programs are often

subsidized by undergraudate tuitions, suggesting that graduate tuitions

are too low. Such changes will tend to limit graduate enrollments, an effect

that is not inconsistent with the anticipated lower demand for Ph.D.'s in

many areas. If such price changes are not possible, it may be desirable to

limit certain graduate programs even beyond the size determined by student

choice. University policies should be such that educational prices or allocation

decisions reflect true social costs, no matter who pays.
                                    —44—




     A third possibility is to reduce the amount of time required for studies,

by operating full—time during summer and vacation periods. The present 4

years needed for the bachelor's degree could be reduced, with considerable

saving of forgone income to students and at no serious loss of educational

quality. All else the same, the reduction in the time needed to obtain a

degree, from 4 to 3 years, would cost a student four summers of work at low

pay and gain him or her 1 year of work as a graduate at higher pay, raising

the economic value of college training. While in the past the desire for

summer leisure may have made a concentrated course of studies attractive to

only a few, in the changed market more students are likely to find this option

desirable. At the least, experiments in altering the time period of courses

and the operations of academia should be made to learn the best ways to

deal with the new market reality.

     Because the American higher educational system is, despite its flaws,

generally superior to that in the rest of the world, attention should be

given to the possible expansion of foreign student enrollments, particularly

from the newly rich oil countries and such developing countries as Brazil,

Mexico, and others, whose human resource demands are likely to outstrip the

capacity of domestic universities. Already, Venezuela has initiated a major

program to "export" thousands of students to the United States for higher

education. We have a comparative advantage in producing college training,

it could be "sold" overseas, taking up some of the slack in domestic student

enrollment.

     Yet another possibility is for institutions to cut out certain curriculum

and encourage greater student cross—enrollment at other schools which offer

particular curriculum.

     What is ultimately needed, however, for these or other adjustments to
                                  —45—



work best is some form of planning for the future market situation, presumably

in conjunction with the governmental bodies that subsidise so much of higher

education.

     One hopes that, given the sizeable governmental funds involved, an

effort will be made to develop economically rational plans for the next

decade and an effort made to use those funds to induce economically rational

decisions on the part of institutions.
