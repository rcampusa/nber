                  Unions and Job Security in the Public Sector



                                   ABSTRACT



     This study examines the effect of unions on job security in the public and

private sectors. Despite much lower unemployment rates for public than private

sector workers, once one controls for differences in worker and job

characteristics, the odds of being unemployed are identical for nonunion workers

in the public and private sectors. The picture is quite different for union

workers, who face greater odds of becoming unemployed than nonunion workers in

private sector jobs but much lower chances of becoming unemployed in the public

sector. The ability of unions to reduce layoff and unemployment rates in the

public sector seems attributable to the political power to prevent budget cuts

and the absence of Unemployment Insurance subsidies or supplemental unemployment

benefits.

I.   Introduction

     The question of how public sector employers adjust employment in periods

of declining demand would not have been considered a serious issue until the last

half of the 1970s. Employment at both the state and local levels grew at such a

rapid and sustained pace before then that this issue arose only in a few isolated

cases. This all changed with the 1974-75 recession and the widespread adoption of

tax and expenditure limitations such as Proposition 13 in California. Since 1975,

government employment has declined as a share of total employment, and since 1980

it has stayed about constant in absolute terms. As a result, many governments

have been forced to make hard decisions about how to trim their payrolls.

     This paper examines how public sector unions have been able to influence

these decisions. Studies by Medoff (1979) and Blau and Kahn (1983) on the

impact of unions on labor market adjustment in the private sector have found

much higher temporary and indefinite layoff rates for union than for nonunion

workers. There is mixed evidence on how unions affect permanent layoff

rates. Freeman and Medoff (1984) report that permanent layoff rates calculated

for 3-digit manufacturing industries between 1958 and 1971 and in 1981 show no

difference between industries that are predominantly unionized and those that

are not, but they also show that the May 1973-75 and 1977 Current Population

Surveys (CPS) for manufacturing workers indicate lower permanent layoff rates for

union members. Blau and Kahn find higher permanent layoff rates for union than

nonunion workers in manufacturing in the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS)

younger male cohort, but no union-nonunion difference for manufacturing workers

in the NLS older male cohort. When they expand these samples to include all
  2


sectors except construction, they find unionism has no effect on the probability

of permanent layoff for either younger or older males.

      Section II compares the postwar trend in unemployment rates for private

and public sector workers and reports the first estimates of layoff rates for

public sector workers. These results show that although there has been some

convergence of the unemployment rates of these two groups, the odds of being on

layoff remain much lower in the public sector. Among public sector workers,

layoff probabilities are considerably lower for union members, a marked contrast

to the pattern of higher layoff rates under unionism in the private sector.

      Sections III and IV compare both the theoretical and institutional factors

that influence employment adjustment decisions in the public and private sector

and point out how the impact of unionism is likely to vary between the two

sectors. The May 1973-75 and 1983 Current Population Surveys and the 1976-82

Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID) are used in Sections V and VI to estimate

public-private and union-nonunion differences in unemployment and layoff prob-

abilities. Section VII examines the impact of public sector unions on Unemploy-

ment Insurance (UI) coverage for state and local government employees before such

coverage became universal and estimates the impact of that coverage on

unemployment probabilities. The main results, summarized in Section VIII,

are: (1) unions reduce by a substantial amount the already low layoff and

unemployment probabilities in the public sector in contrast to those in the

private sector, where layoff rates are much higher under unionism, and (2)

nonunion public sector workers have temporary layoff rates and overall

unemployment probabilities comparable to those of nonunion private sector

workers.

II. Public Sector Layoff and Unemployment Rates

       Unemployment rates for all civilian workers and for government workers are

presented in Figure 1. Both series exhibit a rising trend over time, a reflection

of well known structural changes in the labor market. What is less apparent

in Figure 1, but can be shown easily in a simple regression equation, is that the

gap between these two unemployment rates has narrowed throughout this period. Let

UGOV     unemployment rate for government workers, UTOT = unemployment rate for

nonagricultural private wage and salary workers, and T =   time   trend (1 for 1948,

        38 for 1985). These variables were used to estimate the following equation:



            UGOV = 1.373 รท 0.086*UTOT - 0.027*T + 0.0117*T*UTOT    R2=.854
                  (0.528) (0.095)      (0.024)   (0.0037)



This equation shows that for a given national unemployment rate, the unemployment

rate for government workers was considerably higher in the later part of the

sample period. For a civilian unemployment rate of 6 percent, this model predicts

that the government unemployment rate for 1948 would be 1.9 percent, but in 1985

it would be 3.5 percent. In other words, controlling for the overall state of the

labor market, unemployment of government workers is almost twice as high today as

in the late 1940s.

       Mean layoff rates for public and private sector workers from the 1973-84

May CPS are reported in Table 1. These layoff statistics represent the share of

the labor force unemployed in the survey week because of a layoff. They are not

at all comparable to the layoff rates that used to be published by the Bureau of

Labor Statistics (BLS), which reported the fraction of workers (instead of the

labor force) laid off in a particular month (rather than all previous

months). The sample is restricted to the May surveys because of the availability
   4

 of data on union status in that month and the computational burden of using all

 of the monthly tapes over a 12-year interval. One problem with using the May

 survey for estimating public sector layoff rates is that educational employees

 are unlikely to be on layoff in that month. To adjust for this bias, separate

 estimates are reported for the public sector, with schools, colleges, and

 universities excluded from the sample.

       Temporary layoffs are those with recall within less than thirty days,

whereas indefinite layoffs are those with recall within thirty days or more or

those with no definite recall date. Because of the very small number of public

sector workers experiencing either of these types of layoffs, the sum of these

two layoff rates is reported in Table 1. Both are distinguished from permanent

layoffs by the expectation of recall. The permanent layoff rate is the fraction

of the experienced labor force consisting of unemployed workers who said they

started looking for work because they had lost their previous job.

       Average temporary and indefinite layoff probabilities in May for 1973

through 1984 are about four times greater in the private than in the public

sector. Between 0.6 and 2.4 percent of the experienced labor force in the private

sector was on temporary or indefinite layoff during those years. The corre-

sponding layoff probabilities for the public sector are not only much lower, but

also their range is much narrower--between 0.2 and 0.5 percent for all public

sector employees and between 0.2 and 0.6 percent for public sector employees

excluding education. Although the time period under consideration is quite

narrow, the patterns for 1975-76, 1980-81, and 1982-83 indicate that the peak in

layoff rates for the public sector lags that for the private sector by one

year. There is no evidence that the ratio of the public to the private temporary

and indefinite layoff rate has changed between 1973 and 1984.
                                                                                  5

     Permanent layoff rates also are much greater in the private sector, but

the relative gap between public and private permanent layoff rates seems to have

narrowed in recent years. Between 1973 and 1977, permanent layoff rates were

about three times larger in the private sector than in the public sector (two and

a half times larger when education is excluded from the public sector). This gap

has narrowed to about two and a half times larger between 1978 and 1984 (two

times larger when education is excluded from the public sector), This narrowing

is largely attributable to upward drift in the permanent layoff rate in the

public sector. The layoff rate for all public sector employees was 0.5 percent in

1973 and 1974 but never fell below 0.8 percent in later years. The pattern is

more pronounced when education is excluded; the layoff rate was 0.7 and 0.6

percent in 1973 and 1974 but never fell below 1.1 percent thereafter.

     Starting in 1982, the CPS public use tapes identify public sector workers

by level of government, which allows separate layoff rates to be computed for

federal, state, and local employees (see Table 2). There is very little

difference in the average temporary and indefinite layoff rates among these three

groups over this period. Permanent layoff rates are slightly higher for federal

and local than for state employees in 1982 and 1983, and are much higher for

federal than for state and local employees in 1984. The pattern for 1984

apparently reflects the continued pressure for nonmilitary cuts in the federal

budget.

     Even though the average public employee is subject to a very low layoff

risk, this may be attributable to differences in the type of work between the

public and the private sector. To determine whether any public sector workers are

subject to layoff risks comparable to those for the average private sector

worker, layoff rates for public and private sector employees are reported for
  6

selected industries in Table 3. Because of small samples in individual years, the

data are summarized in three-year groups.

      These results show that the risk of temporary or indefinite layoff is

greatest for public sector jobs in construction, utilities, and federal and

state public administration. However, these layoff rates are almost always far

below those for the average private sector worker in Table 1. The only exceptions

to this general trend are employees in state public administration in 1976-78 and

in urban transit in 1982-84. The odds of temporary or indefinite layoffs are

practically zero in education and the postal service. Permanent layoffs in the

public sector are most likely to occur in construction, utilities, and local

public administration. Except for construction, these layoff rates are also well

below those in the private sector in Table 1.

      The public-private comparisons within particular industry groups for

temporary and indefinite layoffs in Table 3 show that layoff rates are roughly

equal in the public and private sectors in transportation, utilities, hospitals,

and education, but that private sector layoff rates are much higher in construc-

tion. The patterns for permanent layoffs are quite different. Although the

private sector has higher permanent layoff rates in construction, transportation,

and elementary and secondary schools, the public sector has higher permanent

layoff rates in utilities and hospitals. These patterns suggest that careful

controls for industry characteristics will be needed to estimate accurately

the difference in layoff and unemployment probabilities between the public and

private sectors.

      Comparisons of mean layoff rates for union and nonunion workers in the

public and private sectors are reported in Table 4. These can be computed only

for 1973-1975 and 1977 because in all other years unemployed workers were not
                                                                                 7

asked about union membership. Within the public sector, temporary and indefi-

nite layoff probabilities are slightly lower (0.1 percentage points) for union

workers. The average gap in permanent layoff rates is also rather small in

three out of the four years. However, the exception to this overall tendency is

a very important one. In 1975, at the trough of a severe recession, the permanent

layoff rate for nonunion public employees was twice as large (1.4 percent) as

that for union workers (0.7 percent). This suggests that when the pressure for

layoffs is greatest, union workers in the public sector have a much better chance

of keeping their jobs than nonunion public employees. The exact opposite pattern

is observed in the private sector, where union members have considerably higher

layoff rates than nonunion workers.

     Further evidence on differences in unemployment and layoff rates between

the public and private sectors for 1976 to 1981 from the PSID is reported in

Table 5. Separate rates are reported for heads of households and wives. In both

samples the percentage of respondents experiencing unemployment during a

particular year as well as the percentage who lost their last job because of a

permanent layoff (including plant closings and dismissals) are much higher in the

private than the public sector. Because of the considerably smaller sample

sizes and the shorter time period for which data are available, it is very

difficult to spot any convergence of private and public unemployment or layoff

rates in the PSID.



III. Unions and Public Sector Layoffs: Theory

     Demand shocks are likely to differ between the public and private sectors

because of differences in technology and consumer characteristics. For instance,

labor demand in agriculture and construction fluctuates a great deal over the
  8

course of a year because of the dictates of seasons and weather, whereas except

for elementary and secondary education, public sector labor demand Consists of

services provided throughout the year. Demand for public services is also

relatively insensitive to conditions in credit markets, in contrast to some

goods produced in the private sector, such as construction and durable

manufactures. These arguments indicate that there will be less seasonal and

cyclical variability in demand for public than for private goods, which will

result in lower layoff rates in the public sector, other things equal.

      Even if public and private employers had to deal with the same labor

demand shocks, there are still a number of reasons to expect them to have

different layoff rates. Two obvious factors are purely technological - -   public
services cannot be produced for inventory in periods of slack demand and they are

very labor intensive. As a result, cuts in government budgets almost always

require some cuts in payroll.

      These cuts must be obtained by some combination of reduced wages, reduced

hours, or reduced employment. Most government jobs are at the state and local

levels, where wage studies such as Smith (1977) and Freeman (1985) tend to find

rates equal to those in the private sector. In such a situation wage cuts would

produce savings in the short run but would eventually result in higher turnover

and excessive recruiting, hiring, and training costs. Wage cuts in federal jobs

would be less likely to create these problems, as all studies have found those

rates to be well above those paid in comparable private sector jobs. The tradeoff

between hours and employment cuts will be heavily influenced by the attractive

fringe benefit packages offered by most public sector employers and the

relatively small amount of specific on-the-job training in many government jobs,
                                                                                  9

especially in education. Both of these factors will make it more economical to

use layoffs instead of hours reductions in many public sector jobs.

     This assumes, however, that all downward shifts in demand are actually

translated into budget cuts. Throughout the 1970s state and local governments

were highly successful in obtaining federal aid under various guises (revenue

sharing, CETA) to maintain programs that would have been terminated other-

wise. On various occasions local governments also have received fiscal infu-

sions from state governments. This avenue of revenue enhancement is not available

to the federal government, but it does not have to meet the balanced budget

constraint that most state and local governments face. All of these examples

illustrate how governments can find substitutes for tax revenue (some of which

are automatically tied to local unemployment rates and thus indirectly tied

to the revenue of state and local governments) to maintain their budgets and

thereby avoid layoffs.

     Freeman (1985) has shown that public sector employment has less year-to-

year variability than private sector employment. His study, along with the

results on mean layoff rates in Table 1, also suggests that the cyclical pattern

in public sector employment lags that observed for private sector employment.

     These patterns probably result from differences in sources of revenue

between the public and private sectors. Much of the revenue of state and local

governments comes from sources well insulated from cyclical behavior, such as

property taxes and intergovernmental grants. (Fluctuations in revenue would

arise mainly from income and sales taxes, which would vary with output and sales

in a particular state, county, or city.) This dampens the impact of any shock.

     Lags in making- adjustments to any given shock result from the political

process, If these lags are long enough, managers in the public sector have more
   10

 time to plan their manpower responses to declines in demand. This allows them to

make greater use of hiring freezes, which allow them to reduce their adjustment

costs by (1) avoiding hiring persons who will later have to be laid off and (2)

using attrition to reduce the number of employees, thereby avoiding the costs of

layoffs (severance pay, unemployment benefits, reputation). An adequate planning

horizon is absolutely essential for hiring freezes to be a very useful adjustment

device. The incentive to use hiring freezes and attrition in the public sector in

place of layoffs will be offset to some extent by low rates of voluntary

turnover, which result in smaller reductions in employment levels through

attrition than in the private sector.

        It would be inappropriate to discuss public-private differences in layoff

probabilities and completely ignore Unemployment Insurance (UI). Today almost

all private and government employees are covered by UI, so differences in

coverage are not likely to create differences in employee preferences for layoffs

relative to other adjustment devices. The low unemployment rates in the public

sector make it quite unlikely that any group of public sector workers will

collectively receive more in benefits than they spend on payroll taxes. In fact,

many governments finance UI benefits for their workers through direct reimburse-

ment rather than using payroll tax contributions. Thus, UI will encourage layoffs

to a lesser degree in the public than the private sector.

        The above discussion indicates that the factors likely to influence layoff

decisions in the public sector are quite distinct from those in the private

sector. In the absence of collective bargaining, no unambiguous predictions can

be made about how layoff and unemployment rates are likely to vary between the

public and private sectors.
                                                                                 11

     Under collective bargaining median voter models predict that in both the

public and private sectors, greater weight will be given to the preferences of

older, less mobile workers in the determination of personnel policies. Except

in cases of drastic declines in demand, these workers will prefer a policy of

layoffs based on seniority. Such a policy completely insulates them from any

cutbacks in wages or hours that might otherwise be required.

     Another factor behind the preference of unions in the private sector for

seniority-based layoffs is the union-nonunion differential in UI subsidies. This

is not likely to be important in the public sector because, as noted above, the

financing mechanisms and low layoff rates result in effective self-insurance.

Furthermore, supplemental unemployment benefits are rarely provided in union

contracts in the public sector. These two factors suggest that the union-

nonunion gap in layoff rates should at least be smaller in the public than the

private sector.

     In addition, there are unique aspects of unionism in the public sector

that could result in lower layoff rates for union workers in that sector.

Freeman (1986) argues that public sector unions have the ability to shift the

demand curve for their services through political activity. Public sector union

members represent a significant part of the electorate in many state and local

elections. This allows them to use both political power and bargaining power to

push for higher wages and membership. In addition the utility function of

public sector unions will put a higher weight on membership because additional

members give them even more political leverage. Whether public sector unions are

actually successful in obtaining higher wages and employment is an empirical

question, however, because they can also serve as a lightning rod for attracting

political opposition to the higher taxes required to fund higher payrolls.
  12

       This political dimension of union behavior in the public sector is likely

to influence layoffs through two different channels. First, the observed lag of

employment in the public sector suggests that unions as well as managers have the

opportunity to plan strategies for avoiding layoffs. This can be done in a

variety of different ways, such as moderation in wage negotiations or political

pressure within the appropriate government body to keep its payrolls

intact. Second, public sector unions at the local and state levels can also push

for additional revenue from higher levels of government as a substitute for any

drop in local or state tax revenues. For instance, in Congress public sector

unions have been strong supporters of CETA which, under Titles I, II, and VI

granted sizable sums for public employment programs. These programs prevented a

number of cities from having to lay off municipal employees.

       On balance, the effect of unions on layoffs in the public sector cannot be

predicted      ante. Although the most senior workers would prefer a system of

layoffs based on seniority if payroll cuts are required, the potential politi-

cal power of unions may enable them to prevent such cuts from taking place or

make them considerably smaller than they would have been in the absence of

collective bargaining.



IV. Unions and Public Sector Layoffs: Institutions

       Rules and procedures governing layoffs in the nonunion segment of the

public sector, if they exist at all, are determined by legislation or

regulation. There has been only one study to my knowledge of layoff policies in

the public sector. A survey of state governments done by the Bureau of National

Affairs (1982a) found that twenty states based layoffs primarily or solely on

seniority, twenty-four have policies that take both seniority and performance
                                                                                13

into account, and six states have no laws or policies on layoffs. Even in states

in which layoffs are based on both seniority and performance, managers sometimes

do not have much discretion in deciding who is to be laid off. For instance, in

Utah layoffs are based on the sum of the employee's rankings with respect to

previous performance evaluations and seniority. In many cases veterans are given

special preference in layoff or recall procedures.

     During the 1981-82 recession a number of states revised their layoff

procedures to ensure that recent gains in hiring women and minorities were not

eradicated by "last hired, first fired" policies. Bureau of National Affairs

(1982b) identified five states in which state agencies were required to maintain

a percentage of women and minorities after a layoff equal to that in the agency

prior to the layoff. In many other cases, managers were instructed to take

affirmative action into consideration along with other criteria in deciding which

persons were to be laid off and which were to be recalled.

     Under collective bargaining in the private sector, procedures for layoffs

are almost always specified in the union contract. Freeman and Medoff report that

seniority is the most important factor in determining who gets laid off in about

80 percent of all contracts. Five different studies by BLS of contract provisions

between 1970 and 1975 indicate that these practices were not as widespread in the

public sector. The percentage of employees covered by agreements containing

various layoff-related provisions in these studies is reported in Table 6. Most

of the municipal agreements in cities with populations of 250,000 and over in

1970 contained no provisions regarding layoffs. This can be attributed to a

combination of three factors: (1) the recentness of most collective bargaining

relationships in that period, (2) layoff procedures already specified by

ordinances or civil service regulations that in many cases were presumably based
  14

at least in part on seniority, and (3) the rapid growth in municipal employment

that had taken place in preceding years. Given these three factors, most unions

at that time apparently placed little priority on bargaining over layoff and

recall provisions. Collaborating evidence for the BLS studies is found in

Eberts's (forthcoming) study of over 500 New York school districts in the

mid-l970's --   only   20 percent of public school teachers were covered by RIF

provisions.

       Even five years later, the share of union contracts containing layoff and

recall provisions in the public sector, although much higher than before, was

still much smaller than that in the private sector. Only 65 percent of the

contracts during this period contained language pertaining to layoffs and only 35

percent specified recall rights. Both figures are considerably higher than their

counterparts in 1970, which no doubt reflects the decline in the fiscal health

of many cities over this period as well as increased experience with how layoffs

are conducted under civil service rules. Perry's (1979) case study of nine school

systems also points out a trend toward a greater percentage of union contracts

containing layoff provisions. He found that in 1967 contractual provisions

regarding layoffs were "virtually nonexistent." Ten years later, the contracts in

eight of the nine districts contained language regarding layoffs.

       Even if union contracts in the public sector are still less likely to

address layoff issues than contracts in the private sector, it seems safe to

conclude that much greater weight is given to seniority in determining layoffs in

governments with collective bargaining agreements than in those without

collective bargaining. There is also evidence that contract provisions do affect

layoff decisions in the public sector. Eberts shows that RIF provisions are
                                                                                15

correlated with much lower separation rates for teachers in school districts with

declining enrollment, especially for teachers with more than nine years of

experience.

     Layoff provisions are far from the only mechanism that public sector

unions have to influence government behavior. Levine, Rubin, and Wolohojian

(1981) discuss a case in Oakland where the firefighters union used binding

arbitration to reverse a city council decision to eliminate 26 positions in

1975. In other cases unions have exerted political pressure to prevent

cutbacks. For instance, in 1976 the police and firefighters unions in Cincinnati

petitioned for a referendum to freeze staffing at current levels (the petition

did not pass). To protest the proposed transfer of a state-managed hospital in

Pennsylvania, Wilburn and Worman (1980) report that five unions successfully

joined forces to exert pressure, including radio, newspaper, and television

advertisements telling residents in the area where the hospital was located that

it was vital to their welfare.

     A final factor that may be important in some of the period under study

here is the endogeneity of UI coverage for many state and local employees before

December 1974. Before 1972, when state employees in hospitals and higher

education were brought into the system, relatively few state and local public

sector employees were covered by UI. Some states had voluntarily decided to

cover their own employees and a few even had laws requiring all local employees

to participate. Title II of the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of

1974 (PL 93-567) brought almost all state and local workers into the

system. Although this program was supposedly a temporary measure prompted by the

1974-75 recession, the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 made these

changes permanent. Before these federal statutes were enacted, however, the
   16


 political power of public sector unions is likely to increase the odds of UI

 coverage in areas that were heavily unionized. This presumably would result in

 somewhat higher layoff rates, other things equal. This issue will be examined

more closely in Section VII.



V. Evidence from the Current Population Survey

        To identify the separate effects of unionism and public sector status on

layoff probabilities, two specifications were estimated over the May 1973-75

CPS. The first includes separate dummies for union and public sector status; the

second adds a union-public sector interaction term. The extremely large sample

size precludes estimation of probit equations. OLS results for the entire sample

are reported in Table 7; probit results for the second specification for one-

fourth of the sample, randomly selected, appear in Table 7A. Temporary layoff

equations could not be estimated for the random sample because none of the public

sector workers in the smaller sample were on temporary layoff.

A. Public-Private Comparisons. How do layoff rates for public and private

sector workers compare? Once controls for union status and other job and

personal characteristics are included, are the layoff probabilities for public

sector workers still very small relative to those of private sector employees?

The answers from the first specification largely reaffirm the results from Table

1. For all three types of layoffs under consideration, the OLS results indicate

that layoff rates are much lower in the public sector: 0.1 percentage points

lower for temporary layoffs, 0.4 percentage points lower for indefinite layoffs,

and 0.7 percentage points lower for permanent layoffs.

        The second model allows these comparisons to be made separately for union

and nonunion workers. The results show that, except for permanent layoffs, the
                                                                                 17

public-private difference in layoff rates for nonunion workers is much smaller

than the public-private difference for union and nonunion workers combined.

There is no public-private difference in temporary layoffs for nonunion workers.

The public-private difference in indefinite layoffs is much smaller for nonunion

workers than for union and nonunion workers combined.

     Events initiating spells of unemployment for the experienced labor force

include not only layoffs, but also quits and labor force re-entries. To get a

complete picture of how job security compares in the public and private sectors,

quits and labor force re-entries should also be examined, especially the latter.

Previous research by Clark and Summers (1979), among others, shows frequent

transitions between the states of unemployment and out of the labor force. These

transitions have raised the question of whether being unemployed is behaviorally

distinct from being out of the labor force, as many transitions could arise from

measurement error or temporary cessation of job search. There is a clear

possibility that many of the persons who are classified as labor force

re-entrants were laid off before the survey period. If so, then ignoring labor

force re-entrants may result in a biased comparison of public and private sector

job security.

     The drawback with using the information on labor force re-entry is the

difficulty in interpreting the results. It is impossible to distinguish between

persons who left their last jobs voluntarily and those who were laid off.

Despite the problems with interpretation of labor force re-entrant behavior, the

empirical results should provide a more complete picture of relative job

stability in the public and private sectors. The impact of union and public

sector status on unemployment attributable to labor force re-entry, along with
  18

unemployment resulting from quits and total unemployment regardless of source is

reported in the last three rows of Tables 7 and 7A.

       In both models workers whose last job was in the public sector are much

more likely to be unemployed labor force re-entrants than workers whose last job

was in the private sector. The results for the second model show that this

relationship holds for nonunion, but not union, public sector workers. Nonunion

public sector workers are 0.7 percent more likely than nonunion private sector

workers and 0.8 percent more likely than union private sector workers to be

unemployed force re-entrants. These results, although difficult to interpret,

suggest that the lower permanent layoff rates observed in the public sector may

not tell the entire story about job security in the public sector. One of two

things is certain: either the public-private difference in layoff rates for

nonunion workers is overstated in Tables 7 and 7A or unemployment resulting from

voluntary turnover is higher in the public sector for nonunion workers.

       In contrast to other studies (e.g., Long (1982)) that have found lower

voluntary turnover in the public sector, the odds that a person will quit his

last job to search for a new job are no lower for public than for private sector

workers. The discrepancy between this finding and those of earlier studies is

probably attributable to the narrowness of the turnover variable in the CPS,

which does not report quits unless they are followed by a spell of unemployment.

       Further evidence on quits from the PSID is reported in Table 8. (Details

on how the data set was constructed are reported in the next section.) These

results show that quit rates for heads of households are lower in the public than

private sector. In the model, which allows the public sector coefficient to vary

for union and nonunion workers, quit probabilities in the public sector are 2.1

percent lower for nonunion workers and 0.3 percent lower for union workers than
                                                                                  19

 for their counterparts in the private sector. The estimated public-private

differences for wives are very imprecise, indicating that there is no pronounced

quit differential for them. It is interesting to note that among both heads and

wives the impact of union status on quits is much smaller in the public sector.

     The key issue for interpreting the labor force re-entry results in Tables 7

and 7A is how quits accompanied by unemployment compare for union and nonunion

workers in the public sector. To examine this question, the dependent variable

was set equal to one if a person quit the job held a year ago and experienced

unemployment during the past year. These results, reported in the last two

columns of Table 8, show a slightly lower probability of quits followed by

unemployment for union than for nonunion workers in the public sector. This

implies that the results in the first three rows of Table 7 actually overstate

the public-private difference in layoff rates and that a large share of the

unemployed labor force re-entrants who left public sector jobs did not do so

voluntarily.

     The last row of Tables 7 and 7A compares the odds that public and private

sector workers will be unemployed for any reason. The first specification shows

unemployment rates are 0.9 percent lower in the public sector. This difference

narrows to a statistically insignificant 0.2 percent for the nonunion labor force

in the OLS results for the second specification. In the probit results, unemploy-

ment probabilities are the same in the public and private sectors for nonunion

workers. In other words, considering all possible causes of unemployment

together, nonunion public sector workers are just as likely to be unemployed as

nonunion private sector workers. The lower odds of permanent layoffs are offset

by the greater odds of being an unemployed labor force re-entrant.
  20

B. Public Sector Unions. In addition to the models in Tables 7 and 7A, another

way to compare the impact of unions on job security in the public and private

sectors is to estimate separate equations for each sector. The union coefficients

for each sector are reported in Table 9. Because of the great cost of estimating

probit equations (the results in Table 7A required 7995 seconds of CPU time), OLS

results are reported here.

       Whereas union members in the private sector are much more likely to be on

temporary or indefinite layoff than nonunion members, this does not seem to be

the case in the public sector. The coefficients imply slightly lower temporary

and indefinite layoff rates in the public sector for union members, but the

standard errors are sufficiently large to prevent rejection of the null

hypothesis of no union-nonunion difference.

       The impact of unionism on permanent layoffs also is completely different

in the public and private sectors. In the private sector, union members are just

as likely to be laid off permanently as nonunion workers. In the public sector,

permanent layoff rates are 0.4 percent lower for union than nonunion workers.

These results on layoffs imply that public sector unions have been much more

successful in promoting job security than their private sector counterparts.

       The evidence on unemployment due to quits and labor force re-entry as well

as the evidence for all types of unemployment combined is consistent with this

implication. Union members are less likely to become unemployed re-entrants in

both sectors, but the impact of unionism is greater in the public sector both in

proportional and absolute terms. Surprisingly, although union members in the

private sector are less likely to quit their jobs and become unemployed, there is

no union-nonunion difference in this type of quit behavior in the public sector.

Looking across all types of unemployment, the results in the last row of Table 9
                                                                                21

show that union members are 0.4 percent more likely than nonunion workers to

become unemployed in the private sector but 1.2 percent less likely in the

public sector.

C. Retrospective Evidence for 1982. Two key limitations of the results from

the 1973-75 CPS are that (1) during that period employment in the public sector

was still growing and (2) many union contracts did not contain layoff

provisions. Since then, government budgets have been squeezed by legislation to

limit taxes and expenditures as well as by a recession more severe than that in

1974-75. This would presumably give unions less political flexibility to maintain

public sector payrolls, while at the same time make union members more sensitive

to job security issues and in all likelihood increase the share of union

contracts containing rules on layoffs. As a result, one would have good reason to

question whether the results for 1973-75 are still pertinent today.

     These results cannot be replicated for more recent years because after

1977 the CPS stopped asking unemployed workers about union status at their

previous job. One alternative approach is to use the May 1983 CPS, which reports

union status for half the sample (instead of a quarter of the sample, as in

all other surveys since 1981) and matches these records with the March 1983 CPS,

which contains retrospective data on unemployment during 1982. At the cost of

restricting the sample to employed workers, union-nonunion differences in

unemployment during 1982 can be estimated for both the public and private

sectors.

     Unemployed persons in the May 1983 sample consist of those who either were

recalled to their old jobs or were successful in finding new jobs. Those who were

still jobless at the time of the survey are omitted from the sample. This should

be kept in mind when interpreting the results; they are not directly comparable
  22

to those reported from the 1973-75 CPS. Three different independent variables are

examined: a dummy equal to one if the respondent was unemployed during 1982,

spells of unemployment during 1982, and weeks of unemployment during 1982. Probit

equations were estimated for the dummy dependent variable; OLS was used for the

other dependent variables. The distinctions between union and nonunion as well as

private and public workers are based on the job held at the time of the

survey. (The models were also estimated over a data set in which these distinc-

tions were based on the longest job held in 1982. The results were basically the

same and are not reported here.)

       With regard to union-nonunion differences, the results in Table 10 are

comparable to those in the last line of Table 7. Considering all possible

causes of unemployment, there is no difference in the probability of unemploy-

ment in 1982 or spells of 1982 unemployment between union and nonunion workers in

the model without interaction between union and public sector status. When the

interaction is added to the model, the number of spells is slightly higher for

union than nonunion workers in the private sector, but there is no difference in

weeks of unemployment or unemployment probabilities for union and nonunion

workers in the private sector.

       The key result of a negative union impact on unemployment probability in

the public sector from the 1973-75 CPS continues to hold for the 1982 CPS. This

is demonstrated by the large negative interaction coefficients in Table 10 and by

the union coefficients for public sector workers in Table 11. Focusing on the

latter, the results show that public employees belonging to unions were 2.3

percent less likely to have been unemployed in 1982 than nonunion public

employees.
                                                                                 23

     The only finding from the 1973-75 CPS that does not carry over to the

more recent sample is that pertaining to public-private differences in unemploy-

ment probabilities for nonunion workers. Nonunion public employees were 4.4

percent less likely to have been unemployed in 1982 than nonunion private

employees. They also had significantly fewer spells and weeks of unemployment in

1982. This result is most likely attributable to either the restricted sample

in the May 1983 CPS or the lagged response of public sector layoffs to downturns

in economic activity documented in Table 1; it need not be inconsistent with

the findings in Table 7.

     Table 11 also reports separate union coefficients for federal, state, and

local workers. Although the union coefficient is slightly higher for federal

than for state or local workers, the difference is not significant.



VI. Evidence from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics

     The PSID has reported both union status and class of worker on a continuous

basis since 1976. The main advantages of exploring this data set are that it

spans the period between the two CPS samples and that it can be used to estimate

fixed effects models. A possible disadvantage is that the PSID sample consists of

households that have been continuously tracked for 14 years, and such households

are likely to be less than perfectly representative of the labor force.

     Two different indicators of job security are examined: (1) whether the

respondent is currently unemployed or was unemployed in the past year and (2)

whether the respondent lost his previous job because he was laid off or fired

or because his company closed (job losses for any of these reasons will be

referred to as layoffs below). Survey responses to these questions in year t+l

are regressed on independent variables for year t. As in the CPS, the sample is
  24

restricted to wage and salary workers. When using the PSID, the question always

arises as to whether observations from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity

(SEO) subsample should be included. In this case the coefficients are relatively

insensitive to composition of the sample, so observations from the SEO subsample

are included in the results reported below. Splitoff households formed during the

sample period and persons who were self-employed during any of the sample years

are deleted to facilitate data set management. Separate models are estimated for

heads of households (assumed by the PSID to be the male in two-earner households)

and wives.

       The PSID results for heads in Table 12 show that, just as in the CPS, the

odds of being unemployed are about the same for public and private sector workers

not covered by collective bargaining. In the model without any interaction

between union and public sector status, union employees have a 3.8 percent higher

probability of being unemployed; public sector employees, a 3.1 percent lower

probability. However, this model restricts the impact of unionism to be the same

in both the public and private sectors. When this restriction is removed by

adding a union-public sector interaction term, there is no longer any significant

difference between the odds of being unemployed in public and private sector jobs

for nonunion workers. Union workers in the private sector are 4.8 percent more

likely to have been unemployed than nonunion workers, but there is no difference

in unemployment probabilities in the public sector between union and nonunion

workers.

       Wives who are union members working in the private sector are 6.4 percent

more likely to experience unemployment than nonunion workers in that sector. In

the public sector, union members are 1.2 percent less likely to have been
                                                                                 25

unemployed than nonunion workers. Among nonunion workers there is once again no

significant public-private difference in unemployment probabilities.

     Unionism has little impact on the odds that a person in the PSID will lose

his job in either the public or private sector. The union and union-public

sector interaction coefficients are both not significantly different from zero,

in contrast to the CPS in which the interaction was negative. Household heads

working in the public sector are 2.1 percent less likely to lose their jobs

regardless of union status, but the odds of job loss for wives are equal in

the public and private sectors.

     The unemployment and job loss probability equations were also estimated

separately over samples of public and private sector employees, allowing for

complete interactions with all independent variables instead of union status

alone. These results, reported in Table 13, further accentuate the differential

impact of unionism on unemployment probabilities. Among household heads, union

members are 4.8 percent more likely to experience unemployment in the private

sector but 0.3 percent less likely in the public sector. The results for wives

are even more striking. They have a 5.7 percent higher unemployment probability

under unionism in the private sector but a 3.9 percent lower probability under

unionism in government jobs. Union status is uncorrelated with job loss probabil-

ities in either the public or private sector.

     The models reported in Table 12 were also estimated separately for male

and female heads, as well as for whites and nonwhites within both the heads and

wives samples. These results, available upon request, point to the same conclu-

sion as in Tables 11 and 12: union workers in the private sector have higher odds

of becoming unemployed than nonunion workers, but in government jobs unionism is

associated with equal or lower unemployment probabilities.
  26

       A final way to establish the robustness of this result over these samples

is to estimate a fixed effects model. Although it is now widely accepted that

such models are not a panacea for biases associated with unobserved heterogeneity

of workers who obtain jobs in the public and private sectors, it would be

difficult to be very confident in the findings in Table 12 if they were com-

pletely inconsistent with the results from a fixed effects specification. The

fixed effects results for heads (see Table 14) are quite similar in terms of the

signs of the coefficients to the results reported above. The decrease in the size

of the coefficients and the increase in the size of the standard errors is not

surprising in light of results obtained in other studies with fixed effects

estimators. However, in the wives sample, the coefficients actually tend to be

somewhat larger in the fixed effects results. There is no readily apparent

reason for this unusual result. Whatever the reason, it is quite clear, even in

the fixed effects results, that the impact of unionism on the odds of becoming

unemployed is quite different in the public and private sectors.



VII. Public Sector Unions and Unemployment Insurance

       Relatively few state and local government workers were covered by UI

until the beginning of 1972. In 1960 about 280,000 state and 53,000 local

government workers were covered by UI, almost all of them living in New York,

Connecticut, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon, and the District of

Columbia. In the fourth quarter of 1971, coverage had grown to almost 600,000

state and 220,000 local government employees, but it was still concentrated in

the same states as before, plus Washington and Hawaii. Despite the rapid growth

of public sector unionism during this period, there was virtually no change in

the coverage of public employees until the Employment Security Amendments of
                                                                                27

1970, which brought state employees in hospitals and higher education into the

system, became effective at the beginning of 1972. At roughly the same time Ohio,

Florida, Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Louisiana, and Oklahoma provided UI

coverage to most other state employees. Fourteen states took steps to cover

additional state and local government workers in 1972, 1973, and 1974. By the end

of 1974, 2.5 million state and 1.5 million local government employees were

covered. This represented about 75 percent of all state employees and less than

25 percent of all local employees.

     Almost all state and local workers were brought into the UI system by

Title II of the Emergency Jobs and Unemployment Assistance Act of 1974. This

program was instituted as a temporary measure to help deal with the fiscal

stress many state and local governments were facing at the time. Benefits for

state and local government workers were provided directly by the federal govern-

ment. Coverage of state and local government workers became permanent under the

Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, which became effective at the

beginning of 1978. Benefits are financed through either regular contributions to

the state fund or direct reimbursement.

     Before all state and local government workers were brought into the system,

coverage rates tended to be higher in states with large percentages of public

sector workers belonging to unions, as shown in Table 15. In a simple regression

of the percentage of local workers covered by UI on percentage of public sector

workers belonging to unions (federal, state, and local) over the 21 states that

can be identified in the May 1973-75 CPS, the union coefficient (S.E.) is 1.370

(0.584). The union coefficient in the same regression for coverage of state

workers was 0.528 (0.357).
  28

       On the surface these results suggest that union pressure was a significant

factor contributing to UI coverage in the public sector before 1974. However,

four of these twenty-one states had high coverage rates in 1960, well before

public sector bargaining was very widespread. If these four states are dropped

from the sample, the union coefficient (S.E.) drops to 0.319 (0.484) in the state

employee coverage rate equation and to 1.060 (0.656) in the local employee

coverage equation. Thus, it is not at all clear that public sector unions can

take the credit or the blame for the growth of UI coverage.

       Did the changes in coverage have a big effect on unemployment rates? This

can be tested over a sample of state and local public administration workers in

the May 1973-75 CPS residing in states or SMSAs that can be matched with data on

UI coverage rules and percentage covered by UI. During this period we observe

differences in coverage rates across states in 1973 and 1974 and differences in

coverage rates within some states between 1973-74 and 1975. Specifications

included either three regional dummies or a complete set of 38 state dummies and

were estimated for the entire 1973-75 sample as well as for a separate 1973-74

sample. All six unemployment measures used in the results reported in Tables 7

and 9 were examined as dependent variables.

       Of the forty-eight equations estimated, only one had a significant UI

coverage coefficient. A representative set of results using state dummies over

the 1973-75 sample is reported in Table 16. Unless public administration

employees are not representative of the work force in the public sector, these

results indicate that UI coverage did not contribute to unemployment, even in a

period when the federal government was paying some of the benefits. There are two

likely explanations. First, other federal programs including CETA provided
                                                                                 29

assistance to governments under fiscal stress and these programs may have made

layoffs unnecessary. Second, there was no UI subsidy in cases for which the

federal government was not paying the benefits.



VIII. Conclusion

     This paper has shown that despite the much lower observed unemployment

probabilities for workers in the public sector, once one controls for differences

in worker and job characteristics, the odds of being unemployed are identical in

the public and private sectors for nonunion workers in the May 1973-75 CPS and

the PSID. Even though public sector jobs are less subject to seasonal and

cyclical shocks and cyclical patterns lag those in the private sector, these

factors seem to be exactly offset by the inability to produce for inventory and

the labor intensity of the production process in the public sector. Although the

May 1983 CPS indicates lower unemployment probabilities for nonunion public

sector workers than for nonunion private sector workers, this could very well be

attributable to the restriction of the sample to employed persons or the lag of

public sector layoff rates behind those in the private sector. One important

implication of this result is that failure to account for differences in job

security is not likely to systematically bias the results of public-private pay

comparisons.

     This paper's other major conclusion is that the impact of unions on

unemployment and permanent layoff probabilities varies substantially between

private and government jobs. The odds of being unemployed are much higher under

unionism in the private sector, but they tend to be lower for union than nonunion

workers in the public sector. Previous studies have attributed the higher layoff

rates for union members in the private sector to the greater weight given to the
  30

preferences of older workers under unionism, as reflected by the widespread use

of layoffs by seniority in downturns, and larger benefits while unemployed (both

from UI and supplemental benefit plans). The adjustment process in the public

sector operates differently because the political power of public employee unions

can be used in many cases to prevent budget cuts, an optimal outcome for both

senior and junior employees. When cuts are necessary, the absence of any UI

subsidy or supplemental benefits makes layoffs a less attractive option for

members of public sector unions than other adjustment mechanisms such as wage

moderation.

Sources: Type of UI coverage and percentage covered by UI are from U.S.
          Congress (1976). Percentage union members for public sector employees
          residing in each state is calculated from the May 1973-75 CPS, using
          CPS sampling weights.
