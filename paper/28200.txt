                                         ABSTRACT

The extent to which K-12 schools should remain open is at the forefront of discussions on long-
term pandemic management. In this context, there has been little mention of the immediate
importance of K-12 schooling for the rest of the economy. Eliminating in-person schooling
reduces the amount of labour time parents of school-aged children have available to work, and
therefore reduces income to those workers and the economy as a whole. We discuss two
measures of economic importance, and how they can be modified to better reflect the vital role
played by K-12 education. The first is its size, as captured by the fraction of GDP that is
produced by that sector. The second is its centrality, reflecting how essential a sector is to the
network of economic activity. Using data from Canada's Census of Population and Symmetric
Input-Output Tables, we show how accounting for this role dramatically increases the importance
of K-12 schooling.

1       Introduction

A report released in the summer of 2020 by Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, in col-
laboration with a number of paediatric hospitals in Ontario, advocates for the safe return
of children and youth to school.1 The report emphasizes the importance of school re-
opening, highlighting the "significant adverse health and welfare consequences for children
and youth" stemming from the school closings of March 2020 in response to the COVID-
19 pandemic. Those adverse consequences include impediments to students' educational,
social-emotional, and physical development associated with remote learning, as compared
to in-person school attendance.2 The switch to home schooling has also had substantial
impacts on parents. A recent report by the Royal Society of Canada highlights how this
has exacerbated the detrimental effect of the pandemic on the mental health of Canadians.3
The report includes the recommendation that Provincial/Territorial governments should
"attempt to keep children in school and carefully weigh the cost/benefit ratio of closing
schools in the event of another wave of COVID-19."
    Another important consideration in deciding whether to keep schools open is the eco-
nomic implications of children not being in school, acting through its impact on parental
paid work. This is the focus of the current paper. Closing schools means that parents have
to take time off paid work or work from home. As many parents have experienced since
the onset of the pandemic, this has meant a reduction in the number of hours available
to work, reduced productivity while working, or both. This is in addition to the impact
that at-home education has had on "life at home" and the capacity of parents to nurture,
support, and mentor their children.
    In this context the K-12 education system fulfils a role that is crucial but seldom dis-
cussed: it frees up daytime hours during the work week of parents with school-aged children,
allowing them to supply labour to economic activity and earn income. Without in-person
K-12 schooling, it would be hard to imagine the modern work environment functioning as
it does.4

      These concerns have been echoed in provinces across Canada. In its public health guidance for K-12 ed-
ucation issued at the start of the September 2020 school year, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)
similarly stresses the importance of in-person learning, and the "significant hardship" from the suspension
of in-person learning--in terms of "impaired learning, increased child stress, and decreased connection" (See
COVID-19 Public Health Guidance for K-12 School Settings available at http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-
Info-Site/Documents/COVID public guidance/Guidance-k-12-schools.pdf). The Association of Paediatri-
cians of Quebec has also called attention to the impact of first-wave school closures on children's well-being,
and its interaction with existing inequalities in family resources--financial, psychological, and otherwise (See
https://pediatres.ca/covid-19/). These considerations are incorporated in a report prepared on behalf of
the Quebec Ministry of Health, to support health professionals advising parents on the return of children to
the school environment, https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/fichiers/2020/20-210-166W.pdf

      School-aged children cannot easily be left at home alone. For instance, Manitoba and New Brunswick
have legislated that children younger than 12 years of age cannot be left unsupervised, and Ontario's Child

    As Canada navigates its second-wave, decision makers are increasingly pressed to bal-
ance the public health and economic consequences of the pandemic. But standard measures
of the importance of various sectors to the functioning of the overall economy do not take
account of the role of the K-12 schooling system in enabling parents to work. The risk
is that without measures capturing that role, the economic importance of school opening
will be underestimated or, possibly, overlooked altogether. Any such omission would also
have distributional implications since the impacts of school closings are unequally felt--
disproportionately falling on lone parents and mothers in two-parent families, and not di-
rectly impacting singles or couples without school-aged children at home. Understanding all
aspects of the role played by K-12 schooling has correspondingly grown in importance--as
potential grounds for viral transmission, as a determinant of the health and well-being of
families and children, and as a sector that is crucial to the economy.
    In this paper, we describe and implement measures of the importance of the education
sector, and in-person K-12 schooling specifically, for economic activity. In Sections 2 and 3,
we consider the importance of the education sector as conventionally measured in economic
statistics, and contrast that with what occurs when we explicitly account for its role in
"freeing up" labour time of parents with school-aged children. We consider two distinct
measures of a sector's importance. The first is a measure of size : the fraction of national
income (GDP) that is attributable to the education sector. The second is a measure of
centrality : how essential the sector is in the functioning of other sectors of the economy.
Using either measure, accounting for the fact that in-person K-12 schooling makes it possible
for workers in all sectors to "go to work" dramatically increases the importance of the K-12
sector. This is detailed in Section 4, where we also provide measures of GDP loss if schools
were to close.



2    Two Measures of Importance

We begin by discussing the two measures of a sector's importance that form the basis
of our analysis: size and centrality. The many industries that constitute the Canadian
economy can be grouped into 20 broadly defined sectors, based on the goods and services
they produce. These can be further broken down to capture increasingly narrow sectors of
economic activity. This hierarchical structure is formalized by the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) 2017 Version 3.0. It identifies broader "sectors" using 2-digit
sector codes, and provides increasingly fine/disaggregated categories up to 6 digits. We focus
on 3-digit "subsectors"--of which there are approximately 100--but present some results
at the 2-digit level, and sometimes draw on distinctions reflected at the 4-digit "industry
group" level.
    The first measure of a sector's importance is its size, as captured by the fraction of
and Family Services Act states that a child under the age of 16 may not be left unattended "without making
provision for his or her supervision and care that is reasonable in the circumstances". The Canadian Red
Cross babysitting course has a minimum enrolment age of 11.



                                                    3
Canada's GDP that is produced by that sector. This information is drawn from the National
Economic Accounts and corresponds to the sector's contribution to the nation's income or
"value added".
    The second measure is less familiar and gauges a sector's essentiality, or centrality, in
the supply-chain of the economy. Whereas GDP captures the value of final goods, the
measure of centrality also reflects a sector's intermediary contribution to other parts of
the economy. To understand this, note that the economy is a network of activity, where
sectors are "nodes" that produce and trade intermediate output in the process of producing
final goods and services. The latter are ultimately destined to final demand, and recorded
in macroeconomic accounts as expenditures on consumption, investment, net exports, and
government spending (and not part of the network of intermediate good flows). The output
of some sectors is used more intensively as intermediate inputs than others. As a result, they
are more central to the economic network, since other sectors depend on them. Meanwhile,
"downstream" sectors are at the periphery of the network structure. They use intermediate
inputs from other sectors but produce largely for final demand, and are less central than
others.
    A simple example illustrates this concept. Consider the `Animal production' sector
(e.g. poultry farms), which we call sector A.5 This sector provides intermediate output to
`Food manufacturing' (sector B , e.g. chicken nugget factories), `Food and beverage stores'
(sector C , e.g. grocery stores), and `Food services and drinking places' (sector D, e.g.
restaurants). Sectors B and C supply to D, and C and D supply to Canadian consumers
(as final demand). For simplicity, sector D supplies only to final demand (i.e., it is not an
intermediate producer for other sectors of the economy). Here sector A has high centrality
as it supplies to all nodes in the supply-chain; on the other hand D has low centrality as it
is the outermost node in the production network.
    We measure centrality by Bonacich centrality, a concept from graph theory and sub-
sequently introduced to economics (see Bonacich (1987) and Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi
(2019)). A sector's Bonacich centrality is determined by how much of its output is used
in the production process of other sectors, and how much of those sectors' outputs are, in
turn, used by other sectors, and so on. The derivation of this measure and its theoretical
relationship to total expenditure/output shares is detailed in Appendix A. We use Bonacich
centrality primarily as a comparative, or ordinal, measure of the importance of "nodes" in
the production network. As such, we report the measure as an index on a 0­100 scale for
the sake of exposition, where 100 is the most central 3-digit subsector, and 0 indicates the
subsector is entirely non-central.
   Both the size and centrality measures are computed using the 2015 Canadian Symmetric
Input-Output Tables, compiled by Statistics Canada (StatCan) for the national economy.
The input-output tables provide information on intermediate input usage and total output
across subsectors, as well as sectoral labour income and value added. That is, for each 3-
   5
     Technically, in the North American Industry Classification System, Canada 2017 Version 3.0 (NAICS),
animal production is referred to as a "subsector". For now, we will refer to subsectors as sectors for short,
and will be more accurate in our reference to NAICS classifications in Sections 3 and 4.



                                                     4
digit subsector, it details how much of its production is used as inputs in other subsectors;
and conversely, which subsectors it obtains its inputs from.
    The size and centrality measures capture different aspects of a subsector's importance
to the economy. For instance, as displayed in Figure 1 below, the "Health care and social
assistance" sector is large in terms of its share of GDP; however, because the vast majority of
its output goes toward final demand, it is low in terms of centrality. By contrast, "Utilities"
is small in size but highly central because all sectors of the economy use electricity, gas,
sewer, and water as inputs.



3       Importance of Education

"Educational services" is classified both as a 2-digit sector (code 61) and a 3-digit subsector
(code 611) in the NAICS; that is, there is no other 3-digit subsector in the 2-digit education
sector. For our analysis, we further distinguish between K-12 schooling ("Elementary and
secondary schools", coded as 6111 at the 4-digit industry level) and other schooling services
(codes 6112 through 6117), such as universities or trade schools, and continue to refer to
them as subsectors for expositional convenience.6
    Educational services is not a large subsector of the economy, accounting for less than 6%
of national GDP (as shown in Figure 1, which we discuss in detail below). This contrasts
with the prominence it is given in public policy discourse. Economists believe standard mea-
sures of the economic contribution and importance of education, and hence K-12 schooling,
are understated. Fundamentally, this is because education generates positive externalities
to civil society that are poorly captured in national economic accounts. Such external or
"neighbourhood" effects are discussed, for example, in Friedman (1963):

        A stable and democratic society is impossible without widespread acceptance
        of some common set of values and without a minimum degree of literacy and
        knowledge on the part of most citizens. Education contributes to both. In
        consequence, the gain from the education of a child accrues not only to the
        child or to his parents but to other members of the society; the education of my
        child contributes to other people's welfare by promoting a stable and democratic
        society.

    K-12 education is an investment toward externalities to civil society in the distant future.
In addition, K-12 education is an investment toward human capital that makes workers in
all sectors more productive, also in the distant future. Neither impacts are captured in
contemporaneous national income accounts. Short term disruptions to schooling due to
COVID are unlikely to have large impacts on civil society. Whether these disruptions will
have serious impacts on human capital accumulation is more uncertain and will almost
    6
   As a point of reference, K-12 schools comprise approximately 54% of the education sector, with the
remainder being college, university, and miscellaneous/other educational services.


                                                 5
certainly be the focus of future studies. Since our results do not include these future effects,
they should be seen as a lower bound on the ultimate effect of school closings on the economy.
    At a more immediate level, the K-12 school system provides another essential service:
it allows parents/guardians of school-aged children to spend weekday hours as work hours
engaged in economic activity in all sectors of the economy. In what follows, we distinguish
between workers who have child care obligations that hamper their ability to work (workers-
needing-childcare, or WNC, hereafter, and defined more precisely below) from workers whose
ability to do paid work is likely unaffected by school closings.7 Without the K-12 system,
the modern work environment would not function as it does. For instance, workers-needing-
childcare account for 6.7% to 23.1% of hours worked in Canada, depending on the subsector
considered. The loss of in-person schooling effectively reduces labour input available to be
supplied in all sectors of the economy.
    In addition to the standard measures of importance discussed in Section 2, our goal is
to construct extended measures of size and centrality that account for this labour availing
effect. We first construct an alternative measure of size as follows:

       · For each 3-digit subsector, we obtain the proportion of employment income that is
         attributable to workers-needing-childcare from Canada's 2016 Census of Population.
         Our focus is on families with children aged 5 to 17 years old, classified in three cat-
         egories: lone-parent families; two-parent, one-earner families; and two-parent, two-
         earner families. All lone parents are treated as WNC, and we assume that their
         ability to work is dependent on in-person K-12 schooling. Conversely, neither parent
         in two-parent, one-earner families is treated as a WNC; in the case of school closure,
         we assume home schooling can be done by the non-earning parent. For two-parent,
         two-earner families, we include one-half of each parent as a WNC in our baseline
         analysis, and consider alternatives to be described below.8 , 9

       · For each 3-digit subsector, we know from input-output tables how much of the subsec-
         tor's contribution to GDP is in the form of labour income. We multiply this value by
         the proportion of employment income in that sector that is attributable to workers-
         needing-childcare. This gives us the share of the subsector's contribution to GDP
         produced by WNC.

       · Finally, we sum up these values across subsectors, to obtain the total contribution of
         workers-needing-childcare to Canada's GDP. We consider the total size of the K-12
         education subsector to be equal to the conventionally measured size of the subsector,
   7
      The term workers-needing-childcare is somewhat misleading since it brings to mind childcare for pre-
school children. We do not take account of issues related to childcare for pre-school age children since our
focus is on elementary and secondary schools.
    8
      We view this assumption, that child care is symmetrically divided in two-parent, two-earner families, as
a benchmark; it reflects neither anecdotal nor quantitative evidence on how the pandemic has differentially
affected family members. We provide measures based on an asymmetric definition of WNC in Section 4.
    9
      Hence, workers-not -needing-childcare, or non-WNC, include one-half of each parent in two-parent, two-
earner families, individuals without school-aged children, and the parent doing paid work in two-parent,
one-earner families.


                                                      6
      plus the size of the WNC sector. In Section 4.1, we refer to this as the "Extended
      K-12" subsector.10

This gives a simple estimate of how much of the aggregate economy, specifically its labour
income, is dependent upon in-person K-12 schooling. In a sense, this is an upper bound
measure because, as we have witnessed during COVID, some workers can shift to working
from home, educating and caring for their children at the same time, at least in the short
run. But even in that case, the productivity of workers-needing-childcare is reduced, though
perhaps not to zero, as our estimate implies.
    We also provide an extended measure of centrality for K-12 education. As detailed below,
the standard Bonacich centrality of education is small when conventionally measured. This
is because education is on the periphery of the network of economic activity. Essentially
all of its output is accounted for in final demand, while little of it is used as intermediate
input by other sectors in the supply-chain network.
    To account for its role in availing the labour of workers-needing-childcare, we consider a
conceptual extension to the economy's input-output structure. We include a new sector of
the economy: one that produces/supplies the labour of WNC.11 As just discussed, we can
measure the fraction of each sector's labour income owing to WNC. Hence, in considering
WNC as its own sector, we can measure its production/supply of labour services to all other
sectors of the economy. Extending the analysis requires specifying the workers-needing-
childcare sector's use of (or demand for) output from other sectors. In particular, we
assume that the final demand for K-12 education is entirely used by the WNC sector as an
intermediate input. Using this extended input-output matrix for the economy, we calculate
an extended Bonacich centrality measure, with a particular interest in the value for K-12
schooling.



4     Results

4.1    Size

In Figure 1, we show the (standard) contribution of all sectors in the economy, aggregated
to the 2-digit NAICS level. The total height of each bar measures the 2-digit sector's share
of 2015 Canadian GDP, with the smallest sector being "Management of companies and
enterprises" at less than 1% of national income, and the largest being "Real estate and
rental and leasing" at almost 13%. As conventionally measured, the share of K-12 schools
(the 4-digit "Elementary and secondary schools" industry) is small, less than 3% of GDP.
This is indicated as the dotted, red portion of "Educational services".
  10
     Note that we first subtract the value of workers-needing-childcare who work in the standard K-12
subsector, to avoid double counting.
  11
     This is a now oft-used construct in the New Keynesian macroeconomics literature in order to model
wage-setting behaviour; see Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005).

                Figure 1: Sectoral Contribution to Canadian National Income




 Notes: The bars indicate the share of GDP accounted for by various sectors of the economy, aggregated
 to the 2-digit NAICS level. The dotted red bar is the direct contribution of K-12 schooling, the solid
 orange bars are the indirect contributions owing to workers-needing-childcare (WNC). The "Extended
 K-12" bar is the sum of direct and indirect contributions. See text for details.



    As discussed in Section 3, this does not account for the role of K-12 schooling in availing
the economy of labour from workers-needing-childcare. For each 2-digit sector, this contri-
bution is illustrated by the solid, orange portion of the corresponding bar. For example,
the "Health care and social service" sector accounts for 7.2% of Canadian GDP. Of this, 1.0
percentage point (or just less than one-seventh) corresponds to the income earned by our
benchmark definition of WNC discussed in Section 3; the rest is labour income earned by
other workers and business owners, capital income, etc. When summed across all sectors,
workers-needing-childcare account for 8.9% of GDP.
   Recall that we compute the total size contribution of K-12 schooling to the economy by
envisioning an extended K-12 subsector. To do so, we sum the size of the standard K-12
subsector (direct contribution) and the size of the WNC subsector (indirect contribution).
The total contribution of the extended K-12 sector is shown by the rightmost bar in Figure 1.
The solid, orange portion of the bar presents the indirect contribution of K-12 education,
the contribution of WNC summed across all sectors. To arrive at the total, we add to this

                                                   8
the direct GDP contribution of K-12 schools. It amounts to 2.5% and is represented by the
dotted, red portion of the bar for the extended K-12 subsector. Figure 1 also illustrates the
adjustment made to the size of the standard "Education services", to account for the fact
that we distinguish between K-12 and other schooling.
    Hence, we arrive at an extended contribution of K-12 schools totalling 11.5% of GDP.
Even though the K-12 system is officially defined as a 4-digit industry group in the NAICS,
comprehensively measured as done here, it would represent the second largest 2-digit sector
of the economy, second only to "Real estate and rental and leasing".
   As stated above, this is an upper bound on K-12 schooling's size importance: parents
need not completely stop working if their children are home from school. But its magnitude
suggests that even adjusting for working from home, its importance is large. Suppose, for
example, that workers-needing-childcare are effectively half as productive when working
from home and simultaneously educating their children. Then K-12 schooling amounts to
almost 7% of GDP--larger than "Finance and insurance" and just smaller than "Health
care and social service".
    Finally, these estimates are derived from our benchmark definition of WNC that assumes
each parent in a two-parent, two-earner family equally shares the duty of home schooling
and its associated time away from work. As an alternative definition, we consider the WNC
to be the lower-earning parent in such families as measured in the 2016 Census data. This
would be the optimal market-production-vs-home-production choice based on comparative
advantage if, for example, both parents were equally productive at home schooling. As a
point of reference, the male parent is the higher earner in approximately 70% of opposite
sex families while the female parent is the higher earner 30% of the time. Importantly,
evidence from the Canadian Labour Force Survey indicates that mothers have borne the
disproportionate burden of parenting since March 2020 (see Beauregard et al. (2020) and
Schirle and Skuterud (2020)). Neither of our definitions necessarily reflect how families have
shared parenting responsibilities since the start of the pandemic (a critically important issue
that is beyond the scope of this paper). But for our purposes, our various measures allow
for reasonable bounds on quantifying the importance of in-person K-12 education.
    When we define workers-needing-childcare as the lower earner, the WNC subsector ac-
counts for 5.9% of GDP, so that the total contribution of K-12 schools is 8.5% of GDP.
This would make K-12 education the third largest 2-digit sector of the economy, just ahead
of "Public administration" and behind "Manufacturing". To summarize, accounting for its
role in "freeing up" labour time of parents with school-aged children makes in-person K-12
schooling an important part of the economy in terms of size.


4.2   Centrality

We next consider the importance of K-12 education in terms of its centrality in the econ-
omy's network structure. Recall that we express the Bonacich measure as an index on a
0­100 scale, where the most central 3-digit subsector is normalized to 100, and an entirely
non-central subsector receives a value of zero. After dividing Educational services into two

distinct nodes ("K-12 schools" and "all other education"), there are 98 measurable subsec-
tors in the Canadian input-output table. Given this large number of nodes, we present our
results in Appendix Table 1.
    Here, we visually represent the results in two ways. The first is in a simplified, heuris-
tic format displayed in Figure 2. Each bubble or node represents a subsector, with links
representing the network structure of the economy. The arrows on those links indicate
direction(s) of output flow. The larger the bubble, the greater the subsector's centrality.
Because the number of nodes, N = 98, is large and the number of potential links in the net-
work, N × (N - 1)/2, is even larger, it is not possible to represent all subsectors graphically.
Instead, we have selected six nodes, placing the most central one in the centre; network
links indicating goods/services flows have been included for those that are quantitatively
large.12
    The left panel indicates centrality as conventionally measured. The most central (3-
digit) subsector in the Canadian economy is "Professional, scientific and technical services"
(which is also its own sector at the 2-digit level), composed of industries that produce, for
example, legal, accounting, computer support, and advertising services. Given that these
services are used intensively as intermediate inputs by firms, this result is not surprising.
The least central subsector is "Aboriginal public administration," with a centrality index
number of 12.3. K-12 schooling (in red) has a centrality index number of 13.7.
    Figure 3 presents the entire distribution of centrality values in the form of a cumulative
distribution function (CDF). Again, the left panel indicates centrality as conventionally

results documented in Appendix Table 1.

measured. The horizontal axis indicates the Bonacich centrality index between 0 and 100.
Each solid, blue marker in the figure indicates a subsector. Reading from a marker over to
the vertical axis indicates the fraction of subsectors ranked lower in centrality. As in other
advanced economies, the distribution of centrality is fat-tailed, with nearly three-quarters of
subsectors having centrality below 25, and only eight subsectors with centrality greater than
50 (see, for instance, Acemoglu et al. (2012) and Anufrieva, Goryachevaa, and Panchenkob
(2016)).
    K-12 schooling is indicated by the highlighted, dotted, red marker. As conventionally
measured, K-12 schooling has a centrality index number of 13.7. This makes it the 82nd
ranked subsector out of 98, and similar in score to "Electronics and appliance stores",
"Furniture and related product manufacturing", and "Personal and laundry services". The
low centrality of K-12 schooling is due to the fact that it is a downstream subsector, on
the periphery of the production network. It uses intermediate inputs from other sectors;
however, it produces very little in the way of intermediates itself. Instead, its output is
largely "consumed" as final demand.
    As discussed, this importance ranking does not account for the role of in-person K-12
schools in availing the economy of the labour time of parents with school-aged children. We
model this by assuming the existence of an additional workers-needing-childcare subsector
in the network. The WNC subsector is highly central since it provides labour services to
all subsectors of the economy; this is the "outflow" of goods/services from the workers-
needing-childcare sector.
    Completing the extended input-output analysis requires specifying the WNC subsector's
use of output from all other subsectors. Since this subsector is obviously not listed in the
official input-output table, the "inflow" of goods/services to workers-needing-childcare must
be taken from final demand. For simplicity, and to minimize deviation from conventional
measurement, our benchmark calculation assumes that the WNC subsector uses none of the


                                                11
final demand of other subsectors, except one--it uses in-person K-12 schooling to produce
WNC labour services. We assume that the final demand component of K-12 schooling is
entirely used by this subsector as an intermediate input.
     K-12 schooling is much more important when factoring in its labour availing role. This
is illustrated in the right panels of Figure 2 and Figure 3. In our benchmark extension, K-
12 education becomes the most central subsector in the economy, taking on an index value
of 100. To provide a sense of comparison, "Professional, scientific and technical services"
moves to second (when the fictitious WNC subsector is omitted), with a centrality index
number of 66.1.
    This uses our benchmark WNC definition, in which one-half of each parent in a two-
parent, two-earner family is assigned as a worker-needing-childcare. Our alternative defi-
nition incorporates the lower-earning parent as part of the WNC subsector. In that case,
K-12 schooling remains the most central subsector, but by a smaller margin. "Professional,
scientific and technical services" remains second, with a centrality value of 94.6.
    We provide a final sensitivity analysis, representing a more substantial deviation from
the conventional specification of input-output tables. As we document below, this generates
a lower bound on the centrality of K-12 schooling. Here, rather than singling out the
labour of workers-needing-childcare, we include two additional subsectors to the analysis,
representing all of labour input: WNC and non-WNC. The labour services from both
subsectors are outflows to all other subsectors of the economy.
    As before, extending the analysis requires specifying labour's use of output from all other
subsectors. That is, we must specify how much Canadian families (both with school-aged
children and without) consume from each subsector of the economy, in order to provide
these labour services. This, of course, is unobservable. Here, we model the inflows from all
other subsectors to WNC and non-WNC as being proportional to the WNC and non-WNC
shares of aggregate labour income with respect to final demand. Again, the exception is
K-12 schooling where the final demand component of K-12 is entirely used by the WNC
subsector as intermediate input (and not at all by non-WNC).
    In this specification, K-12 schooling becomes the 13th ranked subsector in terms of
centrality, with an index number of 36.1.13 This is slightly lower than "Food manufac-
turing", but higher than "Petroleum and coal products manufacturing" and "Hospitals".
While less central than in our other extended measures, it is still far above the median and
substantially more central than when conventionally measured.
   To summarize, the extended measure recognizes the centrality of K-12 schooling as a
key intermediate input into a subsector (workers-needing-childcare) that is itself highly
central to all others. This indirect effect is what our extended Bonacich centrality measure
  13
     This drop in ranking comes from two effects. The first is the inclusion of a portion of all subsectors'
final demand production as intermediate inflows into the WNC and non-WNC subsectors (not just K-12 as
an intermediate into WNC). Since the centrality index is a relative measure, this increases the centrality
of all other subsectors and decreases the centrality of K-12 schooling. The second effect comes from the
inclusion of the non-WNC sector, which is much larger than WNC. Since centrality depends on size and
connectedness, this amplifies the first effect.



                                                    12
captures, and what the conventional measure misses. Accounting for its role in "freeing
up" the labour time of parents with school-aged children makes in-person K-12 schooling
an important part of the economy in terms of centrality.


4.3      Closing In-Person K-12 Schools

Our analysis measures the importance of K-12 schooling for the Canadian economy, using
data from the 2015 input-output tables and 2016 census. Our results can also quantify
the aggregate implication of suspending K-12 schools, in terms of lost GDP. There are two
effects. The first is the direct loss of national income if K-12 schools were to close. As
indicated in Subsection 4.1, this amounts to a loss of 2.5% of GDP.14
   The second is the indirect, but quantitatively more important loss stemming from the
reduced labour time of workers-needing-childcare. In our baseline definition, if WNC were
unable to work without in-person K-12 schooling, GDP would fall by 8.9%. In our more
conservative definition (in which the lower earner in two-parent, two-earner families were
unable to work) the lost labour productivity of WNC would cost 5.9% of GDP.
    It is worth noting that the centrality analysis of Subsection 4.2 delivers the identical
indirect effect, under a particular expression of the counterfactual. The suspension of in-
person K-12 schooling generates lost labour productivity of workers-needing-childcare: the
productivity of WNC drops to zero without K-12 schools, while that of non-WNC is un-
changed. Hence, when interpreted as sector-specific labour productivity shocks that are
proportional to the sector-specific WNC shares of value added, the loss amounts to either
5.9% or 8.9% of GDP.15
    These effects are large. To provide perspective, real GDP (seasonally adjusted, at an
annual rate) fell by an unprecedented 11.5% during 2020 Q2. The broad-based return of
in-person schooling in Canada since September and the strong rebound in employment and
output since then (at the time of writing) is consistent with the importance of in-person
K-12 schooling for economic activity.



5        Conclusion

Public K-12 schooling is a bedrock institution in Canadian society. Schools are integral to
the emotional and social development of children and teenagers, as the centre of their peer
social interactions. K-12 education also plays a key role in socializing engaged and respectful
citizens. Furthermore, education is critical to the accumulation of human capital that is
key to a productive economy. All of these factors must be considered when determining
    14
     Obviously, if K-12 school closure was temporary and factor input payments (teacher and administrator
salaries, capital rental/lease payments) continued to be made, the loss would be significantly less.
  15
     This is a direct application of Hulten (1978)'s theorem, since our input-output model (as detailed in
Appendix A) features Cobb-Douglas production, perfect competition, and efficiency of equilibrium. See also
Baqaee and Farhi (2019).

whether and in what way to open schools, as we move through the second and subsequent
waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    There is also a more direct and immediate role of K-12 education: it makes it possible
for parents of school-aged children to carry out paid work. Our goal in this paper is to
provide a quantitative assessment of this role. To do so, we augment input-output tables by
constructing a hypothetical sector composed of workers-needing-childcare--workers whose
ability to work is predicated on finding child care for their school-aged children. We calculate
how much of national GDP their labour accounts for, and the importance of their work to
other sectors of the economy.
     Our results are striking. Conventionally measured, K-12 schooling accounts for less than
3% of total value-added. However, when we account for its role in availing the economy
of the labour of WNC, its contribution totals 11.5% of GDP. In terms of centrality in the
supply-chain of the economy, the standard measure ranks K-12 schooling 82nd out of 98
3-digit subsectors. Our preferred adjustment suggests it is in fact the most central sector of
the economy, and our lowest estimate places it in 13th rank. Hence, suspending in-person
schooling represents not just a loss of output for the economy but a very serious loss of
income for the households where parents are unable to work. Given the aggregate nature of
our exercise, we have not investigated the distributional aspects of these results. However,
it is clear that the economic costs we consider fall most heavily on women and, particularly
on lone mothers.
    Our goal in this paper is to contribute to the debate over school closures, by documenting
an aspect of K-12 education that has seldom been discussed--the important part it plays
in the economy. Certainly, the health of students and their families must take precedence
over economic considerations. However, given the size of the impacts we find, we conclude
that health-motivated efforts to "flatten the curve" are especially important because of the
key role of schools in enabling parents to go to paid work.




A     Appendix

Consider a multi-sector economy with input-output linkages. There are J sectors of the
economy. Sector j production is Cobb-Douglas and constant returns to scale, and given by:
                                        1-j j
                             y j = zj  j   Ij ,         j  {1, 2, . . . , J }.              (1)

Here, zj is the productivity of sector j (which can be a composite of sectoral capital and
technology), j is sector j labour input, and Ij is the sector's intermediate input. Interme-
diates are produced by other sectors, giving rise to the network structure of the economy.
Specifically:

taking prices {pk }k as given:
                                                                          J

Normalizing  = 1, prices are expressed in units of the numeraire (in this case, labour).16
The first order condition with respect to sector j 's intermediate input use of goods from
sector k , yjk , can be written as:
                                                           1-j j
                                 pk yjk = j jk pj zj j        Ij              = j jk pj yj .         (2)

    Expressed in units of goods, equilibrium market clearing requires supply equals demand
in all sectors k  {1, 2, . . . , J }:
                                                                     J

                                                                 j =1

where demand is composed of both final demand, f  ~k , (e.g., as consumption, investment
goods) and intermediate good demand (from all sectors). Multiplying this by pk and sub-
stitituting in equation (2):
                                                                 J
                                                   ~
                                       pk y k = pk f k+                  j jk pj yj .                (3)

                  J
Note that         j =1 pj yj
                     is total output (both final and intermediate good use, expressed in
terms of the numeraire). Dividing equation (3) by this gets:
                                                            J
                                             s k = fk +              j jk sj ,
                                                           j =1

where sk is sector k 's share of total output, and fk is sector k 's final good share of total
output. Since this holds for all k  {1, 2, . . . , J }, rewrite this in matrix form:

                                                   s = f + As,                                       (4)

where s = (s1 , . . . , sJ ) and f = (f1 , . . . , fJ ) are (J × 1) vectors, and A is a (J × J ) matrix
where the (j, k )-th element, ajk = j jk , is the expenditure share on sector k 's production
in sector j .
       Equation (4) can be rewritten as:

                                                 s = (I - A)-1 f.                                    (5)

(I - A)-1 is known as the economy's "Leontief Inverse" matrix and can be expressed as:

                                   (I - A)-1 = I + A + A2 + A3 + . . . .
  16
       The choice of the numeraire good is arbitrary and immaterial to the derivation and results.

Hence, the (j, k )-th element of the Leontief Inverse matrix measures the importance of
sector k as a direct and indirect intermediate input supplier to sector j in the economy's
network structure. Let 1 denote a (J × 1) vector of ones. Bonacich centrality, v, is given

                                         J
Hence, v (also referred to as the "influence vector") is (J × 1), where the j -th element
measures the importance of sector j summed across all sectors of the economy.
    Given this, the extension of the centrality analysis discussed in Section 3 requires mini-
mum modification. The change is conceptual, and assumes that the labour input of workers-
needing-childcare (WNC) is a distinct factor of production from the labour of those without
school-aged children (non-WNC). That is, in the sector j production function of equation
(1), j now denotes labour of non-WNC, while WNC labour becomes its own sector17 Cor-
respondingly, the number of sectors increases to J~ = J + 1. Sector j purchases WNC labour
                                              J~   jk
for use as an intermediate input in Ij = k=1 yjk      . Let the WNC sector be denoted as
sector w. Hence empirically, ajw = j jw is sector j 's expenditure share on labour income
payments to WNC workers, in the extended model's (J      ~× J ~) A matrix of equation (4).
   Implementation also requires specifying how sector w's output (WNC labour) is pro-
duced. As with all other sectors, we assume a Cobb-Douglas functional form:
                                                                ~
                                                                J
                                             -w w                     wk
                                yw =   zw  1
                                           w   Iw ,     Iw =         ywk .
                                                               k=1

In our benchmark specification, we assume that the wk = 0 for all k except for the K-12
sector, which takes a value of 1. In the specification for our sensitivity analysis, wk > 0
for all k , with values corresponding to sectoral inflows being proportional to the WNC
share of aggregate labour income with respect to final demand; again, the exception is K-12
schooling where the final demand component of K-12 is entirely used by the WNC sector.
    Finally, it is worth reiterating that the analysis of Section 4 centers on the Bonacich
centrality of the K-12 schooling sector, and not on the centrality of the WNC sector. How-
ever, as noted, the measured centrality of K-12 schools depends on that of WNC, since K-12
schooling is an important input into WNC, a sector that is itself highly central to all other
sectors.




  17
     Hence, given Cobb-Douglas production, the elasticity of substitution between labour input of WNC and
non-WNC is unity. This differs from the implicit assumption embodied by our extended analysis for sectoral
size based on shares of national income; there the elasticity of substitution is assumed to be infinite.
