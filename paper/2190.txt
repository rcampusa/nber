International Competition in the Products of U.S. Basic Industries



                                    ABSTRACT


      This paper provides an overview of recent trends in the U.S. basic

 industries. It first documents the dramatic fall in their shares of domestic

 employment and globalproduction.It then considers explanations for these

 industriest relative -- and, in some instances, absolute --   decline.    Those

 explanations fall into two categories: domestic explanations which focus on

 the decisions of labor, management and government, and international

 explanations which focus on the tendency of the product cycle to continually

 shift the production of established products and standardized processes to

 newly-industrializing countries.

      This review suggests that the recent difficulties of the U.S. basic

 industries have resulted not from one or the other of these factors but from

 their interplay. Insofar as product-cycle-based shifts in the international

 pattern of comparative advantage have contributed to recent difficulties, some

 decline in the U.S. basic industries is both inevitable --   barring   increased

 protection -- and justifiable on efficiency grounds. Insofar as labor,

 management and government decisions share responsibility, the recent

 difficulties of U.S. basic industries may be at least partially reversible.

     Capitalism, as Joseph Schumpeter defined it, is a process of creative

destruction. In a market economy, one should expect new products,

processes and even producers to surplant their predecessors in the normal

course of events. Yet Schumpeter's metaphor provides little comfort to

employees and shareholders of basic industries in the United States, all of

which are suffering the effects of foreign competition. The American steel

industry is the most dramatic case in point: between 1979 and 1985, the

number of wage employees there declined from 342,000 to 151,000, while the

percentage rate of return on stockholders' equity fell from 5.8 to _18.5.1

Recent trends in the automobile, textile and apparel industries, while

somewhat less alarming, similarly convey an impression of U.S. basic

industries in steady and perhaps irreversible decline.

     In this paper, I first document the dramatic fall in the shares of

U.S. basic industries in domestic employment and global production.     I then

consider explanations for these industries' relative -- and, in some

instances, absolute --   decline.   Those explanations fall into two categories:

domestic and international. Domestic explanations focus on the decisions of

three sets of actors: management, labor and government. Management is

blamed for ill-advised decisions (O'Boyle, 1983), labor for high wage costs

(Kreinin, 1984), government for harmful tax, trade and macroeconomic

policies (Bluestone and Harrison, 1982). International explanations focus

on the tendency of the product cycle to continually shift the production of

established products and standardized processes to newly-industrializing

countries (due to what Alexander Gerschenkron called, in now unfashionable
                                     —2—


parlance, the advantages of "economic backwardness").2 Late industrializers,

it is argued, while lacking the infrastructure to be in the forefront of

innnovation, have the advantage of low labor and material costs when it comes

to the production of established goods using standardized technologies.

     The problem which plagues this search for culprits should be familiar to

fans of the board game "Clue." As in "Clue," the problem is one of too

many suspects, and some method is required to eliminate candidates. One of

the findings of Section 1 is a striking contrast in the recent fortunes of

the American steel industry on the one hand and the automotive and textile

industries on the other, steel continuing to spiral downward, automobiles and

textiles showing signs of greater stability. For an explanation of recent

difficulties in the basic industries to be convincing, it must be capable of

accounting for this contrast. Much of the analysis that follows is organized

around the contrasting experiences of these industries.

     After documenting recent trends in the U.S. basic industries, I decompose

those trends into components associated with the rise of competing supplies,

the growth of demand, and changes in competitiveness. First, I consider the

rise of competing supplies, contrasting product cycle explanations that view

shifts in the location of basic industries as a natural consequence of the

international diffusion of standardized technologies with explanations that

emphasize the influence of public policy. Evidence on the diffusion of

established technologies, while confirming the importance of the product

cycle, suggests also that continued innovation in the United States can

preserve important segments of the U.S. basic industries. Next, I examine

global trends in demand for the products of basic industries. Because there
                                       —3—


is a strong correlation between the intensity of demand-side pressures and the

severity of the problems faced by the basic industries, I conclude that

demand-side factors have played an important role in recent trends. Finally,

I analyze factors influencing the competitiveness of basic industries in the

United States and abroad, ranging from labor costs, work conditions,

management strategies and investment decisions to the macro, trade and tax

policies of governments.

    A central message of this paper is that monocasual explanations for the

recent difficulties of U.S. basic industries conceal more than they reveal.

Those difficulties reflect both the efficient interplay of market forces

(driven largely by economic development abroad), and inefficiencies resulting

from labor, management and government decisions which have proven ill-advised

in light of subsequent events. Insofar as product-cycle-based shifts in the

international pattern of comparative advantage have contributed to recent

difficulties, some decline in the U.S. basic industries is both inevitable --

barring   measures to isolate the U.S. market from international competition --

and justifiable on efficiency grounds. Insofar as labor, management and

government decisions share responsibility, the recent difficulties of U.S.

basic industries may be at least partially reversible.

     To the extent that these factors vary in importance across industries -—

indeed across segments of the same industry --   it   is misleading to offer an

undifferentiated assessment of the prospects of the basic industries in the

United States. Much depends on the facility with which different segments of

those industries adopt new technologies eminating from the high—tech sector.

The steel industry, for example, is increasingly bifurcated into a declining
                                      -4-


segment dominated by large-scale integrated works and a more profitable,

technologically—progressive segment dominated by minimills. Similarly, the

application of new technologies holds out more promise for the survival and

prosperity of some segments of the US. automobile and textile industries than

for others. In consequence, it is increasingly difficult to analyze the basic

industries as a monolithic bloc and even to distinguish them clearly from the

high-tech sector.



1.   Recent Trends -in U.S. Basic Industries

     It is not immediately clear what industries should be defined as basic.

Basic industries are typically thought to be those which traditionally loomed

large in U.S. industrial production and have fallen recently on hard times:

iron and steel, textiles and apparel, and motor vehicles. These industries

are lumped together more for their long-standing importance to the U.S.

economy, their recent difficulties, and their regional concentration than for

their innate economic characteristics. Technically, basic industries are

those situated far upstream in the input-output table. Their products serve

as inputs into production in a variety of other sectors. They are

distinguished by the age of the industry and of the enterprise. Their

technology is relatively standardized. Production is often capital intensive,

and there exist barriers to entry. Textiles, apparel, motor vehicles and

steel satisfy these criteria to differing extents. While the steel industry

is relatively far upstream, aged and capital intensive, the speed with which

its technology evolves resembles the high-tech industries. The textile and

apparel industries, while relatively old and heavily dependent on standardized

technologies, are not situated so far upstream (in the sense that they rely as

much on consumer as producer goods markets), are labor rather than capital

intensive and until recently have exhibited few entry barriers. Despite the

difficulties posed by the terminology, in this paper I adopt the popular

definition of basic industries and focus on steel, motor vehicles, textiles

and apparel.

     Figures 1 through 3 show trends and fluctuations in output, employment

and import penetration in these industries since the 1973 peak.3 In Figure 1,

the cyclical volatility of steel and motor vehicle output contrasts with the

relative stability of textile and apparel production. While textile and

apparel production showed no trend through 1979, output in the two industries

fell by 10 and 20 per cent, respectively, between 1979 and 1985. In contrast,

both steel and auto production fell sharply during the 1973-75 and 1979-81

recessions. While vehicle production tended to make up lost ground following

each cyclical downturn, steel output appears to have ratcheted down to

permanently lower levels. That ratchet effect was twice as severe in the

1979-82 recession as in 1973-75. Whereas automobile production had fully

recovered by 1977, steel production remained 17 per cent below 1973 levels.

Similarly, whereas vehicle production had recovered to within 5 per cent of

1979 levels by 1985, steel production remained 35 per cent below these

levels.

     Trends in employment, in Figure 2, mirror the trends in output in

Figure i. Textile and apparel employment declined gradually over the period

(as it has since World War II), reflecting the loss of more than 200,000 jobs

between 1973 and 1985 (amounting to nearly ten per cent of industry employment

at the beginning of the period). Employment in steel moved in similar manner

until 1979, after which it declined sharply; by 1985 employment in the steel

industry was barely 40 per cent of 1973 levels. Employment in the motor

vehicle and equipment industry, in contrast, has been dominated not by a sharp

downward trend but by pronounced cyclical fluctuations although, as

foreign—based companies establish and increase production in the United

States, the share of the four U.S.—based companies in U.S. vehicle employment

continues to decline.

     Together, changes in output and employment provide a perspective on

industry adjustment. Comparing Figures 1 and 2, one finds that only in motor

vehicles did the percentage change in output significantly exceed the

percentage change in employment between 1973 and 1985. In steel, employment

has fallen considerably more than output, especially over the second half of

the period when low-productivity plants were closed and a number of products

with high labor requirements were abandoned. In textiles and apparel,

employment has fallen slightly more than output, especially over the first

half of the period. In both of these industries, the decline in labor/output

ratios reflects substitution of capital for labor designed to increase

productivity. In contrast, the maintenance of relatively high levels of

employment in motor vehicles, especially between 1973 and 1979, reflects

anticipations of producers that industry demand would soon recover.5

     Figure 3 displays import penetration ratios (shares of domestic sales or

apparent consumption accounted for by imports).6 The reason for concern over

imports is obvious. In all three industries, the share of the domestic market

captured by imports has risen dramatically since the early 1970s -- from

approximately 15 to fully 25 per cent in automobiles and steel and to nearly

35 per cent in textiles. The timing of the import surge varies among

industries, however, and there is no direct correspondence between movements

in the import penetration ratio and trends in output and employment. In

textiles and steel, the surge in import penetration began in 1980—81. In the

case of textiles it proceeded steadily, while in the case of steel it was

interrupted in 1983 and again in 1985, coincident with the implementation of

two sets of voluntary export restraints. These two interruptions to the rise

in steel imports fully account for the lower import penetration ratio in steel

than in textiles in 1985. The case of automobiles is very different. The

surge in import penetration began earlier, in 1978-79, but decelerated,

leveled off and ultimately declined in the early 1980s, again coinciding with

the adoption of voluntary export restraints. Reinforcing the impression

conveyed by their output and employment experiences, the import-penetration

performance of the automobile industry looks very different from that of

textiles and steel.

     Tables 1 through 7 provide an international perspective on trends in

basic industry production. Three features stand out from Tables 1-3,

concerned with metals production. Three features stand out. First, there has

been a dramatic shift in the locus of production from developed to developing

countries. The same pattern is evident in iron and steel, non-ferrous metals

and metal products alike, as if common market forces underlie recent trends.

Second, trends in production in centrally-planned economies (dominated in the

1980s by China and Romania) have tended to mirror trends in the developing

world and hence to accentuate the international shift in the locus of

production. Third, U.S. output has been sustained most successfully in the

more technologically advanced stages of production.

     As illustrated by the contrast between the 8 1/2 per cent annual rate of

growth of iron and steel production in developing countries and the 2 1/2 per

cent annual rate of decline in developed nations, the US, is not alone among

developed countries in suffering a decline in iron and steel output. Even

Japanese output fell between 1974 and 1983, a trend which has accelerated

recently as Japanese finished steel production fell by 6.3 per cent between

the first half of 1985 and the first half of 1986, Japanese exports fell by

15.5 per cent and Japanese imports (notably from South Korea, Brazil, South

Africa and Taiwan) rose by 51.4 per cent. But the rate of decline of the U.S.

share of world output is exceptional, the U.S. share of total world raw steel

production falling from 17 per cent in 1976 to 11 per cent in 1985.

     Trends in non-ferrous metals (tin, copper, etc.), in Table 2, display a

similar pattern, with production by developing countries rising dramatically

and that by developed nations stagnating. Of the country groups considered,

only in the U.S. did production fall absolutely, however. Even that decline,

at a rate of one per cent per annum, is small compared to the experience of

iron and steel.

    Table 3 shows that the U.S. maintained its position relatively well in

the more advanced stages of metal production and fabrication. Despite a

decline in developed country output and a rise in developing country

production not unlike those apparent in Table 1, U.S. output remained steady

over the 1974-83 period, in contrast to the less impressive performance of the

Canadian and European industries. U.S. performance in metal fabrication in
large part reflects the bouyant state of domestic demand, since it occurred

despite a steady deterioration in the trade balance -in steel-containing goods.

     Trends in textiles, apparel and footwear, in Tables 4 through 6, are more

heterogeneous. As -in metals, production tended to shift from developed to

developing and centrally-planned economies over the course of the decade. In

comparison to metals, however, these shifts were small, and -in both textile

and clothing the growth of output by centrally-planned economies exceeded that

by developing nations. Compared to steel there has also been more variation

in output trends within the developed world. In textiles, for example, North

American output rose slightly, while production elsewhere in the DECO fell.

In clothing, in contrast, U.S. and Japanese output contracted, while

production elsewhere in the OECD increased. Footwear production fell sharply

in the U.S. and the EEC while remaining stable in Japan and rising elsewhere

-in the OECD. The heterogeneity of response suggests that variations in trade

and industrial policies (in non-market economies, planning) played an even

larger role in textile trade and production than in iron and steel.

     The experience of the global motor vehicle industry contrasts with that

of both textiles and steel. Production by developed countries grew

respectably over the period, increasing most rapidly -in Japan, of course, but

expanding also in non—EEC Europe (notably Scandinavia), the U.S. and Canada.

Only in the EEC did vehicle production actually decline. The astounding rates

of growth of output -in developing countries reflect the low levels from which

production started -in the early 1970s and the takeoff of automobile industries

in Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan.

2.   Growth of Competing Supplies

       As the preceding analysis makes clear, a leading influence over the

state of the U.S. basic industries has been the growth of competing supplies.

Does this growth of foreign competition reflect inexorable shifts in the

pattern of international comparative advantage, or are foreign government

policies designed to promote the expansion of these industries be held

responsible for recent trends?


     The Product Cycle

     According to models of the international product cycle, a pioneering

producer of steel, automobiles and textiles like the United States should

expect its share of global output to erode as production processes are

standardized and diffuse to newly industrializing countries. While an economy

with a comparative advantage in the development of new products and processes

will be the initial home of new industries, as products and processes are

standardized and technological know—how spreads, the location of production

will shift to other countries. The pioneering producer will retain a

productivity advantage only if its rate of development of new processes

exceeds their rate of international diffusion.

     The first industry in which product cycle forces can be observed is

cotton textiles. In the 19th century, the mechanism by which

industrialization initially spread from Britain to the Continent, North

America and then other parts of the world was the diffusion of English-based

spinning and weaving technologies. As early importers of British

technologies, U.S. textile producers had begun to fear by the end of the 19th
                                      —11—


 century that they were being placed at a competitive disadvantage by the

continuing spread of textile technology to lower—wage parts of the world.

Although innovation by the American industry helped to stem this tide, other

producers quickly began to emulate American example. Japanese firms, for

example, after having turned for advice to English machinery manufacturers in

the 1870s and 1880s and adopting the mule spinning technology favored in

Britain, quickly shifted to the ring spinning technology developed in the

United States. The Japanese industry expanded rapidly: by the interwar

period, textile goods accounted for fully half of Japanese exports. But as

the technology continued to diffuse, Japan's share of world textile exports

fell. By the late 1950s she had begun to import textiles, and by 1978 imports

reached 18 per cent of domestic sales. In 1979 Japan's textile trade balance

was in deficit for the first time in modern history.

     The second phase in the textile industry product cycle, which took place

between the late 1930s and early 1960s, was dominated by American technologies

for the production of synthetics and blended fibers. Like their predecessors,

these methods were labor intensive and readily emulated. Hence the location

of production continued to shift toward the NIC5, for whom the textile

industry is an important source of total manufacturing production and

employment. (See Tables 4-5 above.) The diffusion of knowledge has been

accelerated by the aggressive international sales activities of textile

machinery companies, including those based in the United States. Today more

than 100 countries ship textile and apparel products to the U.S.

     The product cycle in the steel industry has been even more dramatic,

since it has been compressed into such a short time span. In Japan, for
                                     —12—


example, where the steel industry was relatively small and inefficient prior

to World War II, the transfer of advanced technologies was concentrated -in the

25 years immediately following the war. In the 1960s Japanese producers

greatly expanded productive capacity, surpassing U.S. producers in their rate

of adoption of new technologies such as the basic oxygen furnace and in the

construction of large greenfield plants offering economies of scale. A significant

aspect of these programs was the Japanese industry's continued dependence on

foreign technology. As late as 1961, over 60 per cent of the Japanese

industry's sales were dependent on technology imported from abroad, mainly

from the United States. Over the course of that decade, foreign technologies

were adapted and the pace of Japanese innovation accelerated. By 1967 the

share of sales dependent on foreign technology had fallen to eight per cent,

and by the 1970s Japan had begun to export technology to the United States.8

     Production by Third World countries, who remain heavily dependent on

foreign technologies, increased dramatically (by nearly 150 per cent) between

1970 and 198O. While developing-country steel industries are only

occasionally multinational, technology transfer still takes place through

direct foreign involvement. China, for example, has relied successively on

Soviet, Japanese and, to a lesser extent, West German expertise, in 1978

signing an agreement with Nippon Steel for the construction of a greenfield,

fully-integrated plant at Shanghai and for the addition of a wide hot-strip

mill to existing works at Wuhan. As part of this agreement, the Japanese

offered to train Chinese technicians to operate the new works. In South

Korea, advanced technology has been transferred whole with the assistance of

foreign advisers. In Brazil, an exception to the rule that steel industries
                                        -13-


tend to be indigenous, two of the three largest private steel companies have

significant European and Japanese participation. Brazil's new Tuberao plant

is a joint venture with the Japanese and Italians. As a rule, however,

government ownership predominates, and direct foreign financial involvement is

rare.

        As in steel, technology transfer in automobile production has been

expedited by direct foreign involvement (often on the part of U.S. firms).

But in contrast to steel, the multinational form dominates. This has been

true even of Japan, GM and Ford having operated plants there from the

mid—1920s to the end of the 1930s. The alternative, obtaining designs and

tooling from abroad, is rendered difficult by foreign exchange shortages like

those which hindered Japanese efforts in the 1950s and plague developing

countries today. Compared to the other basic industries, product cycle forces

operate slowly in the automobile industry since motor vehicles are exceedingly

complex to produce and market. Major mechanical components such as engines

and transmissions tend to be produced using automated, capital-intensive

methods; because of high capital and low labor requirements, LOC5 have no

obvious comparative advantage. "Finish parts" such as exterior body stamping

and moldings must fit precisely and be adapted to market demands. Again,

there may be disadvantages associated with the use of relatively inexperienced

labor and advantages from proximity to the consumer. LDCs' most obvious

comparative advantage therefore lies in the production of minor mechanical

components such as starters, springs and wiring harnesses.

     While for the immediate future foreign sourcing of minor mechanicals is

likely to remain the principal form of LOC auto production affecting U.S.
                                        -14-


automakers, import competition from developing countries promises to have an

increasingly powerful impact on the economy end of the U.S. market. The

Hyundai, imported from Korea, in 1986 enjoyed the highest first-year sales

ever recorded by an import and undoubtedly figured in GM's decision to halt

production of its subcompact, the Chevrolet Chevette. This plus the

introduction of the Yugo (manufactured in Yugoslavia) led to plans to import a

similar economy car, the Proton Saga, from Malaysia. Meanwhile, established

companies have developed plans to produce cars in LOCs for sale in the U.S.

(Volkswagen in Brazil, Pontiac and Ford in Korea, Mercury in Mexico, Dodge in

Thailand). For the time being, LDC competition is heavily concentrated at the

bottom of the product line. The critical issue from the standpoint of U.S.

companies is whether --   or,   more precisely, when and to what extent --   these

countries will begin to penetrate other segments of the American market.


     Government Policy

     Even while product-cycle influences were shifting the locus of basic

industry production from the U.S. to other parts of the world, foreign

government policies could have been operating simultaneously to speed the

process. The recent debate over the extent and effectiveness of foreign

industrial targeting and export subsidization focuses on the latter set of

influences. Following Krugman (1984), it is useful to distinguish three

categories of policy: financial support (such as tax relief and privileged

access to capital markets), control of product market access (through tariffs,

quantitative restrictions and administrative guidance), and government control

of industry conduct (through the encouragement of mergers, joint ventures, and

collusive pricing policies).
                                      —15—


      The efficacy of these policies might be judged according to several

criteria. Did they raise foreign output, employment and exports? Did they

reduce foreign production costs? Did the returns on these policies exceed the

costs from a national point of view? Finally, and this is the criterion

relevant here, did foreign policies accentuate the shift in basic industry

production from the United States and contribute to U.S. industry's

competitive difficulties?

     The extent to which governments have promoted the growth of their basic

industries is notoriously difficult to quantify. How, for example, is one to

measure the impact of moral suasion designed to encourage banks to lend money

to enterprises in a particular sector? Despite these difficulties, some

general conclusions about the impact of policy on the basic industries can be

offered. It is clear, for example, that policy played an important role in

the growth of the Japanese steel and automobile industries in the 1950s; in

the 1970s and 1980s, in comparison, its influence has been much diminished.

In the 'fifties, the Japanese steel market was protected by stringent import

restrictions which increased the profitability of domestic production and

permitted the industry to produce at minimum efficient scale. Low-interest

loans and tax concessions provided added incentive to invest. Although these

policies remained in place into the 1970s, by the mid-1960s Japanese

competitiveness had improved to a point where import restrictions were

redundant. By the mid—1970s policy shifted toward restraining the industry's

growth to avoid exacerbating trade conflicts with other industrial countries.

    As in steel, the growth of Japan's automobile industry was stimulated in

the 1950s by prohibitive barriers to imports and by statutes requiring that
                                     —16—


companies be Japanese owned. Half the cost of a new automobile factory could

be written off in the first year of operation. In the 1980s, in contrast, few

such tax concessions have been available. Over the entire period 1966-81,

Nissan paid an average effective corporate tax rate of 35 per cent.1°

     Although various tax and financial incentives have been provided the

Japanese textile industry, the government's basic strategy has been one of not

interfering with the decline of employment. The share of textile

manufacturing in Japanese employment fell from 23 per cent in 1955 to 13.2 per

cent in 1979, with 18 per cent of Japanese textile jobs lost in the 1970s

alone. The late 1970s saw more than a thousand Japanese textile firm

bankruptcies per annum. The implications of these developments for Japanese

output are evident in Tables 4 and 5. Some steps were taken to slow the

industry's contraction, notably provision of concessional financing for

development of new merchandise, modernization of equipment, and investment in

R&D. But despite these examples to the contrary, Japanese textile-industry

policy has generally emphasized adjustment rather than job retention.

     Policy in Europe, in contrast, has focused more directly on stemming the

decline of basic industry employment. In the early 1970s, government

initiatives tended to be indirect, taking the form of measures to encourage

private lending for rationalization and modernization, for example. Funds for

the French steel industry were raised through government efforts to promote

the formation of an industry—wide syndicate to market bonds to the small

investor. Banks were encouraged by the state to aid in the industry's

modernization. As the financial condition of Europe's basic industries

worsened, however, governments became increasingly involved directly in the
                                     —17--



provision of financial assistance. In 1978 the French government implemented

a restructuring program which guaranteed the industry's debts.11 In several

other European countries transfers from general revenues have been needed to

permit publicly-owned companies to service debt and continue operations.

Subsidies and grants extended to the steel industry by members of the EC have

been estimated at 70 billion OM between 1980 and 198512 Most of these

measures have been taken in concert through the offices of the EC Commission.

     As with its policy toward steel, the objective of European textile policy

has been to prevent the erosion of employment. Starting in the 1970s,

Belgium, Italy and the UK offered textile firms substantial subsidies and in

some cases experimented with nationalization. In Norway, the textile industry

was provided relief from social security payments and financial support for

investment in machinery. France provided transitional assistance to small and

medium-sized firms and subsidized technological research to increase

productivity. The Netherlands initially permitted the market to operate

freely but, once more than half of all textile jobs in Holland disappeared

between 1970 and 1976, intervened with loans and with investment and current

expenditure subsidies for cotton, rayon, linen and clothing producers. If

anything, the scope of such policies has expanded in recent years. France,

for example, recently announced a program providing relief from social

security contributions to textile firms which maintain or increase employment

and investment. The Belgian government recently proposed extending loans and

interest rate subsidies to firms promising to retain at least 90 per cent of

their labor forces.'3

    Have these policies contributed in important ways to the competitive

difficulties of U.S. basic industries? Krugman (1984) argues no. Taking
                                      -18-


steel as an example, he points out that Japanese policies served to subsidize

industry expansion in the 1950s but not subsequently. One would have to

document persistent links from the learning effects of the 'fifties to costs

of production in the 'seventies in order to establish the relevance of

Japanese subsidies to current trends in competitiveness. Krugman argues

further that European policies have been "more a bailout for bondholders than

a subsidy for production or for the creation of new capacity" (Krugman, 1984,

p.11?).

     It is true that the direct effects of Japanese policies are small; one

study estimates that between 1951 and 1975 loans by public institutions,

export promotion schemes and other assistance measures reduced the cost of a

net ton of Japanese steel by no more than $0.45 U.S. (out of an estimated

Japanese cost of production in 1975 of roughly $150 U.S.).14 Nearly every

study of government assistance to the Japanese steel industry has arrived at

similar conclusions. But European subsidies, in contrast with Japan's, have

not been uniformly small; studies of European financial assistance to the

steel industry in the mid—1970s yielded estimates of implicit subsidies in the

range of $2 US per net product ton.

     Even if European financial policies did not increase production or

stimulate the creation of new capacity, as Krugman concludes, they surely

prevented production and capacity from shrinking at the rates that would have

been dictated by market forces alone. Even if European production subsidies

and import restraints have primarily affected Japanese exporters, the U.S.

industry is indirectly affected due to the integration of global commodity

markets. Japanese steel exports that might be sold in Europe in the absence
                                     —19—


of governmental intervention there tend to be diverted to other countries,

leading other producers, who might have concentrated on those markets -in the

absence of Japanese competition, to divert their own exports to still other

markets, including that of the United States. Due to market integration, the

mere fact that subsidies to the steel industry have been relatively generous

in countries which are not among the leading exporters to the United States

does not establish that they were without implications for the competitiveness

of American producers. Policies increasing supply or restricting demand tend

to have indirect repercussions on the United States wherever they occur.

      Observers have argued further that Japanese firms have been favored by

privileged access to borrowed funds, as a result of which their basic

industries have enjoyed an artificially low cost of capital. The only

systematic comparison of the corporate cost of capital in Japan and the U.S.,

that of Ando and Auerbach (1985), suggests that, while this may have been true

for the economy as a whole, the argument has not applied to the basic

industries since the mid—1960s. Ando and Auerbach compare price-earnings

ratios for samples of Japanese and U.S. companies as a measure of required

rates of return. For their samples of roughly 20 U.S. and 20 Japanese

companies for the period 1966-81, the median average return to (or cost of)

capital is 10.3 per cent for the U.S. and 9.5 per cent for Japan. In other

words, Japanese firms were able to pay their shareholders a rate of return 0.8

per cent less than that required of their American counterparts. While the

differences initially appear to be larger for steel and autos (in both

industries Japanese firms have substantially lower returns on (and costs of)

capital than their U.S. counterparts), corrections for depreciation,
                                     -20-


inventories and inflation change the picture.15 While tending to further

increase the cost-of-capital advantage for the Japanese economy as a whole,

these corrections raise the returns to the U.S. steel and auto industries

compared to their Japanese counterparts. For example, the before-tax cost of

capital for U.S. Steel is estimated at 17.8 per cent, compared with 22.0 per

cent for Kawasaki and 23.1 for Nippon Steel. Costs of capital for Ford and GM

averaged 15.5 and 17.3 per cent respectively, compared with 18.4 per cent for

Nissan. Adjustments for taxation only reinforce the conclusion, since

Japanese industry in general and auto and steel firms in particular paid

higher corporate taxes than their U.S. counterparts. Thus, if Japanese firms

benefited from a lower cost of capital, the benefits did not extend to autos

and steel. And, since the 1960s, direct government policy in the form of

corporate tax policy has not worked in the favor of Japan's basic industries.



3.   Lagging Demand

     The U.S. steel, textile nor automobile industries are all import—

competing industries. Hence domestic market growth largely determines the

state of industry demand.

     The U.S. basic industries all have suffered from secular declines in

demand but to differing extents. The most dramatic decline, that experienced

by the steel industry, is portrayed in Figure 4, which shows U.S. apparent

steel consumption relative to real GNP and its trend over a longer period

starting in 1960. Although domestic steel use fell significantly over the

period as a whole, domestic demand exhibited little trend in the 1960s but

declined significantly after 1972 and again after 1978.16

     The downward trend in U.S. steel consumption relative to GNP reflects the

tendency of the steel intensity of production to decline as the economy

matures.17 Phases of rapid industrial expansion and reconstruction like those

which followed World War II require inputs of steel for the construction of

railroads, bridges, port facilities, power stations and other infrastructure.

Eventually, investment in infrastructure begins to slow and with it the demand

for steel; the U.S. needs steel bridges f or only one interstate highway

network, for example. Figure 4 suggests that the U.S. had reached this stage

of declining steel intensity by the early 1970s.18

     Simultaneously, technological change created increasingly attractive

substitutes for steel. Steel has been replaced by plastic and concrete tubing

in many types of construction, by aluminum and plastic in the production of

food and beverage containers, by plastics in various stages of automobile

production. In several applications, notably automobiles, the shift toward

lighter materials was accentuated by the energy price shocks of 1973 and 1979.

In 1973, when 14.5 million vehicles were sold, Detroit consumed 23 million

tons of steel; in 1985 15.7 million vehicles accounted for only 13 million

tons, a fall of 48 per cent per unit.19 The shift toward steel—substitutes

also can be seen as a corollary of economic maturity, as increasingly

sophisticated technologies require the use of thinner and more formable

materials. While there also exist countervailing trends, such as the

substitution of steel for timber, brick and concrete in construction, overall

these developments have tended to reduce the steel intensity of production.20

     Figure 4 also reflects the cyclical sensitivity of steel consumption.

During business cycle downturns, firms delay investment projects and consumers

defer purchases of durables. The ratio of apparent steel consumption to real

GNP therefore rises significantly during recoveries and falls during

recessions.21 Consequently, the absence of a notable decline of steel intensity

in the 1960s is attributable in part to the relative buoyancy of the

macroeconomy over the period. Analogously, slower growth over much of the

period since 1973 and the exceptional severity of the post-1979 recession have

exacerbated the industry's demand-side difficulties.

     U.S. textile producers also have experienced stagnant domestic demand due

to shifts in expenditure shares and a slowly growing macroeconomy. Global

consumption of textiles has been rising less quickly than total manufacturing

production since the early 1960s. The income elasticity of demand for

clothing is less than unity and is thought to fall with rising incomes.22

Consumers' expenditure on clothing and shoes as a percentage of total private

consumption in the U.S., calculated in current prices as in Figure 5, has

declined from nearly 9.5 per cent in 1960 to less than seven percent.23

Measured in constant prices that share has been more stable; while the

constant—price share trends down over the period as a whole, most of

its decline occurs in the decade of the sixties. Thus, it appears to be

mainly falling prices rather than income inelastic demands or shifting

expenditure patterns that account for the industry's demand-side difficulties.

But the aggregate figures mask a shift toward casual wear at the expense of

formal attire, stimulating the demand for the products of some segments of the

industry while depressing the demand for others.

     Motor vehicle apparent consumption as a share of GNP, shown in

Figure 6, while even more volatile than the share of steel, exhibits an almost
                                     -23—


imperceptible downward trend.24 Trends in the share of spending on new motor

vehicles in GNP can be decomposed into effects associated with changes in

average vehicle life, "saturation" of the automobile market, and changes in

the relative cost of purchasing and operating vehicles. The rising average

age of passenger cars in use, from 5.7 years in 1973 to 7.5 years in 1984,

reflects the combination of improving durability and relatively slow income

growth over the period. Both the average price of a new car of constant

quality and the real cost per mile of operating a passenger car actually

declined between 1970 and 1983.25 In 1984 the number of cars per thousand

population reached 549 in the United States, by far the world's highest.26

OECD estimates put the saturation point at 700, however, suggesting that the

industry is still far from wholly dependent on replacement demand.27 Thus, not

only does the automobile industry differ from textiles and steel in that

demand has remained relatively stable, but neither the saturation nor the

operating cost argument provides much basis for pessimism about future

demands. At the end of 1984 the Commerce Department forecast that the number

of passenger cars sold in North American would rise by 11 per cent between

1985 and 1990.28 The principal factor likely to depress the quantity of new

vehicles demanded is a rise in their relative price, perhaps due in part to

the restrictive effect of voluntary export restraints on foreign producers.

The effects of these restraints, which tend to raise the share of U.S.

consumer expenditure on passenger cars even while depressing the quantity

sold in the domestic market, are discussed in the section on trade policy

below. But it is already clear that divergent trends in demand play an

important role in explaining the differing fortunes of the automobile and

4.   Private—Sector Determinants of Competitiveness

     Labor Costs and Labor Productivity

     No factor which figures in the debate over the competitiveness of U.S.

basic industries has attracted more attention than labor costs (see for

example Gomez-Ibanez and Harrison, 1982). The importance of labor costs is

incontrovertible: labor accounts for 46 per cent of total costs in motor

vehicles (Kreinin, 1984, p. 41), roughly 28 per cent of average total costs in

steel (down from 39 per cent in 1976; see Mueller and Kawahito, 1978, p. 19),

and for the great majority of manufacturing costs in apparel. The question is

the extent to which high wages have contributed to competitive difficulties,

particularly in automobiles and steel, and who bears the burden of

responsibility.

     Figure 7 shows trends over the last two decades in the average hourly

earnings of employees in U.S. basic industries relative to all manufacturing

employees. The need to distinguish among basic industries is again obvious.

While earnings in textiles and apparel are only 75 per cent of average

manufacturing earnings and in the latter case have continued to decline, steel

and vehicle earnings are at least 125 per cent of the manufacturing average,

with the differential favoring automotive workers rising slowly and that

favoring steelworkers rising rapidly until 1982. The steelworkers' premium

rose from 26 per cent in 1970 to 64 per cent in 1981-82, before falling to 43

per cent in 1985.29

     Productivity growth has not offset trends in labor costs, if anything

exacerbating them instead. While hourly output in all manufacturing rose

between 1977 and 1982, it changed only slightly in motor vehicles and declined

markedly in iron and steel. Table 8 shows trends over time in U.S. Unit labor

costs (hourly labor costs adjusted for productivity). Nominal Unit labor

costs for all employees, which rose by 30 per cent -in all manufacturing

between 1977 and 1982, rose by 56 per cent in vehicles and 72 per cent in

steel. The impact on costs of the rise in steelworkers' hourly earnings,

which was one and two-thirds as rapid as in all manufacturing, was reinforced

by a 10 per cent decline -in output per hour. The rise in autoworkers'

hourly earnings, which was one and a half times as rapid as in all

manufacturing, was not offset by a relatively small increase in labor

productivity.

     Identifying the reasons for these earnings differentials is rendered

difficult by the fact that they incorporate skill differentials, variations

across industries in the use of cooperating factors (capital/labor ratios),

differences in the organization of production, and differences in bargaining

power. A significant portion of the differentials can be explained on the

first three grounds without an appeal to market power or labor-market

imperfections. A crude measure of skill differentials is educational

attainment: in 1975, 30 and 35 per cent of the workforce in textiles and

apparel, respectively, had less than a ninth grade education, compared to 16

per cent for U.S. industry as a whole.3° This contrasts with 18 per cent -in

primary metals, 15 per cent in fabricated metals, and 12 per cent in transport

equipment. Since women comprise some 80 per cent of apparel-industry

employees, in part because the industry provides a convenient port of entry

for new labor-force participants, the growth of female labor force

 participation may have depressed apparel—industry wages by increasing the

 relevant labor supply. Yet Krueger and Summers (1986) find that controlling

 for age, education and gender, among other variables, fails to eliminate most

of the observed variation in inter-industry wages. Even with controls, basic

 industry wages in 1984 differed from average wages by 19 per cent in transport

equipment, 18 per cent in primary metals, -2 per cent in textiles and -16 per

cent in apparel. Krueger and Summers argue that the interdependence of tasks

encourages the payment of efficiency wages n steel and autos which account

for a portion of the differentials. In textiles and apparel, the diligence of

workers is readily monitored through the inspection of output and the payment

of piece rates, and the costs of employee turnover are relatively low because

of the lesser importance of firm-specific skills. In steel and autos, in

contrast, laborers work cooperatively, rendering their effort difficult to

observe. In addition, turnover costs may be relatively high, making it

efficient for firms to pay wage premia to attract and retain suitable

employees.

     None of these factors provides an obvious explanation for the growing

differential between steel and automotive wages on the one hand and textile

and apparel wages on the other, or for the surge in the premium enjoyed by

steel workers after 1970. This leaves the actions of unions and management.

It appears that the two share responsibility the surge in the steelworkers'

premium after 1970, and that import competition played a critical role. When

attempting to rationalize the rise in steel imports that occurred in the

1960s, management tended to focus on the threat of disruptions of domestic

supply. A famous 116 day strike in 1959 forced U.S. steel users to search out
                                     —27—


alternative sources. As foreign supplies came to be seen as less volatile and

uncertain than domestic sources, steel imports ratcheted upward every three

years when contracts were negotiated and strike threats were renewed.

Perceiving uncertainty about the availability of domestic supplies as the main

factor contributing to the rise in import penetration and anticipating a

strong domestic market for steel, management attempted to remove supply

disruptions starting in 1974 by offering steelworkers real wage increases of

not less than three per cent per annum in return for foregoing the right to

strike. It was easier for management to blame labor militancy than management

decisions for the difficulty of competing with imports. While removing the

cloud of uncertainty covering domestic supplies, this "Experimental

Negotiating Agreement't and its successors contributed greatly to the surge in

steel-industry labor costs. Thus, management and labor strategies led to the

adoption of policies which in the long run exacerbated problems of cost

competitiveness.

     Only in 1983 did the accord break down. By that time the relationship of

cost competitiveness to import penetration could no longer be denied.

Management shifted its attention from supply disruptions to comparative labor

costs, while labor, out of growing concern for employment, moderated its

position on wages, negotiating a nine per cent reduction in total compensation

in the first year of the new steel contract. In 1985, for the first time in

25 years, the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) struck a major steel

company (Wheeling-Pittsburgh) after the company had filed for bankruptcy and

unilaterally imposed court-approved reductions in wages and benef its.31 Thus,

both the rise and fall of the steelworkers' premium coincide with changes in

management and labor strategy.
                                     -29--



competition has weakened the bargaining position of the unions on balance.

Moreover, the decline in the share of steel and automobile workers unionized

suggests that changes in labor-market power have been working in the wrong

direction.

     This brings us to union strategy, the factor emphasized by Lawrence and

Lawrence (1985). They suggest that the price elasticity of demand for labor

is an increasing function of investment --   that   industries engaged in new

investment are better able to substitute plant and equipment for labor when

unions attempt to raise wages, thereby restraining wage demands. Declining

industries in which investment is unprofitable are incapable of responding in

this way, providing an incentive for unions to capture remaining profits by

raising wages, a phenomenon known as "scooping."

     The Lawrence and Lawrence interpretation has the virtue of consistency

with recent trends in the automotive industry, where guarded optimism over

medium-term prospects has sustained investment in recent years and declining

automobile sales and plant closings starting in 1979 led to an immediate

moderation in wage trends. After reporting record losses, Chrysler management

entered national contract negotiations in 1979 and obtained a contract under

which the UAW agreed to $203 million in wage concessions over three years. GM

and Ford negotiated new contracts six months prior to the scheduled expiration

of existing agreements; as at Chrysler, automatic wage increases both for

inflation and other reasons were deferred. Only when industry conditions

improved were traditional wage rules reinstated. This interpretation also

provides a consistent explanation for the rise in steelworkers' wages relative

to those of auto workers, assuming that the steel industry's future was
                                     -28--



     Alternative explanations for changes in labor costs are less

satisfactory. Appealing to the presence of unions is insufficient; even in

the low-wage apparel industry, more than half of employees were unionized in

1975.32 Granting that unions in steel and autos were more cohesive than those

in textiles and apparel, it remains unclear that their actions can account for

the surge in the differential. Economic theory suggests that members of

unions that effectively restrict entry will have higher wages than nonmembers,

not that the differential will rise over time. Nor can the fact that union

wage premia tend to rise in recessions account for these trends in light of

the almost uninterrupted rise in the steelworkers' premium over the decade of

the 'lOs. And while union workers, particularly members of the UAW and USWA,

have had their positions protected by generous cost-of-living escalators,

their earnings premia rose uniformly in periods of low and high inflation

alike.33

     If the UAW or USWA were responsible for the widening differential,

therefore, this must reflect changes in their bargaining power or strategy.

In simple models (e.g. Oswald, 1982), the level of wages for which unions

bargain is a function of the elasticity of labor demand alone; insofar as

foreign competition has increased the price elasticity of final demand for the

products of U.S. basic industries and, ceteris paribus, the elasticity of

their derived demands for labor, this should have weakened the unions'

bargaining power and reduced, not increased the differential. Although

voluntary restraint agreements have strengthened the bargaining position of

U.S. auto- and steelworkers over what it would have otherwise been, the

continued rise in the import share of the U.S. market suggests that foreign
                                     -30-


recognized as bleak from the early 1970s while the auto industry was expected

to survive. This, however, imputes a remarkable degree of foresight to union

 leaders and fails to explain the falling steel industry premium after 1982.

One might attempt to finesse this objective by positing that the U.S. steel

industry is made up of two segments, an integrated sector facing terminal

competitive difficulties, in which unions have been engaged in scooping, and

another comprised of plants which can survive, in wh'ch unions have not

engaged in this practice. The wave of plant closings since the early 1980s

has shifted the mix toward the second segment and resulted in a decline in the

steel earnings premium for the industry as a whole. Ultimately, however, the

problem with this explanation is the implausibility of the notion that as long

as 15 years ago steelworkers recognized the future prospects of their industry

as bleak, particularly in light of the optimism which pervaded the U.S. steel

market in the mid—1970s.

     How much labor cost differentials matter for international competitive-

ness depends on unit labor costs abroad. Comparing unit labor costs across

countries is rendered difficult by differences in data, differences in product

mix, and exchange—rate fluctuations. The Department of Labor's estimates of

hourly compensation, which attempt to adjust for these problems, are

summarized in Table g34 Although these estimates should be regarded as

approximations, it is clear, whether the comparison is for 1975 or 1965, that

the ratio of U.S. to foreign labor costs is higher in automobiles and steel

than in all manufacturing, whatever foreign country is considered. The U.S.

steelworkers' and autoworkers' wage premia that emerged in the 1970s were

without counterpart in other countries. The only exceptions are Japanese

steel- and autoworkers who, like their U.S. counterparts, are better paid than

the average manufacturing worker. Still, at market exchange rates U.S. steel

and automotive wages were in 1975 and 1985 roughly double those of Japan.

     Textiles and apparel exhibit a different pattern. In contrast to the

U.S., where textile and apparel workers earn less than the average

manufacturing worker, in most developing countries they earn more.

Nonetheless, there remains a dramatic labor cost differential between the

Asian and Latin American industries on the one hand and those of industrial

countries (including the U.S.) on the other. The U.S. is not alone; as early

as 1975 textile and apparel wages in many European countries exceeded those in

the United States. That they fell back below U.S. levels in 1985 illustrates

the power of exchange rate movements to bring about dramatic shifts in

relative labor costs (see Section 5 and especially Table 15 below).

     To assess their implications for competitiveness, labor costs must be

adjusted for productivity. Table 10 presents trends in unit labor costs in

iron and steel in five countries relative since 1964. It speaks to the

question of whether unit labor costs in the U.S. have been rising relatively

rapidly over time, thereby contributing the industry's competitive

difficulties. Before 1977, steel-industry unit labor costs actually rose less

rapidly in the United States. The U.S.-Japanese comparisons are of particular

interest. Although Japanese labor productivity nearly tripled in a period

when U.S. output per worker-hour rose by only 16 per cent, hourly earnings

rose much more rapidly in Japan, reflecting the low level from which they

started. Even though U.S. labor costs have been higher than Japan's, this

shrinking disadvantage cannot account for the American steel industry's
                                     -32--



continued loss of market share relative to Japan or for the industry's

worsening (as opposed to persisting) competitive difficulties.

     After 1977, conditions changed. The rise in hourly labor costs in the

U.S. vastly exceeded the comparable rise in the Japan. And while Japanese

labor productivity rose, U.S. productivity fell. In part productivity

trends reflect declining U.S. capacity utilization relative to capacity

utilization in Japan, which may itself reflect the competitiveness effects

with which we are concerned but in any case tends to exaggerate the underlying

productivity differential. Nonetheless, the different trends are indicative

of a rapidly worsening Unit cost problem for the U.S. in the second half of

the 1970s.

     Fuss and Waverman (1985, 1986) find a similar situation in motor

vehicles. They estimate that the trend rate of productivity growth in motor

vehicles during the period 1970-80 was 4.3 per cent per annum in Japan

compared to only 1.6 per cent per annum in the US. By 1980 American

producers, who possessed a considerable productivity advantage over their

Japanese competitors at the beginning of the 1970s, had fallen behind.

Combined with the labor-cost different apparent in Table 4.2, U.S. producers

were at a long run competitive disadvantage of approximately 12 per cent. As

in steel, U.S. producers' competitive difficulties were reinforced by

relatively low levels of capacity utilization.


     Labor Relations and Work Organization

     Labor productivity is not an exogenous variable to which labor costs must

adapt. It depends prominently on four sets of factors: labor relations, the

organization of work, physical investment, and technological change. Labor

relations have attracted particular attention in the automotive industry,

where Japanese work organization is sometimes viewed as a panacea for

productivity ills. Reflection and experimentation have led to the

realization that, while Japanese modes of organization provide useful lessons

for American industry, -it is neither feasible nor desirable simply to

transplant Japanese approaches. Among the lessons -is the inefficiency of an

adversarial labor-management relationship which neither vests workers with

responsibility for product quality nor taps their knowledge of the production

process, and the ability of an implicit contract promising job security to

reduce workers' fear that increased efficiency will lead to redundancy. How

to apply these lessons in the U.S. context is the unanswered question.

     In response to the Japanese example, automotive companies have adopted a

variety of "employee involvement programs."36 In the early 1970s, experiments

were conducted replacing the assembly line with work teams. Initially, sharp

separation was maintained between changes in work organization and bargaining

over compensation, in contrast to Japan. With the expansion of quality— and

productivity-related activities following the 1979 slump in auto sales,

however, negotiations over work organization have become increasingly

integrated with compensation issues, union leaders trading changes in work

rules and conditions for changes in compensation and profit sharing.

     To date, there exist no systematic comparisons of productivity in

otherwise equivalent plants using assembly-line and team-production methods.

Insofar as the main effect of the latter has been to increase the flow of

information between labor and management, it is hard to see how it could fail
                                     —34-.



to increase productivity. Whether the productivity increase is large is the

open question.


     Investment

     The other central determinants of productivity growth are investment and

technical progress. Insofar as technical progress in the steel, auto and

textile industries tends to be embodied in new plant and equipment, the

importance of investment is heightened. Investment in the basic industries

depends both on macroeconomic conditions and on sector-specific factors.

To highlight the latter, Figure 8 shows investment in U.S. basic industries as

shares of total manufacturing investment.37 After declining slightly in the

early 1970s, investment in the textile industry has remained steady, even

rising slightly as a share of manufacturing investment in the early 1980s.

The share of automotive investment is more volatile but, like textiles and in

contrast to steel, shows no decisive downward trend. The dramatic fall in

steel-industry investment over the past decade indicates that modernization

has not proceeded at the same rate as in textiles and autos and provides

additional evidence that future prospects for the U.S. steel industry are

bleaker than those for textiles and autos.

     Textile-industry investment reflects attempts to cut costs rather than to

expand capacity. Increasing the capital intensity of production enables firms

to minimize the consequences of relatively high U.S. wages.38 Open-ended

spinning (which produces four to five times the output of ring spindles), the

air—jet loom (which is three times as fast as the conventional shuttle) and

computerized finishing are viewed as essential elements of the campaign to

 increase productivity. That investment has been maintained despite more than

250 plant closings since 1979 suggests that a leaner but more modern textile

industry will survive into the foreseeable future. In these respects the

situation in automobiles -is similar to that in textiles, although there have

been instances in recent years where capacity expansion has figured in

investment decisions.

     The behavior of steel--industry investment --   or disinvestment --   differs
markedly from the automotive and textile cases. Spokesmen assert that the

American steel industry is vigorously "building for the future" by investing

in new technologies.39 However, calculations by Barnett and Schorsch (1983,

ch. 6) suggest that industry investment has been inadequate to maintain the

value of the capital stock since the early 1970s.4° In the last five years,

new expenditures have done little to offset depreciation of existing capital.

Moreover, before 1980 much of this investment took the form of the

development of new iron ore mines and iron pelletizing facilities, from which

a shrunken integrated sector now derives little benefit. Since 1980, much of

that investment which has been undertaken has gone into the construction of

minim-ills rather than the updating of integrated works. Crandall (1985)

calculates that Tobin's q (the market value of capacity in place relative to

its replacement cost) is on the order of 0.1 for the integrated segment of the

industry; it is not surprising that integrated firms, far from adding to

capacity, are closing plants and disinvesting as quickly as possible. At the

end of 1985, the most efficient minimill producers, in contrast to their

integrated brethren, had a q of roughly 1.15, providing scope for continued

investment.
                                     -36-


     This analysis of investment highlights two distinctions within the basic

industries. First, investment trends imply bleaker prospects for American

steel than for textiles and automobiles. Second, it is critically important

to distinguish the prospects of the minimill subsector from those of

integrated steel.


     Choice of Technology

     Choice of technology can exercise a decisive influence over production

costs and international competitiveness. U.S. producers have been indicted

for failing to adopt cost-minimizing technologies -including continuous casting

in steel and the air—jet loom in textiles. Since this debate has tended to

center on the choice of technology by the steel industry, this section

focuses on three recent developments in steel production: continuous casting,

the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), and the complex of technologies comprising the

minimill. (Section 7 below discusses subsequent innovations in steel and the

other basic industries.)

     Casting is the third of four main stages of primary steelmaking:

smelting, melting, casting and rolling. Continuous casting permits the

elimination of costly and time-consuming discont-inu-ities in the casting

process. In ingot casting, liquid steel is transfered by ladle from the

converter or furnace to ingot molds which are then trimmed, cooled and

solidified, after which the steel is withdrawn from the molds, reheated in

soaking pits and rolled into slabs, blooms or billets. In continuous casting,

liquid steel is transferred in an even stream first into a water-cooled mold

and then to a cooling chamber, from which it is continuously withdrawn by a
                                        —37—


system of rollers and upon solidifying is cut into pieces of the required

 length. The advantages of continuous casting include yield, which exceeds 95

per cent compared to approximately 80 per cent for semi-finished products made

by rolling ingots in slabbing or blooming/billet mill facilities; improvements

in metallurgical quality, including more consistent chemical composition and

fewer surface defects; energy saving due to the elimination of the

energy-intensive ingot processes; and increased productivity due to the

elimination of several labor-intensive stages in the production process.41.

     Following the development of experimental machines in the late 1940s,

commercial introduction of continuous casting occurred between 1952 and the

early 1960s. Continuous casting was first adopted on a large scale in the

late 1960s. Figure 9 compares the course of adoption in the U.S. and abroad,

illustrating the extent to which the U.S. has lagged other countries adopting

this technology. Although the American industry began to close the gap by

constructing or commissioning more than 16 continuous casters between 1981 and

1983, a sizeable shortfall remains.42

     Why has the U.S. lagged in adopting this innovation? The answer has

three components: differences in product mix, differences in related

technologies, and differences in rates of growth and investment among national

steel industries. Product mix matters because, until the 1970s, continuous

casters as installed in the U.S. and Western Europe were suitable only for

producing smaller sections (billets and blooms), which have a square cross

section and are therefore relatively easy to cast. Slab continuous casting as

developed in Japan is technologically more sophisticated than billet and bloom

continuous casting and until the 1970s was not widely utilized. In the 1960s

the share of U.S. crude steel production technically suited to billet and

bloom continuous casting was lower than in a number of European countr-ies.43

These differences in product mix are attributable to the composition of end

use. Flat-rolled products (sheets and plates, for example) are made from

slabs, whereas beams and rails are made from blooms, wire rod and small

structurals from billets. The U.S. industry's concentration on slabs partly

reflects the importance of U.S. the automobile industry in final demand.

     In addition, the cost savings derived from Continuous casting depend on

the type of furnace capacity in place. The diffusion of continuous casting

was favored by the presence of oxygen converters and retarded by the presence

of open hearth. As late as 1984, fully nine per cent of U.S. crude steel

production used the open-hearth furnace, a technology that had disappeared in

Japan and all but vanished in Europe.44 But there must be more to the story:

Figure 10 shows that, while the U.S. in 1984 had both a relatively low share

of continuously cast steel and a relatively high share of open hearth

capacity, there exists no simple relationship between the two variables.45

This is because the rate of adoption of continuous casting has also been

influenced by the rate of expansion of steel—industry capacity. Continuous

casters are difficult to append to existing integrated works whose furnaces

and rolling mills are not laid out in a manner which permits them to be easily

connected by a casting machine. Countries which added capacity in the late

'sixties and early 'seventies, before the application of Continuous casting to

slabs was perfected, are likely to have a smaller share of current output

continuously cast, while those who expanded their capacity subsequently tend

to have a larger share.46

     As our discussion of continuous casting makes clear, the the basic-oxygen

furnace had advantages. In addition to its compatibility with continuous

casting, the BOF, by replacing forced hot air with oxygen and relying solely

on the heat generated by molten ore, eliminated the need for external fuel

sources and reduced heat times by a factor of 12. Table 11 compares the

adoption of basic-oxygen furnaces by U.S. producers and their principal

industrial competitors.47 The U.S. lagged behind Japan in the adoption of the

BOF from the late 1950s and behind Europe from the mid—1970s. As in the case

of continuous casting, the lag reflects several factors. In the 1950s, when

the new technology came on line, U.S. steelmakers had a large amount of

open—hearth capacity in place. The cost savings of replacing an open hearth

in place with a BOF were less than the savings associated with installing a

BOF rather than an open hearth for countries committed to capacity expansion.

Rapidly growing national industries thus were better placed to install the new

technology. In addition, BOFs could accept a maximum of 30 per cent scrap

rather than the 50 per cent typical of open hearths; hence the relative

abundance of scrap in the U.S. attentuated their advantages. Finally,

entrepreneurial intertia cannot be dismissed; early BOFs were developed in

Europe rather than the U.S.. and American producers were slow to appreciate

the advantages of this foreign technology.48

     As Table 11 makes clear, some U.S. producers compensated for their

failure to adopt the BOF by installing electric arc furnaces instead. In

1984, the share of electric furnaces in U.S. utilized capacity was 25 per cent

greater than in the other countries considered. Advantages of electric

furnaces include small size and hence low capital requirements (minimum

efficient scale of an electric furnace is 0.8 million tons of steel annually

compared to 6 million tons for a BOF), ability to use 100 per cent scrap

 (eliminating the need for coke ovens and blast furnaces and reducing the cost

of raw material inputs by up to 50 per cent), and compatibility with

continuous casting. Karlson (1986) explains the growth of electric furnace

capacity in the U.S. largely on the basis of these factors.

     The electric furnace is a central component of the complex of

technologies comprising the minimill. Mi nmills can be constructed for a

fraction of the capital cost of a new integrated mill. Using electric

furnaces in conjunction with continuous casters and a rolling mill, they

initially tended to locate in scrap-abundant regions isolated from integrated

producers by transport costs. Most ininimill firms have not been organized by

the USWA; they pay lower wages and operate under more flexible work rules than

their integrated competitors. They have concentrated mainly on simple,

low-value-added products such as wire rod and reinforcing bar that need not be

produced to high metallurgical standards, leaving to integrated producers the

flat—rolled sheet used in automobiles and appliances. Many minimill firms are

increasingly adapting their methods to the production of high quality bars and

rods, however, and are expected to enter the market for sheet products by the

end of the decade.49 Since U.S. imports tend to be produced by foreign

integrated firms (despite the growing importance of Japanese and Canadian

minimills), the import penetration ratio in the market segment relevant to

minimills is considerably lower than for the American steel industry as a

whole. The same transport costs which provide minimills natural protection

from domestic integrated competitors provide protection from imports. This
                                     -41-


market segmentation has begun to break down, however, as minimill firms have

expanded their capacity, moved into product lines traditionally dominated by

integrated works, and penetrated the home turf of integrated firms.

     The financial performance of the minimill firms has been consistently

superior to that of their integrated competitors.5° While a number of these

firms have recently experienced financial difficulties, rendering

overoptimistic the enthusiasm of some early analysts, as a group they

continued to outperform their integrated competitors and now account for about

16 per cent of the US, market and 22 per cent of domestic shipments.

Increasingly it appears that the U.S. industry is bifurcating into a

relatively healthy minimill subsector and a declining integrated subsector.

     As the example of minimills illustrates, U.S. steel producers remain

active in adopting new technologies. At the same time, their record

illustrates the disadvantages of an early start: having installed large

amounts of capacity in the 1940s and 1950s before the new technologies were

available, those established producers who dominated the integrated sector

were ill placed to adopt subsequent alternatives.

     Energy Prices

     Higher energy prices have had two sets of countervailing effects on the

competitive position of U.S. basic industries. Insofar as steel and vehicles

are more energy intensive than other sectors, higher energy costs raise prices

and reduce industry employment both at home and abroad. At the same time,

since the share of energy in total costs is greater in the EC and Japan than

in the U.S., higher energy prices tend to strengthen the competitive position

of the U.S. industries vis a vis their foreign counterparts.51 The share of
                                       -42--



energy in total costs has been relatively low in the U.S. due to abundant

domestic energy supplies and minimal energy taxation. The importance of these

effects varies greatly across industries, however. At one extreme, since

textile and apparel manufacturing is far from energy intensive, any

comparative advantage accruing to the U.S. has been minimal.52 At the other

extreme, energy costs have a major impact on the demand for automobiles and

are a major element in steel production. As of 1976, coal, fuel oil, natural

gas and electricity accounted for a quarter of major input costs in the U.S.

steel industry. Although the impact of changes in energy costs on U.S. steel

employment is theoretically ambiguous, Grossman (1986) estimates that U.S.

steel-industry employment would have been 3,500 greater in 1976-78 had there

been no change in the relative price of energy, and that higher energy prices

led to the loss of an additional 3,000 jobs between 1979 and 1983. Insofar

as the relative price of energy has fallen subsequently, these effects have

been working in the other direction.



5.   Government Policy and Competitiveness

     Government policies affecting the basic industries are of two types:

policies explicitly designed to influence output and employment in steel,

autos, textiles and apparel (trade policy, adjustment assistance) and policies

targeted at the economy as a whole but with a special impact on those

industries (macroeconomic policy, pollution abatement regulations).
                                     —43—


     Trade Policy

     U.S. policies governing trade in steel, autos, textiles and apparel

differ from trade policy for other industries by virtue of their reliance on

nontariff measures, notably voluntary export restraints. These forms of trade

policy tend to be implemented in an incremental basis and to have a variety of

unintended consequences which introduce unusual distortions into the pattern

of basic industry trade.

     Textiles illustrate those features which distinguish U.S. basic-industry

trade policy from trade policy for other sectors and show how a presumption of

protection comes to be built in to the policy debate with the passage of time.

Voluntary export restraints by Japanese producers were first negotiated in

1937. This agreement established the precedent of handling textile trade

policy separately from the general trade program. In 1955, with Japan's

admission to the GAIT, tariffs on her exports were cut but replaced less than

a year later by VER5 and a five-year plan f or controlling cotton textile and

apparel exports to the US. Thus, nontariff barriers have been a feature of

U.S. textile market for fully half a century. Initially, U.S. textile trade

policy was unique; subsequently, its distinguishing features -— long—lived

protection, reliance on voluntary export restraints, and industry-specific

negotiations —- spread to other basic industries, notably automobiles and

steel.

     Following an interlude during which textile imports were restricted by

the Short-Term Arrangement on Cotton Textile Trade (1961-62) and the

subsequent Long-Term Arrangement (1962-73), the Multif-iber Agreement (MFA) was

concluded as part of the 1973 GAIT negotiations. The Long—Term Agreement had
                                     -44-


departed from GAIT rules for manufactured goods by permitting import

 restrictions to be applied unilaterally, selectively and without compensation

 to the exporter. Moreover, by restricting imports of cotton textiles without

affecting imports of man-made fibers and apparel, these agreements induced

developing countries to shift into the production of the latter. This

provided impetus for the negotiation of a more comprehensive agreement, the

MFA, which initially restricted the growth of textile imports from Japan to

five per cent per annum and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia

to 7-7 1/2 per cent per annum. Imports from new entrants and small suppliers

were treated more favorably. Governments were permitted to impose unilateral

import controls in the event of market disruption (defined as serious damage

to the domestic industry) and to negotiate lower rates of import growth for

items upon which domestic producers were particularly dependent. Quotas were

established through the negotiation of bilateral agreements covering more than

80 per cent of U.S. textile and apparel imports in 1980. Since then, the

quota system has been tightened further. In 1986, when Congress passed a

textile quota bill and attempted to override the President's veto, the U.S.

adopted new agreements with Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The first of these,

for example, limits import growth to 0.8 per cent per annum, compared to 8.6

per cent from 1981 to 1984, and extends coverage to silk blends, ramie and

linen, fibers into which foreign producers have moved in response to previous

restrictions.

     Estimating the effects of textile trade policy is rendered difficult by

the nontariff nature of the restrictions and the differentiated nature of the

product (creating problems which arise in attempts to assess automotive and
                                     -45--



steel industry trade policy as well).55 Fortunately, for at least some foreign

products it is possible to estimate tariff equivalents indirectly. For the

case of Hong Kong, where export quotas are freely traded, Hamilton (1986) used

data on the unit values of U.S. textile imports and the market value of quotas

to calculate the import tariff equivalent of U.S. quotas. These tariff

equivalents, shown in Figure 11, are both substantial and variable.

     Nontariff barriers have significantly reduced U.S. imports of textile

products. The value of U.S. textile and apparel imports (in equivalent square

yards) grew by only 1.3 per cent per annum between 1973 and 1981, while their

composition shifted from textiles to apparel, reflecting differential

treatment of the two categories under the MFA. Over the 1970s, the apparel

share of U.S. textile and apparel imports rose from 35 to 58 per cent.

Insofar as the U.S. possesses a comparative advantage in the production of

highly tailored, high-value-added merchandise rather than unfinished cloth,

this side-effect of quotas has functioned to the disadvantage of the domestic

industry.

    Since 1981, import growth has accelerated to 15 per cent per annum. How

could this occur under the provisions of the MFA? First, a newly-negotiated

bilateral agreement with the Peoples Republic of China permitted quota growth

of 10 per cent per annum. Second, the NICs moved into those few remaining

categories not under quota. Third, production shifted to countries such as

Sri Lanka and Mauritius for which quotas did not exist. Fourth, merchandise

may have been shipped through third countries for which quotas were not

binding. The incentive to respond in these ways was undoubtedly heightened by

the dollar's sharp appreciation, which enhanced the profitability of exporting

to the U.S. market. The American response was predictable. Firms lobbied for

a tightening of import restrictions and, starting in December 1983, the

Administration moved to establish 300 new textile quotas and to prevent their

circumvention by trans-shipping through third countries. The rate of growth

of textile imports fell to less than seven per cent in 1985. In effect, it

appears that the rate of growth of U.S. imports is given exogenously by policy

in the long run, despite various forms of slippage which offer scope for a

positive price elasticity of supply over short periods of time.

     Calculations by l-lufbauer, et al. (1986) imply that restraints depressed

U.S. textile and apparel imports by approximately 28 per cent in 1981. While

offering widely differing estimates of the effect of imports on output and

employment, studies of the textile industry uniformly conclude that output and

employment effects are likely to be smaller than changes in import volumes.

Quotas increase domestic production by less than they reduce imports because

they raise domestic prices, reducing market demand. The percentage change in

domestic textile-industry employment should be roughly equal to the change in

domestic production.56 Using assumptions such as these, Hufbauer, et al.

(1986) calculate that protection permitted the retention in 1981 of 150,000

jobs in textiles and 390,000 in apparel, increasing the total by 26 per cent.

Given the inelasticity of consumer demand for textiles and apparel, domestic

consumers paid a high price per job, on the order of $37,000 1981 dollars.

     The American steel industry is another long-time recipient of protection,

the sector's early growth having been greatly stimulated by shelter from

British competition. U.S. steel trade policy takes two forms, one

traditional, one uniquely modern. The traditional form is ant-idumping law,
                                        —47—


 which protects domestic producers against sales below cost and price

 discrimination by foreign competitors. Both practices are prevalent in the

 steel industry, since their capital intensity compels foreign firms 'to sell

below average cost during cyclical downturns, and since cartelization and

protection permit them to export at prices below those prevailing in their

home markets. The U.S. has had statutes to deter predatory pricing in

international trade for more than 60 years. Since 1g74, antidumping

investigations have focused on the "constructed value" criterion for dumping,

according to which the U.S. estimates foreign material and fabrication costs

and levies an antidumping duty if import prices fall short of those costs plus

fixed margins for general expenses and profits. This constructed value

criterion provided considerable incentive for U.S. producers to file

antidumping suits, which soon exceeded the government's capacity to process

them. This led in 1977 to the Trigger Price Mechanism (1PM), under which the

government monitored steel imports and, upon finding that steel was imported

at a price below reference prices based on the constructed value of Japanese

steel, automatically triggered a Treasury investigation. The 1PM operated

only so long as the industry refrained from filing antidumping Suits. The

advantages of this mechanism, from an administrative viewpoint, were that it

not only eliminated the burden of antidumping suits but provided the

authorities some insulation from industry pressures. But the 1PM contained

many special features and unintended effects, some of which worked to the U.S.

industry's advantage, others which worked against it (for details, see

Eichengreen and van der Ven, 1984). Ultimately, the industry concluded that

the latter dominated and filed antidumping suits, leading to the TPM's

suspension and in 1982 to its demise.
                                    -48-


     The second, uniquely modern form that U.S. steel trade policy takes is

VERs like those in textile trade. VERs were negotiated with the Japanese and

European steel industries in 1968, implemented in 1969 and renewed in 1972.

Following the first oil shock and the steel market slump, the U.S. imposed a

series of increasingly stringent trade restrictions, including new VERs and

antidumping investigations culminating in the TPM. VERs on steel like VERs on

textiles were a mixed blessing. As in textiles, foreign suppliers responded

by trading up, shifting to higher value products in which the U.S. might

normally be thought to have a comparative advantage. As in textiles, sales by

nonsignatory countries tended to replace restrained imports, and there were

reports of shipments diverted through third countries. Once VERs were

replaced by the TPM, a "somewhat porous price floor" (Barnett and Schorsch,

1983, p. 240) for steel products was established, and the import share of the

U.S. market stabilized in the neighborhood of 15 per cent.57 That the TPM's

coverage was not limited to foreign producers who were party to explicit

agreements was a major advantage from the U.S. industry's point of view.

     Since the TPM's collapse in 1982, U.S. steel trade has again been

governed by VERs. These differ from early agreements by defining permissible

imports as shares of the U.S. market. 1985 VERs were designed to limit import

penetration to 20.5 per cent of the steel market. European producers agreed

to restrain their U.S. sales to shares of U.S. apparent consumption ranging

from 2.2 per cent for tin plate to 21.85 per cent for sheet piling.

Additional VERs were negotiated with Mexico, Brazil and South Africa, and by

the end of 1985 the number of VERs had increased to 15, covering 80 per cent

of the U.S. market. Quotas are administered by the exporting countries via
                                     —49-


licensing systems. As a quid pro quo for these agreements, the U.S. industry

has refrained from filing antidumping suits against participating countries.

     These VERs have not prevented imports from capturing a rising share of

the U.S. market since 1981. Their coverage is incomplete (Canada as well as

Argentina and Taiwan are excluded), and they can be circumvented by many of

the devices utilized by textile producers. At the same time, their impact is

reflected in the fact that the import penetration ratio fell from 26.2 to 20.5

per cent the month following the conclusion of the mid-1985 VERs. One can get

a sense of the stringency of these agreements by noting that the red cast-iron

telephone booths sold off by British Telecom as souveniers have been counted

against the European steel quota.

     Since steel products are heterogeneous and import restrictions take

nonprice forms, measuring their impact is not straightforward. The percent

premium of spot export prices over the U.S. user price is probably the best

measure of the tariff equivalent of VERs and countervailing duties.58 As shown

in Figure 12, except during the 1973-74 commodity boom, when imports subsided

and U.S. exports rose, U.S. user prices have consistently remained above

foreign export prices. The differential hovered in the range of 15 to 30 per

cent over the second half of the 1970s and subsequently grew to nearly 40 per

cent, confirming the increasing stringency of U.S. import restraints.

Measured as tariff equivalents, levels of protection received by the industry

are substantial.

     Tsao (1985) estimates for 1983-84 that VERs reduced U.S. imports from the

EC by 17 per cent and total U.S. imports by 15 per cent. A Department of

Commerce study estimates that net imports caused a loss of 148,000 jobs in

steel in 1984; together with Tsao's estimate of the change in imports (and

assuming no change in exports), this implies that U.S. import restrictions

increased steel industry employment by 22,000 workers, or by 15 per cent.59

Grossman's (1986) estimates, in contrast, are predicated upon an elasticity of

production employment with respect to import prices of approximately unity.

Attributing the entire divergence of U.S. user prices from European spot

export prices to the effects of VERs, this implies that U.S. trade

restrictions, by raising effective import prices by 30 per cent, increased

production employment by the same percentage.60 This higher figure should be

regarded as an upper bound, since other variables affecting employment,

notably steelworkers' wages, would have adjusted to the change in import

prices caused by the elimination of VERs; allowing wages to change by the same

percentage as import prices halves the change in production employment, again

resulting in an estimate of 15 per cent. Still other estimates of the change

in production employment are slightly lower (Hufbauer et al., 1986; Cantor,

1984).

      U.S. automotive trade policy takes the same form -—   voluntary   restraints
--   as policy toward textiles and steel. Explicit VERs for automotive trade

are a relatively recent innovation for which textile and steel policies

provided inspiration. Until the mid-1970s, the growing U.S. market share

of Japan was perceived as coming mostly at the expense of Germany and the U.K.

As late as 1910, Japan accounted for less than 20 per cent of total U.S.

imports (see Table 12). But once the first oil—price shock shifted demand

toward smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, Japanese producers were well

situated to expand their exports. By 1979 Japan accounted for more than half

of total U.S. imports and for 15 per cent of the domestic market. In response

to industry complaints, the U.S. then negotiated a voluntary restraint

agreement under which the Japanese agreed to reduce car exports in the year

beginning April 1, 1981 by 7.7 per cent. Japanese exports were held to the

same level for two subsequent years, after which the ceiling was raised by 10

per cent. In 1985 MITI declined to renew the VERs in light of the record

earnings of U.S. automakers, although the Japanese continue to restrain their

exports to the U.S. using traditional forms of administrative guidance.

     As in steel and textiles, auto-industry VERs gave rise to a variety of

distortions. They provided Japanese producers an incentive to shift into

jeeps and light trucks not covered by the initial agreement (although this

loophole was closed subsequently). They encouraged the export of components,

leading Congress to consider domestic-content legislation. They provided

nations not covered by the agreement, notably those of Europe, an incentive to

increase shipments to the U.S., and encouraged entry by other foreign

producers, notably Korea and Yugoslavia. They led to direct investment by

Japanese producers in the United States (see Section 7 below).   They provided

an incentive for trading up, as Japanese producers shifted into the sale of

more luxurious vehicles.

     The effects of quota agreements are difficult to estimate because of the

extent of trading up. Feenstra (1984) has estimated that two-thirds of the

post-agreement rise in Japanese car prices reflected quality change, yielding

an estimate of the increase in quality-adjusted import prices in 1981—82 much

smaller than those of other of other authors.61 He estimates that the reduction

in import volumes and rise in import prices increased domestic production by
                                       —52—


8-9 per cent in the first year of VERs and increased production employment by

somewhat less (because of the existence of excess capacity).62 However,

Feenstr&s estimates for 1981-82, a period when U.S. auto demand remained

relatively depressed, may understate the impact fixed import quotas have had

in subsequent years as the domestic market has expanded. Comparisons of the

prices of a Toyota Corolla or a Nissan Sentra -in Japan and the U.S. (e.g.

Crandall, 1986) show that American consumers, who had paid $500 more than

Japanese consumers in 1979-80 before the imposition of VERs, paid $3000 more

in 1985. Assuming that the initial $500 reflects transportation and

preparation, this suggests a tariff—equivalent in excess of 25 per cent

(assuming an $8,000 U.S. sales price). As domestic demand has grown and

quotas have become more binding, their domestic price and output effects

appear to have increased. Auto import restraints are defined as absolute

levels, in contrast to steel import restraints which are denominated as market

shares. One would expect the former to grow more stringent over time. On the

other hand, as new countries have entered the U.S. market -—partly in response

to Japanese VERs --   the effects of these restraints may have been attenuated.

    U.S. Industrial Policies

    U.S. industrial policies fall into three categories: export promotion

programs, investment subsidies for modernization, and import protection. The

more internationally competitive a U.S. industry, the more policymakers tend

to concentrate on export promotion schemes; the less competitive, the more

they tend to concentrate on import protection. Not surprisingly, the

predominant form of assistance for the U.S. basic industries has been import
                                     —53--



protection. Policy toward the steel industry, for example, has been almost

exclusively of this form.

     Policy toward the textile industry has been more diverse. The Commerce

Department has lobbied for the removal of foreign barriers to U.S. textile

exports. For nearly two decades it has assisted U.S. textile and apparel

producers wishing to develop export sales by helping them locate foreign sales

agents, holding exhibitions, and organizing seminars on export marketing.

While the U.S. industry has developed a few successful exports, notably blue

jeans, it has essentially remained an import-competing rather than an

exporting sector; in consequence, industry-wide trends in output, employment

and profitability have been little affected by Commerce Department

activities.63 In addition, the industry has received federal low interest

loans through the Public Works and Economic Development Act (EDA) of 1965, the

Trade Acts of 1962 and 1974, and the Small Business Administration Program.

Each of these schemes made funds available to firms unable to secure them

through normal channels, so long as there was a reasonable expectation of

repayment and the proceeds were used for expansion or modernization of

capacity. In practice, the textile and apparel industries have not been major

recipients of funds from these programs.

     Although U.S. policy toward the automobile industry is dominated by

import restraints, financial subsidies have also been important, notably in

the case of Chrysler. Assistance to Chrysler starting -in 1979 took the form

of government loan guarantees, which subsidized borrowing by a firm for which

the cost of credit would otherwise have been prohibitive due to bankruptcy

risk. The availability of funds for modernization, in conjunction with the
                                     —54—


upturn in the U.S. auto market and the imposition of VERs upon Japan,

permitted Chrysler to repay its government-guaranteed loans. That the loans

were repaid does not change the fact that the government guarantee was a

subsidy to the firm.

     Besides protection, the most important form of U.S. policy toward the

basic industries has been adjustment assistance. Adjustment assistance is

designed to provide retraining, education and transitional income for the

newly unemployed. In practice, income transfers have been much more important

than training schemes. According to Arpan et al. (1982), approximately 95 per

cent of adjustment assistance to former apparel-industry have gone into

allowances to replace lost earnings rather than retraining or education. The

number of workers that have been placed by the employment service remains

negligible.


     Macroeconomic Policy and Real Exchange Rates

     Until recently, economists would have found it difficult to convince

laymen that monetary and fiscal policies rather than sector-specific events

had exercised a decisive impact on the basic industries. However, the

dramatic post-1981 real appreciation of the dollar and its relationship to the

monetary-fiscal mix have heightened awareness of the importance of

macroeconomic f actors.64 In addition, the severity of the post-1979 recession

has reminded observers of the sensitivity of the steel and automobile

industries, as producers of durable goods and of inputs into their

manufacture, to macroeconomic conditions (see Section 3 above).

    The budget deficits of the 1980s, combined with a tight anti—inflationary

monetary policy, drove up the relative price of domestic goods by causing a
                                     -55-


rapid real appreciation of the dollar. The dollar's strength was a correlary

of the capital inflow needed to absorb the debt issued to finance the deficit,

and was reinforced by greater aggregate demand at home than abroad, which

required for product market equilibrium that demand be shifted away from

domestic goods (see Frankel, this volume). This real appreciation of the

dollar impacted the basic industries because production costs in those

industries are affected by economy-wide conditions and are imperfectly

flexible in own-currency terms. For example, the 58 per cent rise in the

multilateral trade-weighted value of the dollar between 1980 and 1984

dramatically reduced the dollar value of the wages paid by foreign steel,

textile and automobile producers. Table 13 shows the dramatic decline in

German hourly earnings in manufacturing expressed in U.S. dollars and the

smaller but nonetheless significant decline in Japanese dollar-denominated

labor costs over the period 1980:2-1985:1, when the value of the dollar rose

by more than 80 per cent against the Deutchmark and rose by nearly 20 per cent

against the Yen. The rise in dollar-denominated foreign labor costs during

the subsequent period of dollar depreciation is equally dramatic, although

the relationship between the Yen and the Deutchmark -is reversed: whereas the

fall in the nominal yen/dollar rate is nearly twice as fast the second period

as its rise in the first, the fall in the Deutchmark/dollar rate is less than

half as rapid in the second period as its rise in the first.

    Nontariff barriers tend to reduce the price sensitivity of U.S. imports

of basic industry products and hence to limit the impact of real exchange

rates on employment in import-competing sectors. In addition, changes over

time in the height of these nontariff barriers renders the price elasticity of

production employment extremely difficult to estimate. Estimates in the

appendix (Table A.1) suggest that this elasticity ranges from roughly —0.2 in

textiles and apparel to -0.5 in automobiles and steel. According to these

estimates, the real appreciation of the dollar between the second half of the

1970s and the first half of the 1980s reduced employment in textiles and

apparel by nearly 4 per cent and employment in motor vehicles and steel by

nearly 10 per cent (Table A.2). The greater impact of exchange-rate changes

on autos and steel than on textiles and apparel makes sense when one observes

that the dollar has fluctuated most dramatically (especially since the

beginning of 1985) not against the currencies of developing countries which

are the principal suppliers of textile exports to the U.S. market but against

the currencies of industrial countries such as Germany and Japan which are the

main suppliers of autos and steel.


     Pollution Abatement Expenditures

     Unlike industry spokesmen, who attach great weight to the impact on

international competitiveness of U.S. pollution abatement expenditures,

academic analyses have generally concluded that the effects of these costs

have been small. Table 14 shows pollution control expenditures as shares of

GNP and investment for 1975, when concern over improving environmental quality

was at its height. U.S. expenditure shares exceed those of its industrial

competitors, with the notable exception of Japan. Table 15 presents three

estimates of environmental expenditure as shares of industry output or final

demand for the U.S. basic industries and import—competing industry as a whole.

Direct costs of environmental regulation include the capital, operating and

administrative costs of pollution abatement. Direct and indirect costs

include in addition the expenditures of other sectors which produce inputs

into the industries in question. Direct and indirect costs of all regulation

add estimates of the costs of health, safety and economic regulation

(including price and entry restrictions).

     The steel industry stands out for its disproportionate direct costs. The

only other industries with comparable burdens are non-ferrous metal mining,

paper products, nonagricultural mechnicals, electric power generation and the

government sector.65 In contrast, the direct environmental quality

expenditures of the textile, apparel and automotive industries are well below

the U.S. average. When both direct and indirect costs are considered, costs

to the steel industry remain above average, but to a lesser extent. Once

other regulatory (notably mileage and carbon-dioxide-related) costs are added,

vehicles join steel with regulatory burdens in excess of the U.S.

average. Clearly, regulatory costs have affected steel and automobiles very

differently than textiles and apparel.

     Figure 13 takes a closer look at the direct pollution abatement

expenditures of the U.S. and Japanese steel industries.66 Japanese

expenditures per ton of steel output peaked in 1976. (1976 also marked the

peak of Japanese environmental control expenditures as a share of total

investment, at 21 per cent.) Japanese expenditures fell thereafter, although

they turned up in the early 1980s when more stringent water pollution, dust

and soot regulations were imposed. U.S. expenditures also rose in the early

1970s, but from a lower level, and remained stable at a higher plateau into

the 1980$. Although the time profile of expenditure differed across
Figure 13

countries, there is little evidence that the U.S. industry bore a heavier

burden overall.

     At the same time, expenditures by both the U.S. and Japanese steel

industries have vastly exceeded those of semi-industrialized countries where

the pressure to improve environmental quality generally is less intense,

placing both industries at something of a disadvantage relative to

competititors in lower-income countries.67 Looking across industries, Kalt

(1985) finds that higher environmental costs have led to a significant

deterioration in U.S. trade performance. As incomes in developing countries

continue to rise and their demands for environmental protection grow, any U.S.

disadvantage due to environmental regulation can be expected to decline. But

this is likely to be a source of little relief in the decades immediately

ahead.



6.   Wider Impact on the U.S. Economy

     Import penetration and declining basic-industry employment have wider

implications for the American economy. Of the various effects that might be

considered, this section focuses on three: implications for the current

account of the balance of payments, implications for the income distribution,

and implications for the regional location of industrial activity.

     On the surface, the basic industries appear to have contributed

significantly to the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Steel imports are least

important in the aggregate: in 1984, U.S. steel imports were only three per

cent of total merchandise imports, and the deficit on trade in steel was only

eight per cent of the total merchandise deficit. The figures for textiles and
                                     —59-


apparel are larger: textile and apparel imports were 5.8 per cent of total

U.S. merchandise imports, while the textile and apparel deficit was 14.1 per

cent of the overall merchandise trade deficit. The most important basic

industry deficit was that in motor vehicle trade: passenger cars accounted

for 9.1 per cent of U.S. imports and 22.4 per cent of the deficit. Thus,

together these four basic industries accounted for 44.5 per cent of the

merchandise trade deficit.

     It does not follow from this fact that trends in the basic industries

are a cause of the current account deficit in any meaningful economic sense.

The current account is a macroeconomic variable determined by relationships

among other macroeconomic variables, notably by any imbalance between savings

and investment. Thus, the current account deficit results ultimately from

those macroeconomic policies influencing aggregate savings and investment

behavior. Developments affecting particular industries determine only the

composition of the current account, not its level. Trends in the basic

industries influence the current account only insofar as their prospects

affect the economy-wide investment climate or their performance affects

economy—wide levels of employment and profitability sufficiently to alter the

aggregate level of savings.

     Observers of the American economy have expressed concern that the real

incomes of wage earners have failed to rise at historical rates or to keep

pace with the cost of living. As Figure 7 indicates, the declining shares of

steel and motor vehicles in total manufacturing employment represent a

shift from high wage categories of manufacturing employment to lower paid

jobs. The elimination of "quality jobs," it is suggested, lowers blue—collar

earnings and reduces labor's share of national income.

     Were imports of steel and motor vehicles suddenly eliminated, employment

in these -industries could be considerably expanded even if the wage premia

enjoyed by steel— and auto-workers were maintained. But whether average

blue-collar earnings and labor's share of GNP rose or fell would depend on who

financed the redistribution. The standard economic argument is that those

factors of production used most intensively by the protected industries would

benefit, while factors used intensively by other sectors would pay for the

redistribution. That steel and motor vehicle production is highly capital

intensive compared to the economy as a whole suggests that protection for

steel and automobiles would raise the demand for capital more than demand for

labor. Shareholders would be the principal beneficiaries of protection for

the steel and vehicle industries. While workers with industry-specific skills

would benefit in the short run, in the long run artificial stimulus for these

industries is likely to reduce -—   not    increase ——   labor's   share of national

income.

     The relative decline of the U.S. basic industries has major implications

for the regional distribution of manufacturing employment. Tables 16 through

19 show how employment in apparel, textiles, steel and vehicles has been

concentrated regionally and how that concentration has shifted over time.

Apparel—industry employment, for example, already concentrated at the

beginning of the 1970s in the Middle Atlantic region has tended to shift south

and westward (see Table 16). In large part this reflects the attractions of

low wage labor in regions where unionization rates are low. Trends in

textiles (Table 17) resemble those in apparel. Textile-industry employment is

concentrated in six South Atlantic states, with North Carolina, South Carolina

and Georgia alone accounting for more than half of total industry employment.

This geographical concentration has continued to increase over time.

     Steel industry employment has been concentrated traditionally in Western

Pennsylvania, the vicinity of the Great Lakes and, to a lesser extent,

California. Compared to the coasts, the Midwest retains a small margin of

natural protection due to the transport costs of shipping steel from Europe or

Japan.68 Table 18 again reflects a tendency for industry to migrate toward

the low-wage, nonunionized South, where the growth of minimills has been

particularly rapid. The Mid-Atlantic has been particularly hard hit by the

decline in steel industry employment.

     Motor vehicle industry employment is concentrated, of course, in the East

North Central (Table 19). But in this industry also, employment has tended

to migrate toward the East South Central and South Atlantic regions.

     A decline in basic industry employment need not imply either a persistent

unemployment problem or the disappearance of manufacturing jobs. A dramatic

counterexample is provided by Massachusetts, where a transition from dependence

on the textile industry to sectors based on new technologies has been

successfully completed (for details, see Ferguson and Ladd, 1986). Yet this

experience is does not provide a case for untempered optimism. Massachusetts

suffered from unemployment in excess of the national average for an extended

period prior to its post-1975 recovery; thus, its experience does not suggest

that adjustment will be either quick or painless. Second, the reduction in

Massachusetts unemployment resulted not from exceptional rates of job creation

but from below average population and labor force growth. Unemployment fell

because Massachusetts was no less successful than the rest of the country in
                                      -62-


creating new jobs (a significant achievement itself) and because the

Commonwealth's depressed economy discouraged in-migration. Third,

Massachusetts has singular advantages that enable it to exploit the

opportunities offered by high-tech industries, notably a large educational

complex. Whether other states can complete their transition with the same

success remains to be determined. But by demonstrating the role of an

educational infrastructure -in facilitating the transfer of resources, the

Massachusetts example may contain lessons for the design of public policy

toward the regional problem.



7.   Response of the Industries

     Two avenues for enhancing competitiveness --   reducing   input costs and

obtaining additional protection -- have already been addressed. This section

considers three additional means to this end: the development of new products

and processes, investment -in the U.S. by foreign companies, and

diversification.


     New Products and Processes

     Criticism of U.S. basic industries for lagging their foreign

competititors in the adoption of new technologies should not be allowed to

obscure the technological dynamism of many firms. For the basic industries,

advances in manufacturing methods offer more promise than the development of

new products. The speed of process innovation will depend on the success with

which basic industries apply new technologies developed -in the high-tech

sector. Much progress has already taken place. In the steel industry,
                                     -63-


automation and computer control of continuous-caster operations enhance

control of caster speed, liquid levels and cooling rates while reducing labor

requirements. Computers are increasingly used to regulate fuel consumption in

rolling processes and to control the quality of feed input in blast furnaces.

     Even in an industry whose output is apparently as homogenous as steel,

there is scope for product innovation. Ladle refining systems, which permit

the production of higher quality 'clean1' steel, have been widely adopted in

recent years. Five electrolytic galvanizing lines, recently completed or

currently under construction, promise to increase by 500 per cent the

industry's capacity to supply the automotive industry with corrosion

resistant, uniformly formable electrogalvanized steel. Lasers are used to

refine the magnetic domain structure of electrical steel for transformers,

improving product quality and permitting a price premium to be charged.69

     Process innovation in the automotive industry is proceeding apace.7°

Microprocessor-controlled flexible machining centers capable of fabricating

parts for power-steering pumps and alternators have recently been introduced.

These machines can change tools without operator assistance as needed for new

jobs. Assembling the parts produced by such machines into completed

components is a more delicate task; machines with these capabilities remain at

the prototype stage, although robotics have been applied to stamping and to

engine, body and final assembly.71 Computer numerical control has been

introduced into engine and transmission machining. Computer-aided design has

reduced design costs and lead times, while computer-aided engineering has

reduced the cost of skilled tool-room labor. Computer modeling of production

flows has reduced inventory costs, enhanced stock control, and helped to

automate product inspection.
                                     —64—


     As with steel, the scope for product innovation in the motor vehicle

industry is less extensive than in many other sectors. Rather than

fundamental changes in the nature of vehicles, it principally takes the form

of incremental innovations which enhance their capabilities. For example,

on—board computers are increasingly used to monitor engine performance.

Electronic traction and skid control can be used to enhance operator control.

While the cumulative impact of these improvements can be substantial, it

remains unlikely, as Altshuler et al. (1984) conclude, that in the foreseeable

future product innovation will radically transform the automobile.

     In the textile and apparel industries, technological progress has been

less rapid. Nonetheless, at the grading stage, new computer methods are

available for selecting the best combination of fibers for a given end use and

for eliminating the blend variations associated with hand feeding. At the

spinning and weaving stages, technological progress has already led to

refinements of existing technology. At the assembly stage, modest

technological advances, such as the automated pocket-maker, have been adopted

by many firms. The cost of these new technologies is prohibitive for all but

the largest producers.   This will be even more the case once research

currently underway in Japan and New England leads to the development of

flexible sewing systems based on robot technology like that already in place

in the automobile industry.72

     What relief from import competition does innovation offer the U.S. basic

industries? Although process innovations will remain a critical determinant

of comparative production costs, it is unlikely that their adoption will

eliminate the gap between production costs in the U.S. and in its industrial
                                     -65—


competitors, notably Japan. New technologies applicable to the basic

 industries diffuse rapidly among industrial countries; there is no reason to

anticipate that the U.S. will be able to appropriate such technologies and

sustain a competitive advantage by adopting them to a greater extent than

other industrial countries. Insofar as new manufacturing methods entail the

substitution of capital for labor, new technologies that increase the scope

for substitution may reduce the disadvantage of U.S. basic industries

vis—a—vis their LDC competitors. But as the NICs continue to develop and

their labor costs rise in the manner of Japan's, the importance of such

savings will shrink.

     Competitive advantages due to product innovation derive from producers'

ability to tailor new products to the tastes and requirements of consumers.

The proximity of U.S. producers to what remains a relatively large domestic

market situates them favorably in this effort to adapt their products to the

preferences of consumers and end users. The production of electrogalvanized

steel for the U.S. automobile industry and designer clothing by the apparel

industry, cited above, illustrate this potential. Yet the sobering example of

the auto industry in the 1970s is a reminder that mere proximity to the market

is no guarantee of success in tailoring products to final demand.


     Joint Ventures and Onshore Production by Foreign Firms

     The advent of Japanese automobile production in the United States is the

most visible illustration of a general trend. Honda now operates a plant in

Marysville, Ohio and Nissan one in Smyrna, Tenessee, while Toyota and GM

jointly produce a small car in what was formerly GM's Fremont, California
                                     -66-


assembly plant. Together these three operations produced more than 500,000

vehicles in 1986. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu/Fuji have plans for plants in

Michigan, Illinois and Indiana, respectively. In 1984, Nisshin Steel acquired

a stake in Wheeling-Pittsburgh and Nippon Kokan obtained half of National

Steel, while in 1986 Kawasaki Steel acquired half of California Steel.

Moreover, there is an increasing foreign presence in the U.S. minimill

sector.

     To some extent these arrangements represent attempts to import Japanese

technology, management and labor-relations techniques in efforts to boost

productivity. For example, workers at the Nissan and Honda plants and at

California Steel's plant in Fontana are organized into teams responsible not

only for regular production duties but for inspection, materials handling and

housekeeping.73 Moreover, onshore production enhances the ability of Japanese

steelmakers to tailor output to their customers in the U.S. automobile

industry, an important consideration for producers of coated—steel products.

But the principal explanation for onshore production is as a response to U.S.

protectionism and as a hedge against even more stringent measures. Not only

can the Japanese protect against this risk by producing in the United States,

but this strategy itself reduces the danger of tighter trade restrictions by

diverting the sales of Japanese companies from goods manufactured abroad to

those manufactured in the United States.

     Japanese-owned automobile companies project that "immigrant plants" will

produce 1.8 million vehicles for the U.S. market by 1990. Since domestic

demand is projected to grow slowly, these sales are likely to come partly at

the expense of Japanese exports and partly at that of the U.S. competition.
                                     —67—


While onshore production by foreign firms is likely to slow the decline of

U.S. auto-industry employment, it will only add to the difficulty domestic

firms have had in maintaining market share.


     Diversification

     A final response on the part of U.S. basic industries is diversification.

This can be understood as part of a long-standing strategy to make the basic

industries "less basic." As early as 1969-71, 30 cents of every dollar

invested by steel firms was invested outside of steel-producing activities; by

the late 1970s the ratio had risen to 33 per cent.74 USX (formerly the U.S.

Steel Corporation) has found new outlets for its managerial and financial

resources through acquisitions ranging from chemicals and engineering to real

estate and railroads. The same strategy has been adopted by Japanese steel

producers, who have branched into areas as diverse as industrial ceramics and

silicon wafers. The principal thrust of USX's diversification has been into

energy, notably through its acqisition of Marathon Oil in 1982 and Texas Oil

and Gas in 1986. At present, only one-third of USX's revenues come from

steel, with oil and gas now accounting for a majority of total sales. While

this too represents an attempt to move into more promising sectors, it is also

a continuance of the steel industry's traditional strategy of using

diversification to reduce the cyclical risks of steelmaking. Since energy is

an important component of the cost of producing steel, through the ownership

of energy resources, steel companies can hedge against the effects of higher

energy prices.

8.   Future Prospects

     What are the prospects for the basic industries in the United States?

Clearly, the international product cycle will continue to operate. Competence

in the production of the products of basic industries tends to be acquired in

the early stages of industrialization. This international diffusion of

standardized technologies is beyond the control of American producers and

policymakers. Hence developing countries where the costs of labor and raw

materials are low should have a continuing if not an increasing competitive

advantage in the production of standardized basic industry goods. U.S. basic

industries, particularly those segments using standardized processes to

produce standardized products, will experience no relief from foreign

competition.

     The precise impact of this foreign competition will depend on the stance

of U.S. trade policies. For the forseeable future, trade in the products of

these industries will continue to be regulated by "voluntary" restraints and

bilateral quota agreements rather than tariff protection. There is no reason,

if quotas are set at sufficiently restrictive levels, that production for the

U.S. market could not take place domestically. Studies of U.S. trade policy

unanimously conclude that the costs of such policies are high, however. Not

only do the high prices charged domestic consumers of the products of basic

industries translate into a very substantial cost per protected job, but they

divert scarce U.S. resources into the basic industries and out of alternative

uses where their productivity is higher. The competitive difficulties of the

U.S. basic industries are the market's way of signaling that productivity

there is relatively low. Permitting these industries to release resources and
                                        -69-


even facilitating their smooth transfer through adjustment assistance programs

is a way of responding constructively to the productivity slowdown that has

been the subject of so much recent attention.

     None of this implies that the U.S. basic industries should or will

vanish. U.S. producers will retain some comparative advantage vis a vis

developing-country competitors wherever product quality and marketing are

important --   that   is, where skilled labor and proximity to the consumer confer

comparative advantage. Those segments of the American automotive, steel and

apparel industries producing high performance automobiles; electrogalvanized

steel and designer clothing, for example, have brighter prospects than the

basic industries as a whole. The ability of the U.S. basic industries to

exploit this advantage, which other industrial countries share, depends on

their ability to maintain quality, to successfully tailor goods to market, and

to moderate production costs, three areas where their record is not

unblemished.

     Most of all, the competitiveness of these segments of the U.S. basic

industries will depend on their ability to apply the new technologies

developed by the high-tech sector. Robots, computer-controlled machine tools

and other forms of automated technology continue to offer improvements in

productivity and quality control. They are the domestic industries' hope of

maintaining a competitive advantage as existing technologies continue to

diffuse to newly industrializing countries. Located in a country rich in the

human capital used to develop these new technologies, U.S. basic industries

might be thought to possess a comparative advantage in their adoption. But

much depends on the foresightedness of domestic producers and on public
                                    -70-


policy. If macroeconomic policies fail to keep domestic demand from declining

and the real exchange rate from rising as wildly as in recent years, the

investment required for the adoption of these technologies will not take

place. If domestic producers are provided overly generous protection, they

will have little incentive to develop and adopt these new technologies.

Policies of protection which increase basic industry employment in the present

may not be conducive to the prosperity of the U.S. basic industries in the

future.

                          Appendix: Regression Results


     This appendix presents regression results cited in the text. Using

quarterly data for the period 1973:1-1986:1, employment is regressed on

measures of the real exchange rate, the relative price of energy, the

economy-wide unemployment rate and the sectoral real wage. Data and

specification follow Branson and Love (1986) with three modifications. First,

the dependent variable is number of production employees instead of total

employees. Second, a distributed lag on average hourly earnings is appended

to their basic specification to permit the impact of labor costs on employment

to be examined. Third, the sample period is altered, starting only in 1973:1

and extending through 1986:1. Data on both number of production employees and

hourly earnings are drawn from Department of Labor, Employment and Earnings

(various issues). Hourly earnings are deflated by the CPI to construct a

measure of the real wage. Other data are as described by Branson and Love.

The real exchange rate is the IMF index of relative unit labor costs; the real

energy price index is the CPI-Urban energy price index divided by the

CPI-Urban index for all consumer goods; the unemployment rate is for all

workers, economy-wide.

     Results appear in Table A.1. While the results for all manufacturing are

quite satisfactory, the results for the four basic industries vary. In

contrast to all manufacturing, employment in each shows a significant downward

trend even after controlling for cyclical conditions, the real exchange rate,

the real price of energy, and the sectoral real wage. Only the textile

industry fails to exhibit strong sensitivity to the business cycle (as

captured by the coefficients on the civilian unemployment rate). There is

considerable variability -in the impact of energy prices, which increases as

one moves from textiles to apparel to steel and finally to motor vehicles.

The large coefficients in the equations for vehicles and steel suggest that

the energy price variable may also be picking up the impact of structural

factors (shifts toward smaller cars or steel substitutes whose timing

coincides with the energy price shocks). Similarly, changes in the real

exchange rate had a more powerful impact on motor vehicles and steel than

textiles and apparel, suggesting that the MFA limited the effects of import

competition even more severely than automobile and steel VERs. Finally, the

impact of real wages is generally negative but uniformly weak. (Before

concluding from this that firms do not operate on their labor demand curves,

it would be useful to adjust hourly earnings for productivity and to deflate

them by a measure of sector-specific producer prices).

     Table A.2 uses these regressions to decompose changes in U.S.

competitiveness (as they are reflected in changes in production employment)

into these four components and a residual. The first line shows that slack

macroeconomic conditions, real exchange-rate appreciation and higher energy

prices all tended to reduce U.S. manufacturing employment between the second

half of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. Only some slight

decline of real manufacturing wages moderated the trend. Of these factors

the dollar's real appreciation was the most important; by itself it would have

caused production employment in manufacturing to fall by more than an eighth.

But U.S. manufacturing employment declined considerably less than the

movement of these variables would predict. Other sources of enhanced

competitiveness ("other factors" in Table A.2) contributed significantly to

the maintenance of manufacturing employment over the period.

     The basic industries show many of the same patterns but important

differences as well. Employment in steel and vehicles is more cyclically

sensitive than employment in textiles and apparel, is more strongly affected

by movements in the real exchange rate, and is more responsive to changes in

the relative price of energy. Although the recent moderation of real

manufacturing wages has stimulated employment in all four industries, the

contribution of wage trends to the change in total industry employment has

been relatively small. A striking feature of the table is the contrast in the

impact of "other factors" between motor vehicles and the other basic

industries. In textiles, apparel and iron and steel, these other factors

contributed to the decline in production employment over the period. The

interpretation of this finding is that the further intensification of foreign

competition tended to add to the three industries' competitive woes. In

automobiles, in contrast, other factors account for a significant rise in

production employment. Whether this has been due to increased barriers to

foreign competition, notably the negotiation of Japanese export restraints

in 1981, or to new investment, marketing and product-development strategies on

the part of the U.S. automobile producers cannot to be determined by

regression alone.

15. As the authors are careful to note, their estimates must be interpreted
cautiously, since relatively few steel companies (two Japanese, one
American) and relatively few auto companies (one Japanese, three American) are
included in their sample.

16. Apparent consumption is domestic production plus imports minus exports,
taken from OECD (1985) and publications of the American Iron and Steel
Institute, with figures from AISI publications converted to ingot equivalents
by the OECD method. The trend line is the OLS regression:

     App. Cons./GNP = 0.064 — 0.0012*time
                    (26.82) (7.66)

Here and in subsequent footnotes, figures in parentheses are t-statistics.
Breaking the trend in 1973 and 1979:

     App. Cons./GNP = 0.056 -   0.0001*time     -
                                                    0.0015*post72 - 0.0014*post78

Equations such as these are not strictly interpretable as demand curves since
they do not adjust the consumption ratio for relative price effects. In the
case of steel, however, such adjustments are of little consequence. Adding
the price of metals and metal products relative to the prices of all
intermediate materials and supplies changes the coefficient on the time trend
reported above only from 0.0012 to 0.0013.

24. The slope of the OLS regression line, while negative, differs
insignificantly from zero:
     App. Cons./GNP = 4.960 - 0.015*time
                     (7.57) (0.43)

The regression for cyclical sensitivity of the apparent consumption ratio

per cent.   This calculation adjusts total cost per mile, from Motor Vehicle

29. These figures from the u.s. Department of Labor omit non-payroll items
such as pensions, insurance and supplemental unemployment benefits to
facilitate the comparison with all manufacturing. Figures including estimates
of non-wage compensation are used, however, in the international comparison of
basic industries below. Since nonwage earnings have been more important
historically in steel and autos than elsewhere in the economy, Figure 7
presents a lower bound on the premium over all manufacturing received by
workers in these two industries.

34. National currency compensation costs are converted to U.S. dollars using
average market exchange rates. For well known reasons, their dollar
equivalents should not be taken as measures of living standards. Insofar as
market exchange rates reflect the relative price of traded goods, however,
this is the measure relevant to discussions of comparative costs in traded
goods industries.

35. Note that estimates for steel in Table 8 differ from those in Table 10.
Figures in the latter table have been adjusted by the Labor Department to
enhance international comparability. See U.S. Department of Labor (1984).

36.    Similarly, in steel the establishment of voluntary labor—management
participation teams was encouraged by the 1980 basic steel agreement. By
the end of 1985 there were approximately 500 such teams functioning in the
steel industry. The discussion of automotive labor relations that follows
draws mainly Katz (1985), ch. 4 and National Academy of Engineering (1983),
ch. 7.

37. Capital expenditures in millions of dollars are taken from American
Iron and Steel Institute Statistical Highlights (various issues, American
Textile Manufacturers Association Textile Hi-Lights (various issue), and
MVMA Facts and Figures (various issues). Department of Commerce estimates of
capital expenditures in U.S. manufacturing appear in the last two of these
sources.

40. Although their methods, which assume a 20 year life for plant and
equipment, may exaggerate the rate of depreciation and thus overstate the
extent of disinvestment, this is unlikely to affect the thrust of their
conclusions. Acs (1984, p. 141), however, estimates that investment in new
capacity exceeded depreciation in 13 of 21 years from 1.960 to 1980.

45. Continuously cast steel and crude steel production, in metric tons, and
share of the total produced using open hearths are taken from International
Iron and Steel Institute (1985), Tables 2, 4 and 5. Linear regression yields:
                                            -78-


          Continuously Cast = 66.70 - 0.78           Open Hearth         R2 =   0.05
                             (13.60) (1.14)

The sample is comprised of 25 developed and developing countries, all of those
for which data could be obtained excluding Eastern Europe.

46. The regression is:

          Continuously Cast = 12.18    —    0.621       Open Hearth
                             (12.19)       (—0.91)

           (1.10)                              (1.44)

Data are as above, with the addition of 1970 output from OECD (1985). One
reason that output growth does not have a stronger effect is that in some
countries where there have been systematic programs of rationalization, the
authorities, when shutting down excess capacity, have shut down those works
without continuous casters. Hence in some countries where output has declined
most rapidly, the share of steel continuously cast is highest.

47. Data are from International Iron and Steel Institute Yearbooks (various
issues).

48. See for example Adams and Dirlam (1966). Oster (1982) found that large
US, producers were slower to adopt the BOF than their smaller counterparts.
However, in the subsequent study mentioned below, Karison (1986) extended the
analysis to encompass not only the choice between the BOF and the open hearth
but the electric furnace as well, concluding that variations in adoption lag
by plant size were trivial. It remains possible, however, as industry
observers have argued, that all U.S. firms, irrespective of size, were slow to
adopt the BOF.

51. Calculated from Mueller and Kawah-ito (1978), p. 19. Japanese energy-
intensity of production has fallen dramatically since the time of these
calculations. Between 1973 and 1985, energy consumption per ton of crude
steel production fell by 20 per cent as the industry shifted toward coal-based
energy in place of oil.

52. Arpan et al. (1982), pp. 108-109. However, higher oil prices have
improved the competitive position of U.S. national-gas-based synthetic fibre
producers. The regressions in Appendix A suggest that energy prices have had
an insignificant impact on U.S. textile and apparel employment.

53. The estimates in the appendix suggest still larger employment effects.

 55. There nonetheless exists a great number of studies of this question.
 Since they have recently beeen reviewed by Hufbauer et al. (1986), only a
 selection of the most recent estimates is discussed here.

 56. Pelzman (1980), P. 16.

 57. Stabilizing the market share of imports may have been the underlying
 objective of the scheme, which was administered with varying severity so as to
 achieve it. Barnett and Schorsch (1983), p. 241.

 58. Data are taken from Paine Webber (various issues). The export price is
 the Antwerp spot price.

 59. The average number of production workers in 1983-84 was 170,000.
 Assuming it to have been 22,000 less in the absence of restraints, the share
 of employment accounted for by restraints is 22,000/(170,000—22,000)  15 per
 cent.

60. The point is not that domestic prices are 30 per cent higher and domestic
steel-industry employment is correspondingly higher under VERs than they were
in the preceding period of trigger prices. Rather it -is that prices are
approximately 30 per cent higher than they would be under free trade.

61. See Hufbauer et al. (1986), p. 256 for other estimates.

62. U.S. International Trade Commission (1985), p. ix.

63. Arpan et al. (1982), pp. 263-264.

64. See the discussion in Bransor, (1986).

65. Kalt (1985), p. 9.

66. U.S. capital expenditures for environmental control are the sum of air
and water expenditures. Those for Japan are the sum of air and water and
relatively small industrial waste, noise and vibration and miscellaneous
expenditures. U.S. total crude steel production is measured in net tons,
while Japanese figures have been converted to net from metric tons. Sources
are AISI Statistical Highlights (various issues)and unpublished MIII estimates
supplied by the Japan Steel Information Center.

67. There are exceptions to this rule, such as substantial expenditures on
pollution control by Brazilian steel companies.

68. Eichengreen and van der Ven (1984) report estimates of these costs.

69. See Leonard and Collins (1986) and Neiheisel (1986).

70. This is true of all industrial countries; see for example Marsden
(1985).
