Measuring Employer-to-Employer Reallocation

                                          ABSTRACT

We revisit measurement of Employer-to-Employer (EE) transitions, the main engine of labor
market competition and employment reallocation, in the monthly Current Population Survey
(CPS). We follow Fallick and Fleischman (2004) and exploit a key survey question introduced
with the 1994 CPS redesign. We detect a sudden and sharp increase in the incidence of missing
answers to this question starting in 2007, when the U.S. Census Bureau introduced a change in
survey methodology, the Respondent Identification Policy (RIP). We show evidence of selection
into answering the EE question by both observable and unobservable worker characteristics that
correlate with EE mobility. We propose a selection model and a procedure to impute missing
answers to the key survey question, thus EE transitions, after the introduction of the RIP. Our
imputed aggregate EE series restores a close congruence with the business cycle, especially with
the onset of the Great Recession, exhibits a much less dramatic drop in 2008-2009 and a full
recovery by 2016, and eliminates the spurious appearance of declining EE dynamism in the US
labor market after 2000. We also offer the first evidence of the (large and negative) impact of the
COVID-19 crisis on EE reallocation.

1     Introduction
The labor market in the US is a tremendously dynamic place. Every month, millions of
workers move between employment, unemployment, and out of the labor force. In recent
years, increasing attention has been paid to the flow of workers from Employer to Employer
(EE), with no intervening jobless spell. A prominent literature, as best exemplified by
Burdett and Mortensen (1998) and its empirical applications, as well as by Postel-Vinay and
Robin (2002), shows that on-the-job search by, and competition between firms for, employed
workers are a natural source of worker bargaining power, and an important determinant of
cross-sectional wage dispersion caused by turnover frictions.
    Just as critical is the role that EE reallocation plays in shaping two dynamic aspects of
US labor markets. First, from the individual point of view of a typical US worker, direct
moves from one employer to another are a major source of earnings growth over the life cycle
(Topel and Ward, 1992), but also of idiosyncratic earnings risk. Climbing the job ladder takes
time; therefore, falling off it can have drastic implications for lifetime earnings (Davis and
Von Wachter, 2011) and explain the striking skewness and kurtosis in individual earnings
growth at annual frequency documented by Guvenen et al. (2014) (see e.g. Hubmer, 2018).
Second, from an aggregate point of view, the total EE flow is comparable in size with the
flows from Unemployment and Nonparticipation into Employment. A large share of these
UE and NE flows comprises, respectively, recalls by the last employer (Fujita and Moscarini,
2017) and new entry into the labor force, which do not directly reallocate employment
between firms. Therefore, EE transitions play a quantitatively dominant role in this type
of reallocation, which is a major driver of aggregate productivity growth (e.g. Foster et al.,
2008 and Lentz and Mortensen, 2008). The EE transition probability is also procyclical,
but much less volatile than the UE probability or the unemployment rate. These facts bear
significant implications for the cyclical reallocation of labor input between firms, industries,
and occupations (Haltiwanger et al., 2018), for the estimation of the matching function
(Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2018), and for measurement of mismatch and labor market
slack relevant to monetary policy (Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2019).
    For all these reasons -- and possibly more -- measuring EE transitions accurately is im-
portant. This is the goal of the present paper.1 We focus on the monthly Current Population
   1
     The type of transitions we focus on involve a change of employer -- hence the systematic reference to
"Employer-to-Employer (EE) transitions." In the literature, these are sometimes referred to as "Job-to-Job"
(J2J): we find this label confusing as, strictly speaking, job changes include internal promotions, demotions,
or moves caused by internal restructuring and reorganizations, which typically do not involve a change of
employer. We exclude those within-employer job changes from our analysis, although we hereby acknowledge
that they are potentially just as relevant to reallocation and productivity growth as EE transitions.

Survey (CPS), the premier source of real-time information on labor markets, including the
civilian unemployment rate, available to policymakers in the United States. The monthly
frequency, almost unique even among labor force surveys in developed countries, reduces
the recall bias and time aggregation that blur the distinction between direct EE transitions
and short unemployment spells in survey data. Since its 1994 redesign, the CPS contains
an explicit retrospective question (variable IODP1) that can be used to identify EE tran-
sitions: the interviewer reads out the name of an individual's employer recorded in the
previous month, and asks if it still the same. In this paper, we will refer to this question as
"SAMEMP." Fallick and Fleischman (2004) pioneered the use of the answers to this question
to estimate the average EE monthly transition probability, and a time series that has become
the standard reference in the profession. The lighter (yellow) line in Figure 1a shows the time
series of our replication of their results, after taking a 12-month trailing Moving Average to
eliminate high-frequency noise; Figure 1b shows the same after taking quarterly averages.
We can see a dramatic decline that starts in early 2007, and never reverts, thus generating
the impression of a strong cyclical drop preceding the Great Recession by a full year, as well
as a downward trend, and a dramatic drop in April-May 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis.
    In this paper, we revisit measurement of the EE transition probability. Our starting point
is Figure 2. We detect a sudden and sharp increase in the incidence of missing answers to the
SAMEMP question, starting in January 2007 followed by a similar one a year later, which
never reversed, but instead continued growing thereafter. We identify one important change
in survey methodology phased in starting in January 2008 by the US Census Bureau, the
Respondent Identification Policy (RIP), which directly impacts the validity of the answer to

                                                                            2

months) records


the SAMEMP question. In a nutshell, the RIP gives, for privacy reasons, the respondent the
option not to share their answers, including their employer name, with any other household
members who might happen to answer the survey in subsequent months. A significant
number of respondents exercise that option, automatically generating a missing answer to
the SAMEMP question a month later. We provide evidence of a very strong selection
on unobservable characteristics that correlate positively with EE mobility. We also detect
another source of measurement error, similar to but of different nature than the RIP, affecting
all CPS cohorts in 2007, and possibly phased out as the RIP was introduced in 2008 and
early 2009. This may be related to RIP pre-testing. For all these reasons, observed EE
transitions after 2007 poorly estimate the true incidence of EE reallocation.
    Based on this evidence, we propose a selection model and a set of identification assump-
tions, on which we build a procedure to impute missing answers to the SAMEMP question,
thus EE transitions, both before and especially after January 2007. Implementing our pro-
cedure, we estimate an aggregate EE time series which differs substantially, over the last
13 years, from Fallick and Fleischman (2004)'s, plotted as a blue (dark) line in Figure 1.2
Specifically, our series resets the cyclical peak to early 2008, in line with evidence from ad-
ministrative quarterly data reviewed later, and reduces the cyclical drop by about half, with

regularly update, the EE time series that we estimate based on both Fallick and Fleischman (2004)'s and
our methodology, and that we plot, smoothed, in Fig. 1, as well as the time series based on a Missing at
Random assumption. Fig. 14(a) plots all three times series, not smoothed.

a full recovery by 2016, followed by a mild decline since then. Thus, our imputed series
restores a closer congruence between EE transitions and the business cycle, greatly reduces
their cyclical volatility, and eliminates the appearance of a "quit-less recovery" after the
Great Recession and of declining EE dynamism in the US labor market since 2000. We also
present the first empirical evidence of the large negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on
the pace of EE reallocation. Our imputed EE probability series drops even more dramati-
cally than the Fallick and Fleischman (2004)'s series, as predicted by the selection model,
because response rates to the SAMEMP questions rose sharply, reflecting the observed higher
availability of previous Survey respondents under home lockdown.
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we illustrate the features of the monthly
CPS designed to detect individual EE transitions, with a detailed description of the pertinent
SAMEMP question. In Section 3 we present our new empirical evidence of the sudden
increase in the incidence of missing answers to this question starting in 2007, and relate it
to the introduction of the Respondent Identification Policy by the Census Bureau around
that time. In Section 4 we provide evidence that the RIP significantly changed measured
EE transitions. In Section 5 we propose and implement an imputation procedure of missing
answers, hence of EE transitions, based on a model of selection by unobservable worker
characteristics that affect the propensity both to answer the survey and to change the job. In
Section 6 we compare our imputation results with those from other datasets, we address the
impact of Survey attrition, and we examine the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Brief conclusions take stock of the results and highlight outstanding open issues in the
measurement of labor market transitions in the CPS, that we leave for future research.


2       EE transitions: data and baseline measurement
2.1     The Current Population Survey (CPS)
The CPS is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households, which has been conducted by
the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics for more than 60 years. The
information that allows us to detect employer changes has been available only since the 1994
survey redesign, as described below.3
    Despite not being primarily intended for longitudinal analysis, the CPS contains a panel
component and can be used to follow individuals over short periods of time. In each month
    3
     Most of the overview information presented in this section is directly based on the official de-
scription of the CPS at the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (https://www.census.gov/programs-
surveys/cps/data/datasets.html).


                                                 4
the full CPS sample is divided into eight "Rotation Groups," with each housing unit being
interviewed for four consecutive months, then removed from the sample for an eight-month
period, and finally interviewed for another four months. Hence, in any month, one-eighth of
the sample households are interviewed for the first month (i.e., the first Rotation Group),
one-eighth are interviewed for the second month, one-eighth for the third month, etc.
    The CPS has several advantages and disadvantages over panel datasets, such as the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, in studying labor
market states (employment/unemployment, occupation, industry) and related transitions.
The first advantage is the large number of individuals in the sample. The second advantage
is the high frequency of observations over time, as the CPS is conducted monthly, as opposed
to panels that conduct yearly interviews about the entire history of the previous 12 months.
The monthly frequency minimizes (although does not eliminate) time aggregation problems
due to multiple within-period undetected transitions and to the respondent's incorrect recall
of past events. The third advantage is the wealth of information about demographics, which
compares well with that of proper panel data. Finally, only the monthly CPS is updated in
a timely manner every month, which makes it uniquely useful to policymakers.
    Since the CPS samples housing units (i.e., addresses) and not families or individuals,
attrition can occur for one of three main reasons: temporary absence (hospitalization, im-
prisonment, vacation), migration (to go to college, to enlist in the military, to form a family,
to follow or to separate from a spouse, and for work-related reasons, including retirement),
and mortality. Thus, the main disadvantage of the CPS is that some attrition is potentially
correlated with EE transitions. In Section 6, we provide evidence that this correlation is
in practice very weak: most people move for non-job related reasons. In contrast, panel
datasets track individuals wherever they move, although they too suffer from significant
attrition because of their much lower interview frequency. The Survey of Income Program
Participation shares many desirable features of the monthly CPS, but the lower interview fre-
quency (every four months until 2014 and yearly since then) generates recall error in reports
and significant delay in the release of new data. Another disadvantage of the CPS is the
very limited longitudinal dimension, as individuals are followed for eight (non-consecutive)
months, as opposed to decades for panel surveys. This is an unavoidable consequence of the
much richer information set provided by the CPS: since so many questions are asked again
every month, they can be asked only for a short period of time, lest becoming harassment.




                                               5
2.2     Matching monthly CPS files
Matching monthly CPS files means uniquely identifying records in consecutive survey months
that refer to the same individual. In principle, the re-interviewing process in the monthly
CPS should allow us to match three-fourths of the sample in any given month to the next
month, while one-fourth of the sample exits due to rotation (though individuals in their
fourth month can be linked eight months forward). As mentioned, however, various kinds of
attrition reduce the fraction of individuals that can actually be matched.4
    The relevant question to identify the transition of interest in this paper, from employer
to employer, was introduced as part of the CPS redesign in January 1994. Therefore, we
focus on post-1993 data. For the period through April 1995, our matching procedure follows
the traditional methodology that combines ID variables (numerical identifiers assigned by
the Census Bureau) with some observable individual characteristics, such as age, gender,
and race, because there are multiple identical IDs within the same monthly file. As is well
known in the literature, between May 1995 and August 1995 matching is impossible due
to unavailable ID variables. Thus our analysis cannot cover those four months. Starting
in September 1995, the Census Bureau ensures that ID variables are unique, making it
unnecessary, and even harmful, to use observable characteristics in establishing the unique
matches. In general, matching probabilities are fairly high, although over the past several
years attrition increased by about two percentage points. Details are in Appendix A.1.


2.3      The 1994 Survey redesign: Dependent Interviewing
An overhaul of the interviewing technique took place in 1994.5 Before then, every month,
respondents were asked anew: (i) for whom they worked, (ii) what kind of business that
was, (iii) what kind of work they were doing, (iv) what their most important activities were,
and (v) what sector they were working in. This information was later used by CPS staff
to assign employer, occupation and industry codes to each individual. This "Independent
Coding" procedure had at least two serious shortcomings. First, asking these questions was
very cumbersome for the interviewer, and respondents typically complained about answering
the same questions repeatedly. Second, and more important for our purposes, asking these
questions independently every month introduced a significant amount of spurious shifts in
occupation and industry. Indeed, in a small validation study of occupational coding based
on company records and employees' descriptions of their own tasks, Mathiowetz (1992) finds
  4
     Madrian and Lefgren (2000) and Feng (2001) evaluate in depth the design of the matching criteria of
annual (March) CPS records. They build on earlier work in Welch (1993) and Peracchi and Welch (1995).
   5
     This description is based on Polivka and Rothgeb (1993). See also Moscarini and Thomsson (2007).


                                                   6
that CPS staff coded occupations incorrectly about half the time when not told that two
consecutive records concern the same individual. More remarkably, when told that the two
records did come from the same individual, these expert coders still found a 12% disagreement
rates between the company record and the employee's description of their tasks.
   To reduce the interview burden and misclassification, in 1994, the Census Bureau intro-
duced a number of changes to the Survey. The most important change for our purposes is
"Dependent Interviewing" (which implies "Dependent Coding"). For those individuals who
are reported being employed both last and this month, the interviewer asks the following
additional question regarding their main job, that we referred to as "SAMEMP":

   · IODP1
     Last month, it was reported that (name/you) worked for (company name). (Do/Does)
     (you/he/she) still work for (company name)?

        ­ Yes
        ­ No

If the answer is No, then this is followed by questions about occupation in the new employer,
which is then coded independently of the previous one. If the answer is Yes, then two more
questions follow, asking to confirm the description of activities given a month before. If
everything is confirmed, then Dependent Coding applies and automatically assigns the same
occupational code as in the previous month.
    As a result, it has become standard to start the time series of the average EE transition
probability in 1994, exploiting answers to the SAMEMP Dependent Interviewing question.
We will follow this approach. Note that the SAMEMP question is retrospective and only
asked of individuals who are employed in both the past and current month. Therefore, in
order to compute the share who answer No, and estimate the average EE probability, in
principle we do not need to match records, but can just use cross-sections. In practice, the
dataset reports a missing answer to SAMEMP for one of three reasons: the individual was
not employed a month earlier; the respondent declined to answer; or, despite the individual
being employed in both the past and current month, the record was not eligible for Dependent
Interviewing, as explained later. Disentangling these reasons is crucial and only possible by
matching records, because the dataset does not provide this information directly.
    One last set of individuals remain out of reach: those who were employed in the past
month and, in the meantime, changed address and left the survey in the current month, thus
cannot be matched. As explained earlier, taking another job is one of the many possible
reasons for moving home. When the entire household moves out, another household often

                                             7
moves into the same address, possibly for the same reason as the outgoing one, including
household members taking a new job. But any labor market transition will be missed both
for outgoing and incoming households at the time of the move. This is an unavoidable
limitation of an address-based survey, which will always lead to underestimate the average
EE transition probability. In Section 6, however, we provide abundant empirical evidence
that this bias is quantitatively negligible.


3         Missing answers to the SAMEMP question
3.1         Facts
Within the matched records between month t and t - 1, those that are employed in both
months are eligible for the SAMEMP question in month t. Throughout the paper, whenever
we mention "eligibility," we refer to this question and, unless otherwise explicitly stated,
analyze this eligible sample. Out of this sample, we count those who answer No to this
question. The ratio between this count and the total number of employed in the initial
month within the matched sample is our measure of the EE probability.6
    The highest hurdle in this apparently straightforward computation is caused by missing
answers to the SAMEMP question among eligible records. Those missing answers cannot
contribute to the numerator of the EE probability: although we know that these people are
employed in both months, we do not know whether this is at the same company or not.
The question is whether the true, unobserved answer was positive or negative. The issue is
real even for small percentages of missing answers, because the raw monthly EE probability,
computed by just discarding records with missing answers, is small (around 2%), and we
do not know the conditional EE probability among those missing answers. For example,
suppose that only 1% of all answers are missing but that they are all EE movers in truth.
Then, the true EE probability would increase by one half, from 2% to roughly 3%.
    In Figure 3, the higher, darker (blue) line illustrates how the share of eligible records
with missing answers to the SAMEMP question (EEm ) evolved since the introduction of
Dependent Interviewing. Four facts stand out. First, this share has always been positive
and non-negligible. Second, it has been rising over time. Both facts were already noticed
by Moscarini and Thomsson (2007), Fig. 3, who at the time analyzed data through 2006.
Third, we see a dramatic and persistent jump in January 2007. This fact is new, and cause
for great concern. There are further visible sharp accelerations in January 2008 and January

        Note that the denominator includes some individuals who are no longer employed in the current month.

2009. Fourth, the share drops visibly in April and May 2020, following the COVID-19 shock.
    Next, the other two, lower lines split the overall EEm sample into the first four (1-4) and
the second four (5-8) Rotation Groups, normalizing by the same total number of respondents
who are eligible for the SAMEMP question, thus the two series add up to the blue line. Both
series show jumps in January 2007. The former (RG1-4) also jumps at the beginning of 2008,
and the latter (RG5-8) at the beginning of 2009, explaining the sharp accelerations in the
aggregate measure.
    Fallick and Fleischman (2004) pioneered the use of Dependent Interviewing to calculate
this EE probability, and their time series has become the main reference in the profession.
We reconstruct their time series, using their described methodology and assuming, as they
do, that blank answers to the SAMEMP question are stayers.7 Our reverse-engineered time
series and the one that Fallick and Fleischman make available on their websites coincide
almost perfectly, as we show in Figure 4a, where the two lines lie on top of each other.8
Their treatment of missing answers is potentially problematic even before 2007, more so
since then. Instead of treating missing answers as stayers, one can assume that the EE

communication with Charles Fleischman, whom we thank.

      Fallick and Fleischman (2004) also exclude Rotation Groups 1 and 5 from their calculations, to avoid
the so-called "first rotation group bias," and focus on transitions between months in sample 2-3, 3-4, 6-7,
and 7-8. We follow them to replicate their series in Figure 4. In the rest of our analysis, however, we include
all Rotation Groups, including 1 and 5, thus transitions between months in sample 1-2 and 5-6, because we
find that they make little difference to the aggregate time series, but they increase the sample size for our
imputation procedure of missing answers to the SAMEMP question, described later.

probability of these missing answers is the same as that among valid responses. In Figure
4b, we can see that this Missing-At-Random (MAR) assumption brings the level of the EE
probability up noticeably. The gap has been widening since around 2007, as implied by
increasing incidence of non-response shown in Figure 3.
    The natural question is: what happened in 2007-2009? We now provide evidence that
the likely culprit is another seemingly small change in the CPS interview protocol, the
Respondent Identification Policy (RIP), introduced around that time.


3.2        The Respondent Identification Policy (RIP)
Polivka et al. (2009) provide the following description: "The Respondent Identification Policy
(RIP) is the Census Bureau policy that prohibits the sharing of information with other
household members unless the person who originally provides the information consents to
the sharing." They also describe the cognitive testing that was performed before rolling
out the RIP, in order to find the phrasing of the relevant question that would be correctly
understood by the maximum number of respondents. The final formulation:

   · We will recontact this household next month to update this information. If we are unable to
       reach you and we talk to someone else instead, is it OK if we refer to the information you
       gave us?

           ­ IF NEEDED: An example of this type of question is: "Last month (name) was reported

                                                                                  10
           as a teacher. Is (s/he) still a teacher?"
        ­ IF NEEDED: It will help make the next interview go faster

was still misunderstood by a significant minority of tested respondents.
    The CPS Interviewing Manual (April 2015) describes the RIP in Chapter 2.D. "If the
original respondent, which we refer to as the `RIP respondent,' wishes their information to
be confidential, and they are not available for a subsequent interview, you cannot conduct
dependent interviewing. However, if the RIP respondent permits you to verify their informa-
tion with anyone in the household, then you can conduct dependent interviewing. [...] The
instrument will only allow one person to be the RIP respondent. Once the RIP question is
asked and the RIP respondent is selected, the RIP question will not be re-asked in subsequent
months. You may change the answer to the RIPFLG question during the initial interview
only. The only time the RIPFLG will change in subsequent interviews is when there is a
replacement household." Therefore, once the RIP is implemented, a negative answer by the
first, RIP respondent invalidates dependent interviewing for the entire 4+4 month sequence
of that household, unless the household moves out of the address and is replaced by another
one moving in. For this reason, although "Any household member 15 years of age or older
is technically eligible to act as a respondent", the Manual then continues: "If at all possible,
try to interview the most knowledgeable member of the household. In most situations, this
individual will be the reference person or the spouse of the reference person." In turn, the
reference person is defined as "The first person mentioned by the respondent, who either
owns or rents the `sample unit' (e.g., house, apartment)."
    Polivka et al. (2009) also report that the RIP question is not asked in single-person
households, while 14.4% of the RIP questions that were asked for all of 2008 received a
negative answer, from respondents who are observationally different from the population.
One concern for our purposes is that employed and job-mobile respondents are more likely to
answer No to the RIP question, suggesting that they have some confidentiality concerns about
their work situation, primarily about their earnings. Polivka et al. (2009) also report that,
in 2008, following one of the 14.4% negative answers to the RIP questions, the respondent
changed in only one in nine households in the following month's interview. Multiplying the
two shares, the No response to the RIP question should result in a share of invalid dependent
interviewing of just about 1.5%. We showed much larger numbers than this, especially after
2008, because a No answer to the initial RIP question has ramifications that propagate
beyond the month of the answer and the one following it, and suppresses information.
    From now on, our strategy proceeds in three steps. First, in the remainder of this section,
we estimate the timing and mode of introduction of RIP in monthly interviews. The variable

                                                 11
RIPFLG flags when an interview is subject to the RIP, and contains the answer to the RIP
question for that household, but is not available in the public use data, nor in any confidential
version of the data that we are aware of. To determine when and how the RIP was rolled
out, we thus proceed indirectly. Based on Polivka et al. (2009), our prior is that the RIP
was introduced in 2008. To validate this prior, we exploit the fact that the RIP invalidates
some answers to the SAMEMP question. Then, we measure the occurrence and size of
month-over-month changes in the share of missing answers to the SAMEMP question, EEm ,
starting in 2006. We do this for each cohort and rotation group. Because the RIP applies if
the household has more than one member and the household member who answers from the
second month on differs from the original RIP respondent, we dig deeper into the pattern
of EEm missing answers to the SAMEMP question among eligible records, breaking it down
by single-person household and by respondent status (Self/Proxy). Consistently with our
assumption, respondent groups that are expected to be more affected by the RIP show the
largest jumps in EEm . We identify the calendar months of these jumps.
    Our second step, in Section 4, exploits the exogenous variation across groups in the
timing of the RIP introduction, to identify whether the RIP, or something else, causes a
change in measured EE transitions. It is highly unlikely that other changes, especially in
the labor market, affected those rotation groups exactly in those months and in that same
order. Thus, we use a "treatment-control" approach to document that, every time the RIP
was rolled out for a group of respondents and the share of valid answers to the SAMEMP
question suddenly declined, so did the measured EE probability among the remaining valid
answers, only for that specific rotation group. So changes in the incidence of EEm cause
simultaneous drastic changes in measured EE, which is the object of interest.
    In the third and final step, having demonstrated the causal effect of the RIP on measured
EE, we attempt to offset it by imputing EE mobility to eligible records with invalid answers
to the SAMEMP question, both pre- and post-RIP periods.


3.3    Identification of Survey respondents
The CPS is a monthly, addressed-based, household survey. A household is the collection
of individuals who co-habit in the same dwelling, i.e., who live and eat together. Every
month, a household member answers the survey for all members, including her/himself.
Therefore, a specific answer to a question concerning a specific individual can have one of
two respondent statuses: Self (S) if the question concerns the respondent and Proxy (P) if it
concerns someone else in the household. Over two consecutive months, the respondent may
change, and information about a given individual present in the household and in the survey

Figure 5: Shares of previously employed by respondent status over two consecutive months


in both months can follow one of five possible sequences of respondent status: SS, SP, PS,
PP, and finally PP'. The last sequence indicates that both responses about this individual
were given by different Proxies. PS, SP and PP are only possible in households who have
at least two members, and PP' at least three members. Because the RIP is triggered by
respondent status, and change thereof, we need to identify these sequences.
    For this purpose, we use the indicator variable (PUSLPRX) whether the person answered
the survey that month for the household, to identify the respondent (PULINENO) for each
household (HRHHID and HRHHID2). We then construct a flag taking values SS, SP, PS,
PP, and PP', and we assign it to the "second" observation in each month's EE sequence.
That is, the answer to the SAMEMP question in month t is flagged, say, PS if that answer
was given by a Proxy in month t - 1 and by the individual him/her-Self in month t. Single-
person households are easily identified and necessarily belong in the SS group. Figure 5 plots
the shares of the five groups in the population of eligible (employed both last and this month)
matched records in each calendar month. The shares of SP and PS are virtually identical.
We can see that the share of each group is roughly constant until around 2007, and then
SS and PP start rising, presumably reflecting the Census Bureau's effort to secure the same
respondent in consecutive interviews after the roll-out of the RIP. All shares exhibit sharp
jumps in April-May 2020.
    In principle, the RIP is more likely to affect SP, PS and PP' records, when the identity
of the respondent changes from the last month to the current one and is more likely to differ
(surely differs in the second month interview) from the identity of the RIP respondent in the

first rotation. In this case, should a respondent deny permission to share his/her answers
with future, different respondents, Dependent Interviewing after a change of respondent
is ruled out, and the answers to several questions, including the SAMEMP question, will
automatically be missing. In Figure 5, the sum of SP, PS and PP' estimates the respondent
turnover rate. In 2008 this is about 20%, significantly higher than the 14.4% reported by
Polivka et al. (2009) after the RIP question was asked from the first Rotation Group. Figure
6 plots the shares of EEm by respondent status, namely, the proportion of eligible records
within each respondent group that has no valid answer to the SAMEMP question. These
shares rise over time in each group. Consistently with the logic of the RIP, since 2007, these
shares are lower (more valid answers) when the respondent's identity does not change (SS,
PP) and higher when it changes and the person in question responds neither time (PP').
    Because the RIP is relevant only when the identity of the respondent within the household
changes, we expect an increase in EEm more when Proxies are involved than for SS records.
The upper and darker (blue) line in Figure 7 is identical to the darker (blue) line in Figure
3; unlike Figure 6, we now normalized the number of missing answers by that of all eligible
records, in all respondent groups. The middle (orange) line in Figure 7 plots the EEm
incidence among the SS group. Even among these SS respondents, there is a small but
noticeable jump in EEm in 2007. This jump, however, largely disappears, when we condition
on Self responses throughout all available interviews (the lighter, yellow line), rather than
just a pair of adjacent months. When the RIP respondent is P, a negative answer to the
RIP question invalidates later SS records. Consider sequences PSSS with EEm in the second

interview. In this sample, in 2010-2016, the incidence of EEm in the third and fourth
interviews, which are classified as SS (resp., PSSS and PSSS), is enormous, over 70%.
    The recent COVID-19 crisis offers additional evidence in support of our hypothesis that
the RIP affected the non-response rate to the SAMEMP question. In Figure 5, we can see
that respondent turnover drops drastically in April and May 2020: the shares of SS and PP
rise by about eight percentage points. Presumably, people were suddenly more available to
respond again to the CPS because forced to stay at home by the lockdown. Accordingly, in
Figures 6 and 7, the shares of missing answers to the SAMEMP question fall suddenly and
dramatically, returning in two months to levels not seen in about a decade.


3.4     Timing of RIP roll-out
Let RIPi,t  {0, 1} indicate whether the RIP applies to the Survey respondent who answers
questions regarding individual i in month t,9 and let DIi,t  {0, 1} indicate a valid answer
to the SAMEMP (Dependent Interviewing, retrospective) question regarding individual i in
month t. Note that i refers to the identity of the person who is the subject of the questions,
not to the identity of the respondent. If RIPi,t = 1 and the answer to the RIP question is
No, then the SAMEMP question cannot be asked and DIj,s = 0 for all members j = i of
the same household and all calendar months, including t, when the household is interviewed.
But it is also possible that the SAMEMP question can be asked and yet the respondent
   9
    That is, RIPi,t =1 whenever individual i at time t is part of a household whose first rotation respondent
(not necessarily i) was asked the RIP question and gave an answer stored in the Census variable RIPFLG.

from the RIP) around the time of RIP roll-out.


refuses to answer, or does not know the answer, in which case also DIi,t = 0.
    Let Pr(DIi,t = 0) denote the probability of an invalid answer to the SAMEMP question
among eligible records in month t, which can be estimated by the observed share of invalid
answers EEm                                                               m
             t . Note that DIi,t is an individual-level variable, while EEt is an aggregate time
series, a population share, whose time series is plotted in Figure 3. Let Pr(RIPi,t = 1) be the
probability of a record in month t being subject to the RIP. While we do not observe RIPi,t ,
we are extremely confident, based on Figures 1b and 3, and on the description in Polivka et
al. (2009), that Pr(RIPi,t = 1) = 0 before 2007 and Pr(RIPi,t = 1) = 1 starting sometime in
2009. Then we estimate before 2007

                      Pr(DIi,t = 0 | RIPi,t = 0) = Pr(DIi,t = 0) = EEm
                                                                     t


and after 2009
                      Pr(DIi,t = 0 | RIPi,t = 1) = Pr(DIi,t = 0) = EEm
                                                                     t .

To estimate the object of interest, Pr(RIPi,t = 1) in the intermediate period, we use the
identity:

Pr(DIi,t = 0) = Pr(DIi,t = 0|RIPi,t = 1) Pr(RIPi,t = 1)+Pr(DIi,t = 0|RIPi,t = 0) Pr(RIPi,t = 0)

and make the following identification assumption: Pr(DIi,t = 0|RIPi,t ) is constant over time
for either RIPi,t = 0 or 1 in a period of time surrounding the RIP roll-out, 2006-2010, so we


                                                  16
can estimate Pr(DIi,t = 0|RIPi,t = 0) for t in the roll-out period 2007-2009 with the average
of Pr(DIi,t = 0) = EEmt in months t  2006 and Pr(DIi,t = 0|RIPi,t = 1) with the average of
Pr(DIi,t = 0) = EEt in months t  2010. Then, using our estimate Pr(DIi,t = 0) = EEm
                    m
                                                                                           t ,
the last equation can be solved to obtain an estimate of the incidence of the RIP in every
month t in the roll-out period between January 2007 and December 2009:

In words, we assume that the entire increase in the incidence of missing answers to the
SAMEMP question in this interim period is due to the introduction of the RIP, and is
proportional to the share of records introduced to the RIP. We perform this estimation for
each rotation group separately.
    To further refine our estimate of the interim period, we zoom into the period surrounding
2004-2013, and add two more pieces of information. First, we examine the time series of
Pr(DIi,t = 0) for single-member household, who are not subject to the RIP, and thus are never
asked that question. Figure 8 shows a jump in January 2007, which reverses in February
2008. Therefore, calendar year 2007 is different. Second, we break down the time series of
missing answers to the SAMEMP question not only by respondent status (SS, PS etc.), as
done in Figure 6, but also by rotation group. To save on space, in Figure 9 we only present
results for the SS and PS group, as PP and SP are (resp.) similar. The SS group (top row)
shows modest upward jumps in the incidence of missing answers in January 2007, possibly
reversed in early 2008, like single-person households. Rotation Groups 5-7 also show a jump
in early 2009, staggered in order of rotation (RG5 jumps first, then RG6 a month later, etc.).
Conversely, the PS group (bottom row), more likely than SS and single-person households to
be affected by the RIP, shows small jumps in January 2007 and huge jumps, again upwards,
in January of 2008 for RG1-3 and 2009 for RG5-7, again staggered in order of rotation.
    We conclude that the RIP was introduced in a staggered manner, by rotation group,
starting in January 2008, while during the entire 2007 calendar year some other change in
interviewing procedure affected all records. We can only speculate on its nature, possibly
a testing phase of the RIP, but we cannot treat it in the same way as we do the RIP,
because its impact is clearly different, as it affects households whose characteristics (such as
single-person, or SS respondents) make the RIP irrelevant.
    Table 1 provides an overview of our estimated timing of the RIP roll-out period. The
date in each cell represents the survey start month (cohort) and the first column gives the
calendar time. All cohorts and rotation groups are subject to some unknown factor that

causes a temporary increase in the incidence of missing Dependent Interviewing answers in
the calendar year 2007, indicated by the light shaded area. The RIP is introduced by CPS
cohort, starting with the one that entered the survey in January 2008. All new cohorts from
that point on are exposed to the RIP (darker shaded area). The RIP roll-out is completed
in April 2009, when the last cohort not exposed to it (December 2007) exits the survey.10
   Figure 10 plots the same EEm share series as in Figure 3, but with respect to the cohort
dates, i.e. the dates when each cohort entered the survey that are the entries in the table,

     Our imputation procedure of EE mobility after 2007 will provide additional evidence of the pattern
illustrated in Table 1. The "bias" introduced by the RIP in measured EE, that we estimate for each
respondent group and that we aim to correct, settles into a perfectly regular seasonal pattern after 2008,
while it is more erratic in 2007. See Figure A.3

rather than with respect to the calendar dates. We can clearly see a large jump in the
January 2008 cohort, as well as a jump in late 2005 followed by gradual increases toward
January 2007. This pattern is consistent with Table 1. The oldest cohort that is exposed to
the unknown source of measurement error in January 2007, in their last month in sample,
is the October-2005 cohort (right upper corner of Table 1, so only one-eighth of that cohort
was subject to that error (only in their last rotation). The November-2005 cohort had
two interviews subject to that error; the December-2005 cohort had three interviews..., the
January-2007 cohort had all eight interviews, and this remains the case for all cohorts until
December-2007 included. So when we plot EEm by cohort (as in Figure 10), EEm rises only
gradually from October 2005 through January 2007. After that, it remains roughly constant
during 2007, until the January-2008 cohort, when the RIP is introduced to that cohort and
subsequent ones for all eight rotations, with a much more dramatic impact on EEm .


4    Impact of the RIP on measured Employer-to-Employer
     transitions
The RIP has the potential to affect measurement of many variables of interest in the monthly
CPS. In this paper, we focus on its impact on EE transitions through the non-random decline
of valid answers to the SAMEMP question and provide evidence that the RIP introduced
a strong selection. Figure 11 plots the average EE probability of each respondent group,
computed under the MAR assumption (i.e. under the assumption that the EE probability

           Figure 11: EE transition rates by respondent status (12-month MA)


is independent of whether or not there is a valid answer to the SAMEMP question). EE
probabilities differ very significantly across groups, so the changing composition by group of
valid answers to the SAMEMP question, documented earlier, affects in itself the aggregate
EE probability. More importantly, now PS and SP are no longer equivalent. The former
has a much higher EE probability than SP, which is instead similar to PP. Note that these
two-month respondent groups only seldom include the initial, RIP respondent, so PP may
be affected by the RIP if the first respondent was S (or a different proxy P').
    To further corroborate our claim that the RIP affects measured EE transitions, we run
"treatment/control" and "placebo" experiments, which quantify the jumps that are visually
manifest in Figure 11 and demonstrate that these jumps are not due to unusual seasonality.
Specifically, using only the sample of valid SAMEMP answers from January 2006 to March
2009, we regress the individual EE dummy on dummies for calendar month and rotation
group, and on two treatment dummies, which mark the two shaded areas in Table 1. These
two treatment dummies are interacted with respondent status dummies (SS, PP, PS, SP,
PP'). The first treatment dummy equals one if an observation is in the light-shaded area of
Table 1, which flags the measurement problem of unknown source, and zero otherwise; and
the second treatment dummy equals one if an observation in the dark shaded area of Table
1, which indicates exposure to the RIP, and zero otherwise. The observations in 2006 are
in the control group and subject to neither of the measurement problems. This regression
estimates, for each respondent status group, and controlling for seasonality and the rotation
group, the differences in average EE probabilities of the two treatment groups relative to


                                                  21
that of the control group. For the "placebo" experiment, we take the 2005-2006 sample and
"treat" 2006 observations with a RIP placebo. That is, the (placebo) RIP dummy takes zero
for the 2005 sample and one for the 2006 sample.
    Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 12 summarize the impacts of the two dummies. Both of those
dummies are associated with significantly lower EE probabilities for all respondent types
except SS. For the first treatment, the largest impact is observed among PP, which one can
also notice in Figure 11. The RIP treatment results in further declines in EE probabilities.
Interestingly, EE probabilities among SS are little affected by either treatment. Our placebo
regression (Panel (c)) shows no indication that similar declines are observed a year earlier.
    Note that these are not strictly speaking treatment/control regressions, because the ex-
periments are not simultaneous and therefore the effects of the treatments can be confounded
with other time effects. In particular, the treatment periods include the Great Recession,
which officially started in December 2007. This is particularly problematic for the second
dummy (i.e., the RIP dummy) which marks observations in 2008 and early 2009 (see dark-
shaded area in Table 1. For a genuine treatment/control regression we focus on the period
between January 2008 and March 2009. One half of this sample is subject to the first mea-
surement problem and the rest are subject to the RIP. The treatment dummy equals one
for those exposed to the RIP and zero otherwise. For the first calendar month of the sample
(January 2008), only the January 2008 cohort (the first Rotation Group) is subject to the
RIP, and remaining cohorts are not. For the last calendar month in the sample (March
2009), all rotation groups except the last one (December 2007 cohort) are subject to the
RIP. This sample structure allows us to identify the effect of the RIP (in addition to the
month effect and the rotation group effect) relative to the 2007 unknown measurement issue,
controlling for the time effect. Panel (d) of Figure 12 presents the estimated coefficients on
the RIP dummy. We can see that the RIP tends to be associated with lower (measured) EE
probabilities, particularly among SP and PS, although the effect on the PP' group is not
statistically significant.


5    Imputation of Employer-to-Employer transitions
We provided empirical evidence that changes in interviewing protocols in the CPS, of un-
known nature in 2007 and the RIP since the 2008 cohorts, altered measurement of the EE
probability, differently by respondent status. To redress measurement, we propose an im-
putation procedure based on data from 1995-2006. A simple approach is to impute EE
assuming no selection by unobservable worker characteristics. This will be approximately

correct only if observable worker characteristics strongly correlate with the unobservable
ones that determine both true EE mobility and the valid answer to the SAMEMP question.
Besides demographics, we do have rich observables that arguably do correlate with this type
of unobserved heterogeneity, specifically the rotation group, as more job-mobile individuals
may be more likely to attrite from the survey and thus no longer answer the SAMEMP
question, and the two-month respondent status sequence (SS, PP, PS, SP, PP'), as more
job-mobile individuals/households may be more likely to trigger a change in respondent sta-
tus (SP, PS, PP') and thus the application of the RIP, which prevents the interviewer from
asking the SAMEMP question. We will also exploit an aggregate indicator of the labor
market prospects for each individual to capture common factors, both trend and business


                                                          23
cycle, that affects everybody's true EE probability, independently of the RIP.
    If sizable unobserved heterogeneity remains after conditioning on observables, the result-
ing imputation will not correct for the entire bias in the raw series. Therefore, we introduce
a model of selection on unobservables. The difference in average EE probabilities between
pre- and post-2007 data, given the same observables (worker characteristics, rotation group,
respondent status, aggregate indicator), measures the sample selection of those who do an-
swer the SAMEMP question after 2007, when the share of missing answers to the SAMEMP
question suddenly rises, and after 2008, when the RIP is implemented. So, for those who do
not answer the SAMEMP question, namely for the missing records that we want to impute,
the bias is the opposite of this difference, scaled by proportions of valid and invalid records.
For example, if individuals who are more affected by the RIP tend to have a higher true EE
probability, then their selection out of the sample will make the bias in the post-RIP ob-
served EE probability negative, more so the larger the relative incidence of missing records.
We now formalize this insight.


5.1    Imputation: model
In order to clarify the possible sources of bias that the changes in the CPS interviewing
protocol, especially the RIP, introduced in measuring EE flows, and to obtain a precise
imputation formula, we lay out a statistical model. For simplicity, we refer to the RIP as
the only source of measurement error after 2007. When we implement this procedure, we
treat observations from light-shaded cohorts in Table 1 separately, given our earlier evidence.
The same model described below applies to those intermediate observations, after replacing
"RIP" with "unknown source of missing answers to the SAMEMP question in 2007-2009",
and the RIPi,t indicator with a dummy for the light-shaded area in Table 1.
    Let Ei,t denote an indicator function that individual i is employed in month t, with
observable characteristics Yi,t (a vector). Recall that DIi,t  {0, 1} indicates a valid answer
to the SAMEMP (Dependent Interviewing, retrospective) question, and let EEi,t  {0, 1}
indicate an employer-to-employer move (that the valid answer is No). A statistical model is

                        Pr (DIi,t = 1 | Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1) = fDI (Yi,t , i,t )
                        Pr (EEi,t = 1 | Ei,t-1 = 1) = fEE (Yi,t , i,t ),

where  is an unobservable individual attribute, whose distribution may depend on observ-
ables Y . Without loss in generality, we reorder values of  so that fEE (Y, ) is increas-
ing in  for every Y , and unobserved heterogeneity  is interpreted as the propensity to


                                                 24
change job. We are interested in the average mobility of formerly employed workers for each
month t, E [EEi,t | Ei,t-1 = 1] = Pr (EEi,t = 1 | Ei,t-1 = 1). Some formerly employed work-
ers do not experience an employer-to-employer transition, EEi,t = 0, because they separate
from their job into nonemployment, Ei,t = 0. The main issue that we face is that, for the
others, who stay employed and are thus eligible for the SAMEMP question, we are inter-
ested in their average mobility unconditional on a valid answer, E [EEi,t | Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1] =
Pr (EEi,t = 1 | Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1) for each month t, but we only observe the realization of their
EEi,t when there is a valid answer DIi,t = 1, namely E [EEi,t | Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1, DIi,t = 1] =
Pr (EEi,t = 1 | Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1, DIi,t = 1). The last two expectations do not coincide due to
selection on both observables and unobservables into giving a valid answer DIi,t = 1. The
unobservable individual attribute i,t is assumed to be time-varying. Its persistence captures
fixed unobserved traits of individual i, such as preference for job stability, which also de-
termine the person's propensity to be home to answer the Survey, or to give permission to
share that information with future respondents under the RIP. Its time variation captures
random events, such as receiving a job offer that brings i out of the house for a job interview
and triggers a nonresponse.
     In principle, we could specify the functions fDI , fEE of observables Y nonparametrically,
i.e., cluster observables in categorical dummies and express each f as a linear combination
of such dummies and their full interactions. The number of parameters in, thus the sample
size requirements to estimate, such a model would make this strategy infeasible, so we need
to impose some parametric structure.
     We partition observables Y into two sets Y = R  X : a "group" R that will be treated
nonparametrically, namely, imputation will be performed for each set of individuals in each
group separately; and a vector X that will enter parametrically, through regressions using
data within each group R. The variables defining the R partition should be likely to be corre-
lated with unobserved heterogeneity. In our empirical implementation, we define a group by
respondent status (SS,SP,PS,PP,PP'), which triggers application of the RIP, which in turn
may invalidate eligible records for reasons possibly related to unobserved heterogeneity i,t .
But, even before the RIP, the R =PP' group exhibits a higher rate of non-response to the
SAMEMP question (Figure 6) as well as a higher observed EE probability conditional on valid
responses (Figure 11). Therefore, conditioning on respondent group R (SS,SP,PS,PP,PP')
is useful also before the RIP, as the shares of these respondent groups in the eligible popu-
lation change over time.11 Note that, in our specific application, a given individual changes
  11
     In principle, rotation group is also likely correlated with the individual's unobserved propensity to change
job, because people who move to a different address to take a new job are no longer present in later rotation
groups, the well-known issue of geographical attrition in the CPS. In Section 6, comparing with other


                                                       25
respondent group over time depending on the sequence of respondent status over the last
two months. The other observables Xi,t are discussed below.
    To ease notation, from now we omit the conditioning on employment in consecutive
periods, Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1, hence eligibility to the SAMEMP question, with the understanding
that the analysis focuses on this group. Their mobility can then be combined with that (equal
to 0) of former employees who no longer work.
    We model the probability of an EE transition using the following linear-in-X specification:

         Pr (EEi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t , i,t ) = E [EEi,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , i,t ] = Ri,t + Xi,t  Ri,t + i,t            (1)

with  | R, X  G(· | R, X ) capturing group-specific unobserved heterogeneity.
   Our goal is to estimate the average EE transition rate in the population. By the L.I.E.,
we can write it as the average of conditional average EE probabilities over respondent groups
R and observables X :

                            E [EEi,t ] = ER,X [E [EEi,t | Ri,t = R, Xi,t = X ]]                                    (2)

so we focus on estimating the conditional rates, and then take their average in the population.
    As mentioned, the main issue is that we only observe EE transitions among eligible
records which have a valid answer to the SAMEMP question:

   E [EEi,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1] = E [E [EEi,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, i,t ] | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1]
                                       = E Ri,t + Xi,t  Ri,t + i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1
                                       = Ri,t + Xi,t  Ri,t + E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1]                     (3)

but do not observe the remaining part of the sample, who do not answer the question:

         E [EEi,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 0] = Ri,t + Xi,t  Ri,t + E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 0] .             (4)

Selection and bias may occur because the unobserved individual propensity to change job,
i,t , may be correlated with determinants of obtaining a valid answer to the SAMEMP
Dependent Interviewing question (DIi,t = 0, 1) for the same individual, so that

                      E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1] = E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 0] .
datasets, we show evidence that Survey attrition is quantitatively a minor concern for EE measurement.
Defining group by both 5 respondent statuses and 6 rotation group pairs (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8) would
require splitting the sample each month in 30 groups, which runs into sample size constraints.


                                                        26
If this were an equality, we could impute missing records based only on observables, Ri,t , Xi,t ,
i.e., projecting observed EEi,t from the valid answers on these observables and using the
regression results to fit the missing answers. In the Appendix, we present the series based
on the observables-only imputation: it is nearly identical to the one based on the MAR
assumption. Based on this evidence, which contrasts with the drastic change in the pattern
of missing answers that we document, we will proceed assuming that the last inequality holds
and that we need to correct for this bias.
     For this purpose, we make the following identifying assumptions about the unobserved
component i,t of individual i's propensity to select into the sample (have a valid answer to
the SAMEMP question) and then switch jobs in month t. Later, we describe the imputation
algorithm that these assumptions afford.

      Assumption 1: No unconditional selection. E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t ] = 0.

Given the assumed linear-in-X structure in observables (1), this amounts to assuming that
E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t ] is also linear in X , and as such is absorbed in the group fixed effect Ri,t
and in the term X Ri,t .

      Assumption 2: No selection before the RIP. Among respondents to the SAMEMP
      question who are not subject to the RIP, unobserved heterogeneity i,t is orthogonal to
      the validity of the answer to the SAMEMP question, conditional on respondent group
      Ri,t and observables Xi,t :


  E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, RIPi,t = 0] = E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 0, RIPi,t = 0]
                                                                                 = E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t ] = 0.

This is a MAR (Missing at Random) assumption about answers to the SAMEMP question
within each group Ri,t and given other observables Xi,t . Therefore, before the introduction
of the RIP, missing responses to the SAMEMP question are immune from selection on
unobservables.

      Assumption 3: Time-invariant selection after the RIP conditional on ob-
      servables. For records subject to the RIP, mean unobserved heterogeneity amongst
      valid responses to the SAMEMP question is a time-invariant function bR (X ) of respon-
      dent group R and observable characteristics X . For all (i, t):

                         E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, RIPi,t = 1] = bRi,t (Xi,t ).

                                                      27
 This assumption implies that, within each respondent group R, a valid answer to the
SAMEMP question when the respondent is exposed to the RIP may indicate a systematically
higher (or lower) mobility than a valid answer to SAMEMP when not exposed to the RIP,
but this differential mobility only depends on demographics and aggregate labor market
conditions gathered in the vector X , and has no other trend nor other time effects. Because
we treat the 2007-2009 source of unknown measurement error and the RIP separately, this
assumption applies to either, each with its own time-invariant function.


5.2     Imputation: implementation
Our goal is to impute an average EE transition probability to unobserved records as per
Equation (4) based only on observables and on our linear model (1) under Assumptions 1-3.
This requires estimating R ,  R and E [ | R, X, DI = 0] for each R, X .
   By Assumption 1, taking expectations across i, for every month t

  0 = E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t ] = Pr (DIi,t = 0 | Ri,t , Xi,t ) · E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 0]
                                                + Pr (DIi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t ) · E [ | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1] .

Rearranging, we obtain the key equation on which we build our imputation strategy:

                                           Pr (DIi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t )
 E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 0] = -                                     · E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1] . (5)
                                         1 - Pr (DIi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t )

The strategy consists of estimating all terms on the r.h.s., to obtain from that equation an
estimate of the l.h.s., for each record (i, t), both pre- and post-RIP period. We can then use
those estimates in Equation (4) to impute to each missing record an estimated probability of
an employer-to-employer move, EEi,t . Our final time series is the monthly average of these
imputed transitions and of observed EEi,t transitions.
    The average "bias" among observed answers, given respondent group and observables, is
E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1], which can be decomposed as follows:

  E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1]
          = Pr (RIPi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1) · E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, RIPi,t = 1]
                 + Pr (RIPi,t = 0 | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1) · E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, RIPi,t = 0] .

Now, Assumption 2 implies that E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, RIPi,t = 0] = 0, and Assumption



                                                         28
3 that E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1, RIPi,t = 1] = bRi,t (Xi,t ). Next

                            Pr (RIPi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1) = RIPi,t ,

is the indicator function that the RIP applies to that record. Crucially, we can assign this
indicator based on that record's CPS cohort from the darker shaded area in Table 1. Finally,
we obtain the following expression for the bias:

                          E [i,t | Ri,t , Xi,t , DIi,t = 1] = RIPi,t · bRi,t (Xi,t ) .

   We can now estimate bR (X ) by regressing within each respondent group R the observed
EE of those whom we know are treated by the RIP with probability either 0 or 1 on a
constant (for ), X (for  ) and the interaction of the RIP dummy with a flexible function of
X (for b(X )). Specifically, for each group R  {SS, SP, PS, PP, PP'} separately, we proceed
through the following imputation steps:

   1. Using all records eligible for the SAMEMP question (Ei,t-1 = Ei,t = 1), every month
      t run a separate cross-sectional Probit regression of the validity of the answer to the
      SAMEMP question (DIi,t ) on observables Xi,t . Then calculate the predicted value from
      this regression for each record, and call it Pi,t , an estimate of Pr (DIi,t = 1 | Ri,t , Xi,t )
      for that individual.

   2. Using all available valid answers to the SAMEMP question (DIi,t = 1), run an OLS
      regression of EEi,t on: a constant, Xi,t , and the interaction of RIPi,t with a flexible
      function b(Xi,t |  ) parameterized by a vector  . The resulting estimated coefficients
      for group R are, respectively, R ,  R ,  R . For all records, predict Bi,t = b(Xi,t |  Ri,t ),
      which estimates the bias of valid answers subject to the RIP (the bR (X ) function
      introduced in Assumption 3, and there assumed to be time-invariant).

   3. For each eligible record with missing answer DIi,t = 0, impute

                                                                 Pi,t
                             EEi,t = Ri,t + Xi,t  Ri,t -                  · RIPi,t · Bi,t .
                                                               1 - Pi,t

   4. Every month t, take the sum of EEi,t when observed (DIi,t = 1) and of EEi,t when
      imputed (DIi,t = 0) across all eligible records, so across all respondent groups R and
      observables X , and divide it by the number of matched individuals in the same CPS


                                                      29
       cohort who were employed a month before (Ei,t-1 = 1).12

    By Equation (2), the last ratio is an unbiased (under our model) estimate of the popu-
lation average probability of transition from employer to employer. Note that the number
of non-eligible records of workers who were formerly employed but no longer are (Ei,t-1 = 1,
Ei,t = 0) contributes to the denominator (Ei,t-1 = 1), but are excluded from the numerator,
because they would not contribute to it anyway, by EEi,t = 0. Note that the imputation
is done for pre-RIP missing records as well, based only on observables: group fixed effect
(coefficient R ) and other covariates X (coefficients  R ). Post-RIP, we also subtract the
predicted bias rescaled by the predicted odds ratio of a valid answer, per Step 3 above.
    We can now illustrate the intuition behind our strategy. The first EE regression in Step
2 exploits Assumption 2 (pre-RIP records are unbiased because Missing at Random and of
no selection on unobservables) to compute the X -dependent bias post-RIP, Bi,t = b(Xi,t |
 Ri,t ). In Step 3, Assumption 3 ensures that the function b(X |  ) is time-invariant, so
Bi,t = b(Xi,t |  Ri,t ) for the entire post-RIP period. Finally, the smaller the share of missing
answers in the survey population, the larger the adjustment in Eq. (5) needed to guarantee
that unobserved heterogeneity has zero mean in the population by Assumption 1.
    A potential concern is that the effect of the RIP may be time-varying, even conditional
on respondent group R and on other observables X , violating Assumption 3. Our evidence
suggests that this is indeed the case when comparing 2007 and later years, because the
behavior of EEm differs. In the imputation regression, we supplement the RIPi,t dummy
with a dummy for light-shaded area in Table 1, and allow the function b(Xi,t |  ), specifically
the parameter vector  , to differ between light- and dark-shaded (RIP) areas. So, in Step
2, the regression is run on a constant, observables, two "measurement error" dummies (a
light-shaded area dummy and RIPi,t ) and the interactions of each dummy with a separate
flexible function of observables.


5.3     Imputation regressions: specification and results
In Step 2 we specify the function b(Xi,t |  ) to be linear in the following observables Xi,t : an
aggregate labor market indicator, to be discussed shortly, and dummies for calendar month,
  12
     For the denominator, we restrict attention to records that we can match as described in Section 2.2.
The retrospective nature of the SAMEMP question allows us to identify also a few records that we cannot
match to the previous month, but that have a valid answer, so the Census could match them and knew that
they were previously employed. Presumably, our failure of matching based on individual identifiers is due
to survey processing errors. These cases are so few that they make no difference to the aggregate EE time
series of interest, so we feel safe in ignoring them.



                                                   30
Rotation Group (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, denoted by RG1-3 and RG5-7), gender, educa-
tion (less than HS, HS, Some College, College, Graduate Degree), marital status (Married,
Married with Spouse Absent or Separated, Widowed/Divorced, Single), age (16-20, 21-30,
31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71+), major industry (16 major industries, adjusted for breaks to
be consistent over time) and major occupation (13 major occupations, adjusted for breaks to
be consistent over time). In the Probit regression of Step 1, we omit industry and occupation
dummies, because estimation of the full specification sometimes fails to converge.
    The aggregate labor market indicator is meant to capture both low-frequency and busi-
ness cycle variation in the true monthly EE transition probability of the R group, that are
unrelated to measurement issues. By absorbing common time variation, this indicator sup-
ports the validity of Assumption 3, which requires the RIP bias to remain constant over time.
This assumption grows increasingly problematic as time goes by and the pre-RIP period, on
which we base our imputation, recedes in the rearview. It is therefore important to verify
that no residual trend and cycle are left in the average estimated bias.
    To this purpose, we choose as our aggregate labor market indicator the observed average
EE probability in the same calendar month of the SS records who are in the first (and second)
rotation (EESSRG1). In order not to restrict the effects of the trend and the cycle in such
an indicator to be the same, we enter them separately in the regression. That is, first we
fit a quadratic trend to the monthly series of EESSRG1 over the entire period. Then, we
incorporate in the vector of observables Xi,t both the fitted quadratic trend of EESSRG1
and the deviation from it in month t, as separate regressors. We choose the specific cyclical
indicator EESSRG1, to reveal some time patterns in EE transitions for all groups, because
this is a reference group that is immune, by design, to the effects of the RIP (SS) and of
survey attrition (RG1) on the response rate to the SAMEMP question. After experimenting
with many detrending methods, we choose a quadratic trend, and cyclical deviations thereof,
because the imputation regression delivers an estimated bias Bi,t that, once averaged within
each respondent group R, shows no residual trend or cyclical variation (see Fig. A.3 in
the Appendix), validating Assumption 3. Filtered through this quadratic R-specific trend,
EESSRG1 performs better than other aggregate indicators of labor market conditions that
are also immune from the RIP, such as the UE transition probability of the same R group.
We report the results of the Step-2 imputation regression in three tables in Appendix A.2.
    We briefly comment on the regression results. In Tables A.2-A.3, RIPFLAG1 and
RIPFLAG2 refer, respectively, to the light- and dark-shaded areas in Table 1. As expected,
EE mobility is higher among individuals who are in the first rotation group (thus less selected
by job-mobility-related attrition), less educated, less attached to spouses, and younger. Mo-

bility is also higher when the average EE mobility of RIP-immune records (EESSRG1) is
higher, both in trend and business cycle. RIPFLAG1, referring to the intermediate 2007-2009
period, signals a drastic level shift down in observed EE mobility, while RIPFLAG2 (RIPi,t )
impact mostly the interaction terms. These two findings indicate that the measurement issue
captured by RIPFLAG1 is harder to interpret, while the RIP captured by RIPFLAG2 has
no impact on the baseline group and operates mostly through selection. We indeed find that
the interactions of the two RIPFLAGs, especially the second (RIPi,t ), with observables Xi,t ,
especially age, are often sizable and statistically significant. The declining age profile of EE
mobility, which still survives after controlling for many other worker and job characteristics,
is much less pronounced after 2007, and even more so after the introduction of the RIP. This
finding indicates that the RIP caused a selection out of the valid sample of more job-mobile
individuals among young workers, who are more mobile to begin with. That is, fDI (R, X, )
is submodular in age (which is part of X ) and unobserved propensity  to change employer.

2007, are consistently higher, especially for respondent groups SP and PP. This suggests that
respondents who denied permission to share their answers with other household members,
thus invalidating Dependent Interviewing question, including SAMEMP, exhibit observable
characteristics that strongly correlate in other records with EE mobility.
    In Figure 14, we aggregate these group-specific series and report the main result of
our paper, which in part replicates Figure 1a: three time series for the average probabil-
ity of monthly EE transition in the US since 1995, estimated using the Fallick and Fleis-
chman (2004) method (FF), the Missing at Random assumption (MAR), and our imputation
method. In the right panel, all time series are MA-smoothed to remove high frequency noise.
    By an unfortunate coincidence, measurement issues, as revealed by the January 2007
jump in missing answers to the SAMEMP question, predate by about a year the onset
of the Great Recession. Since the EE transition probability is procyclical, the sharp drop
observed around 2008 in the "raw" (estimated according to either the FF or MAR method)
EE probability is easily attributed to the recession. Our imputation procedure leads us to
conclude that most of the drop was spurious. While the imputed EE probability did fall,
importantly, it declined later, and by much less than the raw EE series and the UE transition
probability, which declined by about half starting in late 2008, following the financial crisis.
The FF/MAR raw series and our imputed EE series share a weak recovery in 2010-2014, and
then a clear rebound, which ends in 2016. Thereafter, our EE series returns to the pre-Great
Recession level of about 2.5% and then starts to mildly decline, while the raw series remain


                                                                                33
below 2%, generating the false impression of an ongoing long-run decline in this measure
of US labor market dynamism. This is another important implication of the imputation.
While all measures of firm, job and worker turnover have been trending down in the US in
the last few decades, described in concerned terms as "declining fluidity" in the US labor
market and "declining dynamism" in US business formation (e.g., Davis and Haltiwanger
(2014), Decker et al. (2016), and Molloy et al. (2016)), at least EE turnover appears to have
stabilized in the last 15 years.


6     Comparison with other datasets, and the impact of
      the COVID-19 shock
To further corroborate the validity of our imputation, we compare the average level and time
series variation (trend and business cycles) of our CPS-based measures of the EE transition
probability with those drawn from other representative datasets of the US labor market.
This comparison also offers an opportunity to examine, for the first time, the impact of the
COVID-19 crisis on EE reallocation in the US.


6.1    Average levels and Survey attrition
As mentioned earlier, a limitation of the monthly CPS for our purposes is its address-based
nature. If an employed individual, possibly a household head with the whole household in
tow, moves out of a selected housing unit to take another job, the survey will lose track of
them and miss the EE transition altogether. The same is true of any previously employed
individual/household who moves, shortly after, into the same housing unit, thus into the
Survey, to take another job without any jobless spell. We do not know their employment
status before they enter the Survey. That is, we need to worry about the correlation between
Survey attrition and EE mobility.
    The CPS classifies non-interviews into three categories. Type A is when the Census inter-
viewer is able to confirm that the same household is living in the unit, but unable to conduct
the survey for a variety of reasons. Type B is when the survey unit (the house) is unoccu-
pied and vacant, whether for rent or sale, or held off the market. Type C is when the unit
is permanently ineligible; the typical case is "Demolished." Finally, a Replacement occurs
when one household moves out of the unit but is immediately replaced by a different house-
hold. We find that, every month since 1994, between 2% and 3% of the records of employed
workers who are not in outgoing rotation groups cannot be matched one month forward,


                                             34
because of Type B non-interviews and Replacement. Therefore, the share of movers (out
of the address and of the Survey) among employed workers, whose subsequent employment
status is unknown, is comparable in magnitude with our estimated EE transition proba-
bility. This makes the impact of Survey attrition on EE mobility potentially dramatic. If
employed people moved house only to take another job, the true EE transition probability
would roughly double our estimate. We can show, however, that this concern is not borne
out by other data.
    Our first comparison is with the quarterly Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics
(LEHD), an administrative, matched employer-employee dataset, which contains quarterly
reports on total earnings accruing to each US worker from each employer over the entire
calendar quarter. Unlike the monthly CPS, this source does not suffer from missing an-
swers, but EE transitions still require an imputation, because of a time aggregation bias.
Specifically, we know when a worker earned income from two different employers A and B in
quarter t, but to label this an EE transition from A to B in quarter t we have to rule out the
possibility that there was a jobless spell in between, which the dataset does not report. Hyatt
et al. (2014) propose and implement a filter based on changes in "main employer," defined
as the main source of earnings over two consecutive quarters, and this is the methodology
adopted by the Census to estimate the LEHD Job-to-Job Flows (J2J) series that we use.13
    To make our monthly CPS estimate of EE comparable in levels with the quarterly
LEHD's, we select CPS individuals who have complete interview histories (from RG1-RG4)
and no missing answer to the SAMEMP question at any point in the survey. We focus on
cohorts who enter the Survey from January 2000 through December 2005, which is the early
period covered by the LEHD, and when the RIP does not apply yet to the CPS so we can
use raw numbers and not our imputed series. In this set, we identify the number of workers
who were employed for all four consecutive months RG1-RG4, and estimate their share who
experience at least one EE transition during those three pairs of months. We obtain 5.53%,
which is almost identical to the 5.55% average in the LEHD over the same period. This con-
gruence is reassuring both about the Hyatt et al.'s (2014) time aggregation correction in the
LEHD and about the irrelevance of geographical attrition in the CPS for EE measurement.
    To further corroborate the last point, we turn to the Survey of Income and Program Par-
ticipation (SIPP). In principle, unlike the CPS, this representative Survey tracks individuals
even when they move. In practice, the SIPP also suffers from attrition, but at lower rates
than the CPS. We select the 2014 panel, when the Survey first asked about the reason for a
change of address. The 16 possible reasons14 mentioned to SIPP respondents well illustrate

the variety of job-unrelated reasons for people's moves. Of those who were employed at least
part of month t, 1.06% moved within state, 0.21% moved to a different state, and 0.01%
moved abroad between months t and t + 1. Of the within-state (out of state) movers, 4.54%
(resp. 30.68%) say they moved to take up a new job. Overall, about 0.1% of those who are
initially employed change address to take up a new job. This further suggests that the bias
in the CPS due to correlated attrition and EE mobility is quantitatively negligible.
    To check whether the SIPP itself well represents the fraction of employed workers who
change address, we use the American Community Survey, an annual, large, representative
cross-sectional sample of the US resident population. The IPUMS Abacus tabulates the
share of currently employed workers who report having moved house in the last year. In
2014-2018 this share, on average and nearly constant, is 12.2% who moved within state, 2.5%
from out of state, and 0.5% from abroad. These annual numbers correspond almost exactly
to the monthly numbers from the SIPP reported above.


6.2     Time-series variation
To gauge the cyclical behavior of our imputed series against alternative data sets, besides the
LEHD, we also draw from the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS),
a rotating survey of about 16,000 establishments. The quit rate in JOLTS is the ratio
between the number of employees who quit their establishments over the last month, ex-
cluding retirements which are accounted for separately, and the initial level of employment
at those establishments. Because JOLTS surveys employers, not workers, it cannot distin-
guish between quits to other jobs and quits to non-employment. It can, however, accurately
distinguish between quits and layoffs, because the employer is liable for experience-rated
Unemployment Insurance taxes only in the latter case.
    To facilitate comparison of our CPS-based series with the seasonally adjusted quarterly
series of the LEHD-based J2J series, we seasonally adjust (Census X13) both our monthly
CPS series and the monthly JOLTS series through (resp.) May and April 2020, take quarterly
averages, and rescale them so that the average level of our CPS-based, LEHD and JOLTS
series match up for the first three years of the sample.
    Figure 15 reports the results. The CPS-based FF and MAR series start dropping in early
2007, well before the Great Recession, and never recover pre-GR levels. In contrast, our

imputed series, as well as LEHD and JOLTS all drop in earnest during the Great Recession,
especially in 2008:Q3 when the financial crisis begins, and all recover their pre-GR levels by
2016. We conclude that declining dynamism in US labor markets ends in the 20th century,
at least as far as mobility between firms is concerned. In 2007, our imputed series remains
flat, while the other four series are all declining, although not synchronously, suggesting that
2007 remains a challenge for imputation. The correlation coefficient of each of the three
quarterly CPS series in Figure 15 with the LEHD series is 0.7484 (FF), 0.8008 (MAR),
0.8601 (our imputed series). The stronger correlation of our series is close to that shared
by all three measures pre-RIP (2000:Q1-2006:Q4): 0.8857(FF), 0.8887 (MAR), 0.8891 (our
imputed series), providing further evidence for the validity of our imputation. The correlation
coefficient of each of the three quarterly CPS series in Figure 15 with the JOLTS quarterly
series is 0.4803 (FF), 0.5568 (MAR) and 0.7714 (our imputed series).
    During the GR, the LEHD and JOLTS series drop proportionally a lot more than our
imputed series, and indeed than any CPS series. This difference raises the concern that our
imputation maybe over-correcting the drop due to the RIP. We believe, however, that, for the
LEHD, the large drop is due to time aggregation. The described procedure to eliminate in
the LEHD spurious EE transitions, which had a short jobless spell in between, is more likely
to succeed when short jobless spells are rare, namely, in the trough of the recession. That is,
any remaining time aggregation is likely to bias the average level of the LEHD EE transition
rate upwards, but this bias is procyclical, as it clearly emerges during the last recession, due
to its severity. Obviously, some modest time aggregation exists also in the CPS, because


                                                          37
the SAMEMP question does not distinguish between direct EE transitions and very short
jobless spells that complete within the month. As for JOLTS, quits to nonemployment are
likely to be procyclical, because they are less risky at times of high employment, and thus
amplify the cyclical volatility of the overall quit rate in the figure.
    Finally, all current series (CPS and JOLTS), once seasonally adjusted and quarterly av-
eraged, drop sharply during the COVID-19 lockdown and the resulting freeze of the US labor
market in the second quarter of 2020. Because of data availability, the latest observation
(2020:Q2) is based only on the April-May matched data for the CPS series and on April
data for JOLTS. As in the GR, the drop is especially pronounced in JOLTS. Our imputed
series drops by more than FF and MAR, consistently with the empirical evidence discussed
earlier that the sudden, exogenous reduction in CPS respondent turnover, and consequently
in the impact of the RIP, during the lockdowns mitigated the problem of missing answers
to the SAMEMP question, and thus reduced the negative bias in the raw EE transition rate
that our imputation aims to correct.


7    Conclusions
We measure aggregate employer-to-employer transitions made by workers, without any in-
tervening jobless spell, in US labor markets. We draw from the monthly Current Population
Survey. We uncover a drastic increase in the incidence of missing answers to the perti-
nent survey question (SAMEMP) starting in January 2007, predating by about a year the
full introduction of new interviewing policy, the Respondent Identification Policy (RIP).
We provide evidence that these answers are not missing at random, and these interviewing
changes caused a serious permanent downward bias in the standard measure of employer-
to-employer transitions. We propose a model of selection by observable and unobservable
worker characteristics, and build on it to impute the missing answers to recover the true
aggregate employer-to-employer monthly transition probability. We show that its decline
observed during the Great Recession started about a year later and was much less dramatic
than the raw, biased series indicates, and had fully recovered by 2016, if not earlier. We
conclude that the EE transition rate in the US is procyclical, but less volatile and higher
than previously thought, and presents no low-frequency trend in the 21st century.
     Our analysis still faces important limitations. First, while we are confident that the 2007
observations are corrupted, we are only certain that the RIP was introduced in 2008, so we
still do not know the true nature of the 2007 problem, although we apply the same procedure
to address it. Second, the share of invalid answers to the SAMEMP question in the CPS was


                                              38
modest but slowly rising even before 2007; at that point, this share experiences a few upward
jumps, mostly related to the introduction of the RIP, until early 2009, but then continues to
rise after 2009, smoothly but much faster than before 2007. We also show that the share of
CPS monthly records that can be matched month-over-month has been declining significantly
since 2010 or so. Therefore, underlying trends in response rates have been causing an overall
deterioration in the quality of CPS observations, and appear to interact with the RIP. While
our imputation procedure addresses some of this trend by controlling for sample composition
of the missing Dependent Interviewing answers, it is plausible that additional and progressive
selection by unobservable is unfolding, unrelated to the RIP and partially immune to our
imputation. In future research, we plan to investigate the causes of these ongoing trends.
Getting to the bottom of this measurement issue is especially important in light of the recent
debate on declining dynamism in US labor market.

A.1           Matching CPS files
To match records in January 1994-April 1995, we first take the variable HRHHID, which is
12 digits, and then concatenate it with a 5-digit number, which is in turn created by combin-
ing the following three variables: sample number (HRSAMPLE), serial suffix (HRSERSUF)
and household number (HUHHNUM). The resulting 17-digit number still does not uniquely
identify the household and therefore, even when combined with person line number (PULI-
NENO), the individual. For this reason, following the literature, we also use the individual's
age, gender and race to establish an individual match.A.1
    Starting in September 1995, HRHHID is 15 digits, and its three additional digits, along
with the 5-digit number formed by HRSAMPLE, HRSERSUF, and HUHHNUM as before,A.2
generate a 20-digit number that uniquely identifies the household. Individuals within the
household can then be identified by PULINENO without using observable characteristics. In
fact, after September 1995 these observable individual characteristics are likely to generate
"spurious mismatches," because the Census Bureau occasionally "scrambles" respondents'
age information, and more generally because these characteristics may be measured with
error. ID variables are arguably more fundamental to the entire Survey and thus mistakes
in coding the ID variables are likely to be rare or to be eventually corrected before the data
is made public.
    Figure A.1a presents the probability that a respondent who appears in the month-t micro
data in Rotation Groups 1-3 or 5-7 also appears in the month t + 1 data. Note that Rotation
Groups 4 and 8 in month t are excluded from this calculation, because they rotate out
of the survey in the following month as a result of the survey design. The solid line in
Figure A.1a gives the matching probability based on ID variables only, while the dashed
line gives that based also on the additional three observable characteristics. In general,
matching probabilities are fairly high although over the past several years attrition increased
by about two percentage points. The difference between the two lines measures unmatched
observations due to inconsistencies in either age, sex, or race. One can see that the dashed
line exhibits occasional downward spikes (the spike at the end of 1995 is common to both
methodologies). In Figure A.1b, we present probabilities that either age, sex, or race is
inconsistent between the two months, conditional on IDs matching between the two months.
 A.1
       We allow for age to increase by one year between the two months.
 A.2
       Starting in May 2004, this five-digit part, named HRHHID2, is directly available from the data.

The occasional drops in the dashed line in (a) are mostly due to inconsistencies in the age
information, although race also contributed to the drop at the end of 2002, because of changes
in the coding of the race variable that occurred between December 2002 and January 2003.


A.2           Imputation Step 2: Regression results
Tables A.1-A.3 summarize the results of the Step-2 regressions in our imputation procedure
described on page 29. Table A.1 presents the coefficient estimates for the 1995-2006 pre-RIP
sample, Table A.2 for the interactions with the 2007-2009 cohorts affected by the measure-
ment error of unknown origin, and Table A.3 for the interactions with the RIP, in 2008-2020.
We comment on these results in the paper.
    To validate the key Assumption 3 for our imputation, Figure A.2 shows the fit of a
quadratic trend to our aggregate labor market indicator, the observed average EE probability
in the same calendar month of the SS records who are in the first (and second) rotation
(EESSRG1). The quadratic trend and the deviations from it enter separately the imputation
regression. Then Figure A.3 illustrates the average estimated bias for each month and each
respondent group. By construction, the bias is zero before 2007. It is clear that 2007 is
different from later years, when the average bias settles into a very regular seasonal pattern,
with no visible residual trend and cycle, except for a very small decline for the PP group
and a slightly hump-shaped pattern for the PP' group. The seasonal pattern of the bias
indicates that the underlying seasonal pattern of EE, clearly visible in pre-2007 data, changed

Figure A.2: EE probability and quadratic trend: Self-Self between the first and second
months of the survey


permanently with the introduction of the RIP in 2008, and settled into a different, but equally
regular, pattern thereafter, further evidence of selection by unobservables. Over the entire
post-2007 period, the bias averages to approximately zero for the SS group, and is otherwise
negative, reflecting the reduction in measured EE due to the correlation between EE mobility
and non-response rate. The bias grows in size moving from the PS to the SP group, then
further for PP and is largest for PP'.


A.3      Imputing missing records by observables only
In the main text, we focused on three EE probability series: the Fallick-Fleischman series,
the MAR series, and our proposed series. The other obvious possibility is to impute the
missing records simply based on observables. That is, we can simply project observed EEi,t
from the valid answers on the observables and use the regression results to impute the missing
answers. Specifically, we run the imputation regression for each of the five respondent groups
(as in our proposed imputation procedure) over three different samples, corresponding to the
three shaded areas in Table 1. The latter sample selection is arbitrary, but allowing for the
regression coefficients to differ across these three samples appears reasonable. The results
are robust with respect to other sample selections as well.

figure clearly shows that imputing the missing records based only on observables results in
an aggregate EE probability series that is effectively identical to the MAR series.
