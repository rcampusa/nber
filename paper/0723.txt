           Inflation, Real Interest, and the Determinacy of
                Equilibrium in an Optimizing Framework



                              Abstract




      This paper examines the short—run relation between anticipated in-

flation and the real rate of interest in a model where agents with perfect

foresight maximize utility over infinite lifetimes. In addi'tion to deriving

behavioral functions from explicit intertemporal optimization, the approach

taken here departs from the usual IS-LM analysis in that it is dynamic and

deals with a small economy open to trade in consumption goods. Because

capital mobility must be ruled out to allow scope for variation in the

real interest rate, the results obtained here for one of the two exchange—

rate regimes considered——free floating-—apply equally to a closed economy.

      The paper shows that an increase in the expected inflation rate

depresses the real interest rate in the short run when the exchange rate is

instantaneously fixed by the central bank. When equilibrium is determinate

in the floating-rate case, the real interest rate is invariant with respect

to inflation.

 1. Introduction


      Working in the context of Metzler1s (1951) IS—LM model, Mundell

 (1963) established a short-run negative relationship between the expected

 inflation rate and the real rate of interest. According to Mundell's

 analysis, an increase in the expected inflation rate that left the

 real interest rate unchanged would reduce desired real money holdings

 and occasion an excess supply of goods through the wealth—spending channel.

 Thus, only a decline in real interest, coupled with a rise in nominal

 interest, could be consistent with simultaneous equilibrium in both

 the goods and money markets.

      This paper examines the validity of Mundell's prediction in a model

where agents with perfect foresight maximize utility over infinite

 life-times. In addition to deriving behavioral functions from explicit

 intertempora]. optimization, the approach taken here departs from Mundell's

in two respects. First, the model employed is dynamic and accounts for

both the impact and long-run effects of changes in inflation. Second, the

model describes a small economy open to trade in consumption goods.

Because capital mobility must be ruled out to allow scope for variation

in the real interest rate, the results obtained below for one of the

two exchange—rate regimes we consider -—   free   floating --   apply   equally

to the closed—economy version of the model.

     No model can admit the Mundell effect unless it also admits variation

in the relative price of physical assets and consumption goods. In this

paper, we adopt the extreme assumption that the sole physical asset is capital,

available to the economy in a fixed supply which may not be augmented

through investment. The floating and fixed exchange rate variants of

the model we study differ respectively from the models studied by

Brock (1975) and Calvo (1981) only in the introduction of non-depreciating,

 non—reproducible capital. The extension does not remove the multiplicity of

 convergent perfect-foresight equilibria that may exist in the floating—rate

model, even when consumption and real balances are normal goods, when the

marginal utility of consumption declines with real balances.1 This stands in

contrast to Fischer's (1979) result that in the Sidrauski (1967) one—sector

model with capital and accumulation, normality of both goods ensures a unique

convergent perfect-foresight equilibrium.

      The paper shows that the Mundell effect is present when the exchange rate

is instantaneously fixed by the central bank. When equilibrium is determinate

in the floating-rate case, there is no Mundell effect. Only in the fixed—rate

case does the real return on productive non—money assets fall temporarily in

response to an increase in the expected inflation rate. In the alternative

case, in which the economy is effectively closed, increased inflation, if it

has a determinate effect, causes an immediate fall in desired real balances,

but leaves other real magnitudes unchanged.

      The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the

typical household's maximization problem. Section 3 describes perfect-fore-

sight equilibrium under a floating exchange rate, showing that there are

plausible circumstances in which there exist convergent perfect—foresight

paths other than the stationary-state path. Section 4 assumes that the

exchange rate is instantaneously fixed, but is caused by the central

bak to depreciate according to a pre—announced schedule. In this

setting, an increase in the expected inflation rate is shown to lead

  This type of non—uniqueness for economies lacking capital has been noted
in unpublished portions of Brock (1972) and Calvo (1981). Apparently, the
phenomenon is not widely appreciated.

to a short—run decline in the real interest rate if the economy is

initially at rest. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.




2. The Household's Problem


        The model is one in which identical households maximize the

discounted sum of future instantaneous utilities over an infinite

planning horizon. There exists a single, composite consumption good

which is perishable and available in fixed supply. The representative

household's instantaneous utility is a strictly concave function

u(cm) of its consumption (ce) and real money holdings (rae),

defined as nominal money holdings (Mt) deflated by the domestic—currency

price of output          The household's objective is to maximize the

functional


                                                                      (1)
            f u(c,m)e dt,

where      is a fixed      subjective rate of discount. Both consumption

and real money services are normal goods. 2

       Each household is endowed with a fixed income stream of y units of

output, and may hold its remaining wealth either as money or as a

non—depreciating, non—produced physical asset ("capital") yielding a

fixed return r per unit.     There are k units of capital available to

the economy, and the price of capital in terms of the consumption

    u (c,m) = lim u (c,m) =
c--U   c        m-o m
3me non-money asset may also be thought of as land (as in Calvo (1979))
or as the foreign currency asset held in an economy with a two—tier
exchange-rate system (as in Cumby (1979)).

good is denoted by q. We define the real rate of interest as


          r+q
              q

that is, as the sum of the rate of physical return on capital and the

expected rate of capital gain. The behavior of this variable is the

focus of the analysis below.

     Given an initial level of real marketable wealth w0, the household

maximizes (1) subject to the stock constraint relating marketable

wealth (wt) to holdings of the two assets and the flow constraint linking

changes in w to saving. The stock constraint is written as


          w = m     +                                               (2)



where k denotes the number of units of the non—money asset held by

the household at time t, and     the expected price of one such unit

in terms of consumption. The flow constraint has the form


              =              + qk + (l/P)M -
                  y + rk +                      c,                  (3)



where Tt denotes expected real transfer payments from the government.

The fourth and fifth terms on the right-hand side of (3) sum to expected

real capital gains on the household's financial assets.4

     The maximum principle provides necessary conditions for the

maxmization of (1) subject to (2) and (3) .   First,   an optimal program

must choose       mr and k so as to maximize the current-value Hamiltonian




4constraint (3) is consistent with the two-tier exchange market interpretation
of the model, since interest earnings on foreign—currency assets are current
payments typically repatriated at the corranercial exchange rate.

imply the usual equality between the marginal rate of substitution

Combining (5) and (8), we find that


            A/A = 6 - Cr +      q)/q.                                               (10)



Along an optimal path, the subjective rate of time preference, 6, must

at   all times equal the sum of the            real interest rate and the      percentage
increase in the utility shadow price of real                  wealth.

 3. Perfect—Foresight Equilibrium with a Floating Exchange Rate


        The conditions derived in the previous section describe how households

 must choose their consumption and asset demands at each instant, given

 w0 and expected future paths for government transfers, the price level,

 and the real price of the non—money asset. They do not ensure optimality

 from the household's standpoint, however, for the initial shadow price of

wealth, X, must be correctly chosen. In this section we assume a

freely floating exchange rate, and derive the set of perfect-foresight paths

 for rn and      which satisfy both the necessary conditions of optimality

and the consistency requirement that the expected and realized values

of variables coincide. Associated with each such path is an implied

value of        which may be "wrong' from the household's standpoint, leading

to a suboptimal lifetime program given expectations. We therefore focus

on paths converging to a stationary state, which are necessarily equilibrium

paths. A key finding of this section is that there are plausible

circumstances under which there exists aContinuumof convergent paths, so

that equilibrium prices are indeterminate. When this is not the case and

equilibrium prices are determinate, there is no Nundell effect: inflation

does not influence the real interest rate.

     To derive the system of possible equilibrium paths, some assumptions

about   the   government's behavior are necessary. We assume that

government expenditure consists exclusively of transfer payments to the

public, and that these are financed entirely by domestic credit -

creation.     The level of transfers is varied so as to maintain a

constant (positive) rate of nominal money-supply growth, i. The

implied government budget constraint iS:

              =                                                            (11)


     Taking the number of households to be 1, we define perfect-foresight

equilibrium as follows. Let              be a differentiable path for the

price level and {} a differentiable path for the price of the non—money

asset. Suppose that the household takes as given the paths

and {} = pePtMO/Pt},           and, given initial real wealth MQ/PQ +
                                                                        q0k,
picks paths {C} {rnt} and              that maximize (1) subject to (2) and

(3). Then            and       are perfect-foresight equilibrium paths if and

only if for all t > 0,



          cy+rk                                                            (12)



          rn =      Mt/Pt.                                                 (13)



Condition (12) must hold in equilibrium because the balance of trade is

necessarily zero when there is no capital mobility and the exchange rate

floats. Thus, the economy is effectively closed from a macroeconomic

standpoint. A consequence of (13) is that in perfect-foresight equilibrium,

the path {kt} must satisfy



          k=k                                                              (14)



at each instant.

     Differentiating (13), we obtain the relationship


          rn/rn =    31— P/P                                               (15)



linking desired real balances and the equilibrium price level. Combining

(15) with (9) and (12) yields

 By (12), c = 0 in equilibrium, and so, by differentiating (6) and

 equating the result to (8), we obtain

                                                                  mucm(y+rk,m)

Assuming fl        1, we may solve (16) and (17) for m and q to find the

reduced—form equations of motion



                     [p +   6    - x(y+rk,m)Jm
               =
                                l+n                                                        (18)




          q =          -         -             +6   -
                                                        x(y+rk,m))]q.                      (19)



Together, (18) and (19) characterize the collection of possible

equilibrium paths for the economy.

     The system described by (18) and (19) possesses a unique stationary
            6
state (m,q), defined by the conditions


          u(y+rk,rn)/u(y+rk,m) = p + 6,                                                    (20)


          q =       r/6.                                                                   (21)

Thus, in long—run equilibrium, the rate of return on capital must

equal the subjective rate of time preference, while the marginal rate

of substitution between consumption and real money services must equal

the long-run opportunity              cost    of holding money. Any         path   converging to



6t3niqueness of the stationary state is a consequence of the assumed normality
of real money services.

this stationary position is an equilibrium path, for in addition to

satisfying the necessary conditions of optirnality, it satisfies the

transversality conditions

                                                 — (St                         St

These ensure that the choices of consumption and real balances prevailing

along a convergent path are optimal choices from the household's standpoint.

unanticipated rise in the trend inflation rate i causes the price level to

jump immediately to its higher long—run value, but has no effect

on the real interest rate, which remains at r/q = 5.             Thus, there is no

Mundell effect when the exchange rate floats and equilibrium is unique.

      Equilibrium will not be locally unique if 02 < 0, however, for when

this is so, any choice of the arbitrary constant k2 yields a convergent

solution to (22). Figure 1 displays the phase portrait of (22) when

02 < 0. As m and q are both free to jump in response to unanticipated

events, they may, at time t =     0, assume any value along the locus SS
in Figure 1. Each choice of initial position corresponds to a different

perfect-foresight equilibrium path. Thus, the effects of disturbances

are entirely indeterminate.

      Brock (1975) has shown how multiple steady states may arise in

a model similar to the present one when real balances are inferior over

some ranges of income.       Our example, however, shows that multiple e-

quilibria may arise even though real balances are everywhere normal, so that

there is a unique stationary position. For example, suppose the utility

function is a member of the homothetic relative risk aversion family



he economy an attain this equilibrium because there are no predetermined
variables. We ignore the possibility that there are non—convergent perfect-
foresight equilibrium paths.

          u(c,m) =   (cR/(l_R),

    where a +    < 1 and R, a,       > 0. Then fl =   (l-R)   and rational-expecta-

    tions equilibrium will fail to be unique whnever R > (1 + B)/.

          The possibility of multiple equilibria in the present example is

    disturbing, for there are no obvious pathologies (as in       the   example of

    Blanchard (1979), where the income effect of changes in inflation domi-

    nates the substitution effect) and agents live forever.9 The problem
    is not a consequence of the presence of capital (our example "works" in the

    special case k =   0)..   Indeed, when capital is introduced in the manner of

    Sidrauski (1967), so that the relative price of capital is fixed at 1 by

    technological assumption, normality of both goods is sufficient to preclude

    the existence of multiple convergent equilibria (see Fischer (1979)). In an

open economy facing a known path of foreign prices, the monetary authority

can tie down the home price level by instantaneously pegging the
                                                                            exchange
rate. This, as we shall see, removes the possiblility of multiple equilibria

in the present model.


4. Equilibrium and the Mundell Effect with a Pegged Exchange Rate

          The home country's central bank is now assumed to fix the exchange rate

at each moment by accommodating any balance—of-payments disequilibrium through

sales or purchases of non-interest-bearing foreign reserves.              Because the

central bank stands ready to exchange foreign for domestic money on given terms,

the domestic price Pt of the consumption good equals EtP, where Et is the

exchange rate (the price of foreign money in terms of domestic money) and              P is
the foreign—currency price of consumption. We suppose that the exchange rate is

pegged at each instant, but allowed to crawl upward at the pre—announced,

constant rate 71.      On the assumption that P is fixed for all t,
9
 It is the finiteness of agents' lifetimes that is behind the non-uniqueness
examples discussed by Calvo (1978).

it =   P/P. the (positive) domestic inflation rate. Government expenditure
again consists entirely of transfer payments, determined now by the formula


                      =                                                         (24)


While (24) implies that government transfers compensate the public for

the real depreciation of its money holdings, the rate of nominal money growth
                                                      10
will not equal T out of steady state.

        Under the present institutional assumptions, the future path of the

price level is exogenously determined by the central bank, and the stock

of real balances is thus a predetermined variable that can change only over

time. The asset price                   is perfectly flexible, however, and paths

Condition (14) must again obtain in equilibrium.

        Differentiation of the equilibrium condition (25) leads to the

differential equation

Differentiating (6) and combining the result with (10) yields



              c =   —i-- {u{5           - Cr + q)/q] -              Urn}.

The foregoing expression, when combined with (26) and (27), gives the ina1

equation of the system,


                                                                                —

                        cc

        The stationary state (c,xn,q) of the system described by equations

(26)-(28) is uniquely defined by (21) and

              C =   y   +    rk,
              um(c,rn)/uc(c,rn) =          71   +    5.

In   particular, q remains independent of the inflation rate. The

transversality conditions cited above again ensure that any trajectory

converging to the stationary state describes an equilibrium path. We

now show that equilibrium is locally unique, in the sense that for any

initial level of real balances m0 sufficiently close to in, there are unique

values of consumption c0 and the price of capital q0 placing the economy

on a convergent path. Thus, when the monetary authority pegs the exchange

rate, the non-uniqueness problem that exists under a freely floating rate

disappears.

       The linear approximation to the system is

The sign pattern implies that the rational-expectations equilibrium of the

economy described by (29) is unique. Given an initial value m0 of the

predetermined variable, the solution obtained from (30) by setting k1                            k2 = 0
and      =            -
             (m           rn)/w23 is the unique convergent solution of (29)
satisfying the initial condition on real balances. It follows that the

initial values of consumption and the price of capital are unambiguously

determined.

        With the local uniquenss of equilibrium established, it makes sense

to ask whether an unanticipated, permanent increase in the inflation rate

ii   leads to a short-run decline in the real rate of interest if the economy

is initially at rest. To answer this question, we must look more closely at
                                                   15



the unique saddlepath converging to the economy's long-run equilibrium.

Differentiating (30) and imposing the initial conditions                     =     = 0,
we find that


                  =           -
                      03(ct

                  = 83(w23/w13)(c            -   a),

                  =                          -
                      e3w33/w13)(ct

along the convergent saddlepath. From (29) (or directly, from

(26)), W23i'U13       _i/03
                                  >   0, and so consumption and real balances must
rise or fall simultaneously along the saddlepath.

      As in Calvo (1981), a rise in ir occasions a fall in long-run real

balances; and because consumption and real balances fall together along

the saddlepath, consumption must rise in the short run (if the economy

is initially at a stationary position) so that it may eventually return

to its inflation—invariant long-run level, y +                   rk.   The effect of

inflation on real interest clearly hinges on the sign of w33/w13. If

this ratio is positive, c and q must fall together on the transition

path following a rise in ii.            And if the economy is initially at long-run

equilibrium, q must rise on impact if it is to regain its long-run value

r/cS. The Nundell effect is verified in this case, for if q rises and q

falls in the short run, the real rate of interest, (r +                  q)/q,   must fall.

      We now establish the existence of a Mundell effect in the present model

by showing that               must indeed be strictly positive. From (29), we

find that

                        =
                            3c          —   rx   )/O3(O3 — 6).                         (31)

Recalling that      =            - uu)/u2   >   0 when consumption is a normal

good, it can be established, after some manipulation, that the right-hand

side of (31) has the same sign as



             ccmm
                    -   ( cm)2                                          (32)



But expression (32) is strictly positive because the utility function is

concave. It follows that 33l3 >       0,   implying that a permanent increase

in the expected inflation rate must depress the real rate of interest in

the short run.



5. Conclusion


      This paper has studied the link between inflation and real interest

in a simple model based on individual utility maximization over time.

When the exchange—rate follows an exogenous path determined by the

central bank, so that the domestic price level and stock of real balances

are instantaneously rigid, an increase in expected inflation does depress

the real interest rate in the short run if the economy is initially at

rest. The fall in real interest, together with the concomitant rise

in consumption, maintains the necessary equality between the marginal utility

of money and the opportunity cost, in utility terms, of holding real balances.

     When the exchange rate floats and the price level is accordingly

flexible, real balances drop immediately in response to increased

inflation, restoring portfolio balance with no change in consumption or

real interest. It may occur, however, that the model's equilibrium is

not uniquely determined in the flexible-price case. Surprisingly, non-uniqueness

can occur in quite unexceptional circumstances. It does not presuppose any
                                    17




of the pathological conditions typically invoked to generate economies

with multiple rational-expectations equilibria.

      The paper has drawn heavily on work of Brock (1975) and Calvo (1981)

introducing into their monetary models an additional asset, non-depreciating,

non—reproducible capital. An obvious next step is to extend the present

work to a two—sector setting in which investment goods can be produced

while the price of capital in terms of consumption remains variable.
