       With agency costs of managerial discretion, equity financing is advantageous for the

shareholders of firms with valuable investment opportunities but not for the shareholders of other

firms. Accordingly, we find that firms with good investment opportunities are more likely to

issue equity than debt, have a smaller abnormal return in absolute value when the issue is

announced, and experience substantial asset growth following the issue. Firms that issue equity

even though they do not have good investment opportunities experience a larger abnormal return

in absolute value when the issue is announced and invest morn after the issue than comparable

firms that issue debt.

 SectIon 1. IntroductIon.

         Why is it that some firms issue equity and others debt when they raise new funds? The most

 popular story, the pecking-order story, is based on the view that Information asymmetries between

managers and new investors make equity issues more costly than debt Issues and therefore imply a

financing hierarchy.' Investors in low flsk debt are affected only to a small extent If management attempts

to seH them overvalued securities and therefore do not discount the securities sold much to proteci

themselves against this adverse selection risk. In contrast, this flsk is large for investors who buy equity

because the value of equity is much more sensitive to new information about the finn's true value. Firms

therefore prefer issuing debt to issuing equity and firnis that cannot avoid Issuing equity experience a

negative stock-price reaction when they do so. This popular story assumes that management maximizes

the wealth of existing shareholders. It leaves no role for the agency costs of managerial discretion that arise

because managements objectives differ from those of shareholders and (or the agency costs of debt that

result from the divergence between the investment policy that maximizes finn value and the one that

maximizes shareholder wealth br a given level of leverage. In this paper we take agency costs seriously

and provide evidence that the popular story should be amended to take mb account the existence of these

costs.

         In much of the recent agency literature, ft is assumed that the agency costs of managerial discretion

arise because management values growth even when growth does not benefit shareholders. Wth this view,

management is reluctant to pay out the firm's cash flow, preferring to use it to finance new projects even

when they have a negative net present value (NPV). Management dislikes debt financing because it

restricts its ability to pursue growth. Ii management issues debt, ft has to pay a coupon regularly, satisfy

covenants, and take the risk of losing control of the corporation if it falls to follow the bond indenture. One

way to state this is that debtholders monitor management.2 In contrast, for some firms, an equity issue can




     See Myers (1 914). Information asymmetries between management and outside investors do not
necessarily imply a financing hierarchy. Examples of models which emphasize Inbormational asymmetries
but do not obtain a pecking-order result are Brennan and Kraus (1987) and Noe (1985).

   2 See Harris and Raviv (1990), Hart and Moore (1990). Jensen (1986) and Stulz (1990).
be very much like an infusion of free cash flow, i.e., of funds that management can spend without being

monitored. Therefore, if management wants to invest in a project of marginal value and does not have

inside funds available, it is more likely to be able to do so If the firm has low leverage and it will prefer to

finance ft with an equity issue.

        Though debt financing restricts managements discretion to pursue growth objectives. ft fails to

discriminate perfectly between management exploiting positive NPV growth opportunities and management

growing firm size at the expense of firm value. This means that debt financing is advantageous for

shareholders when a firm has poor investment opportunities, because it constrains management to pay out

cash flow, but not when a firm has good investment opportunities, because ft may prevent that firm from

fully taking advantage of its opportunities. Since equity increases managerial discretion, management would

rather finance with equity if internal funds are insufficient. However, the value of the firm when management

finances with equity inappropriately is lower and therefore outside investors are more likely to intervene and

remove or restrict management.' The greater threat of outside intervention resulting from equity financing

limits the extent to which management finances projects with equity Issues and explains why management

which issues equity when it does not have good projects conveys bad news to shareholders, since it

effectively says that it is not concerned about intervention from outside investors.

        In this paper, we find evidence that firms issuing equity belong to two types based on firm

characteristics that are observable at the time of the issue. There are firms with valuable investment

opportunities that obtain financing through an equity issue because this makes them better able to grow

profitably. There are also equity-issuing firms that have poor investment opportunities and have not

exhausted their debt capacity. Without agency costs of managerial discretion, one would not expect the

latter firms to issue equity. Equity issues by such firms are bad news for shareholders and we show that,

controlling for other firm and Issue characteristics, firrns with poor investment opportunities have a more

negative stock-price reaction to equity issues than firms with better investment opportunities. We provide



    Further, as argued in Stulz (1988). equity financing reduces the extent to which management and its
ames control votes within the corporation and hence makes outside intervention easier.

                                                      2
 other evidence supporting the view that some firms issue equity when they should not If their management

was maximizing shareholder wealth. In particular, we show that finns with poor Investment opportunities

issuing equity invest more than similar firms issuing debt, that firms with low managerial ownership have

worse stock-price reactions, and that the worst stock-price reactions occur for firms with poor Investment

opportunities issuing equity to finance capital expenditures.

         We proceed as follows. In section 2. we provide a more detailed analysis of the agency argument

and of its implications for the Interpretation of the stock-price reaction to equity Issues. In section 3, we

introduce our sample and discuss the characteristics of firms issuing debt and equity. In section 4, we

provide our evidence that investment opportunities play an Important role in firms' issuing decisions. In

section 5, we investigate how the stock-price reaction relates to firm characteristics. In section 6, we show

that debt and equity issuing firms have distinct investment patterns following the new issue. Concluding

remarks are presented in section 7.



Section 2. Agency costs and the security Issue decIsIon.

        To understand the role of agency costs in the security issue decision, It is best to investigate a

special case of Myers and Majluf (1984). In their model, management has better information than Investors

about assets in place and about the firm's investment opportunities. If management can issue securities

at a higher price than they are truly worth given its information, it chooses to do so to maximize the wealth

of the existing shareholders. Riskless debt cannot be sold for more than it is worth, but risky debt and

equity can. When the firm announces issues of risky securities, therefore, outsiders adjust their valuation

of the firm to reflect the new information. This adjustment is trivial If the securities issued are not very

sensitive to firm value, but is significant in the case of equity. The valuation Impact of equity issues

increases their cost and induces firms to issue equity only as a way of raising funds when debt financing

would be extremely costly because the firm has exhausted its ability to sell low risk debt. For these results

to hold, though, it is crucial for outsiders to be less well-informed than management about both components

of firm value.


                                                     3
         Suppose now that outsiders know the value of assets in place in the Myers and Majluf model. Then,

 as recognized by Myers and Majiul, the model collapses: The firm always Invests if it has a positive NPV

 project and, in thek set-up, always issues equity to finance It. With agency costs, this special case remains

 interesting because management may choose to issue to invest in a negative NPV project to maintain firm

 growtk Consider an all-equity firm such that outsiders expect the firm to have no profitable investment

 opportunities. If the firm issues to invest, it is good news if management maxirrüzes shareholder wealth

 because it means that a good project arrived to the firm unexpectedly. However, suppose that the

 probability of arrival of a good project is trivial and outsiders are uncertain about the extent to which

 management is willing to invest in negative NPV projects to grow the firm. It management finances

investment through a debt issue, it has to be prepared to Face monitoring by creditors who want to make

sure coupons and principal will be paid and the bond indenture respected. ThereFore, It will be difficult for

management to finance a negative NPV project with debt unless the 1km has so little leverage that

monitoring by creditors is irrelevant. If the firm has enough leverage that creditors would monitor.

management will choose to issue equity if it decides to undertake the bad project and management's

decision is bad news for shareholders.

        If the firm has good projects, high leverage will make it less likely that It can take full advantage

of these projects. For instance, any adverse liquidity shock Is more likely to force a highly levered firm to

cut back on investment than an all-equity firm.' Consequently, firms with good projects want to limit their

leverage and, if levered, are more likely to choose equity financing.5 The agency costs that arise because

a levered firm may be unable to pursue the investment policy that would maximize the value of an all-equity

firm are called here the agency costs of debt.



     See Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1993) for a review of the literature on the relation between
liquidity shocks and investment. Lang, Ofek and Stulz (1994) show that investment is negatively related to
leverage for low q firms.

     $ There is cross-sectional evidence which shows that firms with better investment opportunities have
lower leverage. See, for instance, Titman and Wessels (19B8) and Smith and Watts (1992). Note, however,
that there is a mechanical negative relation between market leverage and Tobin's q if firms adjust leverage
infrequently, since market leverage falls as the numerator of q increases.

                                                     4
         In figure I. we show the optimal amount of leverage for given Investment opportunities if the agency

 costs of debt increase with leverage and if the agency costs of managerial discretion fall with leverage. We

 show how   a shift in investment opportunities leads to a decrease in leverage: For each level of leverage,
an increase in investment opportunities (1) increases the agency costs of debt because the firm has more

to lose from financial distress and (2) decreases the agency costs of managerial discretion because the

objectives of management and shareholders become more congruent when Investment opportunities

become better.

         Since equity provides unrestricted funds, why is It that management ever chooses to Issue debt?

Issuing equity has both direct and indirect consequences for management. The direct effect is an increase

in managerial discretion that management values. However, the indirect effect can be quite adverse for

management depending on the firm's situation. If the firm does not have valuable investment opportunities,

an equity issue means that the agency costs of managerial discretion increase, which provides greater

incentives for outsiders to try to affect management's actions.' In particular, control activities, such as

takeovers, more active monitoring by large shareholders, more monitoring by board members, and proxy

fights, all became more advantageous for shareholders and outside investors, Issuing equity inappropnately

can therefore increase the probability that management will lose control through corporate control actions

unless management is well protected from such actions. Further, for a given amount invested in the firm

by management and its allies, equity financing reduces the fraction of votes controlled by management and

its allies (see Stulz (1988)). Consequently, equity financing both increases the benefits from outside

intervention and makes outside intervention easier.

        Taking into account the agency costs of managerial discretion makes the information content of new

security issues more complicated. To understand this information content, It Is best to focus on the relation



    6 See Zwiebel (1994) for a model where management issues debt because of a threat from the market
for corporate control. Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein (1993) also have a related model where the better
firms choose financing with low monitoring, intermediate quabty firms choose financing with high monitoring,
and the worst firms chose financing with low monitoiing. In their paper, financing with low monitoring is
pubHc debt and financing with high monitoring is bank financing. Here, financing with low monitoring is
equity and financing with high monitoring is pubc debt.

This figure shows optimal leverage as a function of the agency costs of debt (DD) and the agency costs of managerial discretion (MM) for agiven

nagerial discretion curve to M'M', so that optimal leverage falls from L to U.
 between stock-price reactions and a firm's investment opportunities since the agency costs of managerial

 discretion are inversely related to the quality of the firm's investment opportunities. lithere Is no uncertainty

 about the value of a firm's investment opportunities, the issuing decision is straightforward in the pecking-

order model, If a firm has sufficiently good investment opportunIties, It issues equity ltd cannot issue debt

and the issue is not very informative about the value of assets in place If the investment opportunities are

good enough. In contrast, lithe lirm has poor Investment opportunities, ft never Issues equity. For firms with

sufficiently good investment opportunities, one would expect the interests of management and shareholders

to coincide so that there is no reason to depart from the pecking-order model. Firms that can finance with

low risk debt do so; those that cannot either issue equity or do not Invest if equity Is too underpriced. For

firms that have poor investment opportunities, however, there are good reasons to expect departures from

the pecking-order model if management pursues objectives of Its own. In particular, management may issue

equity to keep the firm growing even though the firm has no good Investment opportunities. For such firms,

an equity issue reveals to outsiders that management has to raise funds to finance Its plans, that it has

decided to proceed with poor investments and, finally, that it views the risks to Its position from doing all

this to be worth taking. If the equity issues are equally unanticipated for both firms, the news for outsiders

is worse for the firm with poor investment opportunities.

         At this point, it is useful to summarize the view that agency costs matter for security issues by

showing how these costs affect the firm's decision of which security to Issue (the Issue decision), how

stock-price reactions are consistent with the existence of such costs (the information content), and how the

firm's behavior after the issue is affected by these costs (theex post actions):

         1. The issue decision. Agency considerations imply that, keeping the threat of successful outside

intervention constant, managers favor equity over debt, so that for firms where the agency costs of

managerial discretion are important, one would expect management to Issue equity even though

shareholders would be better off with a debt issue or no issue at all.

        2. The infonnation content An equity issue that Is not In the Interests of shareholders has a

negative impact on shareholder wealth to the extent that it is not anticipated. This is because the funds are


                                                       6
 kety to be invested poorly and because management is not as constrained by monitoflng from outside

 investors as was expected.

         3. The ex post actions. One would expect equity-issuing firms to grow more than comparable debt-

issuing Arms, whether their investment opportunities are valuable or not.

        It is important to note that the implications of agency costs do not make the considerations

emphasized in the pecking-order story irrelevant. Irrespective of the importance of the agency costs of

managerial discretion, there will always be a degree of undervaluation of the existing shares such that

management chooses not to issue. For firms where the agency costs of managerial discretion are small

enough, it may be that the pecking-order story applies exactly. The pecking-order story based on

information asymmetries assumes that management maximizes shareholder wealth whereas the agency

costs view assumes that management pursues objectives of its own. As emphasized by Dybvig arid Zender

(1991) and others, the pecking—order story makes an ad hoc assumption about management's objectives

that would not be appropriate if shareholders could choose a compensation policy for management such

that the ex ante value of the Arm is maximized. This means that the pecking-order story does not have the

intellectual high ground over the agency costs view: both approaches start from assumptions about

management's objectives that are not derived from first principles. It therefore Is an empirical question as

to whether the pecking-order story is enough to explain the new issue decisions of firms or whether agency

costs are determinants of this decision that cannot be ignored.



Section 3. The sample.

        To obtain our sample of new bond issues and primary stock offerings, we used the Registered

Offerings Statistics File from 1977 to 1984. For the stock offerings, we used the Corporate Financing

Directory published by the Investment Dealers Digest to exclude all offerings that invoke secondary stock

offerings and all shelf-offerings. We restrict the sample to finns whose stock returns are available on the

CRSP tape for the whole calendar year before the announcement date. To obtain the announcement date,

we consulted the Wall Sbeet Journal Index. We use as our event date the first mention of a security issue


                                                     7
 before the offering date and exclude secuflty issues for which such announcements are not available. We

 exclude utilities and banking firms to conform to the earlier terature. We also eliminate firms that have

 confounding announcements, such as dividend or earnings announcements.

         We compute abnormal returns using a method similar to the one used by Asquith and Mullins

 (1986). For each calendar year in the sample we rank securities in the CRSP daily tile according to their

 beta estimated using the market model. We then divide the securities Into ten portfolios based on estimated

 betas. For eacfl firm Issuing a security, we compute the abnormal return over a two-day period that Includes

 the day of the Wall Street Journal announcement and the day preceding the announcement. The abnormal

 return is defined to be the return of the issuing firm minus the return or the portfolio to which the firm

 belongs!

         Table 1 provides a summary of the abnormal return data for thestock and bond issues. The results

are similar to those reported in earlier papers, namely equity announcements have a significant negative

stock-price reaction and debt announcements have an insignificant stock-price reaction.5 Table 1 also

reports various characteristics of firms issuing debt and equity. The median debt-issuing firm has a stock

market capitalization about four times larger than the median equity-issuing firm and raises about four times

more funds through the issue. The equity-issuing firms are riskier than the debt-issuing firms, in that they

have both a higher beta and greater stock return volatility, The leverage measure that uses the market

value of common stock in the denominator does not differ between firms issuing debt and those issuing

stock, whereas the leverage measure that uses the book value of total assets In the denominator is higher

for firms that issue equity. Therefore, book leverage is more supportive of the pecking-order story than a



    'All our results hold if we compute abnormal returns as market model residuals. We choose to focus
on the abnormal returns using the Asquith and Mullins (1986) method because one of our explanatory
variables in abnormal return regressions, the cumulative excess return for the 11 months before the issue,
has a high correlation coefficient (0.48) with the market model alpha.

      For instance, Mikkelson and Partch (1986) find an average abnormal retum for stock issues of
 -3.56% and straight debt of -0.23%, Eckbo (1986) finds a similar result for debt Issues. Asquith and Mullins
(1986) find an abnormal return for primary stock issues for Industrial firms of -3.0% whereas Masulis and
Korwar (1986) find a stock-price reaction of -3.25%. Barclay and Lltzenberger (1988) find an abnormal
return of -244% for the three hours surrounding the announcement on the Broad Tape.

         The adverse selection model predicts that Arms are more kety to issue equity when the stock price

 experiences positive abnormal returns before the issue. Such a result is also consistent with the managerial

 discretion view. Firms that experienced positive abnormal returns are more likely to have good investment

 opportunities (since they may just have obtained them) and are more kely to have good managerial

performance (since it may just have improved). Measuring the cumulative excess return of the issuing firms

common stock like Asquith and Mullins (1986), we find that firms that issue common stock have

experienced significant positive abnormal returns for the 11 months before the stock issue, whereas firms

that issue bonds experience insignificant negative cumulative abnormal returns on average. The result for

debt is inconsistent with some versions of the adverse selection model. For instance, Lucas and McDonald

(1990) conjecture that firms issuing risky debt should have positive cumulative abnormal returns on average

if debt is viewed as equity with less risk. It is supportive, however, of the managerial discretion view that

suggests that if the stock-price performance is poor, showing that management's performance has become

weaker, equity will be expensive compared with funds that impose restrictions on managements actions.

The firms issuing equity and those issuing debt have similar cash flows before the issue. We investigated

also, but do not report here, earnings to total assets, ESIT to total assets and net operating Income to total

assets. In all cases, the mean for equity Issuing firms is larger, but the difference in means is significant

only for net operating income. The only case where the difference is significant Is for net operating income.

Finally, the Arms issuing debt have a substantially higher dividend yield than the firms issuing equity,

        Using the ratio of the market value of equity plus debt to the book value of assets as a proxy for

Tobin's q, firms issuing equity have better investment opportunities than firms issuing debt at the time of

the announcement. For a subset of the firms in the sample, replacement costs were available using FASS

files; the results on this subset are similar to the ones reproduced here. However, the results reported in

this paper use simply the book value of the firm's assets as a proxy for replacement costs in an effort to




     Mikkelson and Partch (1986) obtain a similar result on a smaller sample of bond offerings.

 use as large a sample as possible in our regressions and to avoid a selection bias against srnaU firms

 resulting from the lesser availability of data for these firms. In addition, firms Issuing equity (but not those

 issuing debt) are more likely to do so when the leading indicators suggest good economic conditions and

 therefore good investment opportunities)° Finally, the cumulative abnormal returns before the issue

 discussed in the previous paragraph are consistent with an improvement In the Investment opportunities

 of firms issuing equity before the Issue.




 Section 4. An empirical analysis of the security Issue choice.
         In this section, we investigate an empirical model of security issue choice for our sample firms, This

 model uses variables typically used in the Merature to predict the security Issue choice plus a proxy for

investment opportunities. For given firm characteristics, the agency costs of debt are higher for finns with

better investment opportunities, so that one expects the probability that a firm will Issue equity absent

agency costs of managerial discretion to increase with investment opportunities. Firms with high agency

costs of managerial discretion will issue equity with poor investment opportunities, but such firms are

expected to be a subset of the sample so that in a logistic regression model they will be firms that are not

expected to issue equity and hence issue against type. We then show how the firms that issue equity as

predicted differ from those which issue equity when they are predicted to issue debt.

         The literature on the determinants of firms' capital structures is extensive, but some key ideas are

pervasive in lhe existing empirical work. In this paper, we Focus on a smali number of determinants of

leverage that are generally considered by empiricists and reflect these key ideas:"

        1. Taxation. Because of the deductibility of interest payments, a number of papers argue that the

gain from debt financing relatively to equity financing increases with the fimrrrs tax rate. The literature has

shown that the firm's tax status affects the issue decision (see Mackie-Mason (1990)). As a proxy for these


   '° Choe, Masulis and Nanda (1989) observe the same result.

   " See Masulis (1988) and Harris and Raviv (1991) for references to empirical studies that use these
vanables as well as for references to theoretical papers that motivate their use.

                                                      11
 benefits, we use tax payments divided by total assets for the year preceding the Issue.

          2. Costs of financial distress. As debt and firm risk Increase, financial distress and bankruptcy

 become more likely. As a risk proxy, we use stock return volatility measured over 200 days preceding the

 issue; profitability is measured as cash flow divided by total assets; and leverage is measured as long-term

 debt divided by total assets. We used alternate proxies for risk (beta Instead of volatility), for profitability

 (earnings measures) and for leverage (market value of equity Instead of total assets). Our results are

 insensitive to the choice of proxies for bankruptcy risks and costs.

         3. Asymmetric information. Following Myers and MajIuf (1984), It is well-established that Issuing

 equity is more expensive when there is asymmetric Information between firm Insiders and outsiders.

Therefore, one would expect firms where this information asymmetry is large to issue debt If they can or

abstain from raising funds altogether. As emphasized by Korajczyk, Lucas and McDonald (1991). one would

also expect firms to time equity issues for periods where the Information asymmetry Is smaller. Further,

Lucas and McDonald (1990) show that equity issues are more likely after Increases In the firm's stock price

since then the firm is less likely to be undervalued. We use the cumulative excess returns measured over

200 days before the issue, a measure of leading indicators of economic activity, arid a measure of slack,

namely cash and liquid assets normalized by total assets.

        In some of our regressions, we also control for the amount raised through the security issue since

net proceeds have been found to affect the stock-price reaction in some studies. Presumably, the amount

raised by the firm and the type of security issued are jointly endogenous variables. This suggests that

logistic regressions that do not include the amount raised as an explanatory variable have the Interpretation

of reduced form equations, whereas equations that include the amount raised suffer from a simultaneous

equation bias. A more important reason to consider regressions without the amount raised as an

explanatory vanable. is that such regressions can be used by investors to forecast whether a firm wifi issue

equity or debt, whereas regressions that incorporate the size of the issue cannot (since they incorporate

information not available before announcement of the type of security issued).

        Regression I shown in table 2, shows that investment opportunities play a substantial role in the

 new issue decision. With our logistic model, an equity issue takes value one and a debt issue takes value

 zero. Therefore, a positive coefficient indicates that a firm is more likely to Issue equity. The Tobin's q proxy

 we use has a positive coefficient that is highly significant. Further, Tobin's q has substantial explanatory

 power in that, if it is omitted, the pseudo R-square falls by almost 113. Other variables Indicative of good

 investment opportunities are highly significant also. Both past cumulative excess returns and leading

indicators have positive coefficients with p-values of less than 0.01. Cash flow, however, Is not significant.

Some variables emphasized by other capital structure theories also play an important role. Tax-paymenls

divided by total assets has the expected negative coefficient and Is highly significant. Leverage, however,

is insignificant. This result holds when we use alternate leverage measures and is not surprising considering

the earlier literature, For instance, Baxter and Cragg (1970) do not find a signIficant leverage coefficient

either.'3 Since leverage and volatility are correlated, we omit volatility in a regression not reproduced here;

doing so does not make the coefficient on leverage significant. Finally, we would expect slack to have a

positive coefficient; instead, it has a negative insignificant coefficient.

         In regressions two and three, we add measures of the size of the security issue normalized by the

market value of the firm's equity as an explanatory variable. These measures of the relative size of the

security issue have no impact on the effect of investment opportunities on the new Issue decision. Not

surprisingly, given the statistics of table I, the relative size of the issue is negatively related to the

probability of issuing equity. Two firm characteristics seem to have effects that depend on the relative size

variable; leverage that becomes significant for one relative size measure and volatility which ceases to be

significant. The size measures have a substantial impact on the explanatory power of the regressions. in

regressions not reproduced here, we added total assets and the market value of equity as separate

explanatory variables. The addition of these variables does not affect the conclusions drawn from table.2,

but their coefficients are significantly negative.

        Although our regressions are parsimonious compared to those of earlier papers, they classify



    13 Marsh (1982) does not use leverage but deviations from target leverage in his regressions. He finds
that firms that have high leverage relative to a target are more likely to issue equity.

                                                        14
 correctly a traction of the decisions that is equal to or greater than the fraction correctly classified in these

 papers. For instance, Marsh (1981) classifies correctly 75% of the decisions, whereas our regressions in

 table 2 classify correctly from 75% to 82% of the decisions.

         With this model, we have firms that issue equity even though they resemble firms that issue debt.

 Table 3 compares these finns to the firms that issue debt and the firms that Issue equity and are predicted

 to do so. To classify firms, we use equation one of table 2. For that equation, the threshold that minimizes

 the sum of the probability of a type I and of the probability of a type II error Is 0.42. In all their

characteristics except the ratio of proceeds to market value of equity, the firms that issue equity when

predicted to issue debt look indistinguishable from debt-issuing firms. In contrast, these equity4ssuing firms

are significantly different from finns issuing equity predicted to do so for many characteristics, The firms

issuing equity against type pay more taxes relative to assets than other equity-issuing finns. showing that

the tax deductibility of interest would be quite valuable for them. These firms have less leverage than firms

predicted to issue equity, although not significantly so. They issue at times when leading indicators are

neutral. Their past abnormal returns are insignificantly different from zero. Their volatility is closer to the

volatility of firms issuing debt. Finally, these firms have much poorer investment opportunities than firms

predicted to issue equity. Their mean and median q proxy is only trivially different from the mean and

median q proxy of firms issuing debt. There are no significant cash flow differences among the three sets

of firms. Given the characteristics of these firms, it is difficult to argue that they would benefit from the

flexiDility resulting from issuing equity instead of debt.

        Since managerial ownership is often viewed as an indicator of agency costs, we collected

ownership data from Value Line and found it available for 100 equity-issuing firms. In the last row of table

3, we compare managerial ownership of the two groups of equity-issuing firms. We find that firms that issue

equity against type have lower ownership, but not significantly so.

        Why do firms issue equity against type? Within the context of the pecking-order story, several

explanations seem plausible. First, one might argue that firms will issue equity at times when the cost of

  issuing equity is low because information asymmetry is low." In this case, one would expect the

  information content of equity issues to be low also. This is because it must be public knowledge that

 information asymmetry is low since otherwise firms will face high costs of issuing equity anyway. This would

 suggest that firms that issue equity against type would have a small stock-price reaction. Second, firms

 which issue without a runup convey information that they do not expect good news to be revealed. For firms

 that do not have the option to issue debt, It may make sense to Issue to have funds available to invest.

 However, for firms that can issue debt, it is harder to make the case that there Is much to be gained from

 issuing equity when inFormation asymmetry Is high and when Investment opportunities are poor. it is

 perfectly plausible, though, that firms where the agency costs of managerial discretion are high will

 sometimes issue in such circumstances since managements objectives differ from those of shareholders.



 Section 5. The stock-price reactions to security issues and investment opportuni-
 ties.

         Among firms issuing equity, there are firms with good Investment opportunities and limited debt

capacity. One would expect these firms to issue equity if they raise Funds and one would expect this action

to be in the interest of shareholders, Other firms have poor investment opportunities and look like they could

issue debt, The shareholders of these firms would be better off to have the firm either issue debt or not

raise funds. Since firms form a continuum across types, one would expect the firms where issuing equity

is the least likely to benefit shareholders to have the largest fall In the stock pflce at the announcement of

an equity issue if all issues are equally unanticipated,' Table 4 provides estimates of the correlation

between a firm's type, defined by the probability that a firm will issue equity based on the logistic model of

the previous sections, and the firm's abnormal return for each type of issues. The correlation estimates for

the equity issues are positive and significant; the estimates for debt Issues are negative but insignificant.

                    (1993) models such deviations from the pecking-order model.

     Bayless and Chaplinsky (1991) show that abnormal returns are lower for firms that have a greater
probability of issuing equity.

           We now turn to the relation between abnormal returns and a firm's investment opportunities. With

  the managerial discretion view, equity issues are not in the Interest of shareholders for firms with poor

  investment opportunities. The Pearson correlation between the stock-price reaction to equity issues and our

 q measure is 0.22 (p-value of less than 0.01) and the Spearrnan rank-sum correlation Is 0.18 (p-value of

 0.01). When we divide the sample Into q deciles, we find that the highest q decile has a mean abnormal

 return of -0.22% whereas the lowest q docile has a mean abnormal return o(4.60%. For debt issues, the

 correlation measures are respectively 0.11 (p-value of 0.07) and 0.10 (p-value of 0.10). Therefore, there

 is a robust relation between stock-price reactions to equity Issues and q. but not for debt issues. In a

 regression of abnormal returns on a constant and q, the coefficient on q is 0.97 with a 1-statistic of 2.63 for

 equity issues and it is 051 with a t-statistic of 1.39 for the debt issues. These results are stronger than the

 results From the earlier literature. Barclay and Utzenberger (1988) and Pilotte (1992) find insignificant results

 using conventional levels of significance, but they have fewer issues than we do. Denis (1994) has a large

sample yet finds a weaker relation than here; this may be due to the fact that our sample stops in 1984,

so that it is not affected by the subsequent change in reporting practices of the Wall Street Journal)5 It may

be, though, that the relation between q and abnormal returns will be hard to estimate precisely as long as

we do not have good models of the extent to which an equity issue is anticipated. To see this, suppose that

the market knows that some low q firms will issue equity to enable management to pursue its goals and

that some high q firms will issue equity to finance obviously worthwhile projects. For these two sets of firms,

the average abnormal return will be close to zero. The high q firms expected to issue have no impact on

the measured relation between q and investment opportunities since an unexpected equity issue for these

firms would have a small abnormal return anyway, but the low q firms expected to issue lower the

regression coefficient between q and the abnormal returns since an unexpected Issue from these firms

would have a large abnormal return. The number of low q firms issuing equity will depend on the sample




   ' Before 1985, the WSJ reports on equity issues as a regular news kern. After 1985, most the
information on new issues is reported in the new securities issues column which contains mostly offering
information.

The regression models are estimated using weighted least squares with the weight for each Issue
being the inverse of the variance of the market model residual for the firm Issuing the security.
The sample includes 189 equIty issues from 1977 to 1984. The proceeds of an issue correspond
to the gross proceeds in miIons of dollars. Regression (6) uses the log of relative proceeds.
0MW is the ratio of the market value of the firm's equity plus the book value of its debt divided
by the book value of total assets. Cash flow Is operating income before depredation minus total
taxes adjusted for changes in deferred taxes, minus gross Interest expense and minus dividends

  considered and therefore the anticipation effect may be stronger In some samples than others. This means.

  however, that the relation between q arid the issuing decision is easier to estimate convincingly in empirical

 models of the th•m's decision to issue equity as opposed to debt rather than In empirical models which

 attempt to explain abnormal returns. Another issue that may make ft difficult to estimate the relation

 between abnormal returns and q that affects some earfler papers is the use of the market model. A high

 q firm is more kely to have done well recently and hence to have a positive alpha in market model

 regressions: this increases its predicted return and lowers the regression coefficient o(q in cross-sectional

 regressions.

         q is positively correlated with a variable emphasized in models that focus on adverse selection,

 namely the runup in the firm's stock-price before the issue. q is also ikely to be corTelated with other

 vanables emphasized in the literature. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether the relation between

 abnormal returns and q can be athibuted to its role as a proxy for other variables that may have nothing

 to do with managerial disaetion. We investIgate this in table 5 for stock Issues. It Is immedIately apparent

that the coefficient on q is not affected by the inclusion of the additional variables emphasized by the earlier

bterature. In these regressions! though, the stock runup is not significant and the leading indicators are not

significant either. Therefore, in such regressions, it seems that q dominates the variables emphasized in

papers which focus on adverse selection. When we regress the abnormal return on q and past cumulative

abnormal returns alone, past cumulative abnormal returns has a coefficient of 1.62 with a t-statistic of 1.52,

in contrast to q that has a coefficient or 0.93 with a t-statistic of 2.52. The inclusion of a q proxy results in

a substantial weakening of the variables emphasized in papers which focus on adverse selection. Some

might argue that q is a belier estimate of oveivaluation than the stock runup and that it Is related to the

abnormal return for that reason, If that were the case, though, one would expect equity-issuing firms to

invest less than debt-issuing firms with comparable q's. since presumably the equity-issuing firms are the

overvalued firms where q overstates investment opportunities. We investigate this in the next section.

        We estimated similar regressions for debt issues, but do not report them here. The only variable

that is ever significant in these regressions is the amount of the issue divided by the value ol common

  is never greater than zero.

          The results provided are consistent with the role of agency costs In the new issue decision. An

 equity issue allows Arms with poor investment opportunities to invest In poor projects and/or to reduce the

 disciplinary role of debt. Table 6 shows the abnormal returns for equity issues divided according to the

 purpose of the issue. The stock-price reactions that are above the average for the sample are for firms that

 plan to use the proceeds for capital expenditures, firms that plan to replace long-term debt, and firms that

 plan to replace bank debt. We investigated whether there is a relation between firm type and the abnormal

 return for a given issuing purpose. The problem with this Investigation Is that the cell sizes become small.

 Nevertheless, it is interesting that the nine firms that are not of the equity-Issuing type which plan to use

 the proceeds for capital expenditures have an average abnormal return of 4.43% with a t-statishc oI-5.52,

 whereas the 29 fIrms of the equity-issuing type planning to use the proceeds for capital expenditures have

 an average abnormal return of -2.52% with a t-statistic of -3.41. This evidence should be treated with

caution given the cell sizes, but it nevertheless provides support to the argument that outsiders view the

information that a firm invests the proceeds when it is not of the equity issuing-type negatively.

         It is often argued that agency costs of managerial discretion are less for lirms with high managerial

ownership because management bears more of the monetary consequences from pursuing its own

objectives. We have ownership data available from Value Une for 100 equity issuing firms, For this smaller

sample, we find that when we split the sample into high and low ownership, the low ownership sample has

a mean abnormal return of -3.71% and the high ownership sample has a mean abnormal return of -2.56%.

The difference between the two groups is 1.16% with a t-statistjc of 1.72. One might worry that this

difference is size-related since ownership is inversely related to size; when we split the sample according

to firm size, however, there is no difference in abnormal returns.

 Section 6. Ex post characteristics of firms issuing debt and equity.
         So far, we have shown that the typical equity-issuing firm has good Investment opportunities

compared with the typical debt-issuing firm and that the market reaction to an equity Issue is negatively

related to the issuing finn's investment opportunities. It could be, though, that firms issuing equity with poor

investment opportunities do so because they believe that they are worth less than the market's valuation

since they are low q firms. If this were the case, one would expect these firms to Invest less than the other

equity-issuing firms. In contrast, agency considerations suggest that these firms issue equity to invest oven

though they have poor investment opportunities.

         In this section, we investigate whether the post-issue characteristics of firms issuing equity against

type resemble those of debt-issuing firms of similar type or those of equity-issuing firms of different type.

We provide this information for all firms issuing a type of security as well for subsamples of firms that are

expected to issue the security they issue and those that are not, To distinguish between firms that are

expected to issue a security and those that are not, we use equation (1) from table 2 In the same way we

did to construct table 3. For each variable, we compute the change in the variable from the year before the

issue to the year after the issue, expressed as a percentage of the variable for the year before the issue.

We reproduce the change in cash flow and leverage even though the type of security Issued affects these

variables directly, reducing cash flow and increasing leverage for debt-issuing.Ilrms compared with equity

issuing firms as one would expect.

        The results of table 7 are striking: firms comparable to debt-issuing firms that issue equity Invest

more than the comparable debt-issuing firms: their plant, property and equipment (PP&E). total assets and

capital expenditures all grow at a significantly higher rate. The differences in growth are economically large:

a firm issuing equity against type that has the same PP&E than a firm expected to Issue debt has 20%

more PP&E at the end of the year following the security issue. Since both categories of firms have similar

q proxies, these results are fully consistent with the view that firms which issue equity against the pecking-

order do so to pursue a more aggressive investment policy that is not in the interest of their shareholders.

Compared to the firms expected to issue equity, the firms that issue equity when expected to issue debt

have total assets which grow at a significantly lower rate, but their PP&E and capital expenditures have

insignificantly different growth rates. EBIT increases substantially for the firms expected to issue equity

but not for the firms that issue equity when expected to issue debt. Finally, we report some evidence on

dividend policy. Firms issuing equity have a drop in dividend yield In contrast to firms Issuing debt.

Though firms issuing equity against type form the subsample with the largest drop in dividend yield, the

difference between the change in dividend yield for that subsample and for the subsample of firms

issuing debt according to type is not signiAcant.




Section 7. Conclusions.

          In this paper, we show that the typical firm issuing equity has valuable investment opportunities and

experiences considerable asset growth from the year before the equity issue to the end of the year

following the issue. For firms with the most valuable investment opportunities, equity Issues have no

significant effect on the value of their shares. Not all firms fit this model. We find firms that have poor

growth opportunities that issue equity even though the pecking-order story suggests that they should issue

debt to raise tunds. These firms, otherwise similar to debt-issuing firms, experience substantially higher

asset growth than debt-issuing firms. However, they register an extremely significant drop in their share


                                                      26
price when they issue. Though it 15 true that these firms reveal that they are valued too highly when they

issue, a consistent explanation of this excessive valuation Is that the market did not expect these firms to

issue equity to undertake major investments given their investment oppottunities and does not expect these

investments to increase shareholder wealth. The behavior of the firms Issuing equity against type in this

paper seems inconsistent with the pecking-order model or asymmetric information models which assume

that managers maximize shareholder wealth. If the firms that issue against type have valuable Investment

opportunities that are not recognized by the ñnancial markets, they should not be issuing equity since their

equity would be underpriced and since they could issue debt because similar firms issue debt.
