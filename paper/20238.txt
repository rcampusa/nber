We show that policy uncertainty about how the rising public debt will be stabilized accounts for
the lack of deflation in the US economy at the zero lower bound. We first estimate a Markov-
switching VAR to highlight that a zero-lower-bound regime captures most of the comovements
during the Great Recession: a deep recession, no deflation, and large fiscal imbalances. We then
show that a micro-founded model that features policy uncertainty accounts for these stylized
facts. Finally, we highlight that policy uncertainty arises at the zero lower bound because of a
trade-off between mitigating the recession and preserving long-run macroeconomic stability.

1    Introduction
The recent …nancial crisis and the deep recession that followed have led to a sub-
stantial change in the conduct of monetary policy, with interest rates stuck at
the zero lower bound for the past eight years. A key prediction of the New Key-
nesian paradigm is that, in this situation, we should have observed de‡ation.
However, this prediction has not materialized. Following Hall’s Presidential
Address to the American Economic Association, some researchers have labeled
this observation “Hall’s puzzle”(Hall 2011). Simultaneously, the crisis has trig-
gered a vibrant debate about the best way to deal with the zero lower bound.
Two polar views have emerged. The …rst one advocates a robust …scal stimulus
sometimes even accompanied by a reduced emphasis on in‡ation stabilization
(Romer 2009, Sims 2010a). The second one strongly opposes the idea of aban-
doning policies that worked in the past (Plosser 2012). This debate has occurred
against a background of acute …scal strain. In 2009, the US de…cit-to-GDP ratio
was the highest since the Korean war. Furthermore, by 2012 the debt-to-GDP
ratio had reached levels unprecedented since the end of World War II and, based
on the Congressional Budget O¢ ce projections, is expected to continue increas-
ing for the foreseeable future (CBO 2016). It is conceivable that this debate
and the severe …scal imbalance have led to a rise in uncertainty about how debt
will be stabilized. In this paper, we show that policy uncertainty can account
for the absence of de‡ation that characterized the Great Recession.
    We …rst establish a series of stylized facts by …tting a Markov-switching
VAR to post-World War II data. We include in‡ation, GDP growth, the federal
funds rate, and the de…cit-to-debt ratio. The model identi…es three distinct
regimes. The movements between the …rst two regimes capture a low frequency
relation between the de…cit-to-debt ratio and in‡ation. During the 1960s and
1970s, when Regime 1 is in place, real interest rates are low, the de…cit-to-debt
ratio trends up, and so does in‡ation. These dynamics revert once the economy
moves to Regime 2 in the early 1980s: Real interest rates increase, in‡ation
falls, and so does the de…cit-to-debt ratio. Instead, the third regime captures
the bulk of the dynamics during the Great Recession: a large contraction in
real activity, a short lasting drop in in‡ation, a jump in primary de…cits, and

                                        1
the zero lower bound. During this zero-lower-bound regime, …scal shocks have
large e¤ects on in‡ation, providing evidence that …scal imbalances play a role
in explaining in‡ation dynamics during the Great Recession.
    These …ndings suggest that the following are desirable properties of a struc-
tural model whose objective is to study the Great Recession. First, the model
should feature three policy regimes in line with the VAR evidence. Second,
the model should ideally capture the large in‡ationary consequences of …scal
imbalances during the zero-lower-bound regime. At the same time, this zero-
lower-bound regime should also be inherently di¤erent from any other regime
to the extent that a policy change is triggered by a large contractionary shock.
Third, a successful model should be able to capture the core of the macroeco-
nomic comovements during the Great Recession as the result of this single large
initial shock and the associated change in policymakers’behavior.
    We construct and estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model that re-
‡ects these …ndings and captures a key policy trade-o¤ that arises at the zero
lower bound: choosing between mitigating a large recession and preserving a
reputation for …scal discipline. In the model, when the zero lower bound is
not binding, policymakers’behavior is characterized by two very distinct pol-
icy combinations. Under the monetary-led policy mix, the central bank reacts
strongly to deviations of in‡ation from its target, whereas the …scal authority
passively accommodates the behavior of the monetary authority by adjusting
primary surpluses to keep debt on a stable path. If agents expect this regime
to prevail for a long time, any …scal imbalance is backed by future …scal adjust-
ments and the economy is largely insulated with respect to these disturbances.
Under the …scally-led policy mix, the …scal authority does not react strongly
enough to debt ‡uctuations. It is now the monetary authority that passively
accommodates the behavior of the …scal authority by allowing in‡ation and real
activity to move so as to stabilize debt.1 Finally, the economy is occasionally
hit by a large demand shock that forces policymakers into a zero-lower-bound
regime in which the central bank sets the interest rate to zero and the …scal
   1
    In the language of Leeper (1991) the monetary-led regime corresponds to active monetary
policy and passive …scal policy, whereas the …scally-led regime is associated with passive
monetary policy and active …scal policy.

authority temporarily disregards the level of debt.
    Agents’beliefs about policymakers’behavior once the economy is out of the
zero lower bound play a key role in determining macroeconomic outcomes at
the zero lower bound. We model this idea by introducing a parameter that
controls agents’beliefs about policymakers’exit strategy. We …nd that during
the recent crisis the probability assigned to a switch to the …scally-led regime
experienced a noticeable increase, even if agents still regard a return to the
monetary-led regime as more likely (around 92%). While the estimated proba-
bility of a switch to the …scally-led regime remains relatively low, the in‡ationary
pressure deriving from the large stock of debt is enough to prevent the econ-
omy from experiencing de‡ation. Thus, uncertainty about the future monetary
and …scal policy mix can account for the lack of de‡ation. To show this, we
run a counterfactual simulation in which policy uncertainty is removed. As in
the standard New Keynesian model, this counterfactual model predicts a large
de‡ation.
    The last part of the paper is devoted to highlighting a policy trade-o¤ that
arises at the zero lower bound. To this end, we study the consequences of fully
credible announcements about policymakers’future behavior in the aftermath
of the large demand shock. If policymakers announce the monetary-led regime,
in‡ation expectations drop, leading to de‡ation and a severe recession. If in-
stead policymakers announce that they will move to the …scally-led policy mix,
in‡ation immediately increases because agents expect that debt will be in‡ated
away. This, in turn, leads to a drop in the real interest rate that lifts the econ-
omy out of the recession. However, such an announcement would also increase
macroeconomic volatility once the economy is out of the recession. This hap-
pens because under this regime the macroeconomy is not insulated anymore
with respect to …scal disturbances. Thus, a policy trade-o¤ between mitigating
the recession and preserving long-run macroeconomic stability arises at the zero
lower bound. As views of the relative importance of the two goals di¤er, so do
the policy prescriptions, with the result that policy uncertainty is likely to arise
at the zero lower bound.
    Other papers have addressed the Hall’s puzzle (King and Watson 2012; Del

Negro et al. 2015) and have proposed resolutions (Christiano et al. 2015 and
Coibion and Gorodnichenko 2015). The novelty of this paper is to show that
policy uncertainty about the way debt will be stabilized can account for the
lack of de‡ation during the Great Recession. This mechanism also allows us
to explain why in‡ation expectations rose between 2009 and 2011. Accounting
for policy uncertainty is important in light of a growing literature that argues
that there were in fact changes in policymakers’behavior over the past 60 years
(Clarida et al. 2000; Lubik and Schorfheide 2004; and Bianchi 2013). Baker
et al. (2016) construct a comprehensive index of policy uncertainty. Fernandez-
Villaverde, Guerron-Quintana, et al. (2015) study the role of …scal volatility in
slowing down the recovery during the current crisis. However, …scal volatility
shocks do not provide an explanation for the absence of de‡ation observed in
the data, whereas the uncertainty about future policy rules considered in this
paper does.
    Our work is related to the vast literature on the zero lower bound.2 Our
work di¤ers from previous contributions in one or more of the following dimen-
sions. First, we conduct a structural estimation of a general equilibrium model
and investigate the e¤ects of policy uncertainty at the zero lower bound. In
this respect, the paper is related to the literature on the macroeconomic e¤ects
of uncertainty (Bloom 2009, Gilchrist et al. 2014, Fernandez-Villaverde et al.
2011, Basu and Bundick 2012). Second, we work in a stochastic environment
with a standard New Keynesian model augmented with a …scal block. This
makes our framework suitable for a quantitative assessment of the di¤erent exit
strategies. Third, zero-lower-bound episodes are recurrent and agents take this
into account when forming expectations. In contrast, the literature generally
considers situations in which the economy is currently at the zero lower bound
and it will never be there again. Moreover, our paper proposes an alterna-
tive way for modeling recurrent zero-lower-bound events in dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DSGE).
    Finally, our work is related to the study of the interaction between …scal and

Leeper 1991; Sims 1994; Woodford 1994, 1995, 2001; Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
2000; Cochrane 1998, 2001; Reis 2016). In this respect this paper is related to
Bianchi and Ilut (2015) and Bianchi and Melosi (2013), but di¤ers from these
two papers across several dimensions. First, we here allow for the zero lower
bound and show that policy uncertainty can account for the absence of de‡ation
during the Great Recession. Second, we outline that at the zero lower bound
a policy trade-o¤ between mitigating a large recession and preserving long-run
macroeconomic stability emerges. Finally, we use a Markov-switching VAR to
establish a series of stylized facts about the zero lower bound and the 60 years
of data that preceded it.
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the stylized facts based
on the Markov-switching VAR. These results are used to motivate the bench-
mark model presented in Section 3. Section 4 shows that policy uncertainty can
account for the lack of de‡ation. Section 5 compares the benchmark model to
a nested model in which policy uncertainty is removed. Section 6 outlines the
policy trade-o¤ that arises at the zero lower bound. Section 7 concludes.


2    Motivating Evidence
We introduce a Markov-switching VAR (MS-VAR) to motivate the key mecha-
nism studied in this paper; that is, the growing US …scal imbalances can account
for why in‡ation did not persistently drop during the Great Recession. With
respect to the seminal contribution by Sims and Zha (2006), our MS-VAR in-
cludes a measure of the US …scal stance. This reduced-form analysis will also be
valuable for designing a structural model to study the last eight years of data.
    Estimating Bayesian VAR models with Markov-switching parameters proves
to become quickly computationally challenging as the number of observables and
lags grows. We therefore opt for a parsimonious speci…cation with two lags,
four observables, and quarterly data. This is in line with the literature that
allows for smoothly time-varying parameters in VARs (Primiceri 2005, Cogley
and Sargent 2006). We include GDP growth, in‡ation, and the federal funds

ratio of primary de…cit-to-debt as a parsimonious observable that captures the
…scal stance of the US government over time. In order for debt to be …scally
sustainable, this ratio needs to be negative on average, as the …scal authority
needs to run primary surpluses.3 We allow for three Markov-switching regimes
for the constants and the autoregressive parameters and three Markov-switching
regimes for the volatility of the innovations:

The regimes evolve according to two transition matrices, H and H : Since we
want to keep this analysis as agnostic as possible, we do not impose any ex-
ante restrictions on the property of these regimes. Therefore, we estimate the
MS-VAR model by using Bayesian techniques with ‡at priors.

coe¢ cients we compute the implied conditional steady states. These represent the values to
which the observable converge once a regime is in place for a prolonged period of time.


    Figure 1 reports the smoothed probabilities at the posterior mode for the
three regimes controlling the VAR coe¢ cients and the three regimes of the
covariance matrix. As far as the covariance matrix, Appendix A shows that the
three regimes imply increasing levels of volatility. Regime 2 can be thought of
as a regime associated with recessions and the turbulent periods of the 1970s
until the beginning of the Great Moderation, which is instead dominated by the
low volatility Regime 1. The volatility Regime 3 captures exceptional events,
like the acceleration of the Great Recession in 2008Q3. However, we are mostly
interested in the dynamics captured by the regimes for the VAR coe¢ cients.
Regime 1 dominates the 1960s and the 1970s. The switch from Regime 1 to
Regime 2 occurs in 1981Q2. In order to understand what distinguishes these two
regimes, Table 1 reports their conditional steady states. These are the values
to which the variables converge if a regime is in place for a prolonged period
of time. Regime 1 is characterized by primary de…cits, as opposed to primary
surpluses under Regime 2, higher in‡ation, and a lower real interest rate.
    In order to understand the role of regime changes in capturing the properties
of the data, Figure 2 presents a simulation in which all Gaussian shocks are set
to zero and only regime changes occur. The light gray area and the dark gray
area correspond to the periods during which Regime 1 and Regime 3 were in
place, respectively. The early switch from Regime 2 to Regime 1 captures the
low frequency increase in in‡ation that occurred starting in the late 1960s and
that lasted until the Volcker disin‡ation of the early 1980s. This low frequency
increase in in‡ation is associated with a similar low frequency movement in the

de…cit-to-debt ratio that stabilizes around a positive value. The increase in the
federal funds rate is visibly smaller than the increase in in‡ation. This is in line
with the drop in the conditional steady state of the real interest rate presented
in Table 1. As will become clear when considering the structural model, these
stylized facts can be rationalized in light of a change in the monetary-…scal
policy mix from …scally-led to monetary-led. Under Regime 1, higher de…cits
lead to higher average in‡ation. Real interest rates remain low because the
monetary authority does not react aggressively to in‡ation. We refer to Regime
1 as the …scally-led regime and Regime 2 as the monetary-led regime.4
    Regime 3 dominates the last part of the sample starting in 2008Q3. This
quarter marks the acceleration of the …nancial crisis and the worst period of the
Great Recession. The large contraction in real activity prompted policymakers
to take extraordinary actions on both the monetary and the …scal sides. The

     This interpretation of the data is consistent with Bianchi and Ilut (2015), who …nd a
similar sequence of regime changes for the pre-crisis period when estimating a microfounded
model. They identify a switch from a …scally-led regime, which characterized the 1960s and
1970s, to a monetary-led regime exactly in 1981:Q2, after the appointment of Volcker as Fed
Chairman and Reagan’s election as President of the United States.

…scal authority swiftly introduced massive measures of …scal stimulus that raised
the de…cit-to-debt ratio by 11 percentage points within the next three quarters.
The Federal Reserve cut the FFR aggressively to reach the zero lower bound.
Consequently, we label Regime 3 the zero-lower-bound regime. At the end of
the sample, we observe an increase in the probability of Regime 2, which we
interpret as the monetary-led regime. However, Regime 3 is still the most likely
regime. Furthermore, this result is in part driven by end-of-sample uncertainty.
    Our MS-VAR model explains the key macroeconomic dynamics during the
Great Recession and the ensuing slow recovery as a result of the shock that
pushed the economy from the monetary-led regime to the zero-lower-bound
regime in 2008:Q3. To highlight this point, Figure 3 extends the previous analy-
sis by focusing on the e¤ects of entering the zero-lower-bound regime in 2008:Q3.
All Gaussian shocks are still shut down in this simulation and the starting point
is 2008:Q3. The 70% posterior bands (gray areas) for the e¤ects of this discrete
shock capture remarkably well the dynamics of the data (solid line). This result
suggests that the dynamics of the macroeconomy during the Great Recession
can in principle be explained by only one adverse discrete shock. This shock
lowered both output growth and in‡ation for a few quarters while it triggered
radical and persistent changes in the conduct of …scal and monetary policies.
The switch to the zero-lower-bound regime seems to capture all of these stylized
facts.
    Of particular interest is the quick deterioration of the …scal position as the
Great Recession started. A crucial question for this paper is whether these
…scal imbalances had noticeable e¤ects on price dynamics during the zero-lower-
bound period. The following exercise serves the purpose of providing evidence
of the key mechanism studied in this paper and hence motivates our ensuing
structural analysis. We compute the response of in‡ation to …scal shocks in the
estimated MS-VAR so as to assess the in‡ationary consequences (if any) of the
quickly deteriorating …scal position during the Great Recession. We identify
…scal shocks as those shocks that raise the de…cit-to-debt ratio upon impact
while stimulating the economy for at least 5 quarters.5 The positive comovement

between de…cit dynamics and GDP growth is the salient identifying feature of
…scal shocks. Non-…scal shocks that a¤ect economic activity, such as technology
shocks, should arguably lead to a negative comovement between de…cit and GDP
growth, given that tax revenues go down during recession, while transfers tend
to increase.
    The results are reported in Figure 4, which shows three snapshots of the
macroeconomic e¤ects of …scal shocks before, at, and after the onset of the Great
Recession. These …ndings suggest that the in‡ationary e¤ects of a growing …scal
imbalance due to the Great Recession may have been fairly sizable. The plots
report a …scal shock that raises the de…cit-to-debt ratio by slightly more than
one percentage point in 2008:Q3. In the data this ratio went up by more than
four percentage points in 2008:Q3 and 11.20 percentage points from 2008:Q3
through 2009:Q2 (peak). Consequently, it is conceivable that the deterioration
objectives are to stabilize the business cycles, feature feedbacks to the real economy. Also, a
higher de…cit today will imply a higher stock of debt tomorrow, making the impact of …scal
shocks on this observable variable ambiguous ex-ante. As is standard in the structural VAR
literature, this identi…cation scheme is consistent with our DSGE model.

in the government’s …scal position observed in the data contributed to raising
in‡ation quite substantially in the …rst quarters of the Great Recession.
    Another interesting …nding is that …scal imbalances started to have in‡ation-
ary consequences only in 2008:Q3, that is, when the zero-lower-bound regime
arises. Before that period, the in‡ationary implications of …scal imbalances are
found to be statistically not signi…cant (see upper panel in Figure 4). Before
the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve was used to raising the rate relatively
aggressively in response to …scal shocks and in doing so kept a …rm control over
price dynamics. Furthermore, when the zero lower bound becomes binding in
post-2008:Q3, the impact of …scal imbalances on in‡ation was reduced as the
Federal Reserve could not lower the rate further as it did in 2008:Q3.
    The …ndings presented in this section suggest that the following are desir-
able properties for a structural model whose objective is to study the Great
Recession. First, a successful model should be able to explain the dynamics
of macro aggregates during the Great Recession as the result of a single large
initial shock. Second, the model should feature three policy regimes as the VAR
clearly identi…es a switch to a third regime once the Great Recession began and
two distinct periods before that. Third, the model should ideally capture the

                                            11
large in‡ationary consequences of …scal imbalances during the zero-lower-bound
regime. This third regime should be characterized by extremely low variability
in the policy rate and hence must be di¤erent from the regimes that were in
place before the crisis. Even if this third regime should feature an important
role for …scal imbalances, it should be associated with the realization of a large
negative demand shock, unlike the …scally-led regime that arose in the 1960s and
1970s. In the next section, we build a model in line with these key properties.


3     A Model with Policy Uncertainty
In this section we introduce the model that we will …t to US data in order
to quantify the importance of policy uncertainty. The model is obtained by
augmenting the prototypical New Keynesian model with a …scal block and a
discrete shock that can push the economy to the zero lower bound (ZLB).


3.1    A New Keynesian model
Households. The representative household maximizes expected utility:
                      P1      t         d
                 E0     s=0       exp   t   log Ct        CtA 1   ht                 (3)

subject to the budget constraint:

Pt Ct + Ptm Btm + Pts Bts = Pt Wt ht + Bts   1   + (1 + Ptm ) Btm 1 + Pt Dt   Tt + T R t

where Dt stands for real dividends paid by the …rms, Ct is consumption, ht
is hours, Wt is the real wage, Tt is taxes, T Rt stands for transfers, and CtA
represents the average level of consumption in the economy. The parameter
captures the degree of external habit. Following Woodford (2001), we assume
that there are two types of government bonds: one-period government debt, Bts ,
in zero net supply with price Pts and a more general portfolio of government
debt, Btm , in non-zero net supply with price Ptm . The former debt instrument
satis…es Pts = Rt 1 . The latter debt instrument has payment structure T (t+1)


                                            12
for T > t and 0 < < 1. The asset can be interpreted as a portfolio of in…nitely
many bonds with average maturity controlled by the parameter . The value of
                                                                    m j
such an instrument issued in period t in any future period t+j is Pt+j  = j Pt+j
                                                                              m
                                                                                 .
    The preference shock d is the sum of a continuous and discrete component:
 d = dt + d dt : The continuous component dt follows an AR(1) process: dt =

 d dt 1 + d "d;t . The discrete component d dt can assume two values: high or low
(dh or dl ). The variable dt controls the regime in place and evolves according
to the transition matrix H d :
                                  "                      #
                                      p hh     1    p ll
                            Hd =                           ;
                                    1 phh        pll

where pji = P dt+1 = jj dt = i . The values of H d ; dh ; and dl are such that the
unconditional mean of the discrete shock d dt is zero. This speci…cation is in
the spirit of Christiano et al. (2011). However, in the current setup shocks to
preferences that are able to trigger the ZLB are assumed to be recurrent, and
agents take into account that these episodes can lead to unusual policymakers’
responses, as discussed later on.
    Firms. The representative …rm j faces a downward-sloping demand curve,
Yt (j) = (Pt (j)=Pt ) 1= t Yt , where the parameter 1= t is the elasticity of substi-
tution between two di¤erentiated goods. Firms take as given the general price
level, Pt , and the level of real activity, Yt . Whenever a …rm changes its price, it
faces a quadratic adjustment cost:

                ACt (j) = :5' (Pt (j)=Pt 1 (j)       )2 Yt (j)Pt (j)=Pt          (4)

where t = Pt =Pt 1 is gross in‡ation at time t and           is the corresponding
deterministic steady state. Shocks to the elasticity of substitution imply shocks
to the markup @t = 1= (1          t ) : We assume that the rescaled markup      t =
   log (@t =@) follows an autoregressive process, t =     t 1 +      ;t , where
 1
  ' 2
        is the slope of the Phillips curve. The …rm chooses the price Pt (j) to
maximize the present value of future pro…ts:
                  P
              Et [ 1s=t Qs ([Ps (j)=Ps ] Ys (j)   Ws hs (j)   ACs (j))]

                                          13
where Qs is the marginal value of a unit of consumption good. Labor is the only
input in the …rm production function, Yt (j) = At h1t (j), where total factor
productivity At evolves according to an exogenous process: ln (At =At 1 ) = +
at , at = a at 1 + a "a;t , a;t N (0; 1).
     Government. Imposing the restriction that one-period debt is in zero net
supply, the ‡ow budget constraint of the federal government is given by:

                      Ptm Btm = Btm 1 (1 + Ptm )                T t + Et + T P t

where Ptm Btm is the market value of debt and Tt and Et represent federal tax
revenues and federal expenditures, respectively. Government expenditure is the
sum of federal transfers and goods purchases: Et = Pt Gt + T Rt . The term T Pt
is a shock that is meant to capture a series of features that are not explicitly
modeled here, such as changes in the maturity structure and the term premium.
This shock is necessary because we treat all the components of the government
budget constraint as observables. We rewrite the federal government budget
constraint in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio bm        m m
                                           t = (Pt Bt ) = (Pt Yt ):


                    bm    m    m
                     t = bt 1 Rt 1;t = (           t Yt =Yt 1 )             t   + et + tpt

where Rtm 1;t = (1 + Ptm ) =Ptm 1 is the realized return of the maturity bond,
all the variables are expressed as a fraction of GDP, and we assume tpt =
 tp tpt 1 + tp "tp;t , tp;t N (0; 1).

    Policy Rules. When the high value for the preference shock is realized
  d
( t = h), the economy is out of the ZLB and monetary and …scal policies are
not constrained. In this case, the central bank follows a standard Taylor rule
and the evolution of the policy mix can be described by a two-regime Markov
switching process pt , whose properties will be described in the next section.
When the low value for the preference shock is realized ( dt = l), the central
bank lowers the FFR until the ZLB is reached and the …scal authority focuses
on stabilizing the economy as opposed to trying to stabilize the stock of debt.
    Speci…cally, the monetary policy rule reads as follows:

                                             h                                               i   1      p

                                                                          (Yt =Yt )   y; t

where R;t      N (0; 1), R is the steady-state gross nominal interest rate, Yt
is the output target, and      is the deterministic steady-state level for gross
in‡ation. The parameters ; pt and y; pt capture the central bank’s response to
in‡ation and output gap, which depends on the policy mix pt in place at time
t. The dummy variable Z dt is zero when the value of the preference shock is
high ( dt = h) and one when it is low ( dt = l). To match the behavior of the
FFR in the data during the zero-lower-bound period, we need to allow for small
disturbances and a gradual decline toward a value close, but not exactly equal,
to zero. The size of the monetary policy shocks at the ZLB, Z , is assumed
to be a tenth of the standard deviation of the monetary policy shocks when
out of the ZLB: Z = R =10. The persistence of changes in the federal funds
rate at the ZLB is controlled by R;Z and …xed to :2. Finally, the parameter
0< Z       1 controls the average level of the FFR when at the ZLB. It can be
thought of as the fraction of the steady-state net interest rate. Notice that if

we set Z = 0; R;Z = 0; and Z = 1; we would obtain Rt = 1 at the ZLB and
the net nominal interest rate would be exactly zero.7
   The …scal authority moves taxes according to the following rule:
                               h                                      h                                             ii

where eet     e t + g 1 get ; ;t N (0; 1) ; and et is the level of tax revenues with
             tr
respect to GDP in deviations from the steady state. When the economy is
in the high state of demand (Z dt = 0), tax revenues respond to the state of
the economy, captured by the output gap, to the sum of the long-run level of
transfers and government purchases, and to the level of debt. The parameter
 b; pt captures the …scal authority’s attitude toward debt stabilization, which
depends on the type of policy mix pt in place at time t. When the large negative
preference shock hits (Z dt = 1), the …scal authority temporarily disregards the
level of debt to focus on stabilizing the economy. However, the …scal authority
still responds to the level of spending.


3.2     Policy changes
To characterize policymakers’behavior out of the ZLB, we will make use of the
partition of the parameter space introduced by Leeper (1991). For the sake
of the exposition, we will assume that the Taylor rule reacts only to in‡ation,
whereas the …scal rule reacts only to debt. In this simpli…ed version of the
model, we can distinguish four regions based on the properties of the model
under …xed coe¢ cients. When the values of model parameters are …xed, the two
policy rules are key in determining the existence and uniqueness of a solution.
There are two determinacy regions. The …rst region, Active Monetary/Passive
   7
    When estimating the model we verify that the ZLB would be binding in response to
the large negative preference shock. Our approach to modeling the ZLB di¤ers from the
conventional one, which implies Rt = max (0; Rt ) ; where Rt is the interest rate implied by
the Taylor rule. While our approach cannot rule out the possibility of states of the world in
which the nominal rate Rt assumes negative values, it has the advantage of keeping the model
tractable while it allows us to study the consequences of policy uncertainty.



                                                           16
Fiscal (AM/PF), is the most familiar one: The Taylor principle is satis…ed and
the …scal authority moves taxes to keep debt on a stable path: AM > 1 and
  PF
  b   > 1 1. We refer to this policy combination as the monetary-led regime.
     The second determinacy region, Passive Monetary/Active Fiscal (PM/AF),
corresponds to the case in which the …scal authority is not committed to stabi-
lizing the process for debt: AF
                             b  < 1 1. Now it is the monetary authority that
passively accommodates the behavior of the …scal authority, disregarding the
Taylor principle and allowing in‡ation to move in order to stabilize the process
for debt: P M < 1. Under this regime, even in the absence of distortionary tax-
ation, shocks to net taxes can have an impact on the macroeconomy as agents
understand that they will not be followed by future o¤setting changes in the …s-
cal variables. We label this policy combination the …scally-led regime. Finally,
when both authorities are active, no stationary equilibrium exists, whereas when
both of them are passive, the economy is subject to multiple equilibria.
     In the benchmark model, when the preference shock is high ( dt = h), the
economy is out of the ZLB (Z dt = 0) and the evolution of policymakers’ be-
havior is captured by a two-regime Markov chain that evolves according to the
transition matrix H p :
                               "                       #
                                    p M M    1   p F F
                          Hp =                           ;
                                  1 pM M       pF F

where pji = P pt+1 = jj pt = i . This transition matrix is supposed to capture
the stochastic outcome of a game between the monetary and …scal authorities
that is not explicitly modeled in this paper. Regime M is the monetary-led
                   AM
regime:     ;M =       > 1 and b;M = Pb F > 1 1. Regime F is the …scally-
                      PM
led regime:    ;F =      < 1 and b;F = AMb   < 1 1.
    When the low value for the preference shock occurs ( dt = l), the ZLB be-
comes binding (Z dt = 1), and policymakers’ behavior is now constrained. In
this third regime, the central bank lowers the FFR until it hits the ZLB and
the …scal authority temporarily disregards the level of debt in order to focus
on stabilizing the economy.8 Notice that the zero-lower-bound policy mix can

while out of the ZLB, switches to the …scally-led regime capture the deliberate
choices of policymakers, the zero-lower-bound regime is triggered by an exoge-
nous negative preference shock that prompts the …scal authority to forgo …scal
adjustments to counter the e¤ects of a deep recession. Once the preference shock
is back to its high value, policymakers’behavior is not constrained anymore.
    Even if the ZLB imposes a constraint on policymakers’behavior, agents’be-
liefs are not constrained. Therefore, beliefs about the exit strategy and policy
uncertainty are going to be key to understanding the macroeconomic dynamics
at the ZLB. To capture this feature, we introduce a parameter controlling the
expected exit strategy from the ZLB. The parameter pZM represents the prob-
ability that once the discrete preference shock is reabsorbed, the economy will
move to the the monetary-led regime.
    The joint evolution of policymakers’ behavior and the discrete preference

3.3     Solving the MS-DSGE model
The technology process At is assumed to have a unit root. The model is then
rescaled and linearized around the unique deterministic steady state. The model
can be solved with any of the solution methods developed for Markov–switching
DSGE models. We use the solution method of Farmer et al. (2009). It is
worth emphasizing that in our model, agents form expectations while taking
into account the possibility of entering the ZLB and of changes in policymakers’
behavior. Furthermore, they understand that entering the ZLB is an event
induced by an exogenous shock that can modify policymakers’ behavior even
authority because the dynamics at the zero lower bound mostly depend on the exit strategy.



                                               18
once the constraint stops being binding. In other words, our approach allows
us to model recurrent zero-lower-bound episodes and to capture the impact of
di¤erent exit strategies for policymakers’behavior at the ZLB. The solution can
be characterized as a MS-VAR:

             St = c ( t ; ; H) + T ( t ; ; H) St   1   + R ( t ; ; H) Q ( v ) "t       (7)

where ; v ; and St are vectors that contain the structural parameters, the
stochastic volatilities, and all the variables of the model, respectively. Appendix
B provides more details about the linearization and the solution algorithm.
    It is worth emphasizing that the law of motion of the model depends on
the structural parameters ( ), the regime in place ( t ), and the probability of
moving across regimes (H). This notation highlights that the properties of one
regime depend not only on the structural parameters describing that particular
regime, but also on what agents expect is going to happen under alternative
regimes and on how likely it is that a regime change will occur in the future
(see also Davig and Leeper 2007). In other words, agents’beliefs about future
regime changes matter for the law of motion governing the economy.


4       The E¤ects of Policy Uncertainty
The model solution is combined with a system of observation equations. We
estimate the model with Bayesian methods. We include seven observables span-
ning the sample 1954:Q4-2014:Q1: real GDP growth, annualized GDP de‡ator
in‡ation, annualized FFR, annualized debt-to-GDP ratio, federal tax revenues
to GDP ratio, federal expenditure to GDP ratio, and a transformation of govern-
ment purchases to GDP ratio. All variables are expressed in percentage points
when reporting the results. For tractability, we …x the regime sequence for the
out-of-the-zero-lower-bound regimes based on the VAR evidence presented in
Section 2. The zero-lower-bound regime is assumed to start in 2008:Q4 and
remains in place until the end of the sample.9
    9
   As the starting date of the ZLB we choose 2008:Q4, instead of 2008:Q3 as implied by the
MS-VAR, in light of a model comparison exercise in which we considered all quarters between

4.1     Parameter estimates
Table 2 reports priors and posterior parameter estimates. The priors for the pa-
rameters that do not move across regimes are in line with previous contributions
in the literature and are relatively loose. As for the parameters of the Taylor
rule, the prior for the autoregressive component is symmetric across regimes,
whereas we have chosen asymmetric and truncated priors for the responses to
in‡ation and the output gap in line with the theoretical restrictions outlined
above: Under the monetary-led regime (M) monetary policy is active, whereas
under the …scally-led regime (F), monetary policy is passive. In a similar way,
the priors for the response of taxes to government debt are asymmetric across
the two regimes: Under the …scally-led regime and the ZLB regime, this para-
meter is restricted to zero, whereas under the monetary-led regime it is expected
to be fairly large. In order to separate the short- and long-term components
of transfers, we restrict the persistence of the long-term component ( eL = :99)
and the standard deviation of its innovations ( eL = :1%). We …x the discount
factor to :9985, a value broadly consistent with an annualized 2% real interest
rate, and the average maturity to 5 years (this is controlled by the parameter
  ). We assume that the persistence of the …scal rule at the ZLB coincides with
its value in the …scally-led regime: ;Z = ;F .
     We choose priors for the persistence of the policy regimes in line with the
persistence of the two regimes implied by the regime sequence recovered when
estimating the MS-VAR. Finally, we choose a loose and symmetric prior for the
parameter pZM , which captures the uncertainty about the policy that will be
carried out after the lifto¤ of the interest rate from the ZLB. Our symmetric and
broad prior implies that we maintain an agnostic view with respect to which
exit strategy agents regard as most likely.
     Regarding the parameters of the Taylor rule, under the monetary-led regime
the federal funds rate reacts strongly to both in‡ation and the output gap.
The opposite occurs under the …scally-led regime. Under the …scally-led and
ZLB regimes the response of taxes to debt is restricted to zero, while under the
2008:Q1 and 2009:Q3 as possible starting dates. The results of this exercise, the dataset, and
evidence for convergence of the MCMC algorithm can be found in Appendix C.

monetary-led regime it turns out to be signi…cantly larger than the threshold
value described in Subsection 3.2 ( 1 1 = :0015).
    Since we …xed the regime sequence, the estimates of the transition matrix
are determined by the model dynamics across the di¤erent regimes and not by
the frequency of regime changes. Both the monetary-led regime and the …scally-
led regime turn out to be quite persistent, implying that when one of the two
regimes is in place, agents expect to spend a signi…cant amount of time under
such a regime. The persistence of the high state for the discrete preference shock
is also very high. This implies that when out of the ZLB, agents attach a small
weight to the possibility of a large contraction in real activity deriving from the
negative preference shock. This result is consistent with the fact that before the
recent crisis, the US economy had always been able to avoid the ZLB. When at
the ZLB, agents regard it as more likely that once the negative preference shock
is reabsorbed, policymakers will move to the monetary-led regime (pZM = 92%
at the posterior mean). However, this probability is smaller than the estimated
persistence of the monetary-led regime (pM M is around 99%). Therefore, when
the economy entered the ZLB, the probability attached to switching to the
…scally-led regime increased and agents’ uncertainty about the future policy
mix rose.
    It is worth clarifying the importance of estimating the model over the whole
sample, as opposed to focusing exclusively on the zero-lower-bound period. For
the sake of argument, we can think that the properties of the …scally-led regime
are mostly identi…ed by the study of the e¤ects of …scal imbalances during
the 1960s and 1970s.10 Similarly, the properties of the monetary-led regime are
mostly pinned down by the behavior of the economy during the post-Volcker dis-
in‡ation period. As we shall explain in greater detail in Section 6, for given prop-
erties of the monetary-led and …scally-led regimes, the parameter pZM highly
in‡uences the e¤ects of …scal imbalances on the macroeconomy at the ZLB.
Thus, this key parameter is identi…ed by the joint dynamics of …scal variables,
in‡ation, and real activity during the ZLB period.
  10
    The discussion here is simpli…ed to the extent that the properties of one regime depend
in part on the properties of the other regimes. Furthermore, there are feedback e¤ects from
the macroeconomy to the …scal variables.

4.2     Dynamics at the zero lower bound
Figure 5 reports the estimated impulse response to a discrete negative preference
shock dl . To compute the impulse response, we use the actual data in 2008:Q3.
The shock occurs in 2008:Q4 and is marked by a vertical line.11 The model
is able to replicate the key changes that occurred starting with the 2008 crisis
as a result of the single discrete negative preference shock, in line with the
VAR evidence. The economy experiences a drop in real activity and a large
increase in the debt ratio, monetary policy enters the ZLB, but in‡ation remains
relatively stable. It is also interesting to notice that the model is able not only
to replicate the absence of de‡ation, but also the fact that in‡ation has been
trending up. The model rationalizes this behavior as a result of increasing
in‡ationary pressure coming from the large debt accumulation.
    The absence of de‡ation is tightly linked to uncertainty about policymak-
ers’future behavior. To show this, Figure 6 compares the e¤ects of the discrete
negative preference shock under the benchmark estimated model with its e¤ects
in a counterfactual economy in which the monetary-led policy mix is the only
possible regime when out of the ZLB (dashed line). Thus the vertical distance
  11
    Using actual data is important because the impulse response is not invariant with respect
to the state of the economy, namely the observed …scal imbalances. This is because the
negative preference shock a¤ects agents’beliefs about policymakers’future behavior.

preference shock. The solid blue line corresponds to the estimated model, whereas the

mix is the only possible policy mix.


between the two lines captures the e¤ects of uncertainty about the exit strategy
on the output gap, in‡ation, and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Notice that under the
counterfactual economy, the negative preference shock has now a much larger
impact on in‡ation and real activity. The economy experiences a very large and
persistent de‡ation and a much larger contraction in output. Furthermore, the
massive increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio does not have any mitigating e¤ect
on in‡ation: Agents expect that the entire debt-to-GDP ratio will eventually
be repaid with an increase in taxation. Thus, paradoxically, the uncertainty
about future policy was bene…cial, rather than harmful, to macroeconomic per-
formance. This does not mean that policy uncertainty is bene…cial in itself,
but it implies that when monetary policy becomes constrained by the ZLB, the
resulting policy uncertainty mitigates the consequences of the ZLB by creating
in‡ationary pressure.
    Note that in the counterfactual economy the contraction in output and the
drop in in‡ation are unrealistically large because we are removing the key mech-
anism of the estimated model. In Section 5, we will formally compare our bench-
mark model to an estimated nested model that removes policy uncertainty in a
way that puts the two models on the same ground. The goal in this section is
instead to isolate the key mechanism that prevents de‡ation in the estimated
model. In this respect, the fact that the model can in principle reproduce the
standard features of the ZLB is important: The data could have rejected the
role played by policy uncertainty in explaining in‡ation dynamics. For example,
the estimates could have suggested a very small probability of ever moving to

                                           24
the …scally-led regime and a counteracting mark-up shock that keeps in‡ation
positive. Instead, a large preference shock is found to explain the sharp decline
in real activity. The absence of de‡ation is then rationalized in light of the
possibility of a change in the monetary/…scal policy mix.12
    It is also important to emphasize that the amount of policy uncertainty re-
quired to explain the absence of de‡ation during the Great Recession is quite
moderate. As shown in Table 2, the posterior mean of the probability of moving
to the monetary-led policy mix once out of the ZLB regime is pZM = 92:25%.
This implies that at the ZLB agents mostly believe that policymakers will even-
tually resume the same policy mix observed before the Great Recession. Such a
belief is plausible for the US in light of the long spell of monetary-led policy mix
observed between the Volcker disin‡ation and the onset of the Great Recession.
However, as noted earlier, this value implies a higher probability of moving to
the …scally-led regime than that in the pre-crisis period. Finally, in the esti-
mated model, the magnitude of the in‡ationary e¤ects of uncertainty about the
exit strategy largely depend on the pre-crisis level of government debt, which is
observed to be above its estimated steady-state value (around 42:5%).
    Figure 7 provides further corroborating evidence in favor of the mechanism
proposed in this paper. The …gure reports the evolution of the one-year-ahead
and …ve-year-ahead in‡ation expectations as implied by the model and compares
them with the Michigan surveys. The error bands re‡ect parameter uncertainty.
Even though we do not use in‡ation expectations for estimation, the model is
able to replicate the salient features of the Michigan surveys. First, the model
captures the upward trend in in‡ation expectations that is visible right before
the recession started. This pattern can be partially explained by the increase in
the US …scal burden during those years. Second, the model captures remarkably
well the swing in in‡ation expectations that occurred once the crisis started.
From above trend, in‡ation expectations quickly moved below trend. However,
they never became negative and they quickly recovered. Finally, at the ZLB
in‡ation expectations exhibit an upward trend. The model explains this pattern
  12
    In Appendix D we show that our results do not depend on the shock that triggers the
zero lower bound. To that end, we consider a prototypical New Keynesian model in which we
can directly shock the natural rate as in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).

as a result of the large debt accumulation.
    We …nd it reassuring that the model is able to replicate these key facts even if
in‡ation expectations are not used for estimating the model. This result shows
that the in‡ationary pressure coming from the …scal burden delivers in‡ation
expectations that are very much in line with the data. It is important to empha-
size that in‡ation expectations moved down, as predicted by our model, when
the ZLB was encountered, but they never entered negative territory. In other
words, agents were con…dent that de‡ation would not have occurred. Instead,
in the baseline New Keynesian model, where the monetary-led policy mix is the
only possible regime, agents should expect de‡ation once the economy enters
the ZLB. The fact that in‡ation expectations, and not just in‡ation, behave in
a way that is not consistent with the baseline New Keynesian model suggests
that the absence of de‡ation in the United States cannot be easily rationalized
ex-post with a series of lucky realizations of in‡ationary shocks.


4.3     Inspecting the …scal mechanism
In our model, how shocks propagate depends on the policy regime in place as
well as the state variables of the economy. This property is key for the model
to rationalize the absence of de‡ation at the ZLB. Figure 8 reports the impulse
responses to an increase in the long-term component of transfers under the three
di¤erent regimes. This shock has a direct impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio


                                           26

expectations taking into account the possibility of regime changes.


and, consequently, on the amount of spending that would have to be …nanced
with future taxes. Impulse responses are computed conditionally on each policy
regime being in place over the entire horizon. Nevertheless, model dynamics
re‡ect the possibility of regime changes.
    When the …scally-led regime is in place, agents understand that in the near
future the probability of a …scal adjustment in response to the current increase
in the primary de…cit is fairly low. This determines an increase in in‡ation that
is made possible by the accommodating behavior of the monetary authority
that adjusts the interest rate less than one-to-one to in‡ation. The resulting
decline in the real interest rate determines an increase in real activity. The
debt-to-GDP ratio is then stabilized because of the fall in the real interest rate
and the faster GDP growth.
    Under the monetary-led regime the primary de…cit shock triggers a much
smaller increase in in‡ation because the …scal authority is expected to imple-
ment the necessary …scal adjustments. However, the response of in‡ation is not
zero because agents form expectations taking into account the small possibil-
ity of moving to the …scally-led regime. As a result, a high level of spending
determines some in‡ationary pressure even when the monetary-led regime is in
place. However, the rise in in‡ation is moderate compared to the case in which
the …scally-led policy mix is in place. Given that the Taylor principle holds,
the central bank reacts more than one-to-one to the increase in in‡ation. The
result is a prolonged period of slightly negative output gaps that last as long as
the …scal imbalance is not fully reabsorbed.

the …scal block. Response of GDP growth and in‡ation to a discrete negative preference
shock based on a model that excludes the …scal block. The red dashed line reports actual
data, while the shaded areas report the 90% error bands for the benchmark model.


    Under the zero-lower-bound regime the e¤ects of the …scal shock are quite
similar to those that characterize the …scally-led regime even though the proba-
bility to a return to the monetary-led regime (pZM ) is quite large. The increase
in spending triggers a large increase in in‡ation. Given that the FFR is stuck
at zero, the resulting drop in the real interest rate is ampli…ed with a conse-
quent large increase in the output gap. However, in‡ation is slightly smaller
than under the …scally-led policy mix because the faster output growth ends up
ameliorating the …scal imbalance.


5     No Policy Uncertainty
In the previous section, we used a counterfactual simulation to isolate the role of
policy uncertainty in accounting for the absence of de‡ation. In such an exercise,
since it is a counterfactual simulation, all shocks and non-policy parameters of
the model are kept …xed. In this section, we go one step further and formally
compare the benchmark model with an estimated nested model that does not
feature policy uncertainty about the way debt will be stabilized. Given that
both models are now estimated, we can conduct a formal assessment of the role
played by the …scal block in explaining the joint dynamics of GDP and in‡ation
as well as in‡ation expectations at the ZLB.
    The nested model is similar to the traditional New Keynesian model used by


                                          28

Clarida et al. (2000) and Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) and it does not feature
any uncertainty about the way debt will be …nanced. We still allow for the
possibility of changes in policymakers’ behavior, but now such changes only
concern the behavior of the monetary authority. As observables, we use four of
the seven series used to estimate the benchmark model: GDP growth, in‡ation,
federal funds rate, and government expenditure.13 Figure 9 reports the impulse
responses to the discrete negative preference shock based on this alternative
model. The …gure is analogous to Figure 5 shown above for the benchmark
model. To ease the comparison, the shaded areas report the bands for the
benchmark model. As before, we use the actual data until 2008:Q3 and we then
have the discrete shock occurring in 2008:Q4. Unlike the benchmark model, the
model without the …scal block is not able to account for the joint dynamics of
in‡ation and output growth as a result of the single discrete preference shock.
The model is able to track relatively well the behavior of in‡ation, even if
in‡ation is often outside the 90% error bands. On the other hand, it clearly
misses the magnitude of the contraction in growth.
   To formalize this visual impression, Table 3 reports the mean squared dis-
tance between the actual data and the path in response to the discrete demand
shock implied by the two models. The benchmark model delivers better results
both for in‡ation and output growth. However, in line with what could already

    Including the remaining …scal series would be irrelevant for the dynamics of the macro-
economy because Ricardian equivalence applies when assuming that …scal policy is always
passive. Details about the model and the parameter estimates can be found in Appendix E.

be inferred by the picture, the gains are particularly large for output growth.
Not only is the median of the mean squared distance signi…cantly smaller, but
also the 68% bands do not overlap. As shown in Appendix E, the model without
the …scal block uses the discrete shock to …t in‡ation dynamics, leaving the be-
havior of output to be explained by a contemporaneous TFP shock. Therefore,
when excluding the …scal block we obtain the standard result of the literature:
A combination of shocks is necessary in order to explain the joint dynamics of
in‡ation and output following the recent recession.
    As further evidence in favor of the mechanism proposed in this paper, Figure
10 reports the evolution of in‡ation expectations implied by the model without
the …scal block. Once again, we use shaded areas to denote the 90% error bands
for the benchmark model. Even in this case, we …nd that the alternative model
performs worse than the benchmark model. The model without a …scal block
tends to constantly underestimate in‡ation expectations, which lie outside the
90% error bands most of the time. This is true for both the one-year-ahead
and the …ve-year-ahead expectations. Furthermore, the alternative model does
worse both before and after the economy entered the ZLB.
    Table 4 formally compares the two models with respect to their ability to
replicate the dynamics of in‡ation expectations. For each model, we compute
the mean squared distance between the model-implied in‡ation expectations
and the actual in‡ation expectations. It is important to check that the im-

Table 4: Mean squared distance between model-implied and actual in‡ation expectations
for the 1-year and 5-year horizons. The top panel refers to the benchmark model, and the
lower panel refers to a nested New Keynesain model that excludes the …scal block. We report
results for the whole sample for which expectations are available (1978:Q1-2014:Q1), for the
subsample before the economy entered the zero lower bound (1978:Q1-2008:Q3), and for the
subsample after the economy entered the zero lower bound (1978:Q4-2014:Q4).


provement in the ability to match the behavior of in‡ation expectations does
not occur only at the ZLB, because this could be just a lucky coincidence. We
therefore take the mean squared distance over the whole sample for which in-
‡ation expectations are available (1978:Q1-2014:Q1) and for two subsamples:
before and after entering the ZLB. The benchmark model performs better than
the alternative model over all subsamples and for both horizons.


6     Policy Trade-o¤
In this section, we are interested in assessing why policy uncertainty is likely
to increase once the economy enters the ZLB. We will show that while the
monetary-led regime leads to a more stable macroeconomic environment during
regular times, a policy trade-o¤ characterizes the ZLB: mitigating a large re-
cession or preserving long-run macroeconomic stability. Policy uncertainty rises
when policymakers do not o¤er a clear resolution of this policy trade-o¤.


                                            31
    Let us revisit the e¤ects of the large negative preference shock dl under three
di¤erent scenarios concerning policymakers’behavior. In the …rst scenario, we
consider the benchmark model in which no announcement is made. In the
second and third scenarios policymakers make credible announcements about
the exit strategy. Speci…cally, in the second scenario, policymakers announce
that …scal discipline will be abandoned and that the economy will move to the
…scally-led regime. In the third scenario, policymakers announce that once the
economy is out of the zero-lower-bound period, …scal discipline will be restored,
implying that the economy will move back to the monetary-led regime.14
    Figure 11 reports the results. If policymakers announce that …scal discipline
will be abandoned (dashed line), agents expect that the rising stock of debt will
be in‡ated away. Therefore, they revise upward their in‡ation expectations and,
consequently, in‡ation increases today through the expectation channel. Notice
that the recession is in this case substantially mitigated and the economy is
e¤ectively avoiding the ZLB. If instead policymakers explicitly announce …scal
discipline, the economy enters a recession and de‡ation arises (dashed-dotted
line). Compared to the case in which no announcement is made (solid line),
announcing …scal discipline worsens the recession and brings about a larger drop
in prices. This is because this announcement lowers the probability that the
growing stock of debt will be in‡ated away, which raises the real interest rate and
consequently leads to a recession deeper than the one we actually observed. The
outcomes for this case are qualitatively in line with the traditional view about
the ZLB. However, the drops in real activity and in‡ation are substantially
mitigated compared to the counterfactual economy presented in Subsection 4.2,
in which the monetary-led policy mix is the only possible regime. The reason is
that when policymakers announce …scal discipline, rational agents understand
that a switch to the …scally-led regime can still occur in the more distant future.
    Figure 12 illustrates the evolution of uncertainty for the three scenarios
presented above. We consider three horizons: 1 quarter, 1 year, and 2 years.
Uncertainty is computed taking into account the possibility of regime changes
and future Gaussian shocks (Bianchi 2016). For a variable Xt and a horizon q,
 14
      Appendix B.3 presents the transition matrix for the economy with announcements.

Figure 11: E¤ects of policy announcements following the discrete negative pref-
erence shock. Three cases are considered. The …rst case corresponds to the benchmark
model with no announcement; in the second case, policymakers announce a return to the
monetary-led regime; in the third case, a switch to the …scally-led regime is announced.


it corresponds to the conditional standard deviation sdt (Xt+q ). At the ZLB,
uncertainty is higher than in the pre-crisis period because of the uncertainty
about the end of the recession and the lack of a systematic monetary policy
response to shocks hitting the macroeconomy. When policymakers announce
the …scally-led regime as the exit strategy, the economy avoids hitting the ZLB
and consequently macroeconomic uncertainty remains very close to the pre-crisis
levels. Hence, promising to follow the …scally-led policy mix has the e¤ects of
mitigating the recession and of lowering macroeconomic uncertainty in the short
run.
    Longsta¤ et al. (2013), following Kitsul and Wright (2013), extract the ob-
jective distribution of in‡ation from the market prices of in‡ation swaps and
options by using data at daily frequency. They …nd substantial swings between
fears of in‡ation and fears of de‡ation. Such a large level of uncertainty about
in‡ation is consistent with our …ndings. We regard the study of the link be-
tween policy uncertainty and macroeconomic uncertainty in the context of asset
pricing as an interesting and promising venue for future research.
    The measure of uncertainty reported here re‡ects the level of uncertainty
faced by the agent in the model, taking into account the possibility of regime
changes, along the simulations presented above. Therefore, they cannot be im-
mediately compared with measures of uncertainty based on reduced-form sta-

                                          33

and di¤erent announcements about policymakers’future behavior.


tistical models such as the ones presented by Jurado et al. (2015). If we were to
estimate a reduced-form model with time-varying parameters and heteroskedas-
ticity on the economy simulated above, we would …nd that uncertainty spikes
when the economy enters the ZLB. Nevertheless, uncertainty would stay low
while the economy remains at the ZLB because no large changes in real activity
or in‡ation occur.15 Such a measure of uncertainty would be in line with the
evidence presented in Jurado et al. (2015). Therefore, our results should be
interpreted as showing that the ZLB implies an increase in uncertainty for a
given level of volatility of the exogenous shocks.
    While moving to the …scally-led regime would largely mitigate the recession
and reduce uncertainty in the short run, it would also imply an increase in
macroeconomic uncertainty in the long run. Figure 13 reports the evolution of
uncertainty at di¤erent horizons, from 1 quarter to 10 years, when the monetary-
led and the …scally-led regime are in place. When policymakers follow the
monetary-led policy mix, agents anticipate that with high probability future
…scal imbalances will be neutralized through the actions of the …scal authority.
This leads to a reduction in macroeconomic uncertainty. At the same time,

account the possibility of future regime changes.


the central bank responds strongly to in‡ation, leading to a further reduction
in volatility. If instead policymakers follow the …scally-led regime, uncertainty
increases at all horizons. This is because the central bank reacts less aggressively
to economic ‡uctuations and agents anticipate that all …scal imbalances will now
strongly a¤ect in‡ation and real economic activity.
    Mitigating a large recession by pledging to abandon …scal discipline and the
rise in uncertainty as the economy exits the ZLB are two sides of the same
coin. The announcement e¤ectively softens the recession if and only if it is able
to convince agents that the …scally-led policy mix will prevail for a long time.
Only under these circumstances do agents expect that debt will be in‡ated away.
If the …scally-led regime had low persistence, the announcement would fail to
mitigate the recession because in‡ation would not rise. In fact, agents would
simply expect a change in the timing of …scal adjustments. The existence of this
trade-o¤ between short-run bene…ts and long-run costs provides an explanation
for the ample spectrum of opinions about the best path of action at the zero
lower bound and the consequent increase in policy uncertainty.


7     Conclusions
The US is arguably facing uncertainty about the way policymakers will handle
the large stock of debt that was accumulated during the Great Recession. Part
of the debt is expected to be absorbed by higher growth once the economy fully


                                            35
recovers. However, it is quite unlikely that this factor alone will be enough
to correct the dynamics of US sovereign debt in the absence of substantial
…scal adjustments. A large stock of debt, combined with no clear plan for
…scal stabilization, is likely to create uncertainty about the future policy course
because the monetary authority cannot control in‡ation without the necessary
…scal backing (Sims 2010a). We have shown that this type of policy uncertainty
can explain why the US economy has not experienced de‡ation despite the
several years spent at the zero lower bound.

A     Markov-switching VAR
In this appendix, we describe the MS-VAR used in Section 2.


A.1     Model setup
The variables of interest are assumed to evolve according to a Markov-switching
VAR with two lags:

                                                                 1=2
                  Zt = c t + A t ;1 Zt 1 + A t ;2 Zt 2 +      !t                   (8)
                       h                    i               t


                   t
                     = c t ; A t ;1 ; A t ;2 ; ! t N (0; I)                        (9)

where Zt is a (n 1) vector of data. The unobserved states t and t can take
on a …nite number of values, j = 1; : : : ; m and j = 1; : : : ; m ; and follow
two independent Markov chains. This represents a convenient way to model
heteroskedasticity and to allow for the possibility of changes in the dynamics of
the state variables. The probability of moving from one state to another is given
by P [ t = ij t 1 = j] = hij and P [ t = ij t 1 = j] = hij . Given H = [hij ]
and H = [hij ] and a prior distribution for the initial state, we can compute the
likelihood of the parameters of the model, conditional on the initial observation
Z0 . We impose ‡at priors on all parameters of the models, implying that the
posterior coincides with the likelihood.


A.2     Likelihood and regime probabilities
De…ne the combined regime    t      t   ;   t   , the associated transition matrix H
H H ; and vector t             t
                                 ; t with the corresponding set of parameters.
For each draw of the parameters t and H; we can then compute the …ltered
probabilities tjt , or smoothed probabilities tjT ; of the regimes conditional on
the model parameters. The …ltered probabilities re‡ect the probability of a
regime conditional on the data up to time t, tjt = p( t jY t ; H; t ), for t =

                                            1
1; :::; T , and are part of the output obtained computing the likelihood function
associated with the parameter draw H; t . The …ltered probabilities can be
obtained using the following recursive algorithm:

                                                                       tjt 1            t
                                              tjt       =                                                         (10)
                                                                 10      tjt 1              t

                                        t+1jt           = H            tjt                                        (11)
                               p(Zt jZ t 1 ) = 10                        tjt 1              t                     (12)

where t is a vector whose jth element contains the conditional density p(Zt j t =
i; Z t 1 ; H; t ), the symbol denotes element by element multiplication, and 1
is a vector with all elements equal to 1. To initialize the recursive calculation, we
need an assumption on the distribution of 0 . We assume that the nine regimes
have equal probabilities p( 0 = i) = 1=9 for i = 1:::m: The likelihood for the
entire data sequence Z T is obtained multiplying the one-step-ahead conditional
likelihoods p(Zt jZ t 1 ):
                                                         QT
                                    p ZT j          =        t=1      p Zt jZ t        1



   The smoothed probabilities re‡ect all the information that can be extracted
from the whole data sample, tjT = p( t jZ T ; H; t ). The …nal term T jT is re-
turned with the …nal step of the …ltering algorithm. Then a recursive algorithm
can be implemented to derive the other probabilities:

                              tjT   =   tjt             H0       t+1jT       ( )       t+1jt


where ( ) denotes element by element division.
   Finally, it is possible to obtain the …ltered and smoothed probabilities for
each of the two independent chains by integrating out the other chain. For
example, if we are interested in tjt = p( t jY t ; H; t ) we have:

              ;i                                             Pm
            tjt    = p(   t   = ijY t ; H;          t
                                                        )=         j=1       p(   t   = fi; jgjY t ; H;   t
                                                                                                              )




                                                             2
Similarly, the smoothed probabilities are obtained as:

             ;i                                       Pm
           tjT    = p(   t   = ijY T ; H;    t
                                                 )=       j=1   p(   t   = fi; jgjY T ; H;    t
                                                                                                  ):


A.3     Posterior Mode and Gibbs sampling algorithm
We …rst …nd the posterior mode by using a minimization algorithm on the
negative of the posterior. Given that we have ‡at priors, our point estimates
coincide with the maximum likelihood estimates. Once we have found the pos-
terior mode, we compute the most likely regime sequence and then proceed to
characterize uncertainty around the parameter values conditional on this regime
sequence by using a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Alternatively, we could have
imposed some identifying restrictions based on the properties of the regimes at
the posterior mode, but we preferred to take this more agnostic approach. This
makes the interpretation of the results more immediate because the properties
of the regimes can be immediately associated with the periods during which
they were in place.
    Both the VAR coe¢ cients and the covariance matrix can switch and the
regimes are assumed to be independent. Draws for the parameters of the model
can be made following the following Gibbs sampling algorithm:

  1. Sampling t given t ; t ; t : Given t and ;T ; we can compute the
     residuals of the MS-VAR at each point in time. Then, given t ; we can
     group all the residuals that pertain to a particular regime. Therefore, t
     can be drawn from an inverse Wishart distribution for t = 1:::m .

  2. Sampling t given t ; t ; t : When drawing the VAR coe¢ cients, we
     need to take into account the heteroskedasticity implied by the switches
     in t : This can be done following the following steps for each i = 1:::m :

                              ;T
      (a) Based on                 ; collect all the observation such that               t   = i:
      (b) Divide the data that refer to t = j based on ;T : We now have a
          series of subsamples for which VAR coe¢ cients and covariance matri-
          ces are …xed: t = i; t = 1 ; :::; t = i; t = m : Denote these

                                                      3
           subsamples with yi; t ; xi; t ; where the yi; t and xi; t denote left-
           hand-side and right-hand-side variables in the MS-VAR. Notice that
           some of these subsamples might be empty.
       (c) Apply recursively the formulas for the posterior of VAR coe¢ cients
           conditional on a known covariance matrix. Therefore, for j = 1:::m
           the following formulas need to be applied recursively:

                              P T 1 = PL 1 +              1
                                                                  (x0i; xi; t )
                                                      t                      t
                                                      1
                               BT = BL + (                        x0i;       )vec(yi; t )
                                                      t                  t

                              PL 1 = PT 1 ; BL = BT

           where the algorithm is initialized using the priors for the VAR coef-
                                                               1
           …cients BL = B0 and PL 1 = P0 1 = S0 N0 1             : Notice that this
           implies that if there are not any observations for a particular regime,
           then the posterior will coincide with the priors. With proper priors,
           this is not a problem.
      (d) Make a draw for the VAR coe¢ cients vec                                  t
                                                                                            N (PT BT ; PT )
           with   t   = i:

  3. Sampling H and H : Given the draws for the state variables ;T and
        ;T
           , the transition probabilities are independent of Yt and the other pa-
     rameters of the model and have a Dirichlet distribution. For each column
     of H and H ; the posterior distribution is given by:

                        H s (:; i)   D(asii +   s     s
                                                ii ; aij      +    s
                                                                   ij );         s= ;

      where ij and ij denote respectively the numbers of transitions from state
      i to state j and from state i to state j .

B.2     Model solution
As explained in the main text, the Markov-switching process for the discrete
preference shock d dt is de…ned in a way that its steady state is equal to zero.
In order to solve the model we implement the following steps:

  1. Introduce a dummy variable e dt controlling the regime that is in place for
     the discrete preference shock. Augment the DSGE state vector with this
     dummy variable.

  2. Use the aforementioned dummy variable to rewrite all the equations linked
     to the discrete preference shock. These are the linearized Euler equation
     and the linearized Taylor rule.

  3. Solve the model using Farmer et al. (2009). This returns a MS-VAR:

                        Set = Te ( t ; H; ) Set      1
                                                           e ( t ; H; ) Q"t
                                                          +R


      in the augmented state vector Set :

  4. Extract the column corresponding to the dummy variable e dt from the
     matrix Te and rede…ne the matrices and the DSGE state vector accordingly.



                                                8
      This will return a MS-VAR with a MS constant:

                St = c ( t ; H; ) + T ( t ; H; ) St      1   + R ( t ; H; ) Q"t

      where Q is a diagonal matrix that contains the standard deviations of the
      structural shocks and St is a vector with all variables of the model.

    Unlike other papers that have used the technique described here, our model
allows for non-orthogonality between policymakers’ behavior and a discrete
shock. This allows us to solve a model in which agents take into account that
a large preference shock leads to an immediate change in policy, the zero lower
bound, and, potentially, to further changes. This proposed method is general
and can be applied to other cases in which a shock induces a change in the
structural parameters.


B.3     Matrices used in the counterfactual simulations
We here describe the matrices used in the simulations reported in the paper.

B.3.1   Textbook New Keynesian model: Always monetary-led

In the …rst counterfactual simulation, policymakers always follow the monetary-
led regime when out of the zero lower bound. Furthermore, there is only one
zero-lower-bound regime from which agents expect to return to the monetary-
led regime. Therefore, the transition matrix used to solve this counterfactual
economy is given by:
                                 "                           #
                                      phh    1     pll
                H p = 1; H d =                                   ; H = H d:
                                     1 phh       pll

where phh and pll are the estimated parameter values.

B.3.2   Announcements

In the counterfactual economy with announcements, at the zero lower bound
we distinguish two cases, based on the exit strategy:

                                        9
    1. Policymakers announce that they will move to the monetary-led regime
       once the economy out of the zero lower bound.

    2. Policymakers announce that they will immediately move to the …scally-led
       regime.

    We assume that the probability of the …rst scenario is equal to the estimated
probability of switching to the monetary-led regime in the benchmark model.
In other words, the …rst scenario is more likely than the second scenario and it
has a probability equal to pZM . Furthermore, their probabilities do not depend
on the regime that was in place when the negative preference shock occurred.
We then have a total of four regimes t = f[M; h]; [F; h]; [Z; l]; [F; l]g and the
corresponding transition matrix is given by:

C      Estimation of the DSGE model
This appendix describes the dataset and provides details for the benchmark
model.


C.1      Dataset
Real GDP, the GDP de‡ator, and the series for …scal variables are obtained from
the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The …scal series are built using NIPA Table
3.2. (Federal Government Current Receipts and Expenditures). Government

                                            10
purchases (G) are computed as the sum of consumption expenditure (L24),
gross government investment (L44), net purchases of non-produced assets (L46),
minus consumption of …xed capital (L47). Transfers are given by the sum of net
current transfer payments (L25-L18), subsidies (L35), and net capital transfers
(L45-L41). Tax revenues are given by the di¤erence between current receipts
(L40) and current transfer receipts (L18). All variables are then expressed as a
fraction of GDP. Government purchases are transformed in a way to obtain the
variable gt de…ned in the model. The series for the federal funds rate is obtained
averaging monthly …gures downloaded from the St. Louis Fed web-site.


C.2     MCMC algorithm and convergence
Draws from the posterior are obtained using a standard Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm initialized around the posterior mode. When working with models
whose posterior distribution is very complicated in shape it is very important
to …nd the posterior mode. In a MS-DSGE model, this search can turn out to
be an extremely time-consuming task, but it is a necessary step to reduce the
risk of the algorithm getting stuck in a local peak. Here are the key steps of the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm:

      Step 1: Draw a new set of parameters from the proposal distribution:
      # N n 1; c

      Step 2: Compute ( m ; #) = min p (#) =p           m 1
                                                              ; 1 where p ( ) is the
      posterior evaluated at .
                                                    m                     m
      Step 3: Accept the new parameter and set          = # if u <    (       ; #) where
      u U ([0; 1]), otherwise set m = m 1

      Step 4: If m   nsim ; stop. Otherwise, go back to step 1

    The matrix corresponds to the inverse of the Hessian computed at the pos-
terior mode . The parameter c is set to obtain an acceptance rate of around
35%. Table 6 reports results based on the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin potential re-
duction scale factor using within and between variances based on the …ve multi-
ple chains used in the paper. The eight chains consist of 2; 100; 000 draws each

value used as an upper bound for convergence.


C.3      Determining the time of the ZLB Regime
For tractability, we …x the sequence of Markov-switching regimes to estimate
the model. To select the date at which the ZLB regime has started, we compute
the posterior modes associated with a number of candidate dates. As shown in
Table 7, the fourth quarter of 2008 (2008:Q4) attains the highest posterior mode
and hence is selected as the date at which the ZLB regime has started (recall
that all models only di¤er in terms of the starting date for the ZLB regime, so
they present the same number of parameters).


D      A Prototypical New Keynesian Model with
       a Fiscal Block
The objective of this appendix is to show that the results of Section 4.2 are
robust when one considers models that has less bells and whistles and are more
agnostic about the nature of shocks than the model we estimated in the pa-

per. Let us a consider a prototypical New Keynesian DSGE model of the type
studied in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). This modeling framework is pur-
posely very stylized and follows Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) in considering
unanticipated shocks to the natural rate of interest as the cause of ZLB episodes.
   The loglinearized equations of the model are as follows. All the variables
henceforth are expressed in log-deviations from their steady-state values with
the only exception of the debt-to-output ratio bt , which is de…ned in deviation
from its steady-state value. The IS equation reads:

                                                 1
                          xt = Et xt+1               (Rt       Et        t+1      rtn )                 (13)

where xt denotes the gap between the actual output and its ‡exible-price level
(henceforth, the output gap), t denotes in‡ation, Rt denotes the nominal inter-
est rate, and rtn stands for the natural rate of interest, which is the real interest
rate that would be realized if prices were perfectly ‡exible.
    The New Keynesian Phillips curve is

                                         t   = xt + E t            t+1                                  (14)

The monetary policy reaction function is:
         h               ih                                                           i
     Rt = 1      Z   d
                     t        R Rt   1 + (1     R)         ;   p
                                                               t
                                                                    t+         x xt       Z dt ln (R)   (15)



                                                 13
where R is the steady-state value of the nominal interest rate Rt . Note that
the monetary authority follows the Taylor rule when Z dt = 0 or set its (net)
nominal rate equal to its zero lower bound when Z dt = 1. It should be noted
that Z dt is a dummy variable assuming value 0 and 1 depending on the realiza-
tion of an exogenous discrete Markov-switching process dt . As we shall discuss
below, this process determines the natural rate of interest rtn , implying that
ZLB episodes are caused by unanticipated and recurrent, exogenously-driven
falls in the natural rate of interest. Furthermore, when the economy is out of
the ZLB, the value of the policy parameter ; pt , which controls how strongly
the central bank adjusts the nominal interest rate to in‡ation, are a¤ected by
the exogenous discrete Markov-switching process pt .
    The natural rate of interest is linked to the (exogenous) dynamics of the
natural output though the IS equation under ‡exible prices:

                                        rtn =                 n
                                                          Et yt+1                              (16)

where ytn stands for the growth rate of natural output, whose value at any
time is assumed to depend on the realization of a discrete Markov-switching
process dt .
   The …scal rule that determines the primary surplus t

                                        t   =    b;   p
                                                      t

where bt stands for the government debt-to-output ratio. Note that the response
of the primary surplus to the last period’s debt-to-output ratio is given by
                                                                               p

    There are two exogenous Markov-switching processes: pt and dt . The former
captures monetary and …scal authority’s response to their targets out of the zero
lower bound. More speci…cally we assume that there are two monetary and …scal
policy mix: a monetary-led regime ( pt = M ) and a Fiscally-led regime ( pt = F ).
Under the monetary-led regime the monetary authority responds strongly to
in‡ation ; pt > 1 and the …scal authority promptly adjusts the primary surplus
                                                     1
to changes in the debt-to-output ratio b; pt >           1 .16 Under the …scally-
led policy regime the monetary authority adjusts the nominal interest rate Rt
less vigorously to in‡ation ; pt 1 and the …scal authority pays less attention

matrix driving the policy regime out of the zero lower bound pt is given by the
following matrix                "                      #

   The non-Gaussian process dt determines the growth rate of natural output
and hence the natural interest rate through equation (16). The growth rate of
natural output ytn 2 f yH   n                  n
                              ; yLn g ; where yH > yLn ; and these two states
evolve according to the transition matrix:
                                       "                      #

When the growth rate of natural output is low, the natural rate is low, and
the policymakers are assumed to engage in the ZLB policy regime, which is
characterized by a nominal interest rate set to zero and no adjustment of primary
surplus to changes in the debt-to-output ratio.
   In summary, the joint evolution of policymakers’ behavior and the shock
to the natural rate is captured by the regime obtained combining the two
chains t = pt ; dt . The combined chain can assume three values: t =
f[M; h] ; [F; h] ; Z; lg. The corresponding transition matrix H is obtained by
combining the transition matrix H d , which describes the evolution of the pref-

    Table 8 reports the parameter values we will use to study the property of
this stylized model. The parameters , and b denote the steady-state in‡ation
and the steady-state value of the government debt-to-output ratio.
    The exogenous drop in the growth rate of natural output is chosen so that
to induce an annualized natural rate of 20% during the ZLB periods. In
the benchmark calibration, we set the probability of moving to the monetary-
led policy mix after the ZLB episode equal to pZM = 50% so as to capture
a situation of sizable uncertainty about the policymakers’behaviors when the
economy will exit the ZLB.
    Figure 14 shows the dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, and debt-to-GDP
ratio in the aftermath of a discrete shock to the natural rate. We consider the
benchmark case with parameter values reported in Table 8 and a counterfactual
case in which agents are much more certain that the policy mix out of the ZLB

to the natural rate at time 6.17
    It should be observed that larger policy uncertainty causes absence of de‡a-
tion in presence of a negative output gap as the economy hits the ZLB. Further-
more, policy uncertainty about policymakers’future behavior largely mitigates
the output gap. These results are qualitatively in line with the ones obtained
from our estimated model in Section 4.2. The exercise made in this section
makes it clear that the results analyzed in the paper are not driven by the type
of shock we chose to trigger the ZLB episode or by the more articulated nature
of the model used for estimation.


E      Model without the …scal block
In what follows, we provide the details for the model that removes the …scal
block. As explained in the main text, this model is nested in the benchmark
model and it does not feature any uncertainty about the way debt will be
  17
    Both economies are assumed to be at their respective out-of-ZLB steady-state equilibrium.
However, the starting level of the debt-to-GDP ratio in the counterfactual economy is set to
be equal to that in the benchmark so as to ease the comparison.

E.2    Parameter estimates
Table 9 reports the parameter estimates for the model that excludes the …scal
block. As observables, we use four of the seven series used to estimate the
benchmark model: GDP growth, in‡ation, federal funds rate, and government
expenditure. Note that including the remaining …scal series would be irrelevant
for the dynamics of the macroeconomy because Ricardian equivalence applies
when imposing that …scal policy is always passive.


E.3    Dynamics at the zero lower bound
Figure 15 shows that the model without the …scal block needs to use a com-
bination of shocks in order to explain the absence of de‡ation during the zero
lower bound. The …gure reports the dynamics of in‡ation and output starting
from 2008:Q4 in response to two shocks. The discrete preference shock and a
large negative TFP shock. To ease the comparison with the results reported in
Section 5, we also report the 90% error bands for the impulse response to the

discrete preference shock only. While the discrete preference shock accounts for
the bulk of the decline of in‡ation, the fall in output growth is mostly explained
by the negative preference shock. As explained in the paper, the result shows
that …scal uncertainty plays a key role in explaining the joint dynamics of in-
‡ation and output. Once the …scal block in removed, a combination of shocks
is necessary to explain the joint dynamics of output and in‡ation.
    Figure 16 examines the properties of the traditional New Keynesian model to
match the joint behavior of output growth and in‡ation from a di¤erent angle.

point because the size of the discrete shock is in fact able to generate a realistic
contraction in real activity. We then ask what slope of the Phillips curve can
deliver a behavior of in‡ation and output growth in line with what observed in
the data. The solid blue line corresponds to the case in which the slope of the
Phillips curve is divided by two, implying that in average the slope is around
:0036. Clearly in this case the model can generate a sizeable recession, but a the
cost of generating de‡ation. Dividing the estimates slope by four, things slightly
improve, but in‡ation is still too low. Finally, with a mean of the slope around
:0009 and ranging from :0006 to :0024 we can obtain a behavior of in‡ation
more in line of the data, at the cost of a smaller recession.
    Summarizing, we can highlight three conclusions based on the analysis of

                                                      21
a model that excludes the …scal block. First, in order to rationalize the joint
dynamics of in‡ation and output, a very large level of nominal rigidities are
necessary. Second, when using both data before and at the zero lower bound,
this high level of nominal rigidities is rejected by the estimates. Instead, the
model explains the zero lower bound dynamics as a result of two combined
shocks: A discrete preference shock and contemporaneous negative TFP shock.
This is because we do not ask the model to simply match the zero lower bound
events, but also what happened before this event. Finally, the standard New
Keynesian model cannot generate the drop followed by the slight upward of
in‡ation observed in the data. In the model this is caused by the fact that
as more time is spent at the zero lower bound, the …scal burden increases,
generating in‡ationary pressure.
