                                       COMPLEMENTARITY



                                              ABSTRACT



        Current concern with relationships      among particular technologies,      capital, and the wage


structure motivates this study of the origins of technology-skill     complementarily    in manufacturing.

We offer evidence of the existence of technology-skill    and capital-skill (relative) complementarities

from 1909 to 1929, and suggest that they were associated             with continuous-process     and batch

methods and the adoption of electric motors.       Industries that used more capital per worker and a


greater proportion of their horsepower in the form of purchased electricity employed relatively more

educated blue-collar   workers in 1940 and paid their blue-collar       workers substantially more from

1909 to 1929.   We also infer capital-skill   complementarily   using the wage-bill for non-production

workers and find that the relationship was as large from 1909-19 as it has been recently.       Finally, we


link our findings to those on the high-school    movement(1910        to 1940).   The rapid increase in the

supply of skills from 1910 to 1940 may have prevented rising inequality with technological         change.

        The recent coincidence        of computertiation       and a widening wage structure has led many

to conclude that new technologies         and human capital are relative complements         (e.g., Bound and

Johnson 1992).      A related literature has demonstrated         that physical capital and skill are relative

complements       today and in the recent past,l Thus capital deepening may also have increased the

relative demand for the educated,          serving further to stretch the wage structure.       According    to

this view, only large injections of education can reduce the impact of technology              on inequality.z

The possibility    that such a relationship    exists today has prompted a widely-noted        conjecture that

technological     progress     and skill have always been relative complements.3

        Physical     capital    and more    advanced       technology   are now regarded      as the relative

complements       of human capital, but have they been so for the past two centuries?          Some answers

have already been provided.            A literature   on the bias to technological     change across history

challenges   the view that physical and human capital were relative complements               throughout    the




    1 The empirical research covering the post-World War II period, beginning with Griliches (1969) and
summarized      by Hamermesh        (1993), supports the capital-skill and technology-skill   complementarily
hypotheses.    Bartel and Lichtenberg (1987) find, from a panel of manufacturing industries from 1960 to
1980, that the implementation       of new technologies, proxied by the age of the capital stock, increases the
share of highly-educated       labor in total labor cost, Doms, Dunne, and Troske (1995) show that U.S.
manufacturing     plants utilizing more-advanced      technologies employ more educated workers.       Berman,
Bound, and Griliches (1994) conclude that skill-upgrading across US. manufacturing           industries during
the last thirty years is positively associated with the rate of growth of the capital-output ratio and with
the level of investment in R&D and computers. Berndt, Morrison, and Rosenblum (1992) reach a similar
conclusion.    Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1996) find a substantial and growing wage premium associated
with computer use despite large increases in the supply of workers with computer skills. They also find
greater shifts towards college-educated        workers in industries with more rapid growth in employee
computer     usage (see also Krueger 1993).            Fallen and Layard (1975) confirm the capital-skill
complementarily   hypothesis using cross-country data at both the aggregate and sectoral levels, Positive
correlations have also been found between the utilization of formal company training, and technological
change and sectoral capital intensity (Bartel and Sicherman 1995; Mincer 1989)

    2 Tinbergen (1975), for example, has characterized the evolution of the wage structure as a “race
between technological    development and access to education.”  Direct intervention in wage setting, of
course, can also alter the wage structrue.

    3 By skill we mean higher levels of education, ability, or job training.  When we use the term
technology-skill or capital-skill complementarily we mean that skilled or more educated labor is more
complementary with new technology or physical capital than is unskilled or less educated labor.

industrial past.      Many of the major technological         advances of the nineteenth    century, according

to the more recent literature, substituted physical capital, raw materials, and unskilled              labor, as

a group, for highly-skilled       artisans.4 Rather than being the relative complement         to human skill,

physical capital was, for some time, a relative complement              of raw materials and together, with

unskilled    labor, substituted    for highly-skilled     individuals   (Cain and Paterson    1986; James and

Skinner     1985).5   T’he prototypical   example is that of the gunmaker.           Cheap raw materials       in

America     fostered the use of wood lathes and displaced hand fitting in the production                 of gun

stocks by skilled woodworkers         (Hounshell 1984). Similarly, the cordwainer          once made shoes by

hand with practically        no physical capital.       The intricate division of labor of the shoe factory

began, and its later mechanization        completed, the transition from artisan to unskilled operative.b

The butcher, baker, smith, and glass blower were also skilled artisans whose occupations                   were

profoundly      altered by the factory system, capital, and mechanization.7

          If, as the literature now claims, technological        advance and human skill were not always



   4 Throughout       this paper we use the term artisan to mean a worker who produces virtually       the entire
good.

     5 James and Skinner (1985) divide industries in 1850 into two categories: “skilled” (e.g., woodworking)
and “unskilled” (e.g., clothing). They find that in both “skilled” and “unskilled” industries raw materials
were the relative complements of physical capital, although the effect was greater in the “skilled” sector.
More importantly for the capital-skill complementarily      hypothesis is that skilled labor was the better
substitute for capital in its sector than was unskilled labor in its. Thus an increase in capital (or raw
materials) would have decreased the relative demand for skilled labor. Cain and Paterson (1986) do not
consider skill differences but find, similar to James and Skinner, that capital and raw materials were
relative complements and that both together substituted for labor.
     In the framework we provide below, capital and skilled labor are complements in the creation of
workable machinery which is then used together with unskilled labor to produce output. We use, here,
the language of the existing literature rather than that of our framework.

    b According to Sokoloff (1986) the initial deskilling involved little capital and mechanization     and was
of the Smithian pin-factory variety. Landes (1972) takes an opposing view.

    7 Braverman (1974), among others, argues that         industrialization  and mechanization sewed to deskill
a host of artisanal trades and reduce the relative        earnings of craftsmen.     Yet Williamson and Lindert
(1980), in their innovative     book on historical        trends in inequality,    rely heavily on capital-skill
complementarily    to generate, in their C.G.E. model,     rising inequality with economic development during
the nineteenth century,

                                                          2
relative complements,        when did they become so? We argue that technology-skill                  and capital-

skill complementarily       emerged across the manufacturing       sector as particular technologies,       known

as batch and continuous-process           methods   of production,       spread.a   Reinforctig    the trend was

another technological       change: the switch to purchased       electricityy from steam and water-power

energy sources.

          Our interest,    like that of many we cite, concerns how technological             change affects the

relative demand for skills.         Because technological    change is often accompanied          by increases    in

capital intensity, capital has often been the focus. But many major advances are associated                     with

particular types of capital, like computers are today and electric motors were in the past. As our

measure       of technological   change we will often use capital intensity,        although we also consider

electricity    use and particular    types of production    processes.

          Manufacturing      production    shifted, during the past 150 years, from artisanal            shops to

factories (1830s to 1880s) and later assembly-lines         (early 1900s), then from factories to continuous

and batch processes        (1890s and beyond), and more recently to robotized             assembly     lines.    The

technological      shifts did not affect all products the same, and some were never manufactured                  by

more than one of the technologies.          But manufacturing,     as a whole, progressed         in this fashion.9




     a Batch methods were common to various production processes such as those in chemicals, certain
nonferrous products, some foods (e.g., butter, sugar), liquors, beer, and a host of other products that are
liquid. Late in the nineteenth century and continuing to ours, continuous-process methods were pioneered
in products requiring little assembly and having few or no moving parts, such as oats, flour, canned foods
(eg., condensed milk, soup), soap, film, paper, matches, and cigarettes (Chandler 1977).

    9 See, for example, Atack (1987) and Sokoloff (1984) concerning the transition from the artisanal shop
to the factory in the nineteenth century. Both make the important point that the transition was slow in
some industries. It depended not just on technological change (often simply changes in the organization
of work) but also on decreases in transport costs. In some industries (e.g., boots and shoes, clothing,
furniture, leather, meatpacking, tobacco) a significant minority of value added was produced in artisanal
shops (< 7 employees with no power source) even as late as 1870. And in some (e.g., saddle~),           the
majority of value added came from artisanal shops in 1870. Even though there were economies from
larger scale for much of manufacturing, transport costs were still too high to justify a complete shift in
the mode of production across the entire United States.

                                                       3
        Even though           the transition      from the artisanal shop to the factory may have increased the

capital-output      ratio, it most likely decreased the overall demand for skilled relative to unskilled

labor. The technological            advances that prompted the shift from the factory to continuous-process

methods increased the relative demand for skilled labor while increasing the capital-output                            ratio.

Thus the shift from the factory to continuous-process                       or batch methods       may have produced

manufacturing-wide             capital-skill      (technology-skill)     complementarily.        Electrification    and the

adoption    of unit-drive       machines       reinforced    the change through the automation              of hauling and

conveying      operations.]o

        Few products            went through          all the stages we describe,       but those that did provide

illuminating     examples,          Automobile production began in large artisanal shops, Like the carriages

that preceded       them, automobiles             were assembled        by groups of artisans who hand-fitted            the

various pieces.ll       Technological          advances     led to standardized      and completely      interchangeable

parts that were then assembled                    in factories   by scores of less-skilled       workers,    while skilled

craftsmen   constructed,         installed, and maintained           the machines.    It was only a matter of time for

the assembly line to be innovated,                as it was at Ford in 1913. Much later, the robotized assembly

line was created            using    relatively     fewer less-skilled     operatives   and more        skilled    machine-

crewmen.       In the history of automobile production,                the first technological    advances reduced the

relative demand for skilled labor but later advances increased it.

        We explore the transition                 to technology-skill      complementarily,      believed     to be in full

blossom today.        tir     central point is that the shift to batch and continuous-              process methods,       as

well as the rise in purchased              electricityy, led to an increase in the relative demand for higher-



   10Jerome      (1934) illustrates     this point for many industries.

     11 Braverman (1974) quotes Eli Chinoy: “Final assembly, for example, had originally been a highly
skilled job. Each car was put together in one spot by a number of all-around mechanics” (p. 146). See
also Hounshell (1984).

                                                                 4
skilled and educated workers.                Reinforcing the shift in manufacturing                      was an increased demand

for educated        labor to sell, install, and service technologically-advanced                             products.12




A Framework           to Understand         CapitaI-Skill       and Technology-Skill                   Complementarity

           In considering        our argument,        it is useful     to envision     manufacturing          as having       two distinct


stages:    a machine-installation,          machine-maintenance             segment          (termed     “capital-maintenance”)          and


a production         or assembly       portion     (termed      “production”),               The   two    stages   together      comprise


“manufacturing.”          Capital    and educated          (skilled)      labor,   we will argue,          are always complements


in the machine-maintenance                  segment      of manufacturing              for any      technology.        Machinists,       for


example,      are needed       to install    machinery       and make        it run.13       The “workable”         capital    created    by


skilled    labor    and raw capital         is then used by unskilled                labor    to create     the final product        in the


production         or assembly      segment      of manufacturing.


           The adoption        of a particular        technology         may increase          or decrease      the capital      to output


ratio.    Whether     or not its adoption        increases     or decreases          the relative      demand      for skilled    workers


will generally        depend      on the degree        to which        the machine-maintenance                portion’s       demand     f or


skilled    labor is offset by the production             process’s       demand       for unskilled       labor.   We outline       a more




     12 In the past ten years individuals who sell computer software and hardware have changed from
nerds to slick sales personnel. Similarly, in the 1920s those who sold radios had to deal with the “radio
nuts,” as they were called, but not much later, radio sales personnel were hired to increase sales, not
fraternize with the wireless amateurs. We do not, in this paper, consider the impact technology had on
skill demands in other than the manufacturing sector.

    13Machine-maintenance,     however, may itself have a life-cycle, particularly for the factory or assenlbly-
line technology: “In the first stages of such mechanization when machines are somewhat crude, their
operation requires the watchful care of skilled machinists, Likewise, to make those improvements which
increase machine efficiency, competent machinists are employed to observe the machines in operation
under practical working conditions.        But, as machines increase in importance, they must be further
improved in efficiency so as to require little attention and a minimum number of stoppages for repairs
or overhauling.   This increasing efficiency of the machine itself tends, in the long run, to eliminate much
of the work of that large corps of machinists which was required when machines were first installed to
displace handworkers” (Anderson and Davidson 1940, p. 228).

                                                                     5
formal framework         showing that the immediate      effects of the shift from the artisanal shop to the

factory were probably an increase in the capital-output            ratio and a decrease in the demand for

skilled relative to unskilled       labor.   The shift from the factory to continuous-process         (or batch)

methods, however,        raised the capital-output    ratio but increased the relative demand for skilled

labor.     Within any of the technologies,        however,    an increase in the ratio of the unskilled       to

skilled wage will induce an increase in the capital-output            ratio, the capital-labor   ratio, and the

relative    demand     for skilled labor.     That is, we hypothesize     that capital and skill are always

relative complements         within any technology,     But we believe that shifts in technology,         rather

than changes        in relative   factor prices, have been more important           across history   in altering

capital-output      and capital-labor   ratios.

           Our framework posits three types of technologies         (and one that has two phases): artisanal

shop or hand production           (H), the factory (F) which in its more technologically-advanced          stage

is called the assembly       line (A), and a continuous-process        or batch (C) technology.       There are

three inputs:     raw capital     (K), skilled or educated      labor (L,), and unskilled     labor (LU), with

corresponding       prices r, w, and WU The manufacturing           process contains two distinct portions:

(1) raw capital must be installed and, later, serviced (“capital maintenance”)            and (2) goods must

be assembled     or created (“production”).       All workers in the “production” segment are unskilled,

whereas all workers in the “capital-maintenance”             portion are skilled.

           The “capital maintenance”     portion of manufacturing     is Leontief and, thus, physical capital

and human capital are always strictly complements            in the creation of usable, workable capital for

all technologies.      We will label the usable, workable       capital as K*.14 The production      portion of

manufacturing       uses K* and Lu to manufacture       Q and is Cobb-Douglas.        Thus the creation of K*




    14We also assume, realistically, that K+ cannot be shifted about from one technology         to another but
is specific to the technology for which it was created.

        The same factor proportions                    are needed to create K“ in the F (or A) and C technologies,

but the H technology      requires a larger amount of L, relative to K (see Figure 1, part A). In the

production    of Q, however, the H, F (or A), and C production                                functions differ in factor intensity

(see Figure 1, Part B). Production                 of Q using the H technology                  is the most intensive in K“, next

is C, and last is F (or A). That is, artisanal or hand production                               has the highest skilled-labor      to

capital ratio, relative to the other production methods, in the creation of workable                                  capital.   And

when its workable      capital is used in the production                        process it has the greatest output elasticity.

The factory and continuous-process                      technologies          require a higher capital to skilled labor ratio

in the creation of workable         capital, but both have a lower output elasticity for workable                            capital

in the production     process than does the artisanal shop, the factory system having the lowest.

More formally, we assume that K’ is generated by:

        K* = ti(k]i     “L, /kki “K)                                 i= H, F,A, C                                                 (1)

such that ~l~,A,c> kl~ and            kk~,*,C< lk~ , where 1 /kl i , for example,                         is the unit skilled-labor

requirement    for K* creation in production                         process i. Q production         is, likewise, given by:


        Q = yi ~(Lu) U    (K*)      (1 -U)                           i= H, F,A, C                                                 (2)

such that a~ < ac < ~F,* .

        Even though skilled labor and capital are strictly complements                                in capital-maintenance      for

all technologies,     as in eq.        (l),        capital-skill            complementarily        need    not   be observed      for




    15Our framework produces results that are qualitatively                           similar to those of a more general production
function such as a two-level CES of the form:


        Q=Ai[%(K*)pi+            (l-~)         Lupi]          l/pi             pi<l

                                              ei       l/ei                    gi<l
        K* = [ pi (K) ‘i+(l-~i)L6                  ]

as long as pi > 6i for all i. We analyze the special case for which pi = O and 6i = -m.

                                                                        7
manufacturing        as a whole   as technology        advances       (by which      we mean a movement               from

artisanal production      to the factory and eventually to continuous-process                  methods).lG The reason

can be seen with reference to Figure 1 (see also Table 1). Part B of Figure 1 is drawn so that all

isoquants     represent   equal amounts of Q. It has also been drawn for a very special case of K“

production,     one in which the average cost of K* for all technologies                     is the same (and thus for

which the isocost lines in Part B are parallel).            If r*i is the average cost of K* for technology           i, the

condition     for which r* is equal for the H and F (or A or C) technologies                    is:

        r/ws = [(kl~)-l - (kl~)-l]/[(k~~)-l -   (~kF)-l]                                                               (3)

The condition,       although not necessary, makes the geometry far sirnpler.17 Without it, however,

we will need another, less restrictive,         condition for one of the results.

        Initially, say in time period O, consider the factory system to be in its infancy, continuous

processes     have    not yet been invented,         and the artisanal           shop    is the dominant        mode        of

production.     We begin, therefore,    at point HO, Note that just because K* is relatively high does

not mean that much raw capital per unit of output is used.                   As can be seen in Part A of Figure

1, the H technology       uses relatively more L. than do the other technologies                      in producing    K*.

        Technological       change eventually       makes the factory system the dominant                     mode of Q

production,     as can be seen by the Hicks-neutral              technical change from FOto F1 (resulting             from

an increase in yF). As this type of technological                change proceeds,       firms will eventually        switch

from the H to the F technology         (just beyond F1 in Figure 1, Part B).                  The shift from artisanal

shops to factories initially causes an increase in (K/Q), in (K/L~), probably                         also in K/(L~ + Lu),




   16By a technological     advance from artisanal production         to the factory system we mean an increase in
~F relative to y~. The appearance    of continuous         or batch processes,   likewise,    comes from an increase         in
yc relative to yF.

    17 If the r’s were different, the isocost lines would not be parallel. The condition simply states that
the degree to which the cost of a unit of K exceeds that for a unit of L, must equal the degree to which
F conserves on ~, relative to H, compared with how much H conserves on K, relative to F.

                                                             8
and, most importantly,       a decrease in L./ (L, + LU).lB In the more general case of our framework,

in which the isocost lines in Part B are not parallel for the H and F technologies,                          a weaker

condition      than that given by eq. (3) is required          for an increase       in the relative    demand       for

unskilled labor to emerge from the shift to the factory.             The condition requires that the share of

unskilled      labor in total product for the factory technology          be sufficiently     larger than the share

for the artisanal shop technology.          It is likely that such a condition held.”

         Additioml      Hicks-neutral    technical change shifts the F isoquant to A, possibly                 through

an organizational      innovation: the assembly line. The shift does not change the capital-labor                 ratio,

nor the relative demand for skiUed labor, but it does lower the capital-output                     ratio.

         The shift of most interest          to us is the appearance             of another    technology,      that of

continuous-process      methods, given by isoquant C.20 Although its capital maintenance                    technology

is identical    to that of the A or F processes,       it has a higher output elasticity with respect to K*

than do the A or F processes        (~ < ~~,*). Its eventual adoption will increase (K/Q), K/(L~ + Lu),

and L,/ (L, + LU). That is, with its adoption we will observe capital-stil                    complementarily      and




    la See Table 1 for the various conditions. We are considering here a small factor-neutral technological
change around F,. Greater technological change, as in the movement to A, can decrease K/Q.

    19More formally, the condition is that: (r’~/{~) < [(uE/u~)] . [(1 - u~)/(1 - a~)] - (L1~/ll~) Intuitively,
the condition for the shift from H to F to decrease the relative demand for skilled labor, given Q, will not
occur if (r”~/r*~)is too high. The cost of installed capital will be relatively high in the H sector when the
cost of skilled labor is great in comparison with raw capital. When that occurs, the H sector will have an
incentive to conserve on expensive K* in the production of Q, thus substituting unskilled labor for K*.
But the condition will hold, even when ({”/{~) is high, if u~ is sufficiently low in comparison with u~.
The shift to the F technology will, then, still increase the relative demand for unskilled labor because the
marginal product of ~ is lower in the H technology (given Q and L.)                 The effect is further helped by
the assumption that X1~> 11~. It does seem reasonable that, for given Q and ~, the marginal product of unskilled
labor was lower in the artisanal shop mode of production compared with the factory. After all, the reason for having
the factory system, with its more intricate division of labor, was to increase the marginal product of unskilled labor.

    20 The shift from A to C could arise from exogenous          technological    advance (growth in y= relative to
Y*, ~) or such change could have been fostered by an increase in the relative price of unskilled labor
(increase in wu/r*), as may have occurred with the expansion of high schools after c.191O and with the
ending of open immigration in the 1920s.

technology-skill    complementarit    y, at fl”ven factor prices.21

        Note that the introduction         of electricity   and unit-drive    in many factories    had effects

similar to those arising from a shift to continuous-process           technology.    The mechanization     of the

hauling and conveying       of materials decreased the relative demand for unskilled labor, and the

faster and hotter ruining     of machinery required relatively more machine-maintenance             persomel.




Technology-Skill      and Capital-Skill      Complementarity:      1909 to 1940


        We turn now to the historical       record   to observe when capital and skill, or technology        and

skill, became relative complements.          Because capital is more easily measured          than technology

and its use facilitates comparisons        with the more recent period, we will often focus on capital-

skill complementarily.      But we are also able to gauge technological             advance in the past by the

use of purchased      electricity.   The U.S. censuses       of manufactures        for 1909 and 1919 contain

information    on the capital stock, but that for 1929, important          in our measure of technology       by

purchased     electricity use, does not.     Employment      is not disaggregated      into subgroups    of blue-

-collar workers, except by sex and by child versus adult.22 And we do not have direct evidence

on the average skill or education of workers in those years, although white-collar              workers were




    2] Although we do not have a fourth input -- raw materials -- it is easy to compare our framework
with that in James and Skinner (1984). Their skilled sector is our artisanal sector, and it shifts from the
H to the F technology, thereby increasing K/Q, probably also K/L, but decreasing the fraction of the work
force that is skilled, The cause of the technological shift in their case is the lower relative price of raw
materials in the United States versus Britain.

    22Capital was also inquired of in 1914, but the question on the capital stock ended in 1919. In 1939
a question was asked on capital investment.      For a discussion of the accuracy and consistency of the
capital stock variable and for its defense, see Creamer et al. (1960, appendix A). Capital was to include
only the owned portions of land, buildings, machinery, tools, inventories, and working capital (e. g., cash)
and to be assessed at book value.

grouped     separately.23    Beginning     in 1940 the U.S. census of population             asked information     on

highest grade completed,        industry, and occupation.          Using all these sources, and the narrative

historical record, we explore the origins of capital-skill           and technology-skill      complementarily.24

          The 1940 census allows us to identify industries            that used disproportionate       numbers     of

higher-educated      (e.g., high-school     graduate) workers in blue-collar       occupations,     and the census

of manufactures      can reveal whether “high-education”           industries were more capital- or electricity-

intensive   from 1909 to 1929.      We find, looking across narrowly-defined             industries    in 1909 and

1919, that “high-education”       industries,    categorized      on the basis of 1940 data, were both more

capital- and electricity-intensive.        They also paid their production         workers more in 1909, 1919,

and 1929, suggesting        that these workers were more skilled in the 1910s and 1920s.

          Many of the industries         we characterize    as capital-intensive    and “high-education”         have

been classified by others (e.g., Chandler 1977) as using continuous-processor                  batch technologies.

The evidence      for the 1909 to 1929 period is consistent with the notion that the transition                  from

the factory    (or assembly-line)        to these processes       increased   the relative    demand    for skilled

workers     and thus can be viewed as a candidate               for the origins of economy-wide        capital-skill

complementarit      y. me previous transition, from the artisanal shop to the factory, involved just

the opposite force. Many of the industries that remained craft in nature (e.g., engraving, jewelry,




   23The groups were proprietors and firm members; salaried officers of corporations; superintendents
managers, engineers, and other technical experts; and clerks, stenographers, salesmen, and other salaried
employees.

    24Several data sets culled from the U.S. censuses of manufactures are used. We assembled data for
1909 and 1919 and matched them by (pseudo) 4-digit SIC industry using the 1909 industries. Similar data,
covering 1909, 1914, 1919, and 1929, were generously provided by Arthur Woolf (see Woolf 1980). They
contain information on power sources, omit some detail on wage-earners, and are not matched over time
by industry, We matched the 1929 industries in the Woolf data to our 1909 and 1919 industries and added
the missing information on wage-earners.   Across the three years (1909, 1919, and 1929) we can match 228
(pseudo) 4-digit industries covering gg~. of employment in those years. The 1909 and 1919 census data
surveyed all firms with more than $500 in gross output; that for 1929 used a $5000 cutoff point. There
appear to be no important biases as a result (see Fabricant 1940).

clocks and watches)         had far lower capital intensity but higher skill (education)            per worker than

did the majority       of the industries     that shifted to factory-style     production    techniques.

           Capital   and skill, measured         by the utilization        of non-production     workers,      appear

complementary         across manufacturing.        We find for 1909-19, using a methodology           similar to that

in Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994), that the change in the proportion                   of an industry’s     wage

bill going to white-collar          workers was positively related to the change in both capital-intensity

and purchased        electricity.    And the coefficient measuring capital-skill        complementarit     y for 1909-

19 is larger than for 1959-69 and 1969-79 and almost as great as that for 1979-89.

         Educated       Labor in Blue-Collar       Occupations

         The    1940     U.S. census      of population       contains   the earliest    evidence    regarding      the

educational     attainment      of Arnericm      workers by industry and occupation.25           Using these data,

we explore whether the blue-collar            labor force varied in its schooling by industry.           We limit the

analysis of the 1940 data to males, 18 to 34-years old in blue-collar occupations                (craft, operatives,

laborers, service) working in the manufacturing                sector.2G The age limitation is imposed because

the educational       attainment      reported by older Americans        in the 1940 census appears overstated

(Goldin and Katz 1996),              Secondary   schooling,    moreover,    increased    greatly in the 1920s and

1930s, and thus the educations           of older Americans would have been largely untouched                by these

changes.     We first restrict the analysis to blue-collar         occupations    because questions        concerning

capital-skill   complementarily         often revolve around the skill content of production             workers.




    x The 1940 U.S. pop ulation census was the first to ask the educational attainment.   Only three state
censuses did so prior to 1940 (Iowa 1915, 1925; South Dakota 1915). Small samples exist that contain data
on education and occupation, and the 1934-36 Consumer Expenditure Survey does as well. But none is
national in scope, unbiased in the population sampled, and large, with the possible exception of the Iowa
data which we are currently collecting.

    26 Our substantive findings are very similar if we look, instead, at the educational attainment of all
male workers or at all blue-collar workers, rather than restrict attention, as we do, to 18 to 34 year old
blue-collar males.

                                                          12
        Among all 18 to 34-year old, male blue-collar manufacturing                workers in the 1940 PUMS

(Public Use Microdata       Sample), 27.4% stated they completed          12 years of schooling and most of

them were probably graduates of high schools.z’ As a fraction of the total blue-collar work force,

the more     educated     were   disproportionately       found    in certain    industries.     The industries,

moreover,    fit the categorization   we offered previously,        for many were continuous-process          and

batch technologies      (petroleum refining, dairy products, paints and varnishes, nonferrous             metals)

or were high-technology       industries and those producing relatively new goods (aircraft, business

machinery,    scientific and photographic     equipment),2a

        We list, in Table 2, industries by the percentage           of their blue-collar   male workers     (18 to

34 years old) who were high-school           graduates,     giving those in the top and bottom            2070 by

employment. 29 The industries         divide into two categories.         At the low end of the education

spectrum     are the products    of the first industrial    revolution    and those of construction:      cotton,

woolen, and silk textiles, boots and shoes, lumber, stone, clay, and cement.               At the other end are

the newer goods and services of the second industrial               revolution   (e.g., chemicals,   petroleum),

as well as many in the machine-producing              group.      Also in this category    are some that were

produced     in settings similar to the artisanal shop: clocks, watches, jewelry,              and even aircraft.




    27 The sample is restricted to the currently-employed. In 1940 more than 10’%oof those in the labor
force were unemployed and an additional 4% were on work-relief.      Most, rather than all, of those who
claimed to complete 12 years of school graduated from high school because, even as late as 1940, some
had been educated in ungraded schools, some may have been left back in school, and some, in this period
of soaring education levels, may have overstated their school attainment, as we believe was the case for
older cohorts (see Goldin and Katz 1995a).

    26The list would probably include many others in the batch and continuous-process        group if the 1940
census tabulated finer categories of industries, e.g., distilled liquors, pharmaceuticals.      Industries are
defined as high-technology    if a large percentage of their total labor force were engineers, chemists, and
other scientific personnel, similar to currently used definitions.

    29The PUMS gives all 3-digit industries and some of the larger 4-digit ones.        In the sectors we analyze
there were 61 separate industrial categories (omitting miscellaneous).

                                                       13
Finally, there is that perennial        among high-education         industries:   printing and publishing.’”

        Before making further sense of the findings regarding high and low-education                     industries,

we must address whether the results have been generated                   simply by geographic        differences     in

both education      and industry      or by age differences       in employment     and educational     attainment.

Also of interest is whether particular occupations              determine the groupings.     If, for example, only

machinists,    a highly educated        group, work in aircraft, then aircraft will be a high-education

industry,      We have regressed          the percentage        high school   on a full set of age, state, and

occupation     (craft, operative,     laborer, service) dummies and find that the residuals             by industry

retain an almost identical ranking to that of the original data. That is, state of current residence,

age, and occupation        do not have major effects on the educational            ranking of the industry.      Even

though, for example, aircraft was located in high-education                states and employed       large numbers

of machinists,      its other blue-collar       workers     were also more highly         educated     and aircraft

employed      disproportionately       more high-education        workers even in lower-education           states.

        Another possibility         is that the distribution     of educated workers by industry in 1940 was

a product     of the depression.        Firms that employed         high-educated     workers,    according    to this

logic, would, in the face of decreased           demand, have fired low-educated           workers     and replaced

them temporarily       with their higher-skilled          employees.     Such occupational        changes     are well

documented       for the depression years.       But we find that even in 1950 and 1960 most of the high-

education     industries   and sectors we identify in 1940 remain high-educated.                 Our categorization




    aoThe results do not differ substantially if we considered years of education instead of the percentage
graduating from high school.        Although we do not here present evidence for sectors other than
manufacturing, they display similar patterns. More educated blue collar workers in the communications,
transportation,  and public utilities sectors were found in telephone, wire & radio, air transportation,
petroleum & gasoline pipe lines, electric light & power, and radio broadcasting & television.       In retail
trade new products and those that were time-sensitive or more valuable per unit were sold, delivered, and
serviced by high school graduates,     For example, drivers for jewelry stores and drug stores were more
educated than other drivers. Blue-collar workers in radio stores and even gas-station attendants were far
more educated than the average blue-collar worker.

does not appear to be merely a product of the depression.

        A related issue is whether firms paid their higher-educated,            blue-collar      workers more in

1940. We find that the rate of return to a year of education in a standard earnings equation,                    for

male blue-collar      workers     (white, 18 to 34-years old), was 8.37..31 The return for an equivalent

group of ordinary white-collar         workers was 8.970. Even within the blue-collar            group there was

a substantial     return to education,    suggesting that the industrial distribution      of workers was not

merely a by-product         of the depression,    Of more importance     to us, it suggests that firms valued

the education      of blue-collar   workers.

        Certain industries, therefore, employed more highly-educated             blue-collar workers in 1940.

The industries      were apparently       technologically    advanced,   frequently    of recent origin, often

producing       goods previously     unknown      to consumers,   and using technologies         characterized   by

continuous-process          or batch methods .32 But what do these findings            signify    for capital-skill

complementarily?

        To investigate        capital-education   complementarily    in the 1909 to 1940 period, we have

merged the education          data by industry from the 1940 census with that on industry                attributes

from the 1909, 1919, and 1929 censuses              of manufactures,33     The 1940 census         categories    are

considerably      broader    than are those from the censuses       of manufactures,     which contain about

four times as many industries,         and we have aggregated       the earlier data to conform to the 1940




    31The coefficient on years of schooling is .083 in a (log) weekly earnings equation that also includes
potential-experience  and its square. The return is 77. with a full set of state dummies (data source is the
1 /100, 1940 PUMS).

    ‘2 It should be noted that even though many of the high-education industries were of recent origin,
we base our education data only on workers 18 to 34 years old. Differences in the industries could not,
therefore, be entirely due to the fact that younger workers were more educated than older workers.

    m We rely heavily on U.S. Department       of Commerce,   Bureau          of the Census (1940) for the
categorization of the 1909 and 1919 industries, but also the insights         of Fabricant (1940) concerning
products that underwent substantial change.

categories.      We regress the educational       level of 18 to 34-year old male blue-collar workers in 1940

on the capital to labor ratio (in 1909 and 1919), a measure of electrification              (averaged      over 1909,

1919, and 1929), and various controls for worker and industry characteristics.

           The ratio of capital to wage-earners       in 1909 and 1919 is positively related to the education

of workers by industry         in 1940 (see Table 3, COIS.1, 2), The effect, moreover,            is economically

significant,     Increasing   the capital to labor ratio by the equivalent         of its difference between        the

lumber & timber industry and oleomargarine               in 1909 increases the high school graduation               rate

by 7 percentage      points or by   zs~.   in   1940.’4 Thus more capital-intensive       industries    employed       a

more highly-educated          lab or force some twenty years later.

           We find similar effects with respect to the use of purchased             electricityy, entered either as

the fraction of horsepower        that was run by purchased         electricity   or as the log of the electricity

variable per wage earner (COIS.3, 4). The effect, moreover,               is obtained even when the growth

of industry      employment     from 1909 to 1929 is held constant.          Production-worker         skill was not

simply     determined    by industry       growth and the resulting       newness     of plant and equipment.

Rather, the usage of purchased         electricity affected the relative demand for skill independent                 of


industry       growth.   An 18 percentage          point increase    in the purchased        electricity    share     of

horsepower       (a one standard deviation change) is associated with a 3.6 percentage              point increase

in the share of young blue-collar workers who were high school graduates.                    Note that increases

in total horsepower       did not have the same effect.        The type of power, not simply the amount,

affected the skiU level.       There are important reasons for this.

           Purchased electricity and separate motors enabled many industries to automate conveying




    34 (Capital/wage-eamers)   in lumber & timber was $1693, and was $5871 in oleomargarine         in 1909,
Oleomargarine    was produced using a continuous-process    technology, whereas lumber & timber was
mainly factory production.   The 25~0 figure comes from the fact that 27.47. of all blue-collar males (18 to
34 years old) working in manufacturing were high school graduates in 1940.

and hauling operations and thereby eliminate substantial numbers of laborers.                  Many industries

were prompted        to introduce   these labor-saving     methods with the onset of World War I, and

chief among them were iron & steel, brick manufacturing,                pottery,   Portland    cement, pulp &

paper, rubber tires & tubes, slaughtering&meat           packing, lumber manufacture          & wood-working,

and mining     (Jerome    1934; Nelson 1987; Nye 1990).35         Ample and cheap electricity         rendered

feasible the production     of various materials, such as aluminum and other electrochemical,                that

disproportionately     used skilled labor.    Cheap electricity also encouraged        a more intensive      use

of machines    thereby increasing     demand for the skilled personnel who maintained              them.3G

        Note that we do not mean to imply any direct relationship                   between     the individual

workers in 1909 (or 1919) and 1940.          In fact, education   levels in Table 3 refer to men 18 to 34-

years old in 1940 who could not possibly have been at work in 1909. We are claiming, however,

that there is something       about these industries       that increased   the value of secondary-school

education   during the 1909 to 1940 period.       Secondary schooling was just beginning           to affect the

education   of the masses in the 1910s but by the mid-1920s             to mid-1930s    some 30% to 50°/0of

youths, depending      on region, had high school diplomas (Goldin 1994). Skilled workers in 1909

and 1919 were probably         replaced   in subsequent       decades   by young high-school        graduates.



    35 In iron and steel “the proportion of common laborers was cut approximately in half from 1910 to
1931. The evidence is unmistakable,” notes Jerome, “that recent progress has eliminated unskilled labor
to a much greater extent than other grades” (1934, p. 63). In all these industries, the use of conveyors,
traveling   cranes, jitneys, carriers, industrial trucks, and other handling devices reduced the relative
demand for unskilled labor. The changes, moreover, were evident as early as 1916 to 1920.

    36The role of electricity in increasing the relative demand for skilled workers is complex. Nye (1990)
concludes that electricity increased the relative demand for skill but recognizes the large number of effects.
“As the electrified factory evolved it required a different mix of labor and management           more middle
management; more engineers and technicians; fewer artisanal workers; and a more complex grading of
worker skills, with many more semiskilled laborers       and far fewer unskilled workers . Boy mule drivers
in coal mines, carriers in tire factories, or shovelers of raw materials in steel mills saw their work taken
over by electric locomotives, conveyors, and cranes       as a few skilled men using expensive machines did
work formerly perfomed       by a mass of the unskilled (pp. 234-35).      See also Du Boff (1964) and Devine
(1983) on the transition from mechanical to electric drive and the introduction of group and unit drive
motors.

Formal education      may have substituted      for on-the-job training and formal apprenticeships.

        Firms in 1909, 1919, and 1929 also appear to have paid significantly              more for educated

(skilled) workers.     The average blue-collar     wage in any of the years is strongly and positively

related to the education       level of the industry’s     workers    in 1940.   The coefficient   on years of

schooling     is 1270 in 1909, 107o in 1919, and 17,570 in 1929, as can be seen in the Table 4

regressions    of the (log) average wage on average years of schooling among blue-collar             workers.

Although      it is tempting    to interpret   the coefficients      as rates of return   to an individual’s

education,     they are, instead, a combination      of that and the return to working         in an industry

having more educated workers.         Using data sets containing more complete information,            such as

the censuses beginning with 1940, one can reconstruct the “poorer” data we are forced to use and

measure both the individual       and industry effects.     Almost identical magnitudes       are obtained to

those we present      for 1929 even though        the return to an individual’s        years of education    is

considerably     less.37 In light of these comparisons      we interpret the coefficients    for 1909 to 1929

as indicating that a return to education for blue-collar jobs existed, but that we cannot be certain

of its magnitude.3S

        We also analyze, in Table 5, the relationship         between average earnings per wage earner




    37We construct a similar regression using micro-level data from the 1940 PUMS by aggregating across
industries,   The analogous regression of the log(average wage, production workers) by industry on
average years of schooling of male blue-collar workers, 18-34 years old, in that industry (and the
percentage   female of blue-collar workers) yields a coefficient of .185 (se. .013). In contrast, a micro-level
regression of individual Iog(eamings) on own schooling (plus a female dummy) yields a coefficient of ,040
(se. .0004). It should be noted that because an experience variable is not included, the coefficient on
education is lower than in regressions to measure the return to education.

    3g The wage regressions in Table 4 (and those in Table 5) use consistent data on average annual
earnings of blue-collar workers by industry for 1909, 1919, and 1929. Because hours of work may have
varied in a manner that could bias the results, we have also estimated these regressions (for 1909 and
1919) using hourly earnings, where hours worked in each industry is estimated from a distribution of
hours. The results are robust to the choice of hourly or annual data.

                                                      18
and the capital and electricity variables in 1909, 1919, and 1929.39 We find, consistent                                     with the

previous tables, a positive correlation between the capital to labor ratio and wages and, similarly,

a positive effect between wages and the percentage                           of all horsepower         coming from electricity.

Because World War I caused a transitory                      compression          in production-worker            wages, we prefer

to concentrate       on the 1909 and 1929 coefficients.                 The magnitudes         implied by the coefficients             are

substantial,     particularly       with regard to purchased               electricityy use. The difference,           for example,

between the capital to labor ratios in the oleomargarine                          and lumber&         timber industries       implies

a 5% premium             in wages     for oleomargarine;           the difference        in their     purchased      electricity       use


implies     a 23~0 wage       difference     .40


           The wage       premia     we measure           are largely      due, we believe,         to compositional        effects;       a


greater     proportion        of more      skilled    workers      were     found     in industries     with      more capital per

worker and with a greater percentage                   of industry horsepower           coming from purchased electricity.

Another       interpretation        is that the wage             differentials      reflect   premia       for identically-skilled

individuals      working       in more capital- and electricity-intensive                     industries     in which there was

greater worker bargaining             power and managerial                discretion (e.g., Slichter 1950).         That may well

be the case. But the strong correlation between wages in the 1909 to 1929 period and education

in 1940, by industry,          convinces us that the compositional                   effect matters.41

           That high-school         graduate         blue-collar workers were employed                  in particular     industries

(more     capital-intensive      ones,     those     producing     newer goods) and were paid substantially                        more,

may come as a surprise               to readers        of the historical         literature   on the subject.        Rarely is the




    39We use the 1919 capital/labor                ratios for 1929.

    40The wage premia use the 1929 coefficients.    The actual difference in wages is 337.. Oleomargarine
had a capital to labor ratio in 1919 of $8759 and 69,4% of its horsepower came from purchased electricity;
the numbers for lumber & timber are $3028 and 27.5Y0,

    41   We are currently      looking for direct evidence            on the matter of skill composition.

                                                                   19
education of production workers mentioned.         Yet there is narrative evidence, complementing           our

empirical findings, on the cognitive skills valued in various trades.         High-school     graduates were

sought because they could read manuals and blueprints,             knew about chemistry        and electricity,

could do algebra and solve formulas, and, we surmise, could more effectively converse with non-

production    workers   in high-technology     industries.42    They were hired into particular         skilled

occupations    but also for more ordinary positions in certain “high education” industries,

        Capital-Skill   Complementarily       and Non-Production          Workers

        The data for 1909 and 1919 allow another               test of the capital-skill    complementarily

hypothesis,   as well as a comparison    with more recent estimates, by examining whether the non-

production    worker share of total labor costs increased along with the ratio of capital to output.43

The motivation     is the notion that the relative size of the non-production         worker group captures

the average amount of skill required across all workers.         More engineers and chemists, according

to this logic, necessitate   more educated and skilled production           workers    (see, e.g., Allen 1996).

Continuous-process      and batch methods according to Chandler (1977) required more managerial

and professional     employees,   relative   to production     workers,    and our estimations      above are

evidence that such processes      also required relatively more skilled blue-collar         workers.




   42 See,    fOr exampler
                               the descriptions   of positions  in electrical machinery,   glass, medicinal
manufacturing,    paint and varnish, and the printing trades in U.S. Department of Labor (various years,
1918-1921). Those that required some years of high school or a high school diploma commanded general
cognitive skills such as “good judgment,” “skilled in free-hand drawing, “ “special ability to interpret
drawings, “ “be familiar with the chemical formulas,” “general knowledge of chemicals used,” “be able to
mix the chemicals.”     More technical skills were also valued such as “knowledge of electricity” and “of
electric wire sizes and insulation, “ “technical knowledge of the properties of glass,” “general knowledge
of photography.”      Printing establishments   required that some be “well versed in grammar, spelling,
punctuation      and other essentials of a thorough knowledge of English;’ and noted that “an elementary
knowledge of Latin and Greek is helpful.”

    N Chiswick (1979) addresses a somewhat different question using cross-state aggregate manufacturing
data for both 1909 and 1919 and fails to find much evidence of aggregate capital-skill complementarily
(where “skilled” workers are salaried officers and managers).  Our data are for the same years, but are
disaggregated by industry, and we analyze the composition of skill demand within detailed industries.

           The estimating        equation     comes   from a model in which            capital,     over each ten-year

horizon,     is considered       the quasi-fixed      factor and non-production          (skilled    or educated)       and

production       (unskilled)    labor are the variable factors.~         If the variable cost function (total labor

cost function)        for industry j is translog and production           exhibits constant returns to scale, then

cost minimization         produces    an equation for the non-production             labor share of total labor costs

(S) in time f of the form:

           Sj, = ~ + $jt + ~~(wn/wp) jt +        ~j~(K/Q) jt                                                             (4)

where w. (wP) is the wage of non-production                       (production)   workers,   (K/Q) is the capital to

output     ratio,    and $j measures         the rate of skill-biased       technological    change      in industry      j.

Differencing        eq. (4) to eliminate industry fixed-effects,        yields the following estimating         equation

for the change in the non-production             share of the wage bill in industry j (under the assumptions

that ~j and pj do not vary across             industries   or, more realistically,     that the average coefficients

across industries        are being estimated):

           dSjt = PO+ ~ldln(wn/wP)j, + ~zdh(K/Q)jL + ~~                                                                  (5)

The coefficient         ~1 is greater    than or less than O depending               on whether        the elasticity    of

substitution        between    non-production      and production       labor is less than or greater than 1. The

condition     ~z >0 implies capital-skill        complementarily;       POcaptures the cross-industry         average of

the skill-bias       to technical   change and (PO+ ~,) is the industry-specific            bias to technical     change

plus measurement           error.   The intuitive interpretation        of ~, >0 is that when capital and skilled

labor are relative complements,             industries experiencing      a greater increase in capital intensity are

those with a larger increase in the non-production                   worker share of total labor costs.

           We estimate        eq. (5) as well as a modification           that drops the relative       wage variable,



    44See Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994) and Brown and Christensen (1981). The approach is used,
as well, by Bartel and Lichtenberg (1987). Our findings are not sensitive to whether we include materials
as an additional variable factor of production.

because cross-sectional      wage variation could largely reflect skill differences, not exogenous wage

variation.45     The data are matched at the (pseudo) 4-digit SIC industry level -- there are 256--

for 1909 and 1919, the last year until 1957 that the census of manufactures                   inquired about the

capital stock.      Non-production     workers    were listed in the four groups: proprietors,              officers,

managers       (often including professionals),   and clericals (often including other salaried workers),

and their share of manufacturing         employment       increased    from 13.9~0 in 1909 to 15,7~0 in 1919.

Among      the data issues we had to confront         are the treatment       of proprietor    earnings     and the

choice of output and capital deflators,~          In some industries      (e.g., bakeries),   proprietors    were a

large fraction of all workers and probably perfomed              managerial     and clerical duties.        We have

chosen to exclude their income from the wage bill,47 Our input (capital) and output (shipments;

value added, viz., shipments minus materials cost) variables are both nominal measures.                       In the

absence of industry-specific       output prices and materials        and investment      deflators,   we use the

aggregate WPI for the 1909 and 1919 period and, for consistency,               the aggregate PPI for finished

goods in the 1959 to 1989 comparison          period.4a

        The results for 1909 to 1919, given in Table 6, reveal that the coefficient             on the change in



    45Another reason not to include the wage ratio when estimating eq. (5) is that the estimates will then
suffer from a version of division bias, because WP appears in the denominators of both the dependent
variable and the wage ratio measure. Following Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994), we also add an
output term to account for cyclical differences in the extent to which non-production and production labor
are quasi-fixed factors. The inclusion of din(Q) also allows the production function to be non-homothetic.

    46 The weighting of the regression is another data issue. Because classification errors are more of a
problem for small industries we weight by the wage bill share. Qualitatively        similar results obtain
without weights, and median regressions (LAD estimates) without weights also yield similar results.

     47 Two methods of accounting for proprietor earnings can be offered: one imputes their earnings as
if they earned the average non-production wage in the census, and the second assumes that proprietor
income entirely reflects returns to capital and should not be included in the overall wage bill (it was not
supposed to be included). We present the results under the latter assumption; they are robust to either.

    4’ We can test the sensitivity of applying industry-specific      versus aggregate deflators using the 1959
to 1989 data, We find that the results regarding the capital-skill    complementarily  coefficient (~z) are robust
to the choice of deflator.

                                                       22
the (log) capital-output        ratio (~2) is consistently    positive    and significant     regardless    of other

controls and independent         of the output measure (shipments          or value added) .49 Inclusion of the

change in the relative wage reduces the coefficient somewhat, but far less so when we purge the

wage differential     of certain compositional      effects.50 We also find that the inclusion of a measure

of technological      advance     -- the change in the percentage          of horsepower       run by purchased

electricity   -- does not noticeably     affect the coefficient   on dln(K/Q)      and is itself positive.

         How large we think the effects in Table 6 are will depend on their magnitude                        in more

recent years when many have concluded               on the basis of such regressions         that there is capital-

skill complementarily.         We present such a comparison          in Table 7. The first two columns repeat

the results from COIS.(1) and (2) in Table 6. The remaintig               six give nearly identical estimations

for 1959-69, 1969-79, and 1979-89.         The striking finding is that the coefficient         on the change in

the (log) capital-output       ratio (~~ is larger for the 1909-19 period than more recently.              Only one

coefficient    -- that for 1979-89 in the estimation with the change in shipments variable -- is larger.

         The comparison         of the results for 1909-19 with those more recently             suggests   a strong

movement       during the 1910s toward capital-skill complementarily.             We do not yet know whether

the shift toward capital-skill      complementarit y preceded the 1910s, nor can we discern whether

it continued      beyond.51     But the historical     evidence      suggests   that the 1910s were a critical

moment        in the history    of American       industry    when    new goods     and new processes          were

introduced      as never before.      Moreover,     the new goods and processes             were associated     with




     49Qualitatively similar results are obtained by using the employment share of non-production workers
as the dependent variable. We prefer the cost share measure because it implicitly adjusts for changes in
relative labor quality and hours of work.

     50To mitigate the influence of compositional effects on changes in the sectoral skill premia, we use the
clerical wage for the non-production workers and we adjust the change in the skill premium for changes
in percent female and child among production workers (see CO1.7 of Table 6}.

    51We might be able to analyze the role of capital before 1909 but not between 1919 and the early 1950s.

Technological       Change and Capital-Skill        Complementarily:        Historical Insights and Conclusion

          The goal of this paper was to locate the origtis, and thus the sources, of technology-skill

and capital-skill    complementarily        in manufacturing.        We have demonstrated              that such relative

complementarities        existed from 1909 to 1929 and were associated                  with technologies            such as

continuous      and batch processes      and the adoption of electric motors.            To motivate the empirical

work, we devised a framework            in which capital is a relative complement             of skilled labor in the

creation of workable capital but in which unskilled labor is used with workable capital to create

output.      Manufacturing-wide          capital-skill    complementarily       can arise     from        shifts    between

technologies.      Our evidence pertains mainly to the period since 1909 and the transition from the

factory to continuous      and batch processes and electric motors; we can say little about the earlier

transition   from artisaml        shops to the factory with our data.

          A wide variety of innovations          dominated        the relationships     among capital, technology,

and skill.   We often hear that ours is a time of extraordinary                 technological      change,         Yet those

that appeared       or diffused in the two decades around 1915 may have been more consequential.

Manufacturing       horsepower       in the form of purchased        electricity rose from      9°/0    in 1909 to   53~0   in




1929; similar changes swept residential            use.    New goods proliferated,         such as the automobile,

airplane, commercial       radio, aluminum,       synthetic dyes, and rayon; household                 electric appliances

such as the refrigerator          and washing    machine;       office machinery      such as calculators,         dictating

machines,    and copying equipment.             New techniques       enhanced the production              of rubber, plate

glass, gasoline,     canned condensed       milk, and factory-made          butter.    Of the goods mentioned               all

but the auto are among the higher-education               industries in 1940 and which appear to have been

the higher-skill     industries    in the 1910s and 1920s.        Looking back at Table 2, the high-education



                                                           24
industries     include:    aircraft,   office and store machines,        petroleum      refining,     dairy products,

electrical machinery,       paints and varnishes,       miscellaneous     machinery,     and nonferrous         metals.

          Input price changes          may have been reinforcing        in enticing     firms to adopt particular

technologies.        Among the changes in input prices, the decline in the price of purchased                  electricity

was the greatest and perhaps most irnportant.52 Cheaper power, purchased                        electricity, and unit

drive meant          that firms could     adopt different       types of capital    and production            processes.=

Although      the existence of electric utilities meant that less capital was needed to generate power

within firms, production-capital           (as opposed to power-generating          capital) could run faster and

hotter, thereby requiring         more skilled workers to maintain it.

          Before      its sharp   curtailment     with World      War I, the continuing         flood     of unskilled

immigrants      must have encouraged         the adoption of technologies         intensive in unskilled labor and

with the decrease         in immigration,       firms should have pursued         an opposite       course.     We have

already      noted    that industries     rapidly    automated     after 1916, eliminating          scores     of laborer

positions.     But it was not just the diminution        of immigration     that may have altered the direction

of innovation and adoption.            We have elsewhere demonstrated           that high schools diffused rapidly

in the United States from 1910 to 1940 and that by the 1920s a substantial                    fraction of youths in

America      had completed        several years of secondary        schooling     (Goldin 1994, Goldin and Katz

1995).    The vast majority of those who graduated high school in the 1910s but did not continue

to college,     entered    a host of ordinary white-collar         occupations,     such as clerks, bookkeepers,

secretaries, and various sales positions.           The large premium to high-school        educated workers that

existed at the turn of the century, and which may have prompted                        the high school expansion,



    52According to Woolf (1980, table 2.1) nominal price declines for electricity were 3.4~0 and real declines
exceeded 57. average annually from 1910 to 1929.

    53See Du Boff (1964) and Devine (1983) on why electricity diffused slowly throughout industry                     until
the 1920s and the role of the capital stock and unit drive (i.e., separate motors for each tool).

                                                           25
was    markedly      reduced     by the 1920s, although           it remained     substantial,     A once-expensive

commodity       -- a high-school    graduate -- suddenly became a more reasonably-priced                    input.

         The technologically-forward          industries    also grew the fastest, not surprisingly.                If we

define a high-education        industry (see Table 2) as one in which more than one-third of the young

male   blue-collar     workers     had a high-school            degree    in 1940, the share       of manufacturing

employment       in these industries    rose from    2t).7~0      in   1909 to 26.770 in 1929.     The share in low-

education     industries   (defined as less than 23~0 with high school degrees in 1940) declined from

29.0% in 1909 to 20.570 in 1929. The share of manufacturing                  employment       in the top five (2-digit)

industries by education        (petroleum,   chemicals, electrical machinery,          printing & publishing,         and

scientific instruments)     continued    to expand from 1910 to 1940 (from 107o to 1670). Similar shifts

exist today and reinforce the effects of capital- and technology-skill                  complementarily.

         What did the various changes we detail imply for the wage structure?                       On the shop-floor

and in the office and executive         suite the relative demand for skilled and educated                  labor must

have increased       greatly from 1910 to 1940.54 But we have reported elsewhere                    that the wage of

ordinary white-collar      workers fell relative to that for all production            workers from the late 1910s

to the early 1920s with the increase in high schools (Goldin and Katz 1995).                      It now seems clear

that blue-collar employments         absorbed some of the increased supply of the high-school                educated.

The response      to increased     demand for educated workers was overwhelming:                       in thousands    of

school districts     across the United States high schools mushroomed,                     curricula     changed,     and

enrollments     soared.    The differential    between          the high-school    educated      blue or white-collar

employee      and the less-educated     worker may thereby have been kept in check.



    54 Chandler (1977) notes that the managerial revolution was also brought about by many of the
technologies we believe increased the relative demand for educated labor on the shop-floor. The demand
for more educated workers on the farm must also have increased as farm machinery became more
complex. Perhaps that is why high schools expanded even more rapidly in the rural farm areas of the
Great Plains and Far West than elsewhere.

LU = unskilled or less-educated labor



a The prediction is obtained when: (A~k/l~k) < [(1 - a~)/(1- a~)] . (r*~/r*~) mat is, considering the
restrictive case discussed in the text of equal r* for H and F, the prediction is correct only if the
higher K*-intensity for the H technology is outweighed by the greater use of K in the creation of
K* in the F technology.

bThe impact of (a) on [K/(~     + Lu)] is ambiguous    in the case when   [L,/(L, + LU)] declines.

c The prediction holds in the restrictive case of equal d for H and F.          When the r’ differ, the
condition is: (r*~/r*~) < [(a~/a~)] - [(1 - ~)/(1 - a~)] - (Al~/Xl~),

Notes: The unit of observation is a 1940-industry group.       Industries from the 1909, 1919, and 1929
Censuses of Manufactures are aggregated up to the 1940 groupings, e.g., beverages in 1940 contains the
1909 categories of distilled, malt, and vinous liquors, and mineral and soda waters. Each observation is
weighted by the industry share of total blue-collar employment in manufacturing averaged over 1909,
1919, and 1929. The dependent variable is the percentage of 18 to 34-year old, male blue-collar workers
in the industry in 1940 who graduated high school. The mean for 1940 among all blue-collar workers in
this group is 0,274. Standard errors are in parentheses.

averaged over 1909, 1919, and 1929. Artisan is defined as working in: gold and silver, leaf& foil; jewelry;
photo-engraving;   stereotyping &electrotyping;     cardcut design; wood& die engraving; glass; glass-cutting,
staining & ornamenting; instruments; optical goods; statuary art. Printing & publishing is also included
because of its special feature of demanding a literate labor force;

parentheses are Huber (White) standard errors allowing for grouped errors within 1940 industries. The
education variable (average number of years of school) is from the 1940 PUMS. The average wage is
computed as the wage bill/ (average annual number of wage earners) for all years,

Notes: The average wage is computed as the (production-worker        wage bill) /(average annual number of
wage earners) for all years. Independent variables are defined in Table 3. Log(K/L) by indust~ for 1919
is used in the 1929 regression; YO child for 1919 is used in the 1929 regression. Regressions are weighted
by the number of wage earners in each year, as are the means for 1929.

Notes: The dependent variable is the log change in the nonproduction-worker        share of the wage          bill
between 1909 and 1919. The number of observations is 256 for COIS. (l)-(7) and 253 for CO1.(8).               An
observation is an industry, generally at the (pseudo for 1909 and 1919) 4-digit SIC level. Regressions        are
weighted by the average wage bill share between 1909 and 1919. Standard errors are in parentheses.           The
weighted mean of the dependent variable is 0.006.
