                                             ABSTRACT

We propose a new game theoretic approach to modeling large elections that overcomes the “paradox
of voting” in a costly voting framework, without reliance on the assumption of ad hoc preferences
for voting. The key innovation that we propose is the adoption of a “smooth” policy rule under which
the degree to which parties favor their own interests is increasing in their margin of victory. In other
words, mandates matter. We argue that this approach is an improvement over the existing literature
as it is consistent with the empirical evidence. Incorporating this policy rule into a costly voting model
with paternalistic voters yields a parsimonious model with attractive properties. Specifically, the model
predicts that when the size of the electorate grows without bound, limiting turnout is strictly positive
both in terms of numbers and proportions. Further, the model preserves the typical comparative statics
predictions that have been identified in the extant costly voting models such as the underdog effect
and the competition effect. Finally, under the case of selfish agents, we are able to extend Palfrey and
Rosenthal’s (1985) zero turnout result to a general class of smooth policy rules. Thus, this new approach
reconciles the predictions of standard costly voting, both in terms of positive turnout and comparative
statics predictions with the assumption of a large electorate environment.

                                        A Theory of Large Elections



1. Introduction

In the original formulation of his rational choice theory, Anthony Downs (1957) drew attention

to what has come to be known as the “paradox of voting”: if voting is costly, turnout in large

elections should be negligible. Downs formulated the problem in a decision theoretic framework,

relying on the fact that the probability of being pivotal is exogenous. Ledyard (1981, 1984) and

Palfrey and Rosenthal (1983, 1985) questioned the validity of this approach and recast the

problem in game theoretic terms. As a result of these efforts, in their 1985 paper, Palfrey and

Rosenthal demonstrated that in large electorates, provided uncertainty about relative costs, voters

with positive net voting costs abstain even in a game theoretic framework: “We have come full

circle and are once again beset by the paradox of not voting.” 1 (Palfrey and Rosenthal, 1985, p.

64). In spite of this paradox, game theoretic costly voting models have been, and continue to be,

prominent (see, for instance, Campbell, 1999; Börgers, 2004; Goeree and Grosser, 2007; Krasa

and Polborn, 2009; Krishna and Morgan, 2010; Taylor and Yildirim 2010, among others). Their

popularity is driven by two factors: first, these models are consistent with the notion that voters

behave strategically (e.g. Riker and Ordeshook, 1968; Franklin et al., 1994); second, they are

able to generate intuitive, and empirically supported, comparative statics predictions (e.g.

Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999; Blais, 2000; Levine and Palfrey, 2007) – at least with a finite

electorate.

To date, the prediction that turnout converges to zero as the size of the electorate grows has

 Curiously, the literature has referred to this notion as both the “paradox of voting” and the “paradox of not
voting”.
                                                                                                                 3
typically been overcome in the costly voting model through the incorporation of either ad hoc

preferences for voting or coordination mechanisms that lack a solid micro-foundation (see for

instance Riker and Ordeshook, 1968; Harsanyi, 1977, 1992; Feddersen and Sandroni, 2006;

Coate and Conlin, 2004 ). We instead propose a new approach to modeling large elections that

overcomes this paradox in a costly voting framework, without reliance on the assumption of

direct psychic rewards from casting one’s ballot.

We consider a two-party system. Citizens are characterized by their political preference and cost

of voting, both being private information. We modify the standard model in two ways. First, we

drop the usual winner-take-all assumption and instead include a “smooth” policy rule under

which the degree to which parties (or elected officials) favor their own party’s interests is

increasing in their margin of victory. In other words, mandates matter. Specifically, we assume

that the benefit from government action is distributed across members of the two parties

according to a continuous function that is strictly increasing (tilted toward members of the

winning party) in the proportion of votes received by the winning party. Thus, politicians are

“smooth” in the sense that, for members of a given party, benefits are strictly increasing in the

vote percentage received by said party.

Second, following in the tradition of recent work by Feddersen and Sandroni (2006), we assume

that voters are paternalistic. Citizens not only receive a private benefit from having their

preferred policies adopted, but they also receive spillover benefits from the impact that these

policies have on other individuals.

To motivate our assumption about smooth politicians, we first argue that this is a logical

expectation in an environment where candidates serve at the will of their electorate. We

additionally provide empirical evidence of this type of behavior in the U.S. Congress. In

                                                                                                    4
particular, we use a panel data model with member and Congress fixed effects to demonstrate

that the degree to which members of congress adopt partisan voting records is increasing in the

margin of victory in their most recent election.

Using our proposed theoretical framework we show that, when the size of the electorate grows

without bound, limiting turnout is strictly positive (in terms of proportion) if the supporters of

both parties are paternalistic. This relies critically on the assumption that mandates matter.

Indeed, we show that if the election is decided by winner-take-all majority rule, turnout still

converges to zero even if voters are paternalistic. The intuition is as follows. For a paternalistic

individual in a winner-take-all election, while the benefit from voting increases with the size of

the population, her probability of being pivotal goes to zero at an even faster rate. While, under

the marriage of paternalism and a smooth policy function, the rate at which policy impact

decreases with population is such that it is precisely offset by the increase in paternalistic

benefits arising from the increase in the population. Conversely, when we relax the paternalism

assumption and assume that the supporters of at least one party are purely selfish, we are able to

extend Palfrey and Rosenthal’s (1985) famous zero turnout result to a general class of smooth

policy rules. Thus, we require both paternalism and the assumption that mandates matter to

overcome the paradox of voting.

In analyzing the comparative statics properties of our model, we distinguish between two

different types of paternalism: Exclusive and Inclusive Paternalism. While Exclusive agents are

solely concerned about members of their own party, Inclusive voters also care about the

supporters of the other party. Under this dichotomy, our framework allows us to discern

between two competing comparative statics effects associated with the relative size of the two

parties. On the one hand, increasing the size of one party makes its supporters less likely to vote

                                                                                                       5
(the well-known free-riding effect). On the other hand, changing the relative composition of the

electorate varies the spillovers received by a voter. We refer to this second channel of impact as

the spillover effect. While free-riding and spillover effects perfectly offset each other in the case

of Exclusive voters, the latter is less pronounced when voters are Inclusive. As a consequence,

when agents display Inclusive Paternalism, under the assumption of identical cost distributions

and identical overall levels of paternalism, the incentive to free-ride leads members of the

minority party to turn out to vote at higher rates than do the majority (the so-called underdog

effect -- see Levine and Palfrey, 2007); nevertheless, the majority never loses its initial advantage

and receives a higher share of the votes. Furthermore, assuming the same cost distribution for

both parties and symmetric paternalism, the model generates the prediction that the closer the

election the higher turnout (the so-called competition effect--see Levine and Palfrey, 2007). Both

the underdog and competition effects have been well documented empirically (see, for instance,

Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999; Blais, 2000; Levine and Palfrey, 2007) and characterized as

theoretical features of standard costly voting models with finite electorate and identical cost

distributions (see Taylor and Yildirim, 2010). Key however, as shown by Taylor and Yildirim

(2010), is the fact that these effects disappear when the electorate size grows without bound.

Thus, a main contribution of our approach is its ability to reconcile the attractive properties of

standard costly voting models of small elections with the assumption of a large electorate

environment.



2. Background and Motivation

The first attempt to solve the paradox of voting in costly elections relied on the assumption that

citizens receive a direct benefit from voting that is independent of the election outcome. When

                                                                                                        6
this benefit exceeds the cost of voting (𝐷 > 𝑐) citizens vote (see Riker and Ordeshook, 1968).

While overcoming the problem of zero turnout, this model abstracts from strategic interactions

and provides no comparative statics predictions regarding voter turnout. Other scholars

approached the problem from a different perspective, assuming instead that leaders can mobilize

party supporters (e.g. Morton, 1991; Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999). As a consequence, the game

becomes one with a small number of players and equilibrium turnout is positive. Although they

are able to provide comparative statics results, such models do not provide a micro-foundation to

explain how leaders mobilize followers.

More recently, following in the tradition of Riker and Ordeshook’s civic duty model, Feddersen

and Sandroni (2006) develop a model of ethical voters in the spirit of Harsanyi’s (1977) rule

utilitarian framework. Under their specification, the exogenously given voting rule of Riker and

Ordeshook is replaced by an endogenously determined group-specific utilitarian voting rule that

accounts for the benefits and voting costs of all individuals.

In the model of Feddersen and Sandroni, within each of two types (parties) there are two kinds of

agents: ethical voters and abstainers, with the latter abstaining under all circumstances. Ethical

voters on the other hand receive a benefit D greater than the maximum voting cost 𝑐̅ for “doing

their part”, where “doing their part” consists of following the threshold voting strategy that

would be adopted by a social planner maximizing a utilitarian social welfare function. The

social planner’s objective function adopted by a given type (party) puts equal weight on the

benefits and voting costs of members of each type (party). Hence, ethical voters exhibit other-

regarding preferences: while they are altruistic with regards to other voters’ costs, their

specification is paternalistic in that an individual of a given type projects her own preferred

election outcome onto the entire measure of voters.

                                                                                                     7
Feddersen and Sandroni’s model provides a strong set of comparative statics predictions and

represents a major step forward in the quest for an appropriate theory of large elections. A

version of their specification is also used by Coate and Conlin (2004) to explain turnout in Texas

liquor referenda. Nevertheless, the model relies on the assumption that ethical voters of a given

group do not interact strategically among themselves and, for this reason, the game is actually

isomorphic to a two-player game. This leaves open the question of how ethical voters of the

same type can coordinate and behave as a single actor, instead of free-riding on each other.

While there exists ample evidence that individuals exhibit other-regarding preferences (see, for

instance, Fehr and Schmidt, 2006), and such assumptions are typically employed to explain why

agents cooperate in prisoner’s dilemma problems, the (group) rule utilitarian approach is non-

standard outside Harsanyi’s and Feddersen and Sandroni’s specifications and lacks empirical

support. Moreover, the model crucially depends on the assumption that (at least some) ethical

voters care about the social cost of the election. If this was not the case, all ethical voters would

turn out to vote, as already predicted in Riker and Ordeshook. While this assumption makes

sense from the social planner’s perspective it is not clear why this is an accurate description of a

strategic voter’s preference.

Most recently, in a current working paper, Evren (2011) shows how the rule utilitarian

assumption of Feddersen and Sandroni’s model can be relaxed when there is uncertainty over the

proportion of other-regarding voters. In doing so, he is able to replicate Feddersen and

Sandroni’s results in a game theoretic framework.

In this paper we take a different approach to the problem. Building on the classic work of Palfrey

and Rosenthal (1985), we extend their specification to include the paternalistic behavior posited

by those working in the tradition of Feddersen and Sandroni. Additionally, critical to our

                                                                                                        8
approach is the assumption that mandates matter and election outcomes are mapped into policy

decisions through a smooth policy function that is continuous in election margins (smooth

politicians).

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We begin, in Section 3, with the case for

replacing traditional winner-take-all models of election outcomes with our proposed smooth

policy approach. In Section 4, assuming smooth politicians, we construct a parsimonious and

tractable model that yields positive turnout when voters are paternalistic, while we extend

Palfrey and Rosenthal’s (1985) zero turnout result to a general class of smooth policy rules when

the supporters of at least one party are purely selfish. Section 5 provides comparative statics

predictions: we show that, under the assumption of identical cost distributions, our model

generates both the underdog effect and the competition effect. Section 6 concludes.



3. Smooth Politicians: Empirical Evidence

The key innovation of our modeling approach is the incorporation of a smooth policy rule under

which the degree of partisanship following an election is a continuous function of the relative

vote shares of the two parties. Here we argue that elections determine not only who gets elected,

but also what kind of policies the winners will enact. The basic reasoning is that candidates who

win by larger margins are likely to adopt more partisan policies than are candidates who win by

small margins.

Several arguments exist to support this type of behavior and have received attention in the

political science literature. 2 For example, candidates who win by a landslide can claim they have

a mandate for their party’s policies while those who win by small margins cannot claim such a

                                                                                                  9
mandate. Additionally, when elections are repeated games and candidates are uncertain about

the distribution of voter preferences, close elections may cause candidates to eschew highly

partisan policies to avoid the risk of losing the next election to a more moderate candidate.

Finally, candidates may be intrinsically motivated to legislate from the center of their electorate.

In this case, close elections signal a moderate electoral center while large margins signal a more

partisan electoral center.

A number of studies have provided empirical support for the link between margin of victory and

policy outcomes. Examples include work by Fowler (2005), Somer-Topcu (2009) and Peterson

et al. (2003). Fowler (2005) finds that in U.S. Senate races candidates respond to increases in the

previous election’s Republican vote by adopting more conservative positions in the current race.

Somer-Topcu (2009), using data from the Comparative Manifesto Project to evaluate the impact

of election outcomes on party policy positions in a sample of 23 Democracies between 1945 and

1998, finds that parties respond to declining vote shares by changing the policies they support.

Finally, Peterson et al. (2003) analyze newspaper coverage to identify U.S. Presidential and off-

year elections that were perceived as providing a “mandate” to the winning party. They then

provide empirical evidence that, following a “mandate” election, members of congress deviate

from their historical voting pattern in the direction of the mandate – with this effect attenuating

over time.

While this extant literature is suggestive of smooth behavior by politicians, more direct evidence

can be obtained through an analysis of congressional voting behavior. Table 1 provides an

analysis of the impact of margin of victory on the voting behavior of U.S. Members of Congress

for the 105th through 111th Congress. For a given Member of Congress in a given year, we

identify their degree of partisanship using the first dimension of Poole and Rosenthal’s well-

                                                                                                      10
known DW-Nominate Score. 3 This component of the DW-Nominate Score provides a one

dimensional ranking on the liberal-conservative axis for each Member of Congress in each

Congressional Session – based on an analysis of all roll-call votes during each session. For a

given Congressperson in a given year, we measure degree of partisanship as the distance

between that Representative’s D-Nominate Score and the “center” which we identify as the

midpoint between the scores of the most liberal Republican and the most conservative Democrat.

The first seven columns of Table 1 report the results from a regression of degree of partisanship

on Margin of victory and years in office for each of seven sessions of Congress – with the eighth

column presenting repeated cross-sectional results that are pooled across all seven Congresses.

The final row of the table reports the marginal effect of a one standard deviation increase in

margin of victory on the level of partisanship, expressed in terms of standard deviations in

partisanship. For example for the 105th Congress, the model predicts that a one standard

deviation increase in margin of victory will be associated with a .2 standard deviation increase in

partisanship. The estimated marginal effect is highly significant for all seven congresses and

ranges between .11 and .44 – with a pooled estimate of .25.

Of course, these results do not necessarily imply a direct causal link. One reasonable possibility

is that they reflect the selection of more ideologically extreme candidates into districts with

larger partisan majorities. However, if these results are solely driven by candidate selection,

given that election outcomes are the most direct measure of a given district’s voter ideology,

voters would still benefit by increasing their candidate’s margin of victory (decreasing

periods.

their candidate’s loss margin) because the selection mechanism would in the long-run lead to

preferred policy outcomes. While such a direct causal link is not necessary to motivate the

assumption of smooth politicians, it is possible to use the panel nature of the congressional data

to test for a more causal link. Specifically, by pooling the data and including candidate and

congress fixed effects, we can more directly evaluate the way that the voting behavior of a given

candidate evolves over time in response to changes in their margin of victory. The final column

of Table 1 reports the results from this analysis. Again, margin of victory is highly significant,

and the estimated marginal effect is .12. Thus, even when we focus solely on the within

candidate variation in ideological voting patterns, there is clear evidence in support of the

smooth politician assumption.

To incorporate the notion of smooth politicians in the context of a costly voting model, we

assume that policy outcomes can be mapped to the interval (0,1). Members of party A strictly

prefer outcomes closer to 0 and members of party B strictly prefer outcomes closer to 1.

Election outcomes (expressed as the proportion voting for party B) are mapped into policy

outcomes via a policy function 𝐺(∙). The only restrictions on the policy function are that it be

strictly increasing in the proportion of votes for party B and that there is symmetric treatment of

the two parties. 4 This specification provides a great deal of flexibility; as is shown in Figure 1,

which presents 3 different possible policy functions. The solid line presents a “proportional”

policy function which is consistent with the proportional representation rules that operate in

many parliamentary democracies. The dashed line represents a “quasi-majority” policy function

which approximates policy outcomes under direct election regimes such as those that operate in

the U.S. Congress. Our model allows such a “quasi-majority” policy function to be arbitrarily

    We formalize these notions below in Section 4.
                                                                                                       13
close to the type of step function that characterizes the winner-take-all assumption that has been

typical in costly voting models.

Lastly, the dotted line represents an “un-conventional” policy rule that, while likely of little

empirical relevance, is still admitted by the model.

We conclude this section by noting that our goal is not to provide a theoretical treatment that

explains why politicians are smooth but rather we seek to show how incorporating this type

observed behavior into the costly voting framework yields attractive theoretical results.



4. The Model

We consider a model of costly voting with two parties:             . Society is composed of

                                                                                                   14
citizens. Each individual has the same ex ante independent probability 𝜆 ∈ (0,1) of being a

supporter of party 𝐴 and 1 − 𝜆 of supporting party 𝐵. Citizens decide simultaneously whether to

vote or to abstain. If they decide to participate in the election they bear a cost. We assume that

for a generic individual 𝑖, supporter of party 𝑃, there is a cost to voting 𝑐𝑖∈𝑃 ∈ �𝑐𝑃 , 𝑐𝑃 � ⊂ ℝ+ .

Members of party 𝑃 draw their voting costs independently from the differentiable distribution

𝐹𝑃 (𝑐𝑃 ), with 𝐹𝑃 ′ (𝑐𝑃 ) > 0 on the entire support. While 𝜆, 𝐹𝐴 and 𝐹𝐵 are common knowledge,

each citizen’s preference and cost to voting are private information. If at least one individual

votes, then each member of party 𝑃 receives a benefit from government action according to the

electoral rule 𝐺: [0,1] → [0,1], which is a function of the proportion of total votes 𝑧𝑃 obtained

by party 𝑃. We assume 𝐺 ′ (𝑧𝑃 ) > 0 and finite, 𝐺(0) = 0, 𝐺(1) = 1 and 𝐺(𝑧𝑃 ) = 1 − 𝐺(1 −

𝑧𝑃 ). This last assumption is an anonymity condition that guarantees symmetric treatment of the

two parties. If no one votes the benefit from government action received by each individual is
         1
equal to 2.

Individuals receive direct benefits from government allocations, but they also exhibit

paternalism. They receive spillovers from the benefits obtained by the other members of their

party and may enjoy positive utility from each member of the other party being subject to their

own party’s policy. If a supporter of party 𝑃 receives a direct benefit 𝑏 from government action,

she enjoys an additional benefit equal to 𝛾𝑃𝑃 𝑏 for each member of her own party, and a benefit

𝛾𝑃𝑃� 𝑏 for every supporter of the alternative party. We assume that 𝛾𝑃𝑃 and 𝛾𝑃𝑃� are common

knowledge and that 𝛾𝑃𝑃 , 𝛾𝑃𝑃� ≥ 0.

Consider individual 𝑖, with cost 𝑐𝑖 , belonging to party 𝑃. Let 𝑁𝑃 and 𝑉𝑃 be the number of

supporters of party 𝑃 and of votes cast for 𝑃, both exclusive of individual 𝑖, respectively.

                                                                                                       15
Moreover, call 𝑉𝑃� the number of votes cast for the other party. Notice that for a supporter of

party 𝑃 voting for the other party is dominated by abstaining, hence citizens' actions boil down to

abstain or vote for their preferred alternative. If individual 𝑖 decides to abstain her benefit is

given by:

                                             𝑉𝑃

The solution concept that we employ is Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (BNE). As it is customary in

this literature, we restrict our attention to type-symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibria, in the sense

that all citizens supporting the same alternative choose the same strategy. In turn, participation

decisions depend on the realization of the individual voting cost. Formally, a strategy is a

mapping 𝑠𝑃 : �𝑐𝑃 , 𝑐𝑃 � → {0,1}, where 𝑠𝑃 (𝑐𝑖 ) = 0 means that individual i supporting party 𝑃

abstains and votes otherwise. A strategy profile {𝑠𝐴 , 𝑠𝐵 } is a type-symmetric BNE of the game if

𝑠𝑃 (𝑐𝑖 ) maximizes every individual’s expected payoff, given that all other individuals adhere to

𝑠𝑃 .

We start by exploring voters’ behavior when 𝑁 + 1 is finite. It is possible to characterize
                                                                                                     16

Proposition 1 There exists a pure strategy type-symmetric BNE characterized by the voting

strategy in (1) and thresholds 𝑐𝐴∗ and 𝑐𝐵∗ . 5



Having characterized the equilibrium for 𝑁 + 1 finite, we now turn to analyze voters’ behavior

in large elections. In order to do this we need to introduce some extra notation. First of all, call

𝜈𝐴 ≥ 0 the probability that an 𝐴-supporter votes in the election. Equally, 𝜈𝐵 ≥ 0 is the

probability that a member of party 𝐵 votes. Moreover, given individual 𝑖, let 𝜆̂ and �1 − 𝜆̂� be

the realized proportions of the electorate, exclusive of 𝑖, that support party 𝐴 and 𝐵, respectively.

Finally, denote by 𝜈̂𝐴 and 𝜈̂ 𝐵 the realized proportions of the electorate, exclusive of 𝑖, that vote

for party 𝐴 and 𝐵, respectively. For simplicity of notation let us define Γ𝐴 = 𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝜆 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 (1 − 𝜆)

and Γ�𝐴 = 𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝜆̂ + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 �1 − 𝜆̂�. Similarly, for a 𝐵-supporter, Γ𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 𝜆 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 (1 − 𝜆) and Γ�𝐵 =

𝛾𝐵𝐴 𝜆̂ + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 �1 − 𝜆̂�.

With no loss of generality, consider a supporter of party 𝐴. Given a sample of size 𝑁 + 1,

conditional on the decisions of all other individuals, the expected gross benefit from voting for

an 𝐴-supporter is given by Equation (2).

𝜈𝐴 𝜆 and 𝑃𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝜈̂ 𝐵 �1 − 𝜆̂� = 𝜈𝐵 (1 − 𝜆). Hence, supposing an equilibrium characterized by

thresholds 𝑐𝐴∗ and 𝑐𝐵∗ , limiting turnout in equilibrium is equal 𝜆𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) + (1 − 𝜆)𝐹𝐵 (𝑐𝐵∗ ).

The following proposition summarizes the main result of the paper.



Proposition 2 When 𝑁 → ∞, limiting turnout is positive if and only if Γ𝐴 > 0 and Γ𝐵 > 0.

In the case where Γ𝐴 , Γ𝐵 > 0 the expected gross benefit from voting for an A-member and a B-

member is given respectively by:
                        ∗                                          ∗

Conversely, if Γ𝐴 = Γ𝐵 = 0, 𝑐𝐴 ≥ 2 and 𝑐𝐵 ≥ 2 then turnout is equal to zero. Finally, in all other

cases, turnout for both parties converges to zero.



Proposition 2 states that, if both groups are paternalistic, equilibrium turnout is strictly positive

when the population grows without bound. All 𝐴-supporters with a cost less than

does not depend on the values of 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵 . The intuition behind this finding is that, although the

weight of an individual vote becomes negligible as 𝑁 tends to infinity, the benefit grows with the

size of the electorate.

If all agents are selfish, Proposition 2 extends Palfrey and Rosenthal’s (1985) zero turnout result

to a general class of smooth policy rules. Indeed, when everyone is selfish our model predicts
                                       1
that turnout is either zero, if 𝑐𝐴 , 𝑐𝐵 ≥ 2, or converges to zero otherwise. Finally, turnout tends to

zero if the supporters of only one party are paternalistic; since selfish players will abstain, there

cannot be a mass of paternalistic voters casting a ballot in equilibrium.

One extension to this result is Corollary 1 which states that, ceteris paribus, limiting turnout in

equilibrium can be arbitrarily high if voters are sufficiently paternalistic.



Corollary 1 Given 𝐺(∙) and 𝜆, there exists a pair (Γ�𝐴 , Γ�𝐵 ) such that 𝑐𝐴∗ = 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝑐𝐵 for any

(Γ𝐴 , Γ𝐵 ) with Γ𝐴 ≥ Γ�𝐴 and Γ𝐵 ≥ Γ�𝐵 . Given 𝐺(∙), 𝜆 and Γ𝑃 > 0 there exists Γ�𝑃 such that 𝑐𝑃∗ = 𝑐𝑃 ∀

Γ𝑃 ≥ Γ�𝑃 .



5. Equilibrium Analysis: Exclusive vs Inclusive Paternalism

We now focus on large elections where limiting turnout is positive, that is ΓA , ΓB > 0. We

consider two different types of paternalistic voters. If members of party 𝑃 are such that 𝛾𝑃𝑃 > 0,

while 𝛾𝑃𝑃 = 0, we will say that they are Exclusive, as they only care about the members of their

own party. On the other hand, we will call them Inclusive if 𝛾𝑃𝑃 , 𝛾𝑃𝑃 > 0. We limit our analysis to




                                                                                                      19
the cases where all citizens are either Exclusive or Inclusive. 6 We begin by presenting the

following lemma.

                                 𝜕(𝑐𝐴 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴 ) 𝑐𝐵 𝐹𝐵 (𝑐𝐵 )
If voters are Inclusive then                                  < 0, and thus it cannot be the case that both
                                            𝜕𝜆

  ∗               ∗

Lemma 1 is instructive, as it illustrates the two effects of a marginal change in 𝜆. On the one

hand we have the well-known free-riding effect: increasing 𝜆 makes A-members less likely to

vote, while inducing 𝐵-supporters to vote more often. On the other hand, by changing the

composition of the electorate, an increase in 𝜆 varies the spillovers received by a voter. We call

this relationship the spillover effect.

Suppose that voters are Exclusive. An increase in 𝜆 produces a positive spillover effect for 𝐴-

supporters, and a negative one for members of party 𝐵. Spillover and free-riding effect perfectly

                                                    𝑐 ∗ 𝐹 (𝑐 ∗ )
offset each other and, as a result, the ratio 𝑐𝐴∗ 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) is unchanged. As a consequence, the
                                                     𝐵 𝐵      𝐵


equilibrium thresholds for the two parties move in the same direction. If voters are Inclusive the

spillover effect is less pronounced. Following an increase in 𝜆, an 𝐴-supporter receives higher

6
  Given some additional conditions, most results also hold when the supporters of one party are Exclusive, while the
members of the other party are Inclusive. However, the study of the “mixed” case would complicate the analysis
without adding any interesting insights. Similarly, the key results do not greatly change if 𝛾𝑃𝑃� > 0, but 𝛾𝑃𝑃 = 0, that
is when voters only care about the supporters of the opposite party. Nevertheless, we do not analyze this case, as it is
not particularly realistic.


                                                                                                                     20
spillovers from members of her own party, but lower spillovers from 𝐵-members. The opposite

happens for a supporter of party 𝐵. Hence, the ratio 𝑐𝐴∗ 𝐹𝐴(𝑐𝐴∗ ) decreases with 𝜆, implying that the
                                                               𝐵 𝐵     𝐵


equilibrium threshold for party 𝐴 cannot increase while the equilibrium threshold for 𝐵

decreases.

Lemma 1 allows us to establish the following result.



Proposition 3

                                          𝑐 ∗ 𝐹 (𝑐 ∗ )   𝛾𝐴
   i.      If voters are Exclusive then 𝑐𝐴∗ 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) = 𝛾𝐴𝐵 , lim𝜆→0 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) = 0, lim𝜆→0 𝐹𝐵 (𝑐𝐵∗ ) = 0,
                                           𝐵 𝐵     𝐵     𝐵


           lim𝜆→1 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) = 0 and lim𝜆→1 𝐹𝐵 (𝑐𝐵∗ ) = 0.

  ii.      If voters are Inclusive then lim𝜆→0 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) = 1 and lim𝜆→0 𝐹𝐵 (𝑐𝐵∗ ) = 0, while

           lim𝜆→1 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ) = 0 and lim𝜆→1 𝐹𝐵 (𝑐𝐵∗ ) = 1.



Thus, under Exclusive Paternalism, the free-riding effect is offset by the spillover effect and voter

turnout goes to zero as 𝜆 goes to zero. Conversely, under Inclusive Paternalism, the free-riding

effect dominates and as 𝜆 goes to zero, minority turnout goes to 100% and majority turnout goes

to zero.



5.1 Identical Cost Distributions

In the remainder of the paper we focus on the case where all citizens draw their costs from the

same cost distribution, i.e. we assume 𝐹𝐴 = 𝐹𝐵 = 𝐹. Proposition 4 establishes that if voters are

Exclusive the group with the higher degree of paternalism will always vote more often than the

other, while the same relative percentage will cast a ballot when 𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 .

                                                                                                            21
Proposition 4 Suppose Exclusive voters and 𝐹𝐴 = 𝐹𝐵 .

    i.      If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 then 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) = 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆.

    ii.     If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 > 𝛾𝐵𝐵 then 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) > 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆.

    iii.    If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 < 𝛾𝐵𝐵 then 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) < 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆.



On the other hand, Proposition 5 demonstrates that if voters are Inclusive, there exists a critical

value 𝜆̃ such that 𝐴-supporters vote more often than 𝐵-supporters for any 𝜆 < 𝜆̃, while the

opposite is true when 𝜆 > 𝜆̃.



Proposition 5 (Underdog Effect) Suppose Inclusive voters and 𝐹𝐴 = 𝐹𝐵 . There exists 𝜆̃ such

that 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) > 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆 < 𝜆̃, 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) < 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆 > 𝜆̃ and 𝑐𝐴∗ �𝜆̃� = 𝑐𝐵∗ �𝜆̃�.

    i.      If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 then 𝜆̃ = 2 (Pure Underdog Effect).

    ii.     If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 > 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 then 𝜆̃ > 2 (Asymmetric Underdog Effect).

    iii.    If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 < 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 then 𝜆̃ < 2 (Asymmetric Underdog Effect).



The value of 𝜆̃ depends on the relative degree of paternalism of the two groups. If both groups
                                                                        1
exhibit the same overall level of Inclusive paternalism then 𝜆̃ = 2, meaning that the minority

supporters vote with a strictly higher probability than do the members of the majority party. This




                                                                                                      22
phenomenon, called underdog effect 7, has been discussed in several papers and has been

formalized in a general framework by Taylor and Yildirim (2010) for the case of small electorate

and same cost distribution. Crucially, in Taylor and Yildirim’s model the underdog effect

disappears when 𝑁 → ∞, as turnout converges to zero.

The underdog effect is caused by the relatively higher incentive to free-ride experienced by the

majority supporters. This is why it arises only when voters are Inclusive. As shown in Lemma 1,

if voters are Exclusive the spillover effect is sufficiently strong to offset the free-riding effect,

and the equilibrium thresholds of the two groups move in the same direction when 𝜆 changes.

Moreover, notice that the underdog effect can only arise if both groups display the same overall

level of paternalism, that is if 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 . If that is not the case, the game is no longer

symmetric, implying that one group votes with a strictly higher probability when the electorate is
                                                                         1
evenly split. Hence, the switching point 𝜆̃ cannot be equal to 2. Thus, we draw a distinction

between a pure underdog effect and an asymmetric underdog effect.

When both groups are characterized by the same overall level of paternalism, despite the

underdog effect, the majority supporters never lose their initial advantage, provided that

individuals care about their fellow group members at least as much as do those supporting the

alternative party. As shown by Taylor and Yildirim (2010) for the small electorate case, in

equilibrium the majority party receives a higher share of the votes. As we prove in the next

                                                                                            𝜆𝐹(𝑐 ∗ )

  The term underdog effect was introduced by Levine and Palfrey (2007), who document it with experimental
evidence. Shachar and Nalebuff (1999) and Blais (2000), among others, provide empirical evidence for the case of
large elections.

  Supposing that an individual is at least as much concerned for her own group as is a member of the other party is a
realistic, and not very restrictive, assumption. Moreover, by definition, it is always true for Exclusive voters.

Proposition 6 Suppose that 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 and 𝐹𝐴 = 𝐹𝐵 . If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≥ 𝛾𝐵𝐴 and 𝛾𝐵𝐵 ≥ 𝛾𝐴𝐵 then

        1      1              1        1
𝜃𝐴∗ < 2 ∀ 𝜆 < 2, while 𝜃𝐴∗ > 2 ∀ 𝜆 > 2.



Another important phenomenon that has received significant attention in the voting literature is

the so-called competition effect, which states that turnout is higher the closer is the election.

Levine and Palfrey (2007), who coined the term competition effect, provide evidence for it from

laboratory experiments. This has been a difficult property to demonstrate in models of large

elections (see Krasa and Polborn, 2009). Indeed, as reported by Taylor and Yildirim “the widely

held intuition that elections with a more evenly split electorate should generate a greater

expected turnout appears to be a property of small elections” (Taylor and Yildirim, 2010, p.

464). Nevertheless, the reason why their model does not predict higher turnout in closer elections

is because in a standard costly voting framework turnout tends to zero as 𝑁 → ∞. Yet, the

competition effect is well documented in large elections (see, for example, Blais, 2000; Shachar

and Nalebuff, 1999).

In Proposition 7 we provide analytical evidence of the competition effect for the case of

Exclusive voters, provided the following two conditions hold: 𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 and 𝐺 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) ≥ 0 for
        1                                   1
𝑧𝑃 < 2 (implying 𝐺 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) ≤ 0 when 𝑧𝑃 > 2). Both conditions are rather weak and intuitive.

Firstly, if 𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≠ 𝛾𝐵𝐵 the game is asymmetric and turnout for the two parties is not the same when
    1
𝜆 = 2: hence a more evenly split electorate does not imply a closer election. Second, notice that

so far we have not made any restrictions on the shape of the function 𝐺(𝑧𝑃 ). If 𝐺 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) is greater

                                                                                                    24
                                  1
than (or equal to) zero for 𝑧𝑃 < 2, an individual vote has more (or equal) weight, and the benefit

from voting is greater (or equal), when it closes the gap with the other party than when it

increases it. This assumption encompasses both the proportional and quasi-majority policy rules

discussed above in Section 3.



Proposition 7 (Competition Effect) Suppose Exclusive voters and 𝐹𝐴 = 𝐹𝐵 . If 𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 and

                        1                                             1
𝐺 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) ≥ 0 for 𝑧𝑃 < 2 then turnout is higher the closer 𝜆 is to 2.



We can only provide an analytical proof for the case of Exclusive voters. However, in our model

the competition effect is also a feature of large elections with Inclusive voters – provided that
                                                      1
𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 , 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 and 𝐺 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) ≥ 0 for 𝑧𝑃 < 2. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate predicted turnout as a

function of 𝜆 for a proportional policy rule and a quasi-majority policy rule, respectively. In both

examples, 𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 = 0.5, 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 = 0.25 and costs are uniformly distributed. 𝐺(𝑧𝑃 )= 𝑧𝑃 in

example.

Propositions 2 thru 7 and their associated lemmas and corollaries serve to highlight the large

election properties of a costly voting model that incorporates paternalism (Exclusive and

Inclusive) and smooth politicians – the key strength of the model being its ability to overcome

the paradox of voting, and to capture free-riding and spillover effects, the underdog effect, and

the competition effect in a purely game theoretic formulation of a large election.

As we showed in Proposition 2, if voters are selfish our model predicts that turnout converges to

zero, even assuming that mandate matters. Although we argue that a smooth policy rule is a

much more realistic assumption than considering elections as winner-take-all, it is a fair question

to ask what would happen if voters were paternalistic, but the outcome of the election was

decided by majority rule. Proposition 8 provides the answer to this question, for the case of

symmetric overall paternalism and assuming, as we did when discussing vote shares, that

𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≥ 𝛾𝐵𝐴 and 𝛾𝐵𝐵 ≥ 𝛾𝐴𝐵 .



Proposition 8 Assume 𝐹𝐴 = 𝐹𝐵 . Suppose also that 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 , with 𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≥ 𝛾𝐵𝐴 and
                                                               1
𝛾𝐵𝐵 ≥ 𝛾𝐴𝐵 . Under majority rule, 𝑐𝐴∗ = 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝑐𝐵 if 𝜆 = 2, while limiting turnout is equal to

                  1
zero for any 𝜆 ≠ 2.



The above proposition tells us that if the election is decided by majority rule then, even with

paternalistic voters, turnout converges to zero, unless the electorate is evenly split, in which case

everyone votes. Interestingly, Evren (2010) obtains the same result in a model in which a part of

                                                                                                      26
the electorate has other-regarding preferences, under the assumption that their proportion is

known. Proposition 8 highlights the necessity of assuming a smooth policy rule in our

framework in order to overcome the paradox of voting in a general sense, that is for any possible

composition of the electorate. The intuition is that, under majority rule, if the electorate is

unevenly split the higher benefit of voting that a paternalistic individual enjoys in a larger

population is dominated by the lower probability of being pivotal, with the latter going to zero

faster then 𝑁 goes to infinity.



6. Discussion and Conclusion

Since the seminal work of Ledyard (1981, 1984) and Palfrey and Rosenthal (1983, 1985),

economists have commonly modeled elections as participation games where voters pay a cost to

vote. The prominence of such models can be explained by their game theoretic micro

foundations, and their ability to generate predictions which are consistent with notions of

strategic voting behavior and the comparative statics results that have been documented in

empirical studies of election outcomes. While popular, current formulations of the costly voting

model typically confront one major drawback – the paradox of voting which was first described

in decision theoretic terms by Anthony Downs (1957).

Several attempts have been made to solve the paradox (see Feddersen, 2004, for a review) and

thus reconcile costly voting models with the evidence that a substantial fraction of the population

turns out to vote. Among all of these approaches, Feddersen and Sandroni’s work is perhaps the

most successful example. Unfortunately, while their framework yields strong comparative statics

predictions and positive turnout, their model is inherently non-strategic with regards to members

of the same party.

                                                                                                   27
In this paper we approach the problem from a different perspective, developing a parsimonious

game theoretic model that builds on the basic framework of Palfrey and Rosenthal (1985). We

extend their analysis in two ways. Our primary innovation is the adoption of a smooth politician

framework under which election outcomes are mapped into policy decisions through a policy

function that is continuous in election margins. Second, similar in some ways to the work of

Feddersen and Sandroni, we assume paternalistic voters. Under this new model, when citizens

are paternalistic, large elections yield strictly positive turnout both in terms of numbers and

proportions. Conversely, the model predicts that, if the supporters of at least one party are purely

selfish, turnout will converge to zero as the electorate grows; thus, we extend Palfrey and

Rosenthal’s (1985) theorem to a general class of smooth policy functions. A similar result holds

for the case of paternalism & majority rule. Indeed, under the winner-take-all assumption, if the

electorate is unevenly split, turnout converges to zero – even when voters are paternalistic, while

everyone votes if the electorate is evenly split. Finally, our framework yields sensible

comparative statics predictions, namely the underdog and competition effect, that were believed

to be only properties of small elections (see Taylor and Yildirim, 2010).

Thus, our analysis demonstrates that by reconceptualizing a paternalistic model of costly voting

to incorporate a smooth policy function – an arguably more realistic description of the policy

process – it is possible to reconcile the small sample predictions of the costly voting framework

with a game theoretic large electorate environment.

Finally, we note that in a concurrent working paper, Evren (2010) also overcomes the paradox of

voting in a costly voting framework. Similar to the model of Feddersen and Sandroni, Evren

assumes altruistic voters and a winner-take-all election. Evren’s definition of altruism partially

corresponds to our notion of paternalism, in that a voter does not incorporate other individuals’

                                                                                                     28
benefits in her own utility function (as altruism is typically understood), but rather projects her

own preference onto other citizens; he also assumes, though, that individuals care about the

voting costs of others, thus following in the spirit of Feddersen and Sandroni. In this framework,

Evren shows that, if there is uncertainty about the proportion of the population who are altruistic

voters, the rule utilitarian assumption is not necessary to generate positive turnout in large

elections.

It is an open question about which assumption is a more appropriate description of the driving

force behind voter behavior: expectations regarding the importance of mandate or uncertainty

regarding the composition of the electorate. We consider Evren’s paper and ours to be

complements and view an exploration of their relative merits as fertile ground for future

research.

Proof of Proposition 1

Suppose citizens play according to the strategy defined by (1) and thresholds 𝑐̂𝐴 and 𝑐̂𝐵 . Then for

a supporter of party 𝐴 the expected gross benefit from voting is given by

where

                                                                   𝑉𝐴 +1              𝑉𝐴

                             [1 + 𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝑁𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 (𝑁 − 𝑁𝐴 )]                                         𝑖𝑓 𝑉𝐴 + 𝑉𝐵 = 0
                         2


Similarly 𝐸[𝐵𝐵 (𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 )] represents the expected gross benefit from voting for a supporter of

party 𝐵 and is calculated in an analogous way. For this to be an equilibrium, it must be the case

that the supporter of 𝐴 with cost 𝑐̂𝐴 and the supporter of 𝐵 with cost 𝑐̂𝐵 must be indifferent

between voting and abstaining when all other players adopt the same strategy.

To prove the existence of such equilibrium we construct the function

        Φ(𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 ) = �max�min{ 𝐸[𝐵𝐴 (𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 )], 𝑐𝐴 } , 𝑐𝐴 � , max�min{𝐸[𝐵𝐵 (𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 )], 𝑐𝐵 } , 𝑐𝐵 ��.

As both 𝐸[𝐵𝐴 (𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 )] and 𝐸[𝐵𝐵 (𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 )] are continuous in 𝑐̂𝐴 and 𝑐̂𝐵 , then Φ(𝑐̂𝐴 , 𝑐̂𝐵 ) is also

continuous. Hence, by Brower’s fixed point theorem there must exist a pair (𝑐𝐴∗ , 𝑐𝐵∗ ) such that

Φ(𝑐𝐴∗ , 𝑐𝐵∗ ) = (𝑐𝐴∗ , 𝑐𝐵∗ ). If 𝑐𝑃∗ ∈ �𝑐𝑃 , 𝑐𝑃 �, then all supporters of party 𝑃 with cost less than 𝑐𝑃∗ will

vote and those with higher costs will abstain. Similarly, if 𝑐𝑃∗ = 𝑐𝑃 all members of party 𝑃 will

abstain, while if 𝑐𝑃∗ = 𝑐𝑃 they will all vote.∎

Proof of Proposition 2

In order to evaluate the limit of Equation (2), we must consider two cases.
                                                                                                                   30
i) In the first case, suppose that 𝑐𝐴∗ = 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝑐𝐵 , implying that 𝜈𝐴 = 𝜈𝐵 = 0. Here, all other

citizens choose not to vote with probability 1. As a result, the returns to voting for a supporter of

party 𝐴 are given by:

                                                             1
                                  𝐸[𝐵𝐴 |𝜈𝐴 + 𝜈𝐵 = 0] = 𝐸 �2 �1 + 𝑁Γ�𝐴 ��.

Given that 𝜆̂ → 𝜆, in the limit, as 𝑁 → ∞, then Γ�𝐴 converges to Γ𝐴 . Hence the returns to voting

                                                        1
become infinite if Γ𝐴 > 0, while they are equal to 2 when Γ𝐴 = 0. Clearly, the same holds for a

                                                                                              1
supporter of party 𝐵, with the gross benefit from voting equal to either infinity or 2 when Γ𝐵 > 0

or Γ𝐵 = 0, respectively. If Γ𝐴 = Γ𝐵 = 0, this implies that 𝑐𝐴∗ = 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝑐𝐵 can only be an

                        1            1
equilibrium if 𝑐𝐴 ≥ 2 and 𝑐𝐵 ≥ 2. On the other hand, if at least one between Γ𝐴 and Γ𝐵 is strictly

positive, then it cannot be the case that 𝑐𝐴∗ = 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝑐𝐵 in equilibrium.

ii) In the second case, suppose 𝑐𝑃∗ > 𝑐𝑃 for at least for one party. As a result, for at least one type

the probability of voting is strictly positive, which translates into 𝜈𝐴 + 𝜈𝐵 > 0. We begin by

showing that for this case the Plim of the second term in Equation (2) is zero and can thus be

ignored. To see this, first note that the second half of this term is the probability that no one

votes. Following the approach taken by Taylor and Yildirim (2010) it is easy to show that the

limiting marginal distributions of �𝜈̂𝐴 𝜆̂𝑁, 𝜈̂ 𝐵 �1 − 𝜆̂�𝑁� are independent Poisson distributions

with means equal to {𝜈𝐴 𝜆𝑁, 𝜈𝐵 (1 − 𝜆)𝑁}. 9 As a result,
                                                                   0

Next assume, without loss of generality, that 𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≥ 𝛾𝐴𝐵 and note that 𝜆 < 1. Thus,

We now turn to the first term in Equation (2). For simplicity of notation let us define

Thus we have the result of Equation (A1).

Recall that the 𝑃𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝜆̂ = 𝜆, 𝑃𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝜈̂𝐴 𝜆̂ = 𝜈𝐴 𝜆 and 𝑃𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝜈̂ 𝐵 �1 − 𝜆̂� = 𝜈𝐵 (1 − 𝜆). This fact,

combined with the result that the second term of Equation (2) converges to zero, implies that,

conditional on 𝜈̂𝐴 𝜆̂𝑁 + 𝜈̂ 𝐵 �1 − 𝜆̂�𝑁 > 0, in the limit Equation (2) collapses to

Finally, recalling that in equilibrium individuals use a threshold voting strategy, the probability

𝜈𝑃 that a member of the generic party 𝑃 votes is equal to 𝐹𝑃 (𝑐𝑃∗ ). Hence, we can re-write the

limiting benefit for 𝐴-members as

The limiting benefit for 𝐵-members can be calculated in an analogous way and is equal to

This implies that, in equilibrium, we have

Suppose Γ𝐴 , Γ𝐵 > 0. We are going to show that equilibrium turnout is bounded away from zero.

Notice first that, by definition,

Therefore, from equations (A4) and (A5) we know that, in equilibrium, the following holds

From (A6) it follows that 𝜕𝑐𝐴∗ > 0 and, as a consequence, there exists a function 𝜙 such that

𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝜙(𝑐𝐴∗ ) and      ∗     > 0. Moreover, 𝐹𝐵 �𝜙(𝑐𝐴∗ )� → 0 when 𝑐𝐴∗ → 𝑐𝐴 .
                     𝜕𝑐𝐴


Suppose that 𝑐𝐴∗ → 𝑐𝐴 when 𝑁 → ∞. This implies that, at the limit, the benefit from voting for an

𝐴-member is less than or equal to 𝑐𝐴 . Notice from (A2) that, since 𝐺 ′ (∙) is finite and strictly
                                                                  ∗                                                        ∗

𝑐𝐵 as 𝑐𝐴∗ goes to 𝑐𝐴, it must be the case that:

Working with Equation (A3), by similar logic, as 𝑐𝐴∗ goes to 𝑐𝐴 the benefit from voting for a B-

member tends to:
                                                   ∗)
                                              𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴           𝜆
                                                         2         Γ 𝐺 ′ (∙).

                                       �𝐹𝐵 �𝜙�𝑐𝐴


Note that, if the condition outlined in (A7) holds, it must be the case that 𝐹𝐵 �𝜙(𝑐𝐴∗ )� goes to zero

faster than 𝐹𝐴 (𝑐𝐴∗ ). However, this implies that expression (A8) tends to infinity and thus each 𝐵-

supporter votes in equilibrium. Analogously, it can be shown that if 𝑐𝐵∗ → 𝑐𝐵 then the benefit

from voting for an 𝐴-member tends to infinity, proving that turnout is bounded away from zero

in equilibrium. Moreover, notice from (A6) that if 𝑐𝐵∗ > 𝑐𝐵 then 𝑐𝐴∗ > 𝑐𝐴 , and vice versa, which

means that in equilibrium turnout is positive for both parties.

Finally, suppose Γ𝑃 = 0. In this case, the limiting benefit from voting for a member of party 𝑃 is

equal to zero, which means that 𝑐𝑃∗ cannot be greater than 𝑐𝑃 when 𝑁 → ∞. This in turns implies

that the benefit from voting for a member of party 𝑃 tends to zero, even if Γ𝑃 > 0, and as a

consequence 𝑐𝑃∗ → 𝑐𝑃 . Therefore, unless both Γ𝐴 and Γ𝐵 are strictly positive, equilibrium turnout

                                          1                  1
is either zero, if Γ𝐴 = Γ𝐵 = 0, 𝑐𝐴 ≥ 2 and 𝑐𝐵 ≥ 2, or converges to zero otherwise. ∎

Proof of Proposition 5

Given Proposition 3, we know that, by continuity, there must exist at least one value 𝜆̃ such that

𝑐𝐴∗ �𝜆̃� = 𝑐𝐵∗ �𝜆̃�. Moreover, we know from Lemma 1 that

exists a unique 𝜆̃ such that 𝑐𝐴∗ �𝜆̃� = 𝑐𝐵∗ �𝜆̃�, 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) > 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆 < 𝜆̃ and 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) < 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆 > 𝜆̃.

𝑐𝐵∗ �𝜆 = 2�, meaning that 𝜆̃ > 2. ∎

Proof of Proposition 6

Consider first the case of Exclusive voters. Since 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 = 0, assuming 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵

implies 𝛾𝐴𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 . We know from Proposition 4 that in this case 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) = 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆. It follows
                1                 1                   1           1
that 𝜃𝐴∗ (𝜆) < 2 ∀𝜆 < 2 and 𝜃𝐴∗ (𝜆) > 2 ∀𝜆 > 2.

Consider now the case of Inclusive voters. From (A6) we know that

              𝜆𝑐𝐴∗ 𝐹(𝑐𝐴∗ )[𝜆𝛾𝐵𝐴 + (1 − 𝜆)𝛾𝐵𝐵 ] = (1 − 𝜆)𝑐𝐵∗ 𝐹(𝑐𝐵∗ )[𝜆𝛾𝐴𝐴 + (1 − 𝜆)𝛾𝐴𝐵 ].                   (A14)

Let us re-arrange 𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝐴𝐵 = 𝛾𝐵𝐴 + 𝛾𝐵𝐵 as 𝛾𝐴𝐴 − 𝛾𝐵𝐴 = 𝛾𝐵𝐵 − 𝛾𝐴𝐵 . As we are assuming 𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≥ 𝛾𝐵𝐴

                                                                                           1
and 𝛾𝐵𝐵 ≥ 𝛾𝐴𝐵 , this implies that 𝜆(𝛾𝐴𝐴 − 𝛾𝐵𝐴 ) ≤ (1 − 𝜆)(𝛾𝐵𝐵 − 𝛾𝐴𝐵 ) when 𝜆 < 2, while 𝜆(𝛾𝐴𝐴 −

                                                      1
𝛾𝐵𝐴 ) ≥ (1 − 𝜆)(𝛾𝐵𝐵 − 𝛾𝐴𝐵 ) when 𝜆 > 2. Re-arranging we have 𝜆𝛾𝐵𝐴 + (1 − 𝜆)𝛾𝐵𝐵 ≥ 𝜆𝛾𝐴𝐴 +

                      1                                                               1
(1 − 𝜆)𝛾𝐴𝐵 if 𝜆 < and 𝜆𝛾𝐵𝐴 + (1 − 𝜆)𝛾𝐵𝐵 ≤ 𝜆𝛾𝐴𝐴 + (1 − 𝜆)𝛾𝐴𝐵 for 𝜆 > . In addition, we know
                 2                                                 2

that 𝑐𝐴∗ > 𝑐𝐵∗ for 𝜆 < 2, while 𝑐𝐴∗ < 𝑐𝐵∗ when 𝜆 > 2. Hence, from (A14) we can conclude that

                                                  1                                            1
𝜆𝐹(𝑐𝐴∗ ) < (1 − 𝜆)𝐹(𝑐𝐵∗ ) when 𝜆 < 2 and 𝜆𝐹(𝑐𝐴∗ ) > (1 − 𝜆)𝐹(𝑐𝐵∗ ) when 𝜆 > 2. As a consequence

          1          1                        1           1
𝜃𝐴∗ (𝜆) < 2 ∀𝜆 < 2 and 𝜃𝐴∗ (𝜆) > 2 ∀𝜆 > 2.∎

We know from Proposition 4 that 𝑐𝐴∗ (𝜆) = 𝑐𝐵∗ (𝜆)∀𝜆. Together with Lemma 1, this implies that

Proof of Proposition 8

Consider a sequence 𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 ) such that all the properties of 𝐺(∙) hold for any 𝑚 and, moreover,

                                      1                                                1
𝐺𝑚 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) > 0 for 𝑧𝑃 < 2, 𝐺𝑚+1 (𝑧𝑃 ) < 𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 )∀𝑧𝑃 ∈ �0, 2� and

                                                            0    𝑖𝑓 𝑧𝑃 ∈ [0, 1⁄2)
                                            lim 𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 ) = � 1⁄2     𝑖𝑓 𝑧𝑃 = 1⁄2 .
                                            𝑚→∞
                                                            1     𝑖𝑓 𝑧𝑃 ∈ (1⁄2,1]

When 𝑚 → ∞, 𝐺𝑚 converges to a unit step function, thus representing majority rule.
                                             1                                                          1                                  1
Let us first focus on 𝑧𝑃 ∈ [0, 2). From lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 ) = 0 ∀𝑧𝑃 ∈ [0, 2) it follows that ∀𝑧𝑃 < 2,

                                                                           𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 +𝜇)−𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 )
given 𝜀 > 0, there exist 𝜇 > 0 and 𝑀 such that                                                   < 𝜀 ∀ 𝑚 > 𝑀. Since 𝐺𝑚 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) >
                                                                                   𝜇




                                                                                                                                           38
            1                        𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 +𝜇)−𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 )                                            1
0 for 𝑧𝑃 < 2, we know that                                    > 𝐺𝑚 ′ (𝑧𝑃 ). Hence, ∀𝑧𝑃 ∈ [0, 2), given 𝜀 > 0, there
                                             𝜇


exists 𝑀 such that 𝐺𝑚 ′ (𝑧𝑃 ) < 𝜀 ∀ 𝑚 > 𝑀.

                         1           1                                                  1                                1
Moreover, since 𝐺𝑚 �2� = 2 and lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 ) = 0 ∀𝑧𝑃 ∈ [0, 2) it also follows that ∀𝑧𝑃 < 2,

                                                                                    1           1
                                                                               𝐺𝑚 � �−𝐺𝑚 � −𝜎�
given 𝐾 arbitrarily large, there exist 𝜎 > 0 and 𝑀̇ such that                       2           2
                                                                                                    > 𝐾 ∀ 𝑚 > 𝑀̇. As
                                                                                            𝜎

                             1
𝐺𝑚 ′′ (𝑧𝑃 ) > 0 for 𝑧𝑃 < 2, this implies that, given 𝐾 arbitrarily large, there exists 𝑀̇ such that

      1−
𝐺𝑚 ′ �2 � > 𝐾 ∀ 𝑚 > 𝑀̇.

                                                  1                                         1
Since 𝐺𝑚 is symmetric around 𝑧𝑃 = 2 ∀ 𝑚, it follows that: ∀𝑧𝑃 ∈ (2 , 1], given 𝜀 > 0, there

exists 𝑀 such that 𝐺𝑚 ′ (𝑧𝑃 ) < 𝜀 ∀ 𝑚 > 𝑀; and, given 𝐾 arbitrarily large, there exists 𝑀̇ such that

      1+
𝐺𝑚 ′ �2 � > 𝐾 ∀ 𝑚 > 𝑀̇.

This proves that

                                                0                     𝑖𝑓 𝑧𝑃 ∈ [0, 1⁄2)
                                              ′
                             lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 (𝑧𝑃 ) = � ∞                         𝑖𝑓 𝑧𝑃 = 1⁄2 .                               (A17)
                                                 0                     𝑖𝑓 𝑧𝑃 ∈ (1⁄2,1]

From Proposition 6 we know that in equilibrium the share of the votes for the two parties will

                                 1                        1                                                 𝐹(𝑐 ∗ )𝜆
only be equal when 𝜆 = 2. Hence, if 𝜆 = 2, (A17) implies that lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 ′ �𝐹(𝑐 ∗ )𝜆+𝐹(𝑐
                                                                                     𝐴
                                                                                        ∗ )(1−𝜆)� =
                                                                                                        𝐴         𝐵

                        ∗
                    𝐹(𝑐𝐵  )(1−𝜆)
lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 ′ �      ∗         ∗ )(1−𝜆)    � = ∞ and, from Proposition 2 follows that, under majority rule,
                𝐹(𝑐𝐴 )𝜆+𝐹(𝑐𝐵

                                                      1
𝑐𝐴∗ = 𝑐𝐴 and 𝑐𝐵∗ = 𝑐𝐵 . Whenever 𝜆 ≠ 2, the equilibrium share of the votes for the two parties will

be different, and thus (A17) implies that

                       𝐹(𝑐 ∗ )𝜆                                        𝐹(𝑐𝐵∗
                                                                             )(1−𝜆)
lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 ′ �𝐹(𝑐 ∗ )𝜆+𝐹(𝑐
                       𝐴                       ′
                          ∗ )(1−𝜆)� = lim𝑚→∞ 𝐺𝑚 �                     ∗         ∗ )(1−𝜆)    � = 0. As a consequence,
                   𝐴         𝐵                                     𝐹(𝑐𝐴 )𝜆+𝐹(𝑐𝐵


Proposition 2 implies that, under majority rule, limiting turnout is equal to zero. ∎
