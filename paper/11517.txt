Regime-Switching Behavior of the Term Structure of Forward Markets

                                           ABSTRACT



This paper presents techniques for modelling and estimating the behavior of financial market price

or return differentials that follow non-linear regime-switching behaviour. The methodology to be

used here is estimation of variants of threshold autoregression (TAR) models. In the basic model the

differentials are random within a band defined by transactions costs and contract risk; they

occasionally jump outside the band, and then follow an autoregressive path back towards the band.

The principal reference is Tchernykh (1998). The application here is to deviations from covered

interest parity (CIP) between forward foreign exchange (FX) markets in Hong Kong and the

Philippines. We have observed that these deviations from the band follow irregular steps, rather than

single jumps. Therefore a Modified TAR model (MTAR) that allows for this behaviour is also

estimated. The estimation methodology is a regime-switching maximum likelihood procedure. The

estimates can provide indicators for policy-makers of the market's expectation of crisis, and could

also provide indicators for the private sector of convergence of deviations to their usual bands. The

TAR model has the potential to be applied to differentials between linked pairs of financial market
prices more generally.

  Regime-switching Behavior of the Term Structure of Forward Markets


                  Elena Tchernykh and William H. Branson




                                     Introduction


       The topic of this paper is modelling and estimating the time-series behavior of
deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) in spot and forward FX markets. We
study both spot-forward and forward-forward deviations. The latter are deviations
from CIP between different forward maturities. The analysis can give us a view of
deviations from CIP along the term structure of forwards.
       The literature on CIP deviations goes back at least to Keynes in the 1920s and
Paul Einzig in the 1930s and 60s. They intuitively described deviations from CIP as
random within a neutral band of returns defined by transactions costs and perhaps
default risk. Keynes speculated that the size of this band might be 50 basis points for
sterling. Later work by Branson (1969) and by Frenkel and Levich (1975) estimated
that this band might be as narrow as 25 basis points. Keynes and Einzig also described
CIP deviations as occasionally breaking out of the band, and then regressing back
toward the band over time.
       Deviations from the band present the market with an arbitrage opportunity, a
profitable transaction covered against forward exchange risk. This arbitrage is
“riskless” in the absence of default risk. Acting on this opportunity, the market drives
the deviation back toward the band. This movement may not be instantaneous and
complete due to heterogeneity both of information and default expectations. Thus the
deviation would regress toward the band over a period of time. This is the regression
mentioned by Keynes and Einzig, and it is the main subject of estimation here.
      This time-series behavior can be formally modelled as a threshold
autoregression process (TAR). The time series in question, here CIP deviations, is
stochastic within the neutral band defined by the thresholds, but autoregressive
outside them. The band could be asymmetric, if default risk differs depending on the
direction of the transactions. The speed of regression could also differ above and


                                                                                      2
below the band. Asymmetric bands were estimated in the US – Russian market by
Taylor and Tchernykh (2004), these are also evident in the time series data for Brazil
and Southeast Asian countries, and are observed here for Hong Kong and the
Philippines. The TAR model for time series originated with Howell Tong in 1978,
and has been applied to spot-forward CIP deviations more recently by Mark Taylor
and co-authors.
        In this paper, variants of TAR models are specified and estimated for forward-
forward deviations from CIP for Hong Kong and the Philippines. We focus on 3-6
month deviations. Tchernykh has already studied Russia [Tchernykh (1998), Taylor
and Tchernykh (2004)] and Brazil [Tchernykh (2002a)], and we are now further
studying recent Asia data.
        In addition to tranquil periods of normal functioning of the forward markets,
the Asian data as well as the data studied here include the relatively turbulent period
of the Asian crisis. For a macroeconomic overview of the causes of the crisis see, for
example, Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini (1999). During a crisis, new information
enters the markets sporadically as the authorities are seen to intervene and market
expectations become more volatile. As the CIP differentials widen, market
participants’ estimates of probabilities of default rise. Market participants understand
they are in a crisis, and this further increases the volatility of deviations. Thus during
the crisis period the thresholds of the TAR model may become econometrically
insignificant. We see this result in the data here.
        Deviations from CIP, and estimates of the TAR model, can be useful to
policy-makers and traders. Deviations tend to signal coming crises. This was clear in
the Russian data, and also appears in the Asian data. The TAR model estimates
provide measures of significant deviations from CIP before crises. These can be used
by policy-makers as signals of bubbles and coming crises. They can be used by
traders as the basis for trading rules for arbitrage.
        The paper is structured as follows. First, we specify spot-forward and forward-
forward deviations. Then we formulate the TAR model and estimators for the TAR
model. Next we formulate a modification of the TAR model (MTAR) which includes
the Poisson process as well as autoregression outside of the band. Finally, we present
the empirical results for the Hong Kong dollar and the Philippine peso.




                                                                                        3
                                    Spot-Forward CIP


       The covered interest parity (CIP) theorem for foreign exchange states that the
foreign exchange forward premium equals the interest rate differential between two
relevant currencies:


                        Fi   (1 + Ri )
                           =           .                                               (1)
                        S (1 + Ri * )


Here Fi represents the i-period forward exchange rate in terms of units of home

currency per unit of foreign exchange, S is the spot exchange rate, Ri is the domestic
                                *
i-period interest rate, and Ri is the foreign i-period interest rate. In log-linear form
the formula for CIP may be expressed as:


                        f i - s = ri - r *i                                            (2)


       If (2) does not hold, then it must be possible to arbitrage risklessly and profitably
from one of the currencies into the other. This arbitrage will ensure that equality (2)
holds. Equations (1) and (2) are “no arbitrage” conditions, as in Arbitrage Pricing
Theory (APT) more generally. Since the forward transaction eliminates any foreign
exchange risk exposure, any deviation from covered interest parity must either represent
market inefficiency or else a premium arising from perceived risk of default.




      Forward -Forward CIP: Extension of the Basic CIP Theory


       A more general form of covered interest arbitrage would involve arbitraging
along the term structure of forward differentials. For example, see Taylor and
Tchernykh (2004). For no arbitrage to be profitable, the following generalized CIP
condition must hold:




                                                                                          4
                       Fj        (1 + Rij )
                             =           *
                                              .                                        (3)
                        Fi       (1 + Rij )


Here Fi is the forward exchange rate for period i, and similarly Fj ; Rij is the

domestic forward interest rate, and Rij * is the foreign forward interest rate between

times i and j, i<j. This CIP relationship can also be approximated in log-linear form as


                        f j - f i = rij - r *ij .                                      (4)


       From equation (4), the generalized CIP condition, define the deviation from
CIP for arbitrage between maturities i and j, yt as


                       yt = ( f j - f i ) - (rij - rij *) .                            (5)


       Our empirical methodology involves estimating nonlinear time series models
for yt . In particular, we wish to estimate the boundaries of the neutral band within
which arbitrage does not take place, and the speed of mean reversion of deviations
from CIP outside of the neutral band.




                  Threshold Autoregression (TAR) Model


       The basic idea of the threshold model is a local approximation of differing
regimes over states, i.e. introduction of regimes via thresholds. The threshold
principle allows the analysis of a complex stochastic system by decomposing it into
simpler subsystems. Under the threshold principle, we may group a number of finite
parametric non-linear time series models - in our case, stochastic behaviour between
the thresholds and autoregressive outside the band - into one model to be estimated.
       As discussed above, a number of authors have suggested that time series for CIP
deviations may be characterised by threshold effects, such that arbitrage occurs mainly
once the size of the deviation has passed a certain level. This would suggest that CIP
deviations would be largely random in a certain neighbourhood, while deviations from


                                                                                         5
CIP outside of this range would not be immediately returned into the neutral band but
would instead show a statistical tendency to revert towards the band.
       The gradual return to the band could be based on at least two factors. First,
arbitrage between forward markets is less well established than spot-forward arbitrage.
So information here is likely to be particularly costly and imperfect, as shown in general
by Grossman and Stiglitz (1980). This would make information heterogeneous across
market participants. Second, the size of transactions needed for profitable arbitrage is
likely to be large. This could create differences in liquidity across participants.
Therefore, arbitrage will eliminate deviations only gradually.
       A parametric model which may capture this non-linear behaviour - and which
nests both instantaneous and slower mean-reversion towards the band - is the threshold
autoregressive (TAR) model (Tong, 1978, 1983; Granger and Teräsvirta, 1993), which
can be extended following the work of Taylor and Peel (1998) to allow for asymmetry in
the neutral band. A TAR model for deviations from covered interest parity, y t , can be
written:


           y t +1 = y t + ε 1,t +1                                           if y t < κ 1 and y t > κ 2       (6.1)

           y t +1 = κ 1 (1 − β 1 ) + β1 y t + ε 2,t +1                       if y t ≥ κ 1 ,                   (6.2)

           y t +1 = κ 2 (1 − β 2 ) + β 2 y t + ε 2,t +1                      if y t ≤ κ 2 ,                   (6.3)




where εit ~ N (0, σ i2 ) , i=1,2. Here (κ2, κ1) are the upper and lower thresholds of the

band, and β i ∈(0,1) are the autoregressive parameters. The speed of mean-reversion is

determined by β i .

       The model of equations (6) can be estimated using a grid search over (κ2, κ1).
This procedure will yield estimates of the parameters (κ2, κ1) that maximize the log-
likelihood function:


                                     L( β1 , β 2 , σ 12 , σ 22 , κ 1 , κ 2 ) =

           − 12            [ln(σ 12 ) + ε 12,t +1 / σ 12 ] − 12            [ln(σ 22 ) + ε 22,t +1 / σ 22 ].     (7)
                  yt ∈(κ 2 ,κ1 )                                  yt ∉(κ 2 ,κ1 )




                                                                                                                      6
         If there are not enough observations with deviations below the lower threshold,
we estimate the upper threshold as follows:


          y t +1 = y t + ε 1,t +1                                        if y t < κ 1 ,                  (8.1)

          y t +1 = κ 1 (1 − β ) + βy t + ε 2,t +1                        if y t ≥ κ 1 ,                  (8.2)


where ε i ,t +1 ~ N (0, σ i2 ) i=1,2, and β ∈(0,1). The likelihood function then takes the

form:


                                  L( β , σ 12 , σ 22 , κ 1 ) =

         − 12        [ln(σ 12 ) + ε 12,t +1 / σ 12 ] − 12            [ln(σ 22 ) + ε 22,t +1 / σ 22 ] ,    (9)
                yt <κ1                                      yt ≥κ1




and estimation may proceed as before. Estimation of model (6) or (8) using the
likelihood function (7) or (9) yields the maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters
β , σ 12 , σ 22 , and κ .




                                        Modified TAR (MTAR) Model


         The data from Asia shown in Tchernykh (2004), and for the Philippines below,
show that deviations from CIP frequently occur in irregular steps, not single jumps as
assumed by the classical TAR model. The number and magnitude of these steps differ
substantially across episodes. Including these data points in estimation of the classical
TAR model would put an upward bias in the estimates of the β parameter for the speed
of autoregression. These movements reflect a jump process involving information lags.
         We will proceed to estimate a Modified TAR model, the MTAR model, to
identify the point at which the autoregression takes hold, and then to re-estimate the
autoregression. This modification uses the data points in the jumps in the deviations in
identifying that point. Consider the state where y t ≥ κ 1 . Let us define the starting an

and ending bn points for each period n (n=1,…,N) of movement of y t above k1 for

any y t from the state y t ≥ κ 1 , and a n < t < bn . Than for each interval [an , bn ] ,


                                                                                                             7
t n ∈ [a n , bn ] , we can find a maximum tn, max , such that yt n ,max = max ( yt ) ,
                                                                                                     [ a n , bn ]


an < tn , max < bn , ya n = ybn = k1 .

         We define the domain of the deviations outside of the thresholds as


                                             N
                                    Ω ={           [a n , bn ]} ,                                                   (10)
                                            n =1




the domain of the jump process as


                                            N
                                    Ρ ={           [an , t n ,max ]} ,                                              (11)
                                           n=1




and the domain of the autoregressive process as


                                             N
                                    Α ={           [t n,max , bn ]} .                                               (12)
                                            n =1




         The asymmetric MTAR model can be written as follows.


         y t +1 = y t + ε 1,t +1                                            if y t < κ 1 ,                          (13.1)

         y t +1 = κ 1 (1 − β ) + βy t + ε 2,t +1                            if t ∈ Α .                              (13.2)


The likelihood function for the asymmetric MTAR model would be:


                                    L( β , σ 12 , σ 22 , κ 1 ) =

         − 12        [ln(σ 12 ) + ε 12,t +1 / σ 12 ] − 12                I (t ) [ln(σ 22 ) + ε 22,t +1 / σ 22 ] ,    (14)
                yt <κ1                                       yt ≥κ1 , t∈Ω




where
                                    1, if t ∈ Α
                         I (t ) =                      .
                                    0, if t ∈ Ρ




                                                                                                                           8
        Given the model (13.1), (13.2) and the likelihood function (14), estimation can
proceed as described earlier. However, the likelihood function (14) and the resulting
estimates are conditional on identification of the domain Ρ of the jump process (11).
Our interest here is the estimation of the regression parameter β and the associated
times of mean reversion. Re-estimation of the MTAR will not affect the parameter
estimates conditional on the identification of the domain of the jump process.
        Below we present the estimates of the MTAR and TAR models for Hong Kong
and the MTAR model for the Philippines. The TAR estimates for the Philippines were
presented earlier in Tchernykh (2002b). In the application to the data for the Hong Kong
3-6 month CIP differentials we compare results of the classical TAR and global AR
using Monte Carlo likelihood ratio tests to confirm the significance of the estimates, as
described below. We then compare the MTAR and TAR estimates of the autoregression
parameters.
        The maximum-likelihood estimates of the TAR parameters can be tested against
the null hypothesis of simple AR(1) mean reversion or zero bandwidth, κ1=κ2, by
estimating the restricted AR(1) model and applying a likelihood ratio test. In this case,
the test likelihood ratio statistic is twice the difference between the value of the
likelihood function for the AR(1) model and the maximized value of the likelihood
function for the TAR model.
        Under the null hypothesis, the thresholds are not identified, so the likelihood
                                                2
ratio statistic will not follow a standard      . Therefore, we estimated the empirical
marginal significance level of the likelihood ratio statistics through Monte Carlo
simulation following a standard procedure. The restricted AR(1) model was estimated
using the actual data. The resulting AR(1) parameter estimates were used to calibrate an
artificial AR(1) data generating process with Gaussian errors. Five thousand artificial
data sets equal in length to the actual data set were generated using this process. The
TAR and the AR(1) models were estimated, and the resulting 5000 values of the
likelihood ratio statistic were taken as the empirical distribution of the statistic under the
null hypothesis.
        In the empirical results reported below, if the maximized likelihood statistic is
significant at the 95 percent confidence level, the null of AR(1) is rejected and the TAR
estimates are said to be confirmed. If the maximized statistic is not significant, the AR(1)




                                                                                            9
null is not rejected and the estimates are not confirmed. In either case, the autoregression
parameters are re-estimated using MTAR.




                  Empirical Results: Hong Kong and the Philippines


       In this section we present estimates of MTAR and TAR models for deviations
from CIP in the 3 - 6 month forward markets for Hong Kong and the Philippines on
daily data for the period 1994-2002. The Hong Kong markets are more developed and
stable than those in the Philippines, so estimation on these two can provide a test of the
applicability of the models across levels of institutional development. This time period
also spans the period of the Asian currency crises. Thus it permits us to examine the
behaviour of the data and the applicability of the models across tranquil and crisis
periods. These periods are evident in the data shown in Graphs 1 and 5.
       We expect variants of the TAR model with well-estimated thresholds to hold
during tranquil periods, but not during crises. During a tranquil period the flow of
information to the markets and market participants’ estimates of the probabilities of
default are likely to be relatively homogeneous, thus we expect deviations to be mainly
within the neutral band. Occasionally an unanticipated event will send the deviation
outside the band, and arbitrage will bring it back. During these episodes we can observe
regime-switching behaviour, and it should be possible to estimate a TAR or MTAR
model with results that are significant and economically meaningful. These would be
confirmed by the Monte Carlo likelihood test.
       During a crisis period the flow of information is likely to become irregular, as the
market adjusts expectations to rapidly and substantially changing events. These could
include unusually large or unanticipated changes in interest rates or exchange market
intervention by the authorities. Market participants could begin to base their expectations
on their own perceptions of other participants’ expectations. In this case, estimates of the
probabilities of default could also begin to fluctuate widely. During these periods we
expect to see wide and random fluctuations in CIP deviations. In this case, the thresholds
of the TAR model disappear, and the estimation results should become insignificant.
These would be not confirmed by the Monte Carlo test. We see these differences in the
estimates presented here.



                                                                                         10
        As the markets approach a crisis, we expect that they enter a state of transition
from TAR behaviour to crisis behaviour. During such a transition, deviations are likely
to grow, and TAR behaviour is likely to weaken. We also see this transition in the data
here, and earlier in Tchernykh (2002b) for a wider range of Asian countries.


Hong Kong
        The data on the 3-month – 6-month CIP deviations, defined in equation (5)
above, for the Hong Kong dollar – US dollar rates are shown in Graph 1. These are daily
data for the period January 1994 through September 2002, taken from Bloomberg. The
data have been matched for gaps and differing holidays to provide a full and consistent
data set. In the chart a positive deviation means the 6-month forward exceeded the 3-
month by more than the corresponding interest differential. This implies that arbitrage
could be profitable buying 3-month forward and selling 6 month. A negative differential
would imply the opposite arbitrage; thus large differentials indicate failures of arbitrage
to maintain CIP.
        The Hong Kong data of Graph 1 can be divided into three distinct periods, as
suggested above. These are shown in Graphs 2, 3, and 4. The period from January 1994
to July 1997 seems to exhibit TAR behavior with an occasional downward spike. For
example, in early 1995 the differential jumped to nearly 0.005, and then reverted to what
appears to be a normal range of fluctuation. The data up to July 1997 show occasional
short periods of noise and longer periods of what seems to be TAR behavior.
        The second period runs from July 1997 to April 2000. With the beginning of the
Asian crisis, deviations grew distinctly larger. From late 1997 to late 1998, they
remained in the range 0.005-0.025. Both the mean and the variance of the data increased
sharply during the crisis period.
        The last period runs from March 2000 to August 2002, after the crisis. This is a
tranquil period. We do see below that estimates of a TAR model are confirmed for this
period. For each of these three periods, we also estimate the MTAR model, and compare
the results with a TAR model. Estimation was performed using several different
algorithms. The Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was most
stable in terms of convergence, so it is used in all the estimates presented here. We begin
by presenting the results from estimation of MTAR for each period.
        The estimation results are presented in a standard format for Hong Kong and
later for the Philippines. Each graph has two panels. The first panel displays the


                                                                                        11
movements of the deviations for the period. The second panel for Hong Kong gives a
summary of the MTAR and the original TAR estimates for behaviour above the
estimated threshold. The second panel for the Philippines shows only the MTAR
estimates. The original TAR estimates for the Philippines are presented in Tchernykh
(2002b). The tables in the middle panels show the estimated upper threshold for
deviations and the estimated value of autoregressive parameter β . The TAR and MTAR
models both assume that the autoregression coefficient β will be between 0 and 1.
Therefore, two t-statistics are presented for β . The first, t-stat(0), is the usual test of
β >0. The t-stat(1) is the test of β <1. This is constructed as (1 − β ) / SE ( β ) . We will
use both t-statistics in evaluating the β estimates. Both of these are significant at the 95
percent confidence level in all of the estimates reported here.
        The results for the first period in the Hong Kong data are shown in Graph 2. The
data in the top panel seem to show TAR behaviour. The results in the second panel first
show the estimation of only an upper threshold, here 0.0007. This means that much of
the data before middle 1994 and after January 1995 are above the threshold. The MTAR
estimate of β is 0.879, with a t-statistic for the comparison to zero of 31.8. The estimate
of (1 − β ) is 0.121, with a t-statistic of 4.38. The β estimate implies a half-life of the
deviations of 5.4 days, and 23 days to eliminate 95 percent of a deviation. Compared to
MTAR, the TAR estimate of β is larger, as expected, and the half-life and 95 percent
return times are longer. The distribution of the Monte Carlo likelihood ratios and the
maximized likelihood ratio for the TAR estimates were far above zero, confirming the
results at the 95 percent confidence level.
        Graph 3 shows the results for the crisis period. They are dominated by the two
main periods of crisis. The Monte Carlo test did not confirm the TAR estimates for this
period, that is the AR(1) restriction was not binding. The MTAR provides an estimate of
the autoregression parameter in (13.2) for the domain Α defined earlier in (12). This β
estimate is 0.90 with a t-statistic of 19.7; the t-statistic for (1 − β ) is 2.2. This value of β
gives a half-life of 6.5 days, and a 95 percent recovery time of 27.9 days.
        The results for the final period are shown in Graph 4. In the top panel we see a
period of negative deviations from July 2000 - March 2001. The MTAR β estimate is a
high 0.91, but it has a t-statistic for (1 − β ) of 5.04. It has a half-life of 7.3 days and a 95
percent return time of 31.6 days. The β estimate, half-life, and return time for TAR are



                                                                                              12
even larger. The deviations in the top panel are small, but persistent, consistent with high
estimates of β . The Monte Carlo test confirmed the TAR estimates. Thus during the
tranquil period after the crisis, the deviations in the Hong Kong data are small, but they
do follow an MTAR process. They are also persistent, with fairly high values for β .
        The MTAR estimates are compared with TAR estimates for the same three
periods in the second panels of Graphs 2 - 4. The comparisons use the MTAR estimate
for the threshold, so the β estimates are comparable. In the first and last periods where
the TAR is confirmed by the Monte Carlo test, the MTAR provides a lower estimate of
β and, therefore, faster convergence. In the crisis period the thresholds are not
significant, so the comparison is irrelevant. Thus the comparisons support the superiority
of the MTAR model in the Hong Kong data.


The Philippines
        The Philippine data are shown in Graph 5. These data show four distinct regimes
of behaviour. The first is the period before the Asian crisis broke out, from August 1994
to June 1997. The second is the period of the crisis, from June 1997 to the end of April
1999. The third is the period from May 1999 to the end of August 2000. This is noisier
than the first period. The fourth is the period from September 2000 to the end of March
2002. This seems to contain another crisis at the beginning, but possibly TAR behaviour
after that.
        The MTAR model has been estimated for each of these sub-periods, and the
results are presented in Graphs 6 - 9, following the same format as the Hong Kong
presentation. We begin the discussion of the results with Graph 6 for the first period. We
will discuss these in some detail, and then summarize the rest of the results, since they
follow the same format. The table in the second panel gives the results of the MTAR
estimation for the period. An upper threshold of 0.017 percent is estimated; it can be
located on the graph above. The estimate of β is a high 0.935, with a t-statistic of 40.96.
The t-statistic for (1 − β ) is 2.84, so β is less than unity. The β estimate gives a half-
life of reversion of 10.3 days, with 44.6 days required to eliminate 95 percent of the
deviation above the threshold. Thus the data in this period do follow an MTAR process,
but with very slow reversion to the threshold. The Monte Carlo results did confirm the
earlier estimates of the TAR model, so it appears that the MTAR performs better than
the earlier TAR for this period.


                                                                                         13
        The results for the second period, beginning with the Asian crisis, are
summarized in Graph 7. The Monte Carlo test did not confirm the earlier TAR estimates
for this period. The MTAR estimates of the autoregression parameter β in (13.2) in the
domain Α defined in (12) is 0.83, with a t-statistic of 38.5. The t-statistic for (1 − β ) is
7.18. This value of β gives a half-life of 3.76 days and a 95 percent return time of 16.25
days.
        The results for the third period are shown in Graph 8. There the threshold is
0.012, with several episodes of deviation above it. The estimate of β is 0.87, with a t-
statistic of 31.0. The t-statistic for (1 − β ) is 4.62. The half-life is 5 days and the 95
percent return time is 21.6 days. The Monte Carlo test confirmed the earlier TAR
estimates.
        The results for the fourth period in Graph 9 have a threshold of 0.024, and a
much lower β of 0.63. The t-statistic for β is 11.2, and the t-statistic for (1 − β ) is 6.5.
This value for β gives a half-life of 1.5 days and a 95 percent return time of 6.55 days.
The Monte Carlo test confirmed the earlier TAR estimates for this period.
        The Philippine results did not confirm the TAR estimates for the second (crisis)
period, as expected. The MTAR estimate of β for the first period was a high 0.93. The
MTAR β estimates for the third and fourth periods were 0.87 and 0.63, respectively.
These give more plausible return times. With shorter times in the later periods, it is likely
that the market became more efficient over time in arbitraging deviations in the
Philippine peso.



                                        Conclusion

        This paper has reported estimates of a TAR and a modified TAR model on the
data for 3-6 month forward-forward deviations from CIP for the Hong Kong dollar
and the Philippine peso on daily data from 1994 to 2002. The TAR model is
confirmed by a Monte Carlo test for all parts of the data except the Asian crisis period
of 1997-1999. The MTAR model provides lower estimates of the autoregression
parameters and shorter return times in all cases where the TAR estimates were
confirmed.
        Earlier work on CIP deviations, for example Taylor and Peel (1998) and
Tchernykh (1998), used the classical TAR model that was developed by Tong (1978).


                                                                                          14
That model assumed that the CIP deviations appear as a leap outside a threshold, and
then a regression back to the threshold. In the earlier review of the Asian data on CIP
deviations [Tchernykh (2002b)] it was observed that deviations frequently develop as
a series of jumps to a peak, and then the regression begins. Inclusion of these series of
jumps in the estimation biases the estimate of the autoregression coefficient β
upward. To eliminate this bias, we developed the modified TAR (MTAR) model that
eliminates the jump data from estimation of β . This model was used in estimation on
the Hong Kong and the Philippine data.
       The estimation of the TAR model on the Hong Kong and Philippine data was
confirmed for periods before and after the Asian crisis. The MTAR and classical
TAR were compared on the Hong Kong data, confirming the bias in the estimate of
 β using the classical TAR model. The Philippine data are much noisier, and show a
wider range of regimes. There the β estimates for the non-crisis periods ranged from
0.93 to 0.62. Thus the parameters of the MTAR models vary substantially across
regimes. The MTAR for the Philippine data perform better the earlier TAR estimates.
       The data on deviations from CIP in Hong Kong and the Philippines show large
deviations before and during crises. Since these are 3-6 month forward-forward
deviations, this implies that the spot-forward deviations get larger, the longer their
maturities. This suggests that deviations from CIP, and estimates of the MTAR
model, can be useful to policy-makers. These can be used by policy-makers as signals
of bubbles and coming crises. These signals can lead policy-makers to inject liquidity
into the market to prevent a coming crisis, or to allow the exchange rate to move as
underlying policy changes are undertaken. They can be used by traders as the basis
for trading rules for arbitrage when they have sufficient liquidity and secure
counterparties. Both of these activities should work to close the deviations.
