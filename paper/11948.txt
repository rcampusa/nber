                                           ABSTRACT

Published macroeconomic data traditionally exclude most intangible investment from measured

GDP. This situation is beginning to change, but our estimates suggest that as much as $800 billion

is still excluded from U.S. published data (as of 2003), and that this leads to the exclusion of more

than $3 trillion of business intangible capital stock. To assess the importance of this omission, we

add capital to the standard sources-of-growth framework used by the BLS, and find that the inclusion

of our list of intangible assets makes a significant difference in the observed patterns of U.S.

economic growth. The rate of change of output per worker increases more rapidly when intangibles

are counted as capital, and capital deepening becomes the unambiguously dominant source of growth

in labor productivity. The role of multifactor productivity is correspondingly diminished, and labor's

income share is found to have decreased significantly over the last 50 years.

        The revolution in information technology is apparent in the profusion of new products

available in the market place (goods with the acronyms PCs, PDAs, ATMs, wi-fi), as well as

items like the internet, cell phones, and e-mail. These innovations are part of a broader

technological revolution based on the discovery of the semiconductor, often called the “IT

revolution.” However, while its effects are apparent in the market place, its manifestation in the

macroeconomic statistics on growth has been slow to materialize. Writing in 1987, Robert

Solow, famously remarked that “you see the computer revolution everywhere except in the

productivity data.” Some ten years later, Alan Greenspan observed that the negative trends in

measured productivity observed in many services industries seemed inconsistent with the fact

that they ranked among the top computer-using industries.1 Greenspan also questioned the

accuracy of the consumer price index, in part because of its failure to adequately account for the

new or superior goods made possible by the IT revolution.2

        The IT revolution began to appear in the productivity data mentioned by Solow in the

mid 1990s. This pick-up has been linked to investment in IT capital in a series of papers (Oliner

and Sichel (2000, 2002), Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000), Stiroh (2002), and Jorgenson, Ho, and

Stiroh (2002)), all of which estimate the contribution of IT capital to output growth within the

   Chairman Greenspan’s concerns about the measured productivity trends in services industries were first
expressed in remarks at an FOMC meeting in late 1996 in regard to a staff analysis of disaggregated
productivity trends (Corrado and Slifman 1999). Gullickson and Harper (1999) also investigated this
issue. The observation that many of the services industries that had negative productivity trends were
among the top computer-using industries owes, at least in part, to Stiroh (1998) and Triplett (1999).
2
   Similar views were expressed by Nordhaus (1997), who concluded from his analysis of the history of
lighting that official price and output data “miss the most important technological revolutions in history.”
Also, Hausman (1999) noted that cell phones were absent from the CPI market basket for many years
after they appeared in the market place.

Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches sources-of-growth (SOG) framework. However, the productivity

pick-up did not remove all suspicion about the ability of official data to accurately capture the

factors that affect U.S. economic growth. Both firm-level and national income accounting

practice has historically treated expenditure on intangible inputs as an intermediate expense and

not as an investment that is part of GDP, although this has begun to change with the

capitalization of software in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).3 The

capitalization of software alone has had an appreciable affect on the growth of output per worker

in the non-farm business sector, and the growing literature on intangibles suggests that this is just

the tip of the iceberg.4

        Our own earlier estimates suggest that, in 1999, software spending was less than

15 percent of a more complete list of intangible business investments that includes spending on

innovative property (eg., R&D) and economic competencies as well as software and other

computerized information (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel 2005, hereafter CHS). We found that

total business investment in intangibles was approximately one trillion dollars in 1999, an

amount that is roughly the same as investment in tangible capital at that time. The magnitude of

these estimates suggests that uncounted intangibles have an appreciable effect on the level of

GDP, as well as on the rate of investment and level of labor productivity. This paper builds on

   In addition to the capitalization of software expenditures by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
the capitalization of scientific R&D is under serious consideration for both the U.S. NIPA and the United
Nations System of National Accounts. See Grimm, Moulton, and Wasshausen (2005) for a description of
BEA’s procedures for estimating software.

   The recent literature includes work sponsored by the OECD (OECD Secretariat 1998, Kahn 2001),

2000, 2001a, 2001b; McGratten and Prescott 2000, Lev 2001. This literature approaches the intangibles
problem from a variety of perspectives, building upon previous work that both linked aggregate
productivity and stock market performance (e.g., Baily 1981, B. Hall and R. Hall 1993) and constructed
firm-level intangible stocks using financial data (e.g., Griliches 1981, Cockburn and Griliches 1988, and
B. Hall 1993).

our previous work by examining whether the relative magnitude of the discrepancy in the level

of investment carries over to the rates of growth of capital stock and real output. Our ultimate

objective is to examine how the capitalization of intangible expenditures affects the SOG

analyses that have played such a prominent role in recent analyses of the productivity pick-up.

       We use our new SOG estimates to address the following issues: how much growth in

output went uncounted because of the omission of intangibles; what is the contribution of

intangible capital to output growth; how does the inclusion of intangibles affect the allocation of

output growth between capital formation and multifactor productivity growth; and, does the post-

1995 productivity pickup look different when intangibles are taken into account? To our

knowledge, this is the first paper to examine these issues in the SOG framework with a more-or-

less complete list of intangible assets. We find that the inclusion of intangibles makes a

significant difference in the measured pattern of economic growth: the growth rates of output

and of output-per worker are found to increase at a noticeably more rapid rate when intangibles

are included than under the baseline case in which intangible capital is completely ignored, and

capital deepening (when expanded to include both tangibles and intangibles) becomes the

unambiguously dominant source of growth in labor productivity. More broadly, the factors

typically associated with the growth of the “knowledge economy” assume a greater importance

once intangibles are included.

       We also find that the inclusion of intangibles has an important effect on the labor share of

income. Specifically, in our framework, labor’s share of income is lower than implied by

conventional NIPA data, and it trends down notably over time. The addition of intangible capital

and the associated flow of income from that capital raise the capital share of income and lower


                                                 3
the labor share. Moreover, our numbers indicate that intangible investment has grown

considerably more rapidly in recent decades than has tangible business investment, and the stock

of intangible capital has grown considerably more rapidly than has the stock of tangible business

capital. Thus, once intangible assets are incorporated into the calculations, the share of capital

income shows a noticeable uptrend in recent decades, and the share of labor income shows a

marked downtrend, particularly since 1980.

       The paper is organized as follows: We first examine the theoretical basis for the claim

that intangibles should be treated as capital rather than as intermediate inputs. We then describe

how intangible capital, which is often viewed as qualitatively different from tangible capital, can

be incorporated in the neoclassical framework on which the sources-of-growth model is based.

Our procedures for estimating the flow of intangible investment and the corresponding stock of

intangible capital are then discussed, after which our growth accounting results are presented and

discussed.

                               II. Are Intangibles Really Capital?

                       A. The Treatment of Intangible Expenditures

       The first question to be settled is theoretical: should intangible expenditures be classified

as capital or as an intermediate good? The choice between the two alternatives becomes more

apparent when the production functions and accounting identities associated with the two

approaches are made explicit. This can be accomplished by considering a world of three goods,

consumption C, tangible investment goods I, and an intangible N. When intangibles are

regarded as being an intermediate good, labor L and tangible capital K are allocated to the




                                                  4
production of all three goods, and N is an input to C and I. The production function and flow

account for each of the three sectors is then



(1a)     N(t) = FN(LN(t),KN(t), t);             PN(t)N(t) = PL(t)LN(t) + PK(t)KN(t);

(1b)     I(t)   = FI(LI(t),KI(t),NI(t), t);    PI(t)I(t)     = PL(t)LI(t) + PK(t)KI(t) + PN(t)NI(t);

(1c)     C(t) = FC(LC(t),KC(t),NC(t), t);       PC(t)C(t) = PL(t)LC(t) + PK(t)KC(t) + PN(t)NC(t);



with the adding up conditions L = LN + LI + LC, K = KN + KI + KC, and N = NI + NC , as well as
                                                             5
the accumulation equation K(t) = I(t) + (1-      K)K(t-1).       The production functions in each

equation are linked to the accounting identities by the assumption that each input is paid the

value of its marginal product. In this formulation, N(t) is both an output and an immediate input

to the production of the other products, and therefore nets out in the aggregate. Thus, N(t) does

not appear in the GDP identity, which has the form



(1d)     PQ’(t)Q’(t) = PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t) = PL(t)L(t) + PK(t)K(t).



This is the approach taken by financial accounts for individual firms, the United Nation’s System

of National Accounts (1993), and, until the recent move to capitalize software, the U.S. NIPAs.

In equation (1d), the apostrophes on the left-hand side of the equation are used to distinguish the


5
   We adopt the convention that intermediates used by the industry that produced them are netted out of
final output. We have therefore omitted NN from the production function and accounts of the
intermediate good industry. We also ignore the complication of chain weighting to keep the exposition
simple.
                                                    5
case in which intangibles are excluded from the case described below in which intangibles are

counted as investment.

        A different model of production accounting applies when the intangible is classified as

capital. The output of the intangible, N(t), now appears in the production functions of the

consumption and tangible investment sectors as a cumulative stock, not as a contemporaneous

input as above. An accumulation equation for intangible capital, R(t) = N(t) + (1- R)R(t-1),

parallels the corresponding equation for tangibles. The sectoral equations become



(2a)     N(t) = FN(LN(t),KN(t),RN(t),t);        PN(t)N(t) = PL(t)LN(t) + PK(t)KN(t) + PR(t)RN(t);

(2b)     I(t)   = FI(LI(t),KI(t),RI(t),t);       PI(t)I(t)   = PL(t)LI(t) + PK(t)KI(t) + PR(t)RI(t);

(2c)     C(t) = FC(LC(t),KC(t),RC(t),t);        PC(t)C(t) = PL(t)LC(t) + PK(t)KC(t) + PR(t)RC(t);



The balance equations set out above are modified to replace the equation N = NN + NI + NC with

R = RI + RC +RN.6 Again, the production functions in each equation are linked to the accounting

identities by the assumption of marginal productivity pricing. The GDP identity, in this case,




6
  In this second formulation we expand the technology of the intangible producing sector to use the
output that it produced in previous years (that is, to use its own stock of accumulated intangibles). In
other words, the knowledge investments of past years are allowed to be productive in producing current
and future knowledge. This allows investment to be aimed not just at direct product or process
innovation, but also at furthering the capability of the innovation process itself. Indeed, this is a key
aspect of the R&D process, because research often is done to further the research capability of R&D
researchers. Moreover, some firms continue to do research even when a competitor has beat them to the
punch, in order to keep up with best practice and perhaps get out in front in the next round. This line of
reasoning does not fit well with the preceding formulation (1a)-(1d) in which the accumulated stock of
past knowledge is treated as an intermediate input and omitted from the technology for producing
knowledge.
                                                     6
must be expanded to included the flow of new intangibles on the product side and the flow of

services from the intangible stock on the income side:



(2d)       PQ(t)Q(t) = PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t) + PN(t)N(t) = PL(t)L(t) + PK(t)K(t) + PR(t)R(t).



The price PR(t) is the user cost associated with the services of the intangible stock and is a source

of income that is absent from the conventional intermediate goods case (1d). The concept of

GDP in this expanded identity is more comprehensive and larger in magnitude than in the

conventional case.

                       B. Growth Accounting with Intangible Capital

       The conventional SOG framework allocates the growth rate of output to the share-

weighted growth rates of the inputs plus a residual. Following Solow (1957), the SOG equation

is derived from the conventional framework of equations (1a)-(1d) by logarithmic differentiation

of (1d):

               (1e)      gQ’(t) = s’C(t)gC(t) + s’I(t)gI(t)

                               = s’L(t)gL(t) + s’K(t)gK(t) + gA’(t).



The notation gX(t) is used to denote the rate of growth of the respective variables; for example,

gQ’(t) thus denotes the growth rate of aggregate output (the Divisia index of the growth rates of

consumption, gC(t), and investment, gI(t)), and gA’(t) denotes the growth rate of multifactor

productivity. The output shares s’C(t) = [PC(t)C(t)]/[PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t)], etc., and input shares

s’L(t) = [PL(t)L(t)]/[PL(t)L(t) + PK(t)K(t)], etc., are assumed to be equal to the corresponding

                                                  7
output elasticities. Intangible input and output play no role in the formulation of this SOG

equation.

       When intangible capital is treated symmetrically with tangibles, the structure (2a)-(2d)

governs the equations of growth, and the SOG model becomes



              (2e)         gQ(t) = sC(t)gC(t) + sI(t)gI(t) + sN(t)gN(t)

                                = sL(t)gL(t) + sK(t)gK(t) + sR(t)gR(t) + gA(t),



where the output shares are now sC(t) = [PC(t)C(t)]/[PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t) + PN(t)N(t)], etc., and the

true input shares are sL(t) = [PL(t)L(t)]/[PL(t)L(t) + PK(t)K(t) + PR(t)R(t)], etc.

       A comparison of (1e) and (2e) reveals that the alternative view of intangibles involves

more than the growth terms gN(t) and gR(t), and the associated shares, but also requires a

restatement of all shares. The shares are linked by the factor of proportionality



       (3)           = (pCC+pII)/(pCC+pII+pNN ).



The basic result is that labor’s share when intangibles are capitalized is smaller by this factor: sL

=   s’L, and the income share of capital is thus larger. A similar analysis applies to the rates of

saving and consumption. Consumption shares with and without intangibles are related by the

same proportionality factor as above, sC =      s’C. The consumption share is smaller and the rate

of saving/investment is correspondingly higher. This result is relevant in view of the perception

of a low rate of saving in the U.S. economy, particularly because existing measures exclude

                                                   8
much of the investment in knowledge capital that is a defining feature of the modern U.S.

economy. Finally, the residual estimates of multifactor productivity from (1e) and (2e), gA’(t)

and gA(t), respectively, differ by the factor   when the economic system is in Golden Rule steady

state growth, a result derived from Jorgenson (1966), but the bias due to ignoring intangible

capital, gA(t) - gA’(t), has a more complicated form in other cases.

                       C. The Criteria for Capitalizing Intangibles

       The two approaches set out above give different structural representations of the same

economy, and both cannot be simultaneously correct. Fortunately, standard capital theory

provides criteria for choosing one over the other. As discussed in CHS, capital theory implicitly

defines capital in the context of an optimal consumption plan based on the maximization of an

intertemporal utility function subject to the usual constraints (Weitzmann 1976). The solution to

this optimization problem determines the optimal path of consumption over time and thus

consumer saving behavior, which in turn determines the paths of investment and capital. As

discussed in Hulten (1979), the solution to this optimization problem has an important

implication for the treatment of intangible capital: any use of resources that reduces current

consumption in order to increase it in the future qualifies as an investment. This result argues for

symmetric treatment of all types of capital, so that, for example, spending on R&D and employee

training should be placed on the same footing as spending on plant and equipment. Moreover,

this symmetry principle requires that most business expenditures aimed at enhancing the value of

a firm and improving its products, including human capital development as well as R&D, be

accorded the same treatment as tangible capital in national accounting systems.



                                                  9
                                   D. Symmetry in Production

       The symmetry principle of the preceding section establishes the theoretical equivalence

of tangible and intangible capital from the standpoint of consumption. This symmetry between

tangible and intangible capital is less apparent from the production side of the economy, which is

perhaps one reason that intangibles have traditionally not been counted as capital. Indeed, some

have argued – particularly in the accounting world – that several characteristics of intangibles

disqualify them from being counted as capital; namely, the lack of verifiability for intangible

assets that are not acquired through market transactions; the lack of visibility of intangible assets

after their acquisition that complicates efforts to track past vintages; the non-rivalness of some

intangible assets; and the lack of appropriability of the returns from some intangibles. We

discuss each of these issues in turn and argue that such differences between tangibles and

intangibles, while generally noteworthy, are no more relevant for the capitalization issue than are

differences in the characteristics of equipment, structures, and land.

       One source of production asymmetry between tangibles and intangibles arises from the

fact that most tangible assets are purchased from other producers. Intangible assets, on the other

hand, often are produced within the firm that uses them, and there is thus no arms-length market

transaction to generate observable and verifiable data with which to estimate the quantity

produced, designated as the flow PN(t)N(t) in the notation of this paper. A related problem arises

because it is also difficult to separate PN(t)N(t) into separate price and quantity components;

indeed, sometimes it is even difficult to define the units in which PN(t) and N(t) ought to be

measured (for example, in what units should knowledge be denominated?).




                                                 10
       The absence of externally verifiable data is a major reason that accountants are reluctant

to capitalize intangibles, preferring instead to treat them as an intermediate expense that arises

and disappears internally within the same year. However, the lack of verifiability per se does not

automatically make intangibles an intermediate input. Some tangible assets are also produced

internally (some construction projects, for example) and therefore do not pass through external

markets that generate verifiable transactions data. On the other hand, many intangible assets are

acquired through external markets (technology licenses, patents and copyrights, and the

economic competencies acquired through purchases of management and consulting services). In

any case, the real issue of whether intangibles should be classified as intermediates or as capital

depends on the economic character of the good, as per the preceding section, and not on the ease

with which PN(t)N(t) can be measured.

       Intangibility itself is another source of asymmetry in production. Tangible goods have a

physical embodiment that is capable of being observed, and it is therefore possible to observe the

ones that have been held over from previous years in the larger stock (they often have serial

numbers that identify their vintage). The self-evident durability of a tangible good would

immediately qualify it as capital rather than an intermediate good under most reasonable criteria.

Intangibles, on the other hand, have no palpable embodiment and, in some sense, lack visibility.

Thus, it is not feasible to look for a collection of vintages of intangible investments or even a

single older vintage as proof that the item in question really is capital. In the case of knowledge

capital, for example, it is hard to know which “bit” of knowledge belongs to which vintage of

investment. From the perspective of national income accounting methodology, this issue could

be characterized as the difficulty of measuring depreciation rates and obtaining stocks, R(t), for

                                                 11
intangible assets. However, this concern is not a valid conceptual reason for treating intangibles

as an intermediate input rather than as a capital asset. Again, it is how the item is used over time

that determines whether or not it should be capitalized, not the ease with which R(t) can be

measured.

       Yet another asymmetry between tangibles and intangibles arises because of the public

good aspects of the latter. Many types of intangible capital, such as R&D knowledge, are non-

rival. The non-rivalness of pure knowledge implies that it can be employed by many users

simultaneously without diminishing the quantity available to any single user. In this situation,

the balance equations would be N = NN = NI = NC and R = RI = RC =RN. Moreover, each

additional unit of output produced would not need an additional “unit” of knowledge, suggesting

that the marginal product of R is zero. However, while the marginal product of R used in the

direct production of output may indeed be zero, this is the wrong margin to examine, because an

increase in R increases the efficiency of production and thus increases output indirectly, or it

improves the quality of the product (which is conventionally expressed as an equivalent increase

in quantity). Why else would a firm pay to increase its R if it did not yield some benefit? In

addition, many types of intangible capital – such as brand equity and organizational and human

competencies – are not purely non-rival, but instead have a highly firm-specific character.

Indeed, many intangibles are specific to a firm and valuable, at least in part, because the firm is

able to exclude competitors from gaining access to key information and technology (the secrecy

of the formula for Coca Cola is an example).

        The non-appropriability of some intellectual property is another aspect of intangibles.

The full benefits of R&D and worker training may not be captured by the firm making the

                                                 12
investment, and the measured prices PN(t) and PR(t) may reflect only private benefits and costs.7

However, as before, the capitalization issue pivots on whether the provision of R increases future

output and consumption, not whether R is partly non-appropriable or non-rival, and these two

features do not invalidate the need to capitalize many intangible expenditures.

        In sum, the various characteristics that cause tangible and intangible capital to be

different – verifiablity, visibility, non-rivalness, and appropriability – are all important features

that distinguish one type of capital from the other. However, none of these differences is

relevant to the issue of whether to treat intangible expenditures as capital. That is determined by

whether or not the expenditure is intended to yield output in some future time period. This is the

conceptual analogue on the production side to the symmetry criterion of whether the expenditure

was made in order to increase future consumption. Many intangibles satisfy these criteria and

must therefore be treated as capital.

         Symmetry in production does impose one important restriction on intangible assets. To

proceed as we have in the formulation of the equations (2a)-(2d), we assume that the same

neoclassical investment rules that apply to tangible capital also apply to intangibles: investment

in tangibles is assumed to proceed up to the point that the present value of the stream of future

user costs, PK(t + ) just equals the cost of acquiring a marginal unit of the investment good, PI(t).

Applied to intangibles, this assumption implies that investment is made using marginalist

principles. An alternative Schumpetarian view of the firm might reject this assumption, but we



7
  Any externalities due to unappropriated benefits from R&D or other investments appear as a shift in the
production function and are picked up in measured MFP (Hulten 2001). This is essentially the
mechanism of endogenous growth theory when externalities arise from R&D (Romer 1986) and
education (Lucas 1988).

adopt the marginalist approach because our objective is to integrate intangible capital into the

neoclassical sources-of growth framework of equation (2e), which is based on marginalist

principles.

                                  E. Prices and Deflators

        The SOG equations of the preceding section are computationally derived from the

accounting structure in equations (2a)-(2d) using price deflators to convert nominal values into

their real counterparts. As discussed above, a difficult aspect of this computation is measuring

the price deflator PN(t) needed to convert estimates of expenditure PN(t)N(t) into real estimates.

This has proved to be one of the most difficult empirical issues in the study of R&D investment,

in large part because of the verifiability and visibility issues described above. The strategy in the

R&D literature has been to use input costs to proxy for PN(t); the most common approach has

been to average a wage deflator and a price deflator for a broad measure of output on the grounds

that R&D expenditures are roughly 50 percent labor costs and 50 percent supplies.8

        In contrast to this approach, we opt for a pure output deflator as a proxy for the price of

intangibles. Although we consider this proxy only a placeholder until further research develops

deflators for specific intangibles, we believe that a price measure is preferred to a wage measure

for the following reason. Under constant returns to scale in the technology in (2a), the growth

rate of the price of the intangible capital good is:



              (4)      gPN(t) = sLN(t)gPL(t) + sKN(t)gPK(t) + sRN(t)gPR(t) - gAN(t),



8
  This approach to constructing a deflator for R&D was developed and used by Jaffe (1972) and then by
Griliches (1984).
                                                  14
where sLN(t) = [PL(t)LN(t)]/[PL(t)LN(t) + PK(t)KN(t) + PR(t)RN(t) ] is labor’s income share in the

production of intangible investment. Using the wage PL(t) as a proxy for PN(t) is equivalent to

assuming that the growth rate of output price is gPN(t) is equal to the growth rate of wages, gPL(t).

As can be seen in equation (4), this will occur only if labor is the sole input to the production of

the intangible and if the rate of multifactor productivity growth in the production of intangibles,

gAN(t), and the shares of tangible and intangible capital, sKN(t) and sRN(t), are all zero. These

assumptions are extremely implausible, because, for example, R&D programs require plant and

equipment, and knowledge builds on knowledge. Because using a wage deflator tends to give

biased results, we adopt the nonfarm business output price deflator as a proxy for PN(t). This

proxy can be rationalized by the fact that much R&D and coinvestments in marketing and human

competencies are tied to specific product lines. Integrating the cost of productivity-enhancing

investments back into the “using” industries is accomplished generally by adopting the nonfarm

business output price as the deflator for intangibles.9

        The search for an appropriate deflator for the user cost of intangibles, PR(t), also poses

challenges. The corresponding user cost of tangible capital, PK(t ), is not usually observed but

can be imputed following Jorgenson (1963) and Hall and Jorgenson (1967). When intangibles

are ignored, the conventionally measured rental flow, PK(t)K(t), is estimated by the residual

income not attributable to labor, PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t) - PL(t)L(t). This leads to an error because,

when income accrues to intangible capital, the conventionally measured residual term for capital

income actually equals



9
 Martin Baily offered this rationale for the deflation of the output of management consultancies (see
Triplett and Bosworth 2004, p 260).
                                                    15
(5)            PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t) - PL(t)L(t) = PK(t)K(t) + PR(t)R(t) - PN(t)N(t).



The conventional practice of ignoring intangible capital thus leads, in general, to a biased

estimate of the income accruing to tangible capital. There is, moreover, another subtle issue that

arises because the total capital income on the right-hand side of (5) is measured by the sum of all

property-type income (interest, dividends, retained earnings, taxes, and depreciation). This list

accounts for all the non-labor payments accruing to both tangible and intangible capital, i.e., to

PK(t)K(t) + PR(t) R(t), leaving no apparent role for the intangible investment, PN(t)N(t). As the

right-hand side of equation (5) illustrates, the answer to this apparent contradiction is that the

income accruing to intangible investments is reflected on the input side as uncounted profits.

Specifically, when intangibles are treated as an intermediate input, the spending on intangibles is

subtracted from revenue as an expense, reducing measured profits. On the other hand, when

intangibles are treated as an investment, they are not subtracted from revenue in the period of

purchase, and profits are higher. Thus, the symmetric treatment of tangible and intangible

capital is not just about PN(t)N(t) as uncounted output, but also about PN(t)N(t) as uncounted

income accruing to capital.



                      III. Estimates of Intangible Investment and Capital

                              A. Measuring Investment in Intangibles

       In our earlier work, we developed estimates of a broad range of business investments in

intangibles in the 1990s. Our results are summarized in Table 1 for the three broad categories of

intangibles included in our analysis, with separate detail for two of the categories. We first

                                                  16
estimated expenditures on each type of intangible (the first column in the table), and then, based

on available economic research and evidence, we determined how much of each expenditure

might be considered business investment according to the criterion of whether the expenditure

could be deemed to yield future consumption (the last column). Estimates are the annual average

for the period shown (the late 1990s), and the numbers in parentheses indicate how much of each

type of investment currently is included in the NIPAs.

        The rationale for our choice of categories is discussed in some detail in our the previous

paper. We only note here that our choice was driven, in large part, by our desire to go beyond

existing categories to develop a more comprehensive list. Our first broad category, business

investment in computerized information, is largely composed of the NIPA series for business

investment in computer software.10 Our second category, innovative property, includes the

National Science Foundation (NSF) Industrial R&D series. However, the NSF’s survey is

designed to capture only innovative activity built on a scientific base of knowledge and therefore

does not fully capture resources devoted by businesses to innovation and new product/process

R&D more broadly.11 This “other” R&D – we called it nonscientific R&D – includes the

revenues of the nonscientific commercial R&D industry, as measured in the Census Bureau’s


10
   The NIPA software series is conceptually consistent with our intertemporal criterion for defining capital
because the software measure includes both purchased and own-account components. National
accountants estimated the own-account component indirectly to overcome the verifiability issue discussed
earlier (Parker and Grimm 1999).
11
   The survey asks companies to include “activities carried on by persons trained, either formally or by
experience, in: biological sciences, computer science, engineering, mathematical and statistical sciences,
and physical sciences (e.g., chemistry and physics)” but to exclude “quality control, routine product
testing, market research, sales promotion, ... and other nontechnological activities; ... and research in the
social sciences or psychology.” In a further clarification, the survey instructs companies to include
expenditures for conducting clinical trials for drugs and software development if the application has
commercial value, but to exclude “software development intended for within company use only.”
                                                    17
Services Annual Survey (SAS), as well as the costs of developing new motion picture films and

other forms of entertainment, and a crude estimate of the spending for new product development

by financial services and insurance firms.12 It is apparent from Table 1 that, by the late 1990s,

investment in non-scientific R&D was as large as investment in scientific R&D.

        Our third general category includes investment in what we have called “economic

competencies.” This includes spending on strategic planning, spending on redesigning or

reconfiguring existing products in existing markets, investments to retain or gain market share,

and investments in brand names. Expenditures for advertising are a large part of the investments

in brand equity, but as stressed in our earlier work, not all spending on intangibles should be

counted as capital spending. Based on results from the empirical literature on advertising, we

estimated that only about 60 percent of total advertising expenditures were for ads that had long-

lasting effects (that is, effects that last more than one year).

        Investment in firm-specific human and structural resources is the second type of economic

competency included in our estimates. It includes the costs of employer-provided worker training

and an estimate of management time devoted to enhancing the productivity of the firm. Our

estimates of the former are based on BLS surveys; the latter are based on SAS revenues for the

management consultant industry and trends in the cost and number of persons employed in

executive occupations. Without doubt, these spending flows are imprecisely estimated, but

business investments in firm-specific human and structural resources through strategic planning,

adaptation, reorganization, and employee-skill building are important drivers of innovation and

12
   Many new products in the financial services industry involve computerized information; to avoid
double-counting (particularly with the own-account portion of computer software), we deliberately were
very conservative in our estimates for this component.
                                                   18
profitability in industry and require treatment as investment to be consistent with capital theory.13

Moreover, this last category is, by our reckoning, the largest type of business intangible

investment. And, total investment in economic competencies is nearly as large as the investment

in the other two major categories combined.

        Two other facts emerged from our earlier work. First, total investment in intangibles grew

more rapidly than investment in tangibles over the decade of the 1990s, although the levels of the

two were nearly equal in magnitude for the decade as a whole. Second, investment in the

categories of intangibles already included in the NIPAs was only a fraction of our estimated total,

even if all scientific R&D were included. Together, these findings suggest that a longer time

series on the growth of intangible business investment would indicate a strong dynamic role for

intangibles in explaining economic growth and might significantly affect our understanding of the

sources of growth of the U.S. nonfarm business sector.

        Table 2 reports our new estimates of business investment in the intangibles shown in

table 1 by decade starting in 1950. In general, the estimates shown in table 2 were derived using

the same methods and sources as used in our earlier paper. Most of the needed source data begin

at least by the late 1940s, and the series for spending on scientific R&D and on brand equity begin

much earlier. However, for a few components we could not use the same sources for earlier

periods, and the components were extrapolated backward in time using related series. This

occurred most prominently for the series based on SAS data, which are not available prior to the



13
  Moreover, the micro data evidence of Abowd et. al (2005) suggests that firm-level differences in
organizational practices (proxied by firm-level distributions of human capital) are strongly related to
outcomes such as revenue per worker and market valuation.
                                                     19
mid-1980s. All SAS series were extrapolated back using a related aggregate in the BEA’s gross

product by industry system that is available beginning in the late-1940s.14

        For employer-provided training we made some changes to the estimates for recent years

and made some special adjustments to estimates for earlier years. In our earlier work, we used

trends in wage costs and the industrial structure of the workforce to extrapolate the results of

surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the mid-1990s. For this paper, we

improved our extrapolations for more recent years by linking them to estimates from surveys that

have been conducted by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) since

1997.15 These new results suggest a slight pullback in firms’ per-employee expenditure on

training in 2002, perhaps reflecting the cyclical episode in 2001. We know of no similar, survey-

based data for business outlays on employer-provided training in earlier periods.

        The studies that established the link between training and productivity at the firm level

(Bartel 1991, 1994) used data for earlier years (the mid-1980s), but the training measures were

qualitative indicators, not actual figures on the amount firms invested in their employees (see also

Black and Lynch 1996, whose data were for the early 1990s). The BLS surveys and the more

recent ASTD data suggest that per-employee rates of spending on (formal) training increases with

the size of the firm.16 The BLS surveys also show that employees in professional and managerial

the series for R&D in the social sciences and humanities, market research services, and management
consulting services from 1985 back to 1947.

   See www.astd.org or Bassi, et. al. 2001 for further information.
16
   See table 1 in the employer survey at www.bls.gov/ept. Only 69 percent of small establishments (fewer
than 50 employees) provided formal training in 1995 compared with nearly all medium-sized (50-249
employees) and large (250 or more employees) establishments.

                                                    20
occupations receive the most training (in terms of hours).17 With the growth of the modern

corporation and a rough doubling of the ratio of employees in professional and managerial

occupations in the total workforce since the late 1960s, the incidence of employer-provided

training likely has also increased by a notable, albeit unknown, amount.18 Because an extension

of the methods used in our earlier work would not build in an increase in incidence (except

indirectly through its impact on the distribution of wage costs by industry), we boosted the trend

in training implied by an extension of our earlier work by a small amount (less than 2 percent per

year) between 1948 and 1988.

        All told, business investment in intangibles is a vital aspect of business activity, and the

investments shown in table 2 represent a large and growing portion of the overall economy. The

extent to which existing nominal output measures are understated owing to the treatment of most

intangibles as intermediates in the national accounts is illustrated by Figures 1 and 2. The former

shows our measure of total investment as a share of (adjusted) nonfarm business output and

indicates that intangibles have accounted for virtually all of the increase over the last five

decades. (Note that software is included in “existing” investment, owing to its current treatment

the NIPAs). Figure 2 breaks the growth in intangible investment into its major components and

reveals that, in recent years, the most dynamic categories of intangibles are firm-specific

resources, non-scientific R&D, and computer software. The major period of relative growth in


17
   Employees in professional and paraprofessional occupations received essentially twice the number of
hours of formal and informal training as those in other occupational groups, with training most prevalent
for computer, professional and technical, and management skills. See tables 1 and 6 in the employee
survey at www.bls.gov/ept.
18
   The reported increase in the ratio of professional and managerial occupations in the workforce is based
on data from BLS’s Current Population Survey (CPS). Nakamura (2001) presents and discusses the
increase in this ratio from 1982 to 2000. We developed similar estimates using more limited CPS
occupational categories that extend back to 1967.

                                                    21
scientific R&D was the 1950s.19 Figure 2 also reveals the relative importance of investment in

economic competencies as a share of the total investment.

        The last four rows of table 2 present data on related series as a basis for further

comparisons. The most interesting is perhaps the last row, which presents our estimates of the

parameter      from our equation (3). This parameter is the ratio of output with and without

unrecognized intangibles. When nonfarm business output is adjusted to include our estimates of

the unrecognized intangibles, the adjusted output is 12 percent (1/ ) percent higher than the

existing measure in the 2000-2003 period. Fifty years ago, the adjusted measure was only about 5

percent higher.

                      B. Real Intangible Investment and Capital Stocks

        The ultimate objective is to estimate the SOG equation (2e). In order to do this, estimates

of the real investment in intangibles are necessary, as are the corresponding stocks of capital.

Real investment for each new category of intangibles was obtained by deflating the nominal

investment estimates of the preceding section by the nonfarm business output deflator.20 As noted

in Section II, we believe this deflator is a plausible placeholder until further research permits

better measures. The NIPA price for software is retained and used for that category of

intangibles.




19
   Scientific R&D also bulged in the 1979-1982 period, but this bulge is accounted for by a jump in
mineral exploration, which we include in scientific R&D along with the NSF’s Industrial R&D series.
Expenditures on oil and gas well drilling and mining, the dominant component of mineral exploration, are
already capitalized in the NIPAs.
20
   The nonfarm business output deflator begins in 1948. To deflate nominal investment data that begin
earlier (scientific R&D and brand equity, for example), the nonfarm business output deflator is linked to
the GDP deflator.

                                                   22
        To obtain intangible capital stocks, we start with our estimates of real investment series

N(t) and apply the capital accumulation identity of Section II, R(t) = N(t) + (1- R)R(t-1).21 Two

further elements beyond N(t) are needed to implement the identity: a depreciation rate, , and a

capital benchmark, R(0), for each intangible asset.

        Relatively little is known about depreciation rates for intangibles. Based on the limited

information available, we made the following assumptions about depreciation rates:




                Category                                  Depreciation Rate (percent)
                Computerized information                              33

                R&D, nonscientific                                     20

                Firm-specific resources                                40

        For computerized information, our estimate is based on the BEA’s assumptions for own-

account software (depreciation rate of 33 percent, five-year service life). Our estimate of the

depreciation rate of R&D capital (20 percent) is in the middle of the range of the rates reported in

the existing literature on R&D. For R&D, Bernstein and Mamuneas (2004) find that the

depreciation rate in the United States is 18 percent. Nadiri and Prucha (1996) obtain a figure of

12 percent. Pakes and Schankerman (1978), using data for several European countries, obtain an




21
  Note that we are assuming that R&D investment becomes productive as soon as it is put in place; that is,
we are assuming a gestation lag of zero. In contrast, Fraumeni and Okubo (2005) assumed a one-year
gestation lag. We maintained a gestation lag of zero to avoid the complication of different gestation lags
for different assets as is done in much of the growth accounting literature. Hopefully, future research will
shed further light on this issue.

                                                     23
average rate of 25 percent; in a later paper (1986), they estimate a range from 11 to 26 percent.22

For advertising, the empirical literature finds the effects of ads to be relatively short-lived (as

noted earlier) but reports a wide range of findings on the longevity of advertising capital; our own

interpretation of this literature is that advertising capital depreciates by 60 percent per year.23

        For firm-specific resources, we averaged the rates for brand equity and R&D. As just

described, the firm-specific resources category has two components. On the one hand, the

discernible and direct link between employer-provided training and firm-level productivity

suggests that investments in this component are long-lasting. On the other hand, investments

through strategic planning and reorganization reflect business’ need to constantly adapt to

changing economic conditions. While such investments undoubtedly have a long-lasting

“learning-by-doing” dimension (similar to that in R&D), we believe they also have a short-lived

“organizational forgetting” dimension (similar to that in advertising).

        For each asset, the initial capital stock was set to zero in the year shown below.

   The 33 percent figure is the double-declining balance rate for BEA’s assumed service life of five years
for own-account software, calculated as 1.65/5. This ratio was originally developed by Hulten and Wykoff
(1981).
23
   We concluded that advertising had a service life of less than 3 years based on work by Landes and
Rosenfield (1994) who estimated implied annual geometric rates of decay of advertising for 20 two-digit
SIC industries covering manufacturing and many services. The Landes-Rosenfield findings also generated
our conclusions on the amount of advertising that should be expensed (about 40 percent; see footnote 21 in
CHS).
     The literature is not settled on these issues. Some find that all (Comanor and Wilson 1974) or a
higher fraction (Hall 1981) of advertising expenditures should be expensed, while others suggest that little
or no expensing is appropriate (Lev 2001). Yet another econometric study found the durability of
advertising capital to be as high as 7 years (Ayanian 1983).

                                                    24
The assumption that initial capital stocks are zero (rather than an unknown positive value) has

little effect on our growth accounting analysis because all of the depreciation rates are relatively

high and the true value of the benchmark will have depreciated away by the date that we start our

growth accounting analysis (1973).

        Table 3 shows our estimate of the nominal intangible capital stock in 2003 (in billions of

dollars) and the annual average growth rate of real intangible capital in the 1973-1995 and 1995-

2003 periods.24 In terms of the components of intangible capital, over the period from 1973-95,

nonscientific R&D capital is the fastest growing new category of intangibles; over the period

from 1995-2003, computerized information is the fastest growing category. In both periods,

scientific R&D is the slowest growing category.

                                   C. The User Cost of Intangible Capital

        The SOG model (2e) requires both the growth rate of intangible capital and its income

share. In order to estimate the income share, it is first necessary to estimate the user cost PR(t)

associated with each type of intangible capital. The standard expression for the user cost of any

asset was derived by Jorgenson (1963) and extended by Hall and Jorgenson (1967) to include

taxes. The Jorgensonian user cost for intangibles is given by the expression

        (6)     PRi(t) = [r(t) +     i   -   i(t)]   PNi(t),

where r(t) a measure of the net rate of return common to all capital in year t,          i   is the depreciation

rate for asset i,   i(t)   is the expected capital gain (loss) on asset i, and PNi(t) is the intangible


24
   As indicated in Table 2, two components of innovative property (mineral exploration and a portion of
architectural design services) are already included in the NIPAs and are not included as intangibles in
Table 3; thus, we are implicitly counting them as tangible assets in the growth accounting results that
follow. We left them as categorized by the BEA to simplify the presentation; in any case, these categories
are small enough that reclassifying them would make little difference in the sources of growth analysis.

                                                               25
investment price deflator. Except for the real net rate of return r(t), each term on the right-hand

side of this expression can be calculated for each new intangible asset from the data described

above, with the capital gain term proxied by the three-year moving average of the nonfarm

business price deflator. We include the usual Hall-Jorgenson tax terms in our actual calculations

although they are not shown in (6) for simplicity of exposition. We estimate the net rate of return

r(t) using the procedure developed in Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) that solves for the common

value of r(t) in each year that causes the accounting identity in equation (5) to hold for all types of

capital, intangible and tangible.25

                               D. Output Measures and Income Shares

The next link in completing the data needed for the SOG equation (2e) is the estimation of output

and the associated income shares. Following equation (2d), nominal output in the nonfarm

business sector is the sum of our estimates of current dollar intangible investment, PN(t)N(t), and

deliveries of consumption and tangible investment to final demand, PC(t)C(t) + PI(t)I(t). The

income shares follow immediately by dividing each element on the right-hand side of (2d),

PL(t)L(t), PK(t)K(t),and PR(t)R(t) by the value of output. These shares are shown in the last

column of table 3 for the periods 1973-95 and 1995-2003.



25
    It is worth emphasizing that the Jorgenson-Griliches procedure for estimating the rate of return results
in a common rate of return to both tangibles and intangibles. This assumes that businesses arbitrage their
investments across all types of capital, investing in each type until the rate of return for all assets is equal.
While this assumption about investment may be disputed by Schumpeterians, we believe that it is the
logical starting point for incorporating intangibles into the sources-of-growth analysis because it treats
intangibles symmetrically with the way tangibles are treated in the existing SOG literature. In particular, it
is symmetric with the way the official SOG estimates are constructed by the BLS. We also note that, as of
this writing, the required BLS data extend through 2002. Following Oliner and Sichel, we use a regression
equation to project r(t) for 2003; explanatory variables include two lags of r(t), inflation in the nonfarm
business sector, the acceleration of real output in the nonfarm business sector, the unemployment rate, and
the profit share.

                                                       26
        To highlight how the accounting differs when intangibles are counted as investment,

table 4 shows the elements of the income identity PQ(t)Q(t) = PL(t)L(t) + PK(t)K(t) + PR(t)R(t),

along with the associated shares. As can be seen in the memo items, including all intangibles

lowers the labor share of income from about 70 percent to 60 percent and raises the capital share

(the sum of lines 12 and 13) from about 30 percent to 40 percent. Note that intangibles account

for 37.5 percent of all capital income (line 13 as a share of line 12 plus line 13).

        The full time series of the new labor share is provided in figure 3. The lowering of the

labor share is one of the more startling results of the “new view” of intangibles. Not only is

labor'
     s share significantly lower when all intangibles are capitalized, the “new” share is no longer

constant (as it appeared to be before software was capitalized). Rather, the new share trends

downward over the past five decades, particularly since 1980. The growing wedge between the

old and new views of labor'
                          s share reflects the fact that an increasing fraction of capital income

has been associated with intangibles.26

        To obtain an index of real output growth including the new intangibles, we aggregate the

existing real nonfarm business output and the real investment series for each of the new categories

of intangible assets, PNi(t)Ni(t), using a Divisia index procedure.27 The result is the growth rate

of output gQ(t) = sC(t)gC(t) + sI(t)gI(t) +   i sNi(t)gNi(t).   This is the final data series needed to

complete the SOG analysis.



26
   This income appears in the first column of table 4 (and on the income statements of companies in the
economy) as retained earnings. Additions to retained earnings translate into a long-run increase in national
wealth as corporate share values increase. To the individual investor, it appears as an increase in personal
wealth from stocks, pensions, insurance, etc.
27
   Because nominal business investment for each of the new intangible assets is deflated with the nonfarm
business deflator, Divisia aggregation and fixed-weight (or simple sum) aggregation yield the same series
for real nonfarm business output including business investment in intangible assets.

                                                    27
                               IV. Growth Accounting Results

        The estimates of Section III provide the elements needed to construct growth accounts

with intangibles. We can then compare the SOG models with and without intangibles (equations

1e and 2e of Section II). The SOG results are shown in Table 5 for two periods, 1973-1995 and

1995-2003, which were selected in order to analyze the role played by intangible investments in

the productivity pick-up that is usually dated from 1995 in the recent SOG literature.28

        The top panel in Table 5 presents the growth accounts based on equation (1e), the SOG

without any intangibles.29 These results are based on BLS estimates of the growth of labor

productivity in the nonfarm business sector, from which we have excluded software.30 The

estimates provide the baseline for comparison with SOG estimates based on equation (2e) with

intangibles, shown in the bottom panel of Table 5. A number of conclusions can be drawn from a

comparison of the two panels. First, it is apparent that the capitalization of intangibles increases

the rate of growth of output per hour in both the 1973-1995 and 1995-2003 periods. Interestingly,

the increase in growth rates relative to the baseline is largest in the earlier period (20 percent)

compared with the second (11 percent). However, it is worth noting that the second period covers

both the technology boom and the subsequent technology bust. Estimates that refer only to the


28
   The figures here follow the methodology described above, which also coincides with that used by the
BLS to produce their estimates of multifactor productivity growth. For a description of their methodology,
see BLS (1983).
29
   The figures in table 5 and throughout the paper do not incorporate the 2005 annual revision of the
NIPAs.
30
   The items listed under the heading ‘Contribution of Components’ are the growth rate of each input
weighted by the corresponding income share. In moving from one formulation to the other, we make
appropriate adjustments to the income shares. As of this writing, BLS’s published estimates extend
through 2002, and we only had to estimate one year. This was done using the procedure developed in
Oliner and Sichel (2000, 2002).

                                                   28
1995-2000 period would show a greater influence of intangible investments on labor productivity

growth. The dependence of growth accounting estimates on the period of analysis, and

particularly on the endpoints, is a well-known characteristic of this type of analysis.

       Second, the relative importance of the factors “explaining” growth changes significantly

when intangibles are introduced. In the first period, the portion of top-line growth explained by

intangibles goes from 0 percent in the top panel (by definition) to 26 percent with them, and the

corresponding numbers for the 1995-2003 period are 0 percent and 27 percent, respectively.

Moreover, intangibles moved up to parity with tangible capital in its importance as a source of

growth during the second period. Put another way, capital plays a larger role in accounting for

labor productivity growth once intangibles are included. In the earlier period, capital accounted

for 59 percent of labor productivity growth when intangibles are included, but only 44 percent

when they are excluded. In the latter period, the difference is even greater, with capital

accounting for 54 percent of growth when intangibles are included but only 35 percent when they

are excluded.

       Third, a comparison of MFP growth rates reveals that this source of growth declines both

in absolute and relative importance when intangibles are included as investment. This is most

pronounced for the second period, during which the average annual growth rate of MFP drops

from 1.42 percentage points under the “old” view to 1.08 percentage points when intangible

investments are included in the analysis. Expressed as a fraction of the rate of growth in output

per hour, MFP declines in importance from 51 percent to 35 percent. This result is not

particularly surprising in light of Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) and in view of the fact that MFP

is measured as a residual.


                                                 29
       Fourth, one thing that cannot be claimed for the “new” view is that intangibles affected the

size of the mid-1990s pick-up in labor productivity itself. The third column in both panels shows

the percentage-point acceleration in each SOG factor between the two periods. It is apparent that

the size of the acceleration in labor productivity in percentage points was virtually the same in

both panels.

       Fifth, the source of the mid-1990s acceleration in labor productivity does change when

intangibles are included. In the top panel, the acceleration in MFP accounts for two-third of the

total pickup when intangibles are excluded, but accounts for less that half in bottom panel when

intangibles are included. Correspondingly, the role of capital in the acceleration of labor

productivity is considerably larger when intangibles are included.

       In sum, the results shown in Table 5 strongly suggest that intangibles matter not just for

national income and wealth accounting, but for growth accounting as well. Indeed, our estimates,

rough as they may be, imply that the traditional practice of expensing intangibles results in a

seriously distorted picture of the sources of growth.

       Table 6 continues the SOG of Table 5 by disaggregating line 6 of that table’s lower panel

into the separate components shown in Table 1. It is probably not surprising that computerized

information (software) is an important factor driving the growth of the total intangible variable in

Table 5, but it is perhaps more surprising that firm-specific resources are found to be of equal

importance. The rather small role of scientific R&D also is surprising in light of the attention that

R&D has been given in the literature on innovation. Scientific R&D accounts for only a modest

portion of total intangible capital deepening and is markedly less important than investment in




                                                 30
software.31 It also worth noting that the non-traditional types of intangibles highlighted in this

paper – nonscientific R&D, brand equity, and firm-specific resources – together account for

nearly 60 percent of total intangible capital deepening since 1995. Because software is already

capitalized in the NIPAs, and scientific R&D will probably be sometime over the next decade, our

results suggest that growth accountants should not lose sight of these other forms of intangible

capital.

           This paper highlights the importance of intangibles as a source of economic growth.

However, because software is already included in published growth accounts, another question is

relevant: how much impact would the capitalization of the other intangibles have on published

growth rates? Table 7 addresses this question by showing estimates for the nonfarm business

sector, including software but not the other intangibles, for periods shown in Tables 5 and 6. A

comparison of the top-line result in Table 7 with the corresponding estimate on line 1 in the

lower panel of Table 5 indicates that the growth rate of output per hour is not greatly increased by

the inclusion of the other intangibles from 1995-2003 (2.95 percent versus 3.09 percent).

However, the composition of the sources of growth is affected, with a significantly greater role

for capital deepening with full accounting for intangibles and a proportionately smaller role for

MFP. Again, the capitalization of intangibles matters for the understanding of economic growth.




31
   This result hinges, at least in part, on our assumption that the nonfarm business output price is an
appropriate deflator for scientific R&D. If we followed the R&D literature and used a deflator with a
wage component, the result that scientific R&D played a relatively small role in accounting for recent U.S.
economic growth would be, if anything, stronger. On the other hand, if the deflator for ICT investment
were used instead (as suggested by Mairesse and Kosoglu 2005), we would find that scientific R&D
played a more important role.

                                                    31
                     V. Conclusion: It’s the Knowledge Economy

       The rapid expansion and application of technological knowledge in its many forms

(research and development, capital-embodied technical change, human competency, and the

associated firm-specific co-investments) is a key feature of recent U.S. economic growth.

Accounting practice traditionally excludes the intangibles component of this knowledge capital

and, according to our estimates, excludes approximately $1 trillion from conventionally measured

nonfarm business sector output by the late 1990s and understates the business capital stock by

$3.6 trillion. The current practice also overstates labor’s share of income by a significant amount

and masks a downward trend in that share. Our results also suggest that the inclusion of

intangibles both as an input and as an output can have a large impact on our understanding of

economic growth. We have found that the inclusion of intangible investment in the real output of

the nonfarm business sector increases the estimated growth rate of output per hour by 10 to 20

percent relative to the base-line case which completely ignores intangibles. Thus, the inclusion of

intangibles matters for labor productivity growth rates, although it has little effect on the

acceleration of productivity in the 1990s. On the input side, intangibles reached parity with

tangible capital as a source growth after 1995, and when the two are combined, capital deepening

supplants MFP as the principal source of growth. Moreover, the majority of the contribution of

intangibles comes from the non-traditional categories of intangibles identified in this paper.

        It is also worth noting that the fraction of output growth per hour attributable to the old

“bricks and mortar” forms of capital investment (labeled “other tangible” capital in the lower

panel of table 5) is very small, accounting for less that 8 percent of the total growth in the period

1995-2003. While it is inappropriate to automatically attribute the other 92 percent to


                                                  32
“knowledge capital” or “the knowledge economy,” it is equally inappropriate to ignore the

association between innovation, human capital, and knowledge acquisition, on the one hand, and

investments in intangibles, IT capital, labor quality change, and multifactor productivity, on the

other.

         That intangibles, and more generally, knowledge capital should be such an important

driver of modern economic growth is hardly surprising, given the evidence from every day life

and the results of basic intertemporal economic theory. What is surprising is that intangibles have

been ignored for so long, and that they continue to be ignored in financial accounting practice at

the firm level. The results presented this paper are intended to illustrate the potential magnitude

of the bias arising when they are excluded from economic growth accounting. In the process, we

have been forced to make a host of assumptions about many empirical issues, in order to measure

such items as output deflators and non-market inputs like firm-specific organization and human

competencies. Further research will undoubtedly find better ways to deal with these issues, and

future data collection efforts will evolve to fill the gaps that this paper only traverses lightly.

However, while our results are clearly provisional, we are also mindful of the famous dictum of

John Maynard Keynes that it is better to be imprecisely right than precisely wrong.

                                               apparently have relatively short-lived

                                               long-lived effects, but a portion of
                                               management fees probably is not capital

NOTE. The figures in this table are consistent with those used by the BLS in putting together its multifactor
productivity estimates for the nonfarm business sector. The figures in the first column, however, exclude
software, and thus nominal output (line 3) and total income (line 7) are lower by NIPA estimates for software
spending by nonfarm businesses.
1. Estimates of indirect business taxes for the nonfarm business sector (now known as taxes on production and
imports) were inferred, given figures for lines 3, 5, and 6.
2. The figure for income accruing to tangible capital in the second column differs from that in the first column
because the net rate of return—the term r(t) in equation (6)—changes slightly when intangibles are included.
