                                       ABSTRACT

We examine whether the recent expansions in Medicaid from the Affordable Care Act reduced
“employment lock” among childless adults who were previously ineligible for public coverage.
We compare employment in states that chose to expand Medicaid versus those that chose not to
expand, before and after implementation. We find that although the expansion increased
Medicaid coverage by 3.0 percentage points among childless adults, there was no significant
impact on employment.

1    Introduction

In 2010, the United States passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a landmark legis-

lation that overhauled the nation’s existing healthcare system. A central debate around the implementation

of this act has been its effects on employment. Prior to the ACA, Americans primarily obtained health

insurance coverage through their employers, as individually purchased plans were often prohibitively ex-

pensive, and public insurance was limited only to certain segments of the population. As a result of this

system of employer-sponsored coverage, some have predicted that many individuals sought employment

purely to gain coverage. Several provisions of the new law, however, may loosen this “employment lock”

by providing alternative affordable coverage options.

    One of the ways that the original law made health insurance accessible to low-income populations was

through a mandated expansion in the public means-tested Medicaid program to all those with incomes below

138 percent of the federal poverty line, starting in 2014. However, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made

the expansion optional and left the decision up to the individual states. As of this writing, only 32 states

have elected to expand Medicaid. Since the program previously covered mostly families with children, the

expansions had the greatest impact on non-elderly low-income adults who do not have children under the

age of 18 (hereafter, “childless adults”). In states that did not expand Medicaid, most childless adults under

the federal poverty line are left without coverage; they are ineligible for Medicaid and are also excluded from

receiving the ACA’s refundable tax credits toward the purchase of private insurance, which are available to

workers above the poverty level.

    In this paper, we ask whether the availability of Medicaid reduced “employment lock” among childless

adults. Although the long-term impacts of the Medicaid expansion, and health reform more generally, will

not be known for a few more years, one effect that should be apparent even at this early stage is whether

or not the introduction of public insurance allowed those who were locked into jobs for insurance reasons

to exit the labor force.1 In fact, as detailed below, several studies have demonstrated that the expansions

may have potentially large and immediate impacts on the labor market. To study this, we utilize state-level

differences in Medicaid availability due to the Supreme Court’s ruling. We compare the sources of health

insurance coverage and employment rates of states that expanded Medicaid relative to those that did not,
   1 Although we focus on the impacts of Medicaid on the decision of whether or not to work (“employment lock”) rather than on

“job lock” due to a lack of data on job changes, there is evidence that the health reform may also lead to a reduction in job lock
more generally (Heim and Lurie, 2014).



                                                                1
before and after the policy was in place, in a differences-in-differences strategy. In contrast to previous

findings and predictions, we do not find any evidence of a reduction in employment lock in response to the

expansions of Medicaid.

   The best existing evidence on employment lock among the population most affected by the Medicaid

expansions – low-income childless adults – come from two quasi-experimental studies and one experimen-

tal study of specific state programs that provide Medicaid or similar coverage to childless adults. The first

of these is Garthwaite et al. (2014), who examine the employment effects of a large disenrollment in Ten-

nessee’s Medicaid program for the “uninsured and uninsurable” in 2005. Using a differences-in-differences

strategy, they estimate that Medicaid enrollment was associated with an over 50 percentage point drop in

employment. Dague et al. (2014) study a 2009 enrollment freeze in a Wisconsin public insurance program

and find smaller, but economically and statistically significant negative employment effects. They use both

regression discontinuity design and matched differences-in-differences strategies, and find that the employ-

ment drop from Medicaid coverage ranges from two to ten percentage points. Finally, Baicker et al. (2014)

find that when Oregon randomly selected childless adults to be eligible for Medicaid coverage, there were

no effects on employment. One explanation for the disparate results across states, supplied by both Baicker

et al. (2014) and Dague et al. (2014), is that Tennessee’s program covered relatively higher income indi-

viduals, who are more likely to be able to find jobs with health benefits. Another explanation is that worse

labor market conditions may affect the ability of individuals to adjust to health insurance losses or gains

through employment. Finally, it is also possible that the groups affected in each of the three states differed

in terms of how much they valued health insurance, and therefore how likely they were to be “locked” into

employment in the absence of Medicaid. In particular, since Oregon’s Medicaid program was only open to

those who did not recently have health insurance, those ultimately affected by the lottery would not have

been a group that was highly dependent on health insurance. On the other hand, as a result of earlier re-

certification procedures, the Tennessee disenrollees were likely a population that had greater than average

taste for coverage. In contemporaneous studies, Gooptu et al. (2016) and Kaestner et al. (2015) find limited

employment effects from the ACA Medicaid expansion.

   Our study is also related to the literature on how public insurance expansions crowd out private insur-

ance, since the primary source of private coverage is employer-sponsored coverage. The seminal paper on

this topic, Cutler and Gruber (1996), finds that when Medicaid eligibility was expanded for children in the

late 1980s to early 1990s, reductions in private coverage offset 49 percent of the increase in Medicaid cover-

                                                      2
age. Furthermore, they find that this private coverage is entirely employer-sponsored coverage, rather than

non-group private insurance. Later studies that have reexamined the same Medicaid expansions and subse-

quent policies for slightly higher income children generally find smaller crowdout effects, though estimates

cover a wide range (Shore-Sheppard, 2008, Card and Shore-Sheppard, 2004, LoSasso and Buchmueller,

2004, Gruber and Simon, 2008, Ham and Shore-Sheppard, 2005b). There has been considerably less work

examining the crowdout effects of expanding eligibility to adults, since there was very limited coverage for

adults prior to the ACA. Hamersma and Kim (2013), Busch and Duchovny (2005), and Aizer and Grog-

ger (2003) find little to no crowdout of private coverage when examining the effects of parental Medicaid

expansions.

    Finally, we distinguish our study from an earlier literature on the the labor supply effects of Medicaid for

single mothers, which mainly focuses on the effects of the decoupling of Medicaid from cash assistance in

the 1980s and early 1990s (Yelowitz, 1995, Ham and Shore-Sheppard, 2005a, and Meyer and Rosenbaum,

2001). The key question in these studies is whether raising the income threshold for Medicaid (from a lower

cash assistance income threshold) increased labor force participation among potential cash assistance recip-

ients (i.e., single mothers) and abstracts away from the potential effect of Medicaid reducing employment

lock.2 In contrast, we focus on a population that, prior to the expansion, was not eligible for Medicaid

or comparable public coverage at any income level. Our estimates therefore should be unaffected by the

potentially offsetting impact of relaxing income constraints.

    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of the major

provisions of the ACA and the Medicaid expansions, as well as some background on the insurance landscape

prior to the reform. Sections 3 and 4 describe our data, sample, and empirical strategy. We present our results

in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.



2    Background on the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010 with the goal of providing near

universal health insurance coverage in the United States. Prior to the reform, publicly provided health in-

surance was generally available only to certain segments of the non-elderly population. State Medicaid

programs covered low-income families (mostly children), pregnant women, the blind, and the disabled. Pri-
    2 An exception is Hamersma and Kim (2009), who explicitly examine the effects of parental Medicaid expansions on job mobil-

ity, finding that Medicaid reduces job lock among unmarried women.


                                                              3
vate insurance was primarily obtained through employment, though not all employees were offered this

coverage. Those who did not meet the criteria to qualify for public coverage, and who did not have access to

employer-sponsored plans often faced high coverage costs in the private individual market. The health re-

form sought to bring affordable coverage to these uninsured individuals through a combination of individual

and employer mandates, the introduction of premium subsidies and reduced cost plans, the establishment of

health insurance exchanges where individuals can shop for coverage, and the expansion of public programs.

Many of these provisions went into effect beginning in 2014, including the individual mandate, establish-

ment of the exchanges, and the expansion of Medicaid programs. Indeed, as shown in Figure 1, our data

show an increase of about 10 million in the number of people insured from 2013 to 2014.

   Originally, the ACA targeted the uninsured at the lower end of the income distribution by requiring states

that accept federal funding for Medicaid (currently, all states and the District of Columbia) to expand cover-

age to all individuals below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Given that children at that income level

were already covered in all states, either by existing Medicaid programs or the Children’s Health Insurance

Program (CHIP), this expansion mainly affected adults, and in particular, those without dependent children

(“childless adults”). Those with incomes above 138 percent of the poverty line (up to 400 percent) would

be eligible for premium subsidies in the form of a refundable tax credit when purchasing private insurance.

Furthermore, those between 138-250 percent of poverty are eligible for plans with lower deductibles and

co-payments.

   In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that requiring states to expand Medicaid was unconstitutional in

National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius. Instead, states may choose to expand

Medicaid, which was completely funded by the federal government starting in 2014, but will drop gradually

to 90 percent funding after 2019. Following the ruling, only about half of the states took up the expansion in

January 2014, and a handful more expanded later in 2014 and 2015. In states that did not expand Medicaid,

premium subsidies were available for those between 100 to 400 percent of poverty, but many adults below

poverty were left without affordable coverage options.

   Prior to 2014, state Medicaid programs generally provided no coverage to the non-disabled, non-elderly

adult population, with several exceptions. The only group of healthy adults that states were required to

cover were very low-income parents of dependent children (typically with incomes well below poverty) and

those who were transitioning out of cash welfare programs. If states wanted to expand eligibility outside of

mandatory coverage groups, they had to receive approval for a “demonstration” waiver. Some states used

                                                      4
these waivers to offer coverage to childless adults, but since the programs were required to be budget neutral

to the federal government, the programs were generally limited in scope.3 According to surveys of state

officials conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Georgetown University, as of 2013, eight states

and the District of Columbia provided childless adults below certain income limits with Medicaid-equivalent

coverage (i.e., the same comprehensive benefits at no cost) (Heberlein et al., 2013a). An additional 13 states

provided a more limited package of benefits to low-income childless adults, though more than half of these

programs were closed to new enrollment.4

    Therefore, when the ACA Medicaid expansions were implemented in 2014, it simultaneously granted

coverage to previously ineligible adults, while relaxing income limits for some who were already enrolled.

Since we are interested in isolating the labor supply effects of providing public health insurance (“employ-

ment lock” effects) from the potentially confounding effects of raising eligibility limits for existing enrollees,

our ideal sample includes only individuals who were not enrolled in Medicaid prior 2014. Since we do not

observe prior coverage in our data, our analysis will be limited to childless adults living in states that did not

have any Medicaid-equivalent coverage prior to 2014.5 We keep the states with more limited benefits in our

analysis, since it is unclear how accessible these programs were and whether they can be viewed as substi-

tutes for employer-sponsored coverage. However, we probe the robustness of our results to the exclusion of

these states below.

    To summarize, the upper panel of Table 1 lists the states without any Medicaid-equivalent coverage for

childless adults in 2013 that constitutes our main analysis sample, as well as their expansion status and date.

We also denote which states in this group had limited benefits to childless adults. The lower panel lists the

states that provided some childless adults with Medicaid-equivalent coverage and are therefore excluded

from our analysis.
    3 The ACA also allowed states to begin covering childless adults beginning in April 2010, but the federal funding for this new

coverage group was limited to the state’s “regular” matching rate until 2014.
    4 This number excludes states that provided coverage contingent on employment or other non-income requirement.
    5 Focusing only on those who were previously ineligible for Medicaid also has the advantange of reducing any confounding

“woodwork” or “welcome mat” effects, which occurs when previously eligible individuals begin to take up Medicaid (“come out
of the woodwork”) following the reform due to increased outreach and advertising (Sommers and Epstein, 2011 and Frean et al.,
2016). To the extent that expansion states have larger “woodwork” effects, this may confound the interpretation of our employment
estimates.




                                                                5
3    Data

Our analysis utilizes data from the annual American Community Survey (ACS) and the monthly Current

Population Survey (CPS). Both surveys are nationally representative and contain labor market, health in-

surance, and demographic information. The ACS surveys a cross-sectional one-percent sample of U.S.

households every year. The CPS surveys about 60,000 households per month, interviewing them for four

consecutive months, followed by a break of eight months, and finally another four months. The ACS data

we use cover 2010-2014, and the CPS data cover 2010 through July 2015.

    We draw our health insurance information from the ACS. Although the CPS also contains health in-

surance information in its annual March supplement, a redesign of the health insurance questions coin-

ciding exactly with the timing of the Medicaid expansions renders it unusable for our purposes (Pascale,

2015). The specific health insurance variables from the ACS that we use are indicators for being covered

by the following types of insurance at the time of the survey: private insurance, private insurance through a

employer-sponsored group plan, private insurance that is directly purchased, and public insurance (Medicaid

or another government program for the low-income or disabled).

    For labor market information, we use both ACS and CPS data. The ACS has the advantage of a larger

sample size, but the CPS contains more nuanced questions on labor force participation, as well as a slightly

longer time horizon post expansion. For both data sets, our main outcome variable is an indicator for being

“at work” in the survey reference week. For intensive margin measures of employment, we use the question

in the CPS that asks the worker for the number of actual hours worked in the reference week. Usual weekly

earnings are reported in the CPS for those who are employed and interviewed in their fourth and eighth

month in the survey. We measure wages by dividing weekly earnings by the number of usual hours worked

per week.

    As mentioned above, prior to the expansion, all states covered low-income parents to some degree, and

several states also had programs that provided childless adults with Medicaid-equivalent coverage. To the

extent that adults who were enrolled in Medicaid prior to the expansion were limiting their labor supply

to stay under income thresholds, any evidence of employment lock would be confounded by workers who

increase their labor supply in response to the relaxed income limits in expansion states. We therefore focus

only on childless adults and restrict the sample to the 42 states in which there was no Medicaid-equivalent

coverage for childless adults in 2013. Later in the analysis, we probe the robustness of our results to includ-


                                                      6
ing only states without any public insurance for childless adults. We consider an individual childless if they

do not share a household with a child under 18. This definition of childless is likely to identify a subset of

the actual population of adults who are excluded from public insurance coverage pre-ACA, as households

with children may contain several families where only a subset of the adults qualify as parents or caregivers

according to state program rules. To avoid potential interactions with military, aged, and dependent health

coverage, we restrict our sample to non-institutionalized, civilian adults, ages 27-64.

    Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for childless adults in the expansion states and non-expansion states

in our sample. Expansion states have higher rates of coverage, mostly coming from employer-sponsored

coverage, though higher rates of Medicaid coverage also contribute to the disparity. In terms of employment

rates, however, the two sets of states look fairly similar, with employment in expansion states only slightly

higher. In terms of demographic differences, the non-expansion states tend to be on average less educated,

more likely to be non-white, and have a higher rate of poverty.

    Since individuals with incomes above the federal poverty line (up to 400 percent of the poverty line)

would be eligible for premium subsidies beginning in 2014 regardless of whether they live in a state that

expanded Medicaid, the expansion will mostly impact those who are below the poverty line. We therefore

also focus on a subsample of childless adults who are below the poverty line. Since a poverty measure

is not readily available in the basic monthly CPS, we use the categorical variable on the total household

income, in conjunction with the number of household members, as a proxy. We define an individual as

below poverty if the upper threshold of their household income category is below the official poverty level

of the interview year, assuming the number of household members is the family size. As expected, this

understates the poverty rate: it is consistently about one percentage point below poverty rates obtained using

the ACS. However, the fraction of individuals below poverty using this measure tracks changes in the ACS’s

poverty rates fairly well over time (not shown).

    Finally, for robustness, we estimate the effects of the Medicaid expansion in a few other subsamples

that utilize additional information available in the CPS. In one subsample, we take advantage of the short

panel structure of the CPS and identify individuals who were employed when surveyed in the previous year.

In linking the respondents over time, we follow Madrian and Lefgren (1999) and match by household and

person identifiers, and invalidating matches that do not have consistent sex, race, and age information. Using

this method, we are able to match about 77 percent of respondents who were in their fifth through eighth

month in the survey. In another subsample, we use self-reported health status information, which fall into

                                                       7
five mutually exclusive categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor, from the Annual Social and

Economic Supplement of the CPS (the “March CPS”).



4      Empirical Strategy

To identify the effects of an expansion in Medicaid coverage, we compare employment in states that did and

did not expand Medicaid, before and after adoption of the policy. Specifically, we estimate differences-in

differences (DD) specifications of the following form:


                                                 yst = β Expst + αs + γt + εst                                                  (1)


where yst are measures of insurance coverage and employment in state s and time t (where t is a month

in CPS samples, and a year in ACS samples), αs are a set of state fixed effects, and γt includes a set of

year fixed effects. When we have monthly data (i.e., in the CPS), γt also includes a set of calendar month

fixed effects to control for seasonal fluctuations in insurance or employment that are common in all states.

Expst is an indicator for whether state s covers childless adults under Medicaid in time t. In the ACS data,

which is available yearly through 2014, states will have at most one period in which Expst is equal to 1.6

In the monthly CPS analysis, for which we have data through July 2015, Expst will equal to 1 starting the

month the expansion is implemented. The coefficient of interest is β , which captures the effect of expanding

Medicaid.

     We estimate the model on on data aggregated to state-year (ACS) or state-month (CPS) averages, and

weight each aggregate by the number of observations in each state-year or state-month cell. In the absence

of individually varying covariates, the weighted aggregate regression is identical to estimating using the

individual level data, up to a degrees-of-freedom adjustment.7 We choose to aggegate the data in this way

to highlight the fact that the effective unit of observation in the context of our quasi-experiment is the state-

year/month. In other words, if we observe more individuals in the states and years we already have in our

existing sample, we are not gaining any more variation in the regressor of interest, and the aggregate analysis

reflects this fact. However, more individual observations do reduce the variance of the estimated insurance
    6 Statesthat expanded in the middle of 2014 and in 2015 (MI, NH, PA, IN) are considered not expanded in the ACS analyses.
    7 In
       our base specification, we do not include any controls other than state and time fixed effects, though our results are robust
to controlling for the demographic composition of states (i.e., age, gender, race, education, and marital status), shown in Appendix
Tables 3 and 4.



                                                                 8
coverage or employment rates for each cell. Thus, the weighting can be viewed as a heteroskedasticity

correction: Since state-year/month cells with more individuals have may have smaller error term variances,

weighting by the cell sizes may improve precision.8 All standard errors are clustered at the state level.

    The identifying assumption is that the employment in expansion states and non-expansion states would

have trended similarly the absence of the Medicaid expansion. One way this would be violated is if only

states with strong or weak labor markets, and whose employment was on an upward or downward trajectory

prior to 2014, choose to take up the expansion. To gauge whether there were pre-existing trends in the

expansion states we replace Expst in equation (1) with a set of “event time” dummies:

                                                      1
                                             yst =   ∑      δk Dkst + αs + γt + εst                                       (2)
                                                     k=−3


where Dkst is equal to 1 if in time t, state s is in its kth year of its Medicaid expansion, and 0 otherwise. If

the outcome in the above equation is employment, the coefficients δk for k < 0 show whether, in the periods

leading up to the expansion, the expansion states had significantly different employment rates relative to the

control group.

    In order to determine whether individuals reduced labor supply in response to the Medicaid availability

from equation (1), there must not have been any offsetting differential increases in labor demand in expan-

sion states relative to non-expansion states. One provision of the ACA that is predicted to have impacts on

labor demand is the employer penalty, which penalizes large employers for not offering employer-sponsored

coverage beginning in 2015. Although all states are subject to this penalty, one way in which the penalty

may interact with the Medicaid expansion to impact labor demand is if the penalty is smaller in expansion

states. This is possible because the penalty is applied to an employer only if an employee claims a premium

tax credit, which may be less likely in states that expand Medicaid. To test this indirectly, we examine the

effects of the expansion on wages, which should increase if there were an offsetting increase in demand.

    We note that in addition to the Medicaid expansions, the ACA established premium subsidies and health

insurance marketplaces in all states, which also had the potential to reduce employment lock. Our identi-

fication strategy, which compares states by expansion status, will therefore be unable to estimate the effect

of the health reform on employment lock more generally. Rather, we will only detect employment effects
    8 Indeed, a modified Breusch-Pagan test that regresses OLS residuals on the inverse of cell sizes confirms the presence of

heteroskedasticity when the outcome is employment in our main ACS and CPS samples (Solon et al., 2015). In addition, we report
the estimates without weighting in Appendix Tables 3 and 4.



                                                                9
for a relatively low-income population whose incomes are not high enough to qualify for subsidies to pur-

chase health insurance on the new exchanges. We therefore also estimate our models on low-income and

“Medicaid-likely” subsamples described below in Section 5.

    Finally, it is also possible that because the premium subsidies are only available to those between 100 to

400 percent of the federal poverty line, workers in non-expansion states may increase their labor supply in

order to obtain subsidized private coverage. This effect works in same direction as the the employment lock

effects (i.e., non-expansion states would have relatively higher employment), biasing our results upward in

absolute value. For this reason, in some specifications, we estimate equation (1) on a sample of workers

who were previously employed.



5    Results

We begin by graphically examining insurance and employment trends in our sample of childless adults

in expansion states and non-expansion states. In Figures 2 and 3, we only include states that expanded in

January 2014 (17 states) and states that have not expanded (21 states), though our estimates will also include

the handful of states that expanded later than January 2014. Figure 2a shows that, as expected, Medicaid

coverage sharply increased in expansion states after 2014, while the increase was much milder in non-

expansion states. In Figure 2b, we plot overall coverage rates. In 2014, when several major provisions of the

ACA came into effect, including the individual mandate and the opening of the health insurance exchanges,

insurance rates in both expansion and non-expansion states increased, though the increase was larger in

expansion states. The magnitude of this difference is smaller than the difference in Medicaid coverage,

suggesting that individuals who were ineligible for Medicaid in non-expansion states were differentially

more likely to obtain private insurance via employment or through the newly established exchanges. When

we plot the annual employment rates in expansion and non-expansion states in Figure 3, however, there is no

evidence that employment in expansion states is lower than in non-expansion states.9 If anything, in states

that expanded Medicaid, employment may have increased.

    In Table 3, we present our DD estimates of the effect of the Medicaid expansions on health coverage
    9 The differences in employment rates and trends between the ACS and CPS data are likely due to the smaller sample sizes in

the CPS. In Appendix Figure 1, we compare the employment-to-population ratio (16+ year-old) estimated from the CPS and ACS
in expansion and non-expansion states to those obtained using the Current Employment Statistics (CES). Though we are unable to
compare the employment rates in our main sample (childless adults) to the employment rates in the CES, the trends in the CES
most closely match the ACS for the overall adult population. Note that the CES does not contain farm employment.



                                                              10
rates. Consistent with Figures 2 and 3, the first two columns of Panel A show that there was a significant dif-

ference in the fraction of childless adults insured and insured by Medicaid of 1.6 and 3.0 percentage points,

respectively, between expansion states and non-expansion states after the policy was in place. Column 3

confirms that a relative decrease in private insurance contributed to the smaller overall increase in insurance

coverage than implied by the increase in Medicaid coverage. In columns 4 and 5 we examine whether this

crowdout is coming from employer-sponsored group coverage. The point estimates indicate that the 3.0

percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage in expansion states is crowded out by a 0.9 percentage point

reduction in private direct purchase insurance, and 0.3 percentage point reduction in employer-sponsored

coverage, though the latter is statistically insignificant.

    The total “crowdout” implied by our estimates is 42 percent, with about 11 percent coming from

employer-sponsored insurance and 31 percent from direct purchase insurance. These estimates are within

the range of estimates of crowdout during the Medicaid and CHIP expansions to low-income children (Cut-

ler and Gruber, 1996, LoSasso and Buchmueller, 2004 and Gruber and Simon, 2008). However, we note that

it is somewhat misleading to relate previous measures of crowdout to the current setting, as many changes in

health policy and overall insurance coverage coincide with this particular Medicaid expansion. In past work,

the interpretation has been that expansions of public insurance led to some dropping of employer-sponsored

coverage among already insured individuals or dependents. Due to the individual mandate, as well as other

provisions in the ACA, the fraction insured increased sharply in 2014 for both expansion and non-expansion

states. The expansion in Medicaid was “crowded out” in the sense that, in the absence of Medicaid coverage,

some of the uninsured would have obtained coverage by purchasing insurance directly, perhaps through the

newly established state exchanges, where they can select from a menu of affordable coverage options.

    Turning to our employment results in the first two columns of Table 4, we find a statistically insignificant

difference in employment rates in expansion states following the policy change. The point estimates from

the CPS data indicate that there may even have been a positive employment effect in expansion states.

In columns 3 and 4, we examine whether there were potential intensive margin responses to Medicaid

coverage. If employer-sponsored coverage is only available to full-time employees, we may expect the

Medicaid expansion to allow workers who previously worked full-time only to obtain health insurance to

switch to a better-matched part-time job. We do not find evidence that individuals are reducing their hours

worked following the Medicaid expansion: Part-time employment (those working fewer than 20 hours a

week) remained unchanged and full-time employment (those working 30 or more hours a week) may even

                                                        11
have increased. Finally, since the employment lock effect is only relevant for the employed, we estimate

employment effects among those who were employed in the prior year, using the CPS’s short longitudinal

structure. Column 5 shows that the expansion did not affect employment outflows.

    In panels B and C of Tables 3 and 4, we present the analogous results for two subsamples of childless

adults who are more likely to be impacted by the Medicaid expansion. As mentioned above, since subsidies

for directly purchasing insurance are available for those above poverty in all states, employment lock among

higher income groups is expected to be reduced regardless of expansion status and would not be detected

by our DD strategy. We therefore examine the effects among those with incomes below the poverty line.

Panel B of Table 3 shows that, relative to all childless adults, the Medicaid expansion had a much larger

impact on the the overall insured rate among childless adults below poverty, increasing the rate of Medicaid

coverage by 11.1 percentage points and overall coverage by 7.9 percentage points. There is evidence of

some crowd out of both private employer-sponsored and direct purchase coverage of 1.0 and 2.0 percentage

points, respectively. When we examine the effects of the expansion on employment in Table 4, we again

find that there are no statistically significant effects on employment rates, nor any adjustment in labor supply

along the intensive margin.10

    We note that restricting the sample to only those below poverty is problematic if the composition of

this groups differs in expansion and non-expansion states. In particular, workers may reduce labor supply

in order to qualify for Medicaid, resulting in an increased poverty rate in expansion states.11 In Panel C

of Tables 3 and 4 we therefore also show an alternative subsample containing a subset of childless adults

who are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid as predicted by fixed demographic characteristics. To

do this, we estimate a linear probability model of Medicaid enrollment, with household size, educational

attainment, age categories, sex, marital status, and race as predictors.12 We use the coefficients from this

model to predict the probability of being on Medicaid in both the ACS and CPS childless adult samples.

The “Medicaid likely” subsample shown in the bottom panels of Tables 3 and 4 are those who are above

the median in terms of their predicted Medicaid probabilities. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 show that the

first stage estimates of the Medicaid expansion on overall coverage (2.6 percentage points) and Medicaid
  10 Although we are able to estimate and report the results on continued employment and wages in the last two columns, we note

that the estimates, especially in the below-poverty sample, suffer from small cell sizes.
  11 We also estimate equation (1) with y as the fraction of the population below poverty in state s at time t, and present the
                                            st
estimate of β in Appendix Table 1. The statistically insignificant negative coefficient indicates that increased rates of poverty in
response to the Medicaid expansion is unlikely confound our findings.
  12 Specifically, we use indicators for each household size (7 dummies), detailed education categories (14 dummies), five-year age

groups (8 dummies), sex, marital status (5 dummies), and race (2 dummies).


                                                                12
coverage (4.6 percentage points) are stronger in this subsample relative to all childless adults, as expected.

However, the (insignificant) employment effects are of roughly similar magnitudes (Table 4).

    Using the estimates from column 2 of Table 3 and column 1 of Table 4, a 95 percent confidence interval

indicates that the implied “treatment effect on the treated” (TOT) of Medicaid on employment is no more

negative than 15 percentage points (from “Medicaid-likely” subsample). To put these numbers in context, we

compare our estimates with three recent studies on the impact of Medicaid on the labor supply of childless

adults. As mentioned in the introduction, the most compelling evidence we have so far on the potential

for the public insurance expansions in the ACA to reduce employment lock comes from states that have

recently stopped or started enrollment in public insurance programs for childless adults. Garthwaite et

al. (2014) examine a large disenrollment in Tennessee’s childless adult program in 2005 and find that 63

percent of those who lost Medicaid increased their labor supply, though the 95 percent confidence interval

ranges from about five percent to well over 100 percent.13 Dague et al. (2014) find much smaller but still

significant and precisely estimated employment effects ranging from 2.4 to 10.6 percentage points after an

enrollment freeze in Wisconsin’s childless adult program in 2009. Finally, Baicker et al. (2014)’s estimate

from the Oregon Health Experiment, where wait-listed childless adults were randomly invited to enroll in

the program, is that Medicaid reduced employment by 1.6 percentage points (statistically insignificant).

Our point estimates are closest to Baicker et al. (2014)’s small and insignificant point estimates, though our

estimates do not rule out the moderately sized effects that were found in Dague et al. (2014).

    One possible explanation for the widely disparate findings in the state-specific case studies is that they

may be studying very different subpopulations. Employment lock would be most relevant for those who

highly value health insurance (i.e., those who are or who have dependents in poor health), and/or who

have relatively low labor force attachment. The population studied in Garthwaite et al. (2014) are exactly

those with higher than average taste for health insurance (due to earlier recertification reforms), while the

population studied in Baicker et al. (2014) are those who have gone without coverage for at least six months,

and may have lower than average taste for coverage. To see whether these differences across populations

may explain the different results, we estimate our models on subgroups of childless adults who are likely

to have larger employment responses to Medicaid coverage. First, we estimate the effects of the expansion

on those who tend to have lower labor market attachment: females, those age 50 or older, and high school
  13 These numbers use only the confidence interval on the reduced form effect on employment, and does not account for the
estimation of the first stage.



                                                           13
dropouts. Then, as a proxy for health insurance preferences, we also estimate the employment effects

among those with a self-reported health of poor, fair, or good (available in the March CPS only). The first

two panels of Table 5 show that the Medicaid expansions had similar effects on insurance coverage and

employment among females and older individuals as in the overall childless adult population. Among high

school dropouts, the expansions had a larger impact on Medicaid coverage, and there is also less evidence

of private insurance crowdout. Correspondingly, there is no evidence of employment effects. Finally, in

the last panel, we find no statistically significant employment effects among those with self-reported health

ranging from poor to good (about 38 percent of respondents).

    A potential explanation for the zero to positive employment response is that expansion states experienced

a relative increase in labor demand. As mentioned above, since the ACA mandated that employers with over

50 full-time equivalent employees are required to provide group coverage and were penalized for every

worker who claims a premium tax credit (excluding the first 30), it is possible that employers in states

that expanded Medicaid anticipate lower labor costs because they are less likely to be penalized for lack of

coverage.14 We test for a possible increase in labor demand by examining the wage response in expansion

states, which should be positive if there were simultaneous increases in labor demand and decreases in labor

supply. In the last column of Table 4, we report the DD coefficient when we estimate equation (1) with the

average log wages as outcomes. We find no significant effects of the Medicaid expansion on wages.

    As mentioned above, the validity of the differences-in-differences strategy for identifying a causal effect

of expanding Medicaid depends crucially on the idea that labor market trends were comparable in states

that expanded relative to those that did not. One particular concern is that states that expected upward

growth in employment are more likely to take up the Medicaid expansion, masking any employment lock

effects. We check to see whether expansion states were on a different employment trajectory prior to the

expansion by estimating equation (2) and plotting the estimates of δk in Appendix Figure 2. The statistically

insignificant estimates of the δk coefficients for k ≤ 0 and lack of visual pre-trends indicate that there were

no systematic differences between expansion states and non-expansion states in the periods leading up to

the policy change.

    In Appendix Table 2, we probe the robustness of our results to the exclusion of certain states. First,

as we mention in Section 2, 13 states provided low-income childless adults with limited benefit plans prior

to 2014. Of these 13 states, 11 subsequently chose to expand coverage in 2014, as shown in Table 1. To
  14 Note   that the employer mandate does not come into effect until the beginning of 2015.


                                                                 14
the extent that the enrollees in these limited plans were previously constrained to work fewer hours due

to the low income thresholds, it is possible that the Medicaid expansions led to increased labor supply,

confounding the effects of employment lock. The upper panel of Appendix Table 2 shows the estimates of

our main DD specifications using excluding these 13 states. A second concern is that while most expansion

states implemented the policy at the beginning of 2014, a handful of states expanded later in the year and

in 2015. In states that expanded later, it is possible that the timing of the policy was determined by factors

related to the state’s economy and labor market. Therefore, in the lower panel of Appendix Table 2, we

include only the states that expanded in January of 2014 and non-expansion states.15 The results from both

of these alternative sample restrictions mirror the results from Table 4.



6      Conclusion

In this study, we examine whether the recent expansions in Medicaid reduced “employment lock” among

childless adults who were previously ineligible for public coverage. To do this, we use a differences-in-

differences strategy that compares employment in states that chose to expand Medicaid versus those that

chose not to expand, before and after implementation. We find that although the expansion increased Med-

icaid coverage by 3.0 percentage points among childless adults, there was no significant impact on the

employment. Our estimates rule out the large employment lock effects of Garthwaite et al. (2014) and are

similar to that of Baicker et al. (2014).

      We close with several potential explanations for the different estimates across studies. First, as noted by

both Baicker et al. (2014) and Dague et al. (2014), the population studied by Garthwaite et al. (2014) is a

higher income population than those most affected by the Medicaid expansions in the ACA. It is possible that

the types of jobs that individuals living below poverty are able to obtain are less likely to come with health

benefits. Another explanation is that the considerable policy uncertainty surrounding the ACA’s Medicaid

expansion may have dampened or delayed employment responses: If workers “locked” into employment for

insurance reasons perceive the Medicaid expansions to be temporary due to constitutional or implementation

challenges, they may be reluctant to leave their jobs and employer-sponsored insurance coverage. As the

dust settles, however, it is possible that we will begin to see the predicted impacts on the labor market.
    15 This
          excludes PA, NH, IN AK, and MI. We also exclude WI because while it did allow childless adults in Medicaid starting
in 2014, it is not considered technically expanded because the program is limited to those under 100 percent FPL and will not be
accepting the enhanced federal funding for childless adult coverage.



                                                              15
Therefore, while our early estimates suggest that the labor market impacts of the Medicaid expansions are

smaller than anticipated, medium- and long- term impacts remain an important avenue for future research.
