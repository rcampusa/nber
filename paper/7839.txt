1       Introduction
A common textbook example of how economic theory can be used to guide policy comes
in the relationship between tax cuts and household spending. Standard versions of the
Permanent Income theory of consumption imply that the marginal propensity to consume
out of transitory shocks to income is close to zero, while the marginal propensity to con-
sume out of permanent shocks is close to (or equal to) one. Thus, economic policymakers
are advised that if they wish to stimulate consumption via an income tax cut, they should
make it permanent. While policymakers do not always heed this advice,1 economists in
the business of making policy recommendations usually express little doubt about its
sagacity.
    The point of this paper is that the economics profession’s traditional conﬁdence that
the MPC out of permanent tax cuts is close to one may be misplaced.2 The potential
problem is that the model which produces the implication of an MPC of one does not
allow for habits in consumption. A host of recent papers have argued that models with
habits are more consistent with, variously, the short-term dynamics of aggregate con-
sumption in the U.S. and other countries (Fuhrer (2000); Fuhrer and Klein (1998)); the
level of the equity premium (Abel (1990, 1999); Constantinides (1990); Jermann (1998));
the cyclical properties of asset prices (Campbell and Cochrane (1999)); and the long-
term behavior of aggregate saving rates in Japan and other East Asian countries which
have experienced increasing saving rates in the wake of their takeoﬀs into rapid growth
(Carroll and Weil (1994); Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000)). Most of these papers
have proposed habit formation to explain puzzles that seem to have little to do with the
marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income.3 But this paper argues that
habits strong enough to solve these other puzzles imply an MPC out of permanent shocks
of much less than one. Alternatively, a credible empirical measurement of an MPC out
of permanent shocks that is close to one would constitute a blow to the proposition that
habit formation is the right explanation of these other puzzles.
    The intuition for why habits generate a low MPC is simple: Habits tend to pull
consumption in the direction of its past level (to borrow a metaphor from monetary
economics, they make consumption ‘sticky’). Delving a bit deeper into the logic, habits
make the level of consumption sluggish essentially because they imply that utility is
aﬀected not only by the level of consumption but also by consumption growth. Just
as the traditional model without habits implies that the level of consumption should be
smoothed, habits imply that consumption growth should be smoothed. Thus, in response,
say, to a positive shock to permanent income, the same amount of cumulative total increase
    1
     A recent example is President Bush’s 1992 attempt to stimulate consumer spending by reducing the
rate at which taxes are withheld from paychecks, without changing statutory tax rates.
   2
     The traditional deﬁnition of the marginal propensity to consume out of x is the immediate change
in consumption induced by a change in x; thus, asserting that the MPC out of permanent shocks is less
than one does not violate an intertemporal budget constraint that requires that changes in income must
eventually be reﬂected in consumption.
   3
     The exception is the work by Fuhrer (2000) who is explicitly concerned with matching the dynamic
response of aggregate consumption to shocks, of which permanent tax cuts are but one example.


                                                  2
in consumption will yield more utility if that change is spread out over an extended period
of smoothly higher-than-normal growth than if the entire response is concentrated into a
single growth spike that happens instantly when the good news arrives (as would happen
in the standard model).
    One country where the question of the magnitude of the marginal propensity to con-
sume out of permanent tax cuts is a critical policy issue at the moment is Japan, where
there is widespread agreement that some form of ﬁscal and/or monetary stimulus might
help lift the economy out of the stagnation of the past decade. Permanent income tax
cuts are one of the most widely recommended policies among the advocates of ﬁscal stim-
ulus. However, Japan is a leading example of a country where rapid growth seems to have
stimulated subsequent increases in the saving rate,4 a pattern of behavior that appears to
be inconsistent with the standard permanent income model but that Carroll, Overland,
and Weil (2000) suggest can be explained by habit formation. As a way of organizing
the theoretical question around a concrete example, this paper therefore examines a habit
formation model parameterized to roughly match the increase in saving in Japan and
shows that the MPC out of permanent tax cuts is somewhere in the neighborhood of 30
percent in that model - leading to the conclusion that even permanent income tax cuts
may not be an eﬀective way to stimulate aggregate demand quickly in Japan.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model, which is
an extension (incorporating permanent income and shocks thereto) of the growth model
with habits in Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000). Section 3 parameterizes the model
both in the baseline case where habits are unimportant and in the case where habits
matter. Section 4 shows that the model without habits has trouble explaining the rise in
the saving rate, to world-beating highs, that took place in Japan from the mid-1950s to
the mid-1970s. However, when habits are added the model becomes much more capable of
predicting that increases in growth cause increases in saving as apparently seen in Japan
and other East Asian countries.5 Section 5 examines the implications of the two models
(without habits and with them) for the MPC out of permanent shocks, and shows that
the implication of the habit formation model of a low MPC out of permanent shocks is
robust. The ﬁnal section concludes.


2       Theory
In theoretical terms, the goal in this paper is to take the model of economic growth with
habit formation described in Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000) (henceforth C-O-W) and
enrich it suﬃciently so that we can derive implications of habit formation for the marginal
propensity to consume out of stochastic permanent shocks to noncapital income. Since the
    4
     Although Hayashi (1986) argues that the oﬃcial statistics overstate the level of the saving rate in
Japan, even after making the adjustments that Hayashi proposes, the saving rate increases greatly over
time.
   5
     And elsewhere: Attanasio, Picci, and Scorcu (2000) and Rodrik (1999) ﬁnd evidence that increases
in growth cause increases in saving across the whole swath of countries included in the World Bank’s new
dataset on saving and growth around the world.

                                                   3
C-O-W model incorporated neither labor (or broadly, noncapital) income nor uncertainty,
the model needs to be modiﬁed substantially.
    C-O-W assumed that aggregate income was generated by a Rebelo-style Y = AK ag-
gregate production function, in which all aggregate income can be interpreted as capital
income. This was done because the assumption of an AK production function simpli-
ﬁes the problem greatly, since labor income is eliminated and the aggregate interest rate
is constant. Solving the problem with a more traditional CRS neoclassical production
function of the form Y = F (K, L) would have been much harder because to decide the
proper level of current consumption the representative agent would have needed to forecast
the evolution of wages and interest rates, which depends upon the level of current con-
sumption, and so on recursively. Numerical solution methods are available but extremely
cumbersome when habits are involved.
    The diﬃculties posed by adding a realistic treatment of idiosyncratic uncertainty are
even greater. The macroeconomics literature has largely used representative agent models
not because such models are inherently appealing but because the technical challenges
of solving and simulating models with idiosyncratic uncertainty and heterogeneity are
formidable when there is a neoclassical aggregate production function. The problem is
that the evolution of the capital stock depends in principle upon the entire distribution of
savings across households. Because the path of wages and interest rates in a model with
a standard neoclassical production function depends on the path of the capital stock, in
principle the model contains an M-dimensional state variable (the levels of wealth for each
of the M consumers). Since the ‘curse of dimensionality’ makes it diﬃcult to solve models
numerically when there are as few as 2 state variables, the problem appears intractable
(although Per Krusell and Anthony Smith (1998) have recently shown that it is more
tractable than it appears).
    Here I will avoid those complexities by assuming that we are examining a small open
economy in which wages and interest rates are determined by international factor markets.
Thus, the gross rate of return after depreciation is ﬁxed at R = (1 + r), the deprecia-
tion rate is ﬁxed at δ, and labor income growth is assumed to come from an exogenous
improvement in aggregate labor productivity at rate G = (1 + g) from one period to
the next. Net aggregate income will then simply be wL + rK, and gross income will be
wL + (r + δ)K.
    I assume that each inﬁnitely-lived consumer in this economy is endowed with one
unit of labor which is supplied inelastically in an aggregate labor market. The individual
consumer’s labor income is subject to multiplicative idiosyncratic transitory shocks i,t+1
              i,t+1 ] = 1.6 Idiosyncratic ‘permanent labor income’ is deﬁned as the level
such that Et [˜
of labor income that would obtain for individual i if the transitory shock to labor income
took on its mean value of one. Permanent labor income Pi,t is also subject to lognormally
   6
     The notational convention will be that stochastic variables have a ∼ over them when their expectation
is being taken, but not otherwise, on the grounds that equations where the expectation is being taken
are the only kinds of equations where the time period from which the equation is being viewed is well-
speciﬁed. Hence we write the transitory shock to labor income in period as i,t+1 but its expectation as
Et [˜
    i,t+1 ].

distributed shocks Ni,t+1 (again such that Et [Ñi,t+1 ] = 1) in each period; the marginal
propensity to consume out of permanent income will be determined by examining the
response of consumption to these shocks.7
    Denoting by Hi,t the habit stock inherited from past consumption behavior, and des-
ignating total resources available for consumption (the sum of undepreciated past capital,
current capital income, and current labor income) as Xi,t , the consumer’s optimization
problem for a ﬁnite horizon beginning at the current period t and ending at period T (and
dropping the i subscripts to reduce clutter) is given by

where Kt is the proportion of total available resources from the beginning of the period Xt
that have not been consumed at the end of the period. Habits as of the beginning of next
period Ht+1 will have moved from where they started out in this period (Ht ) toward this
period’s consumption. Next period’s total resources Xt+1 will equal the return R = (1+r)
(net of depreciation) on this period’s end-of-period capital, plus labor income Yt+1 . Labor
income will equal permanent labor income Pt+1 multiplied by the transitory shock t+1 ,
and permanent labor income next period will equal permanent labor income this period
increased by the gross labor productivity growth factor G = (1 + g) and multiplied by
a stochastic shock to permanent income Nt+1 with mean one. As usual, the recursive
nature of the problem allows us to rewrite the maximand as:
                                                                                  
            Vt (Xt , Pt , Ht ) = max u(Ct , Ht ) + βEt Vt+1 (X̃t+1 , P̃t+1 , Ht+1 ) .    (7)
                                   {Ct }

      Following C-O-W the utility function is of the form
                                                       (Ct /Htγ )1−ρ
                                   u(Ct , Ht ) =                     .                           (8)
                                                          1−ρ
This form has several appealing characteristics as a way to model habits. The ﬁrst is its
intuitive structure: Fuhrer (2000) and Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000) show that in
the steady-state of the nonstochastic model, the quantity which yields utility by being
raised to the (1 − ρ) power becomes
                                  CH −γ = C 1−γ (1 + g/λ)γ                                       (9)

where g is the steady-state growth rate of consumption. Thus, utility is derived from
a geometric mean of the level and the (scaled) growth rate of consumption, and the
parameter γ allows us to ‘tune’ the importance of habits in utility. If γ = 0 then only the
absolute level of consumption is important (the standard CRRA model), while if γ = 1,
then consumption relative to the habit stock (i.e., growth) is all that matters. For the
feasible values of γ between zero and one, both the absolute and the relative levels are
important. For example, if γ = .5, then a person with consumption of 2 and habit stock
of 1 would have the same utility as a person with both consumption and habit stock equal
                                      1
to 4. Finally, we assume that ρ > 1−γ   , a technical condition required for the solution to
be well behaved.
    Another important feature of this speciﬁcation, particularly for a model with sub-
stantial microeconomic uncertainty, is that so long as consumption remains positive, the
utility function remains ﬁnite and well-deﬁned. This is in contrast with ‘subtractive’
utility functions of the form u(C, H) = (C − γH)1−ρ /(1 − ρ) used, for example, by Con-
stantinides (1990). In such models, if γ is substantially greater than zero then microeco-
nomically plausible amounts of variation in consumption can lead to negative values for
(C − γH) and therefore to nonsensical values for utility.8
    The model as written has three continuously-valued state variables, Xt , Ht , and Pt .
Given the computational challenges of solving models with three state variables, it be-
hooves us to consider whether the dimensionality of the problem can somehow be reduced.
It turns out that it can: the model can be recast by dividing all stock and ﬂow variables by
the level of permanent income, and then becomes a problem in two state variables and per-
manent income becomes simply a scaling term. Speciﬁcally, deﬁne xt = Xt /Pt , ct = Ct /Pt ,
and so on. The accumulation equation for xt is

                               Xt+1 = R[Xt − Ct ] + Yt+1
                           xt+1 Pt+1 = RPt [xt − ct ] + Pt+1 t+1
                                xt+1 = (R/Gt+1 Nt+1 )[xt − ct ] + t+1

and the equation for ht+1 is

                                      Ht+1 = Ht + λ(Ct − Ht )
                                  ht+1 Pt+1 = ht Pt + λ(ct Pt − ht Pt )
                           ht+1 Gt+1 Nt+1 Pt = Pt (ht + λ(ct − ht ))
                                               ht + λ(ct − ht )
                                       ht+1 =                   .
                                                  Gt+1 Nt+1

    Campbell and Cochrane (1999) use the subtractive formulation, but assume that the accumulation
equation for h takes a nonlinear form that causes h to fall as c gets closer and closer to h, preventing c
from ever falling below h. Aside from its role in averting negative values of c − h, however, the eﬀects
and meaning of this nonlinear accumulation equation are diﬃcult to understand.

will be given by Ct (Xt , Ht , Pt ) = ct (Xt /Pt , Ht /Pt )Pt .
    The methods in Carroll (1996) can be extended to this case to prove that the successive
rules will converge if the ‘impatience’ condition

                                    RβEt [(G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )−ρ̂ ] < 1,                             (11)

holds, where ρ̂ = ρ + γ(1 − ρ) and this condition corresponds to a requirement that
consumers are suﬃciently impatient that as wealth approaches inﬁnity eventually a point
arrives at which they would wish to consume more than their current labor and capital
income.9 Details of the solution method can be found in the appendix.


3       Parameterization
This section begins by parameterizing the baseline version of the model with intertempo-
rally separable utility, then considers parameterizing the habit formation version of the
model.
    I choose conventional assumptions for the time preference rate β = .97 and net in-
terest rate R = 1.03, where the time period of the model is interpreted as a year. The
depreciation rate is taken from Hayashi (1997), who reports (p. 298) that the average
depreciation rate in Japan over the past 40 years has been about δ = .09. The baseline
coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion will be ρ = 3, in the middle of the range from 1 to 5 tra-
ditionally considered plausible. Finally, Carroll (1992) and several other studies ﬁnd that
the household labor income process in the United States is relatively well-characterized by
a distribution with three components. With some small probability p, household income
is equal to zero (i.e., with probability p,  = 0 - these events in the data occur chieﬂy
during unemployment spells); when household income is not equal to zero,  is distributed
lognormally with σ 2 = 0.10; and N is lognormally distributed with standard deviation
σN = 0.10; in the absence of corresponding empirical results for Japan we use the US
numbers for σ 2 and σN  2
                          . The unemployment rate in Japan has typically ranged from 2-4
percent over most of the postwar period. Accordingly the probability of an unemployment
    9
     This is the counterpart to the impatience condition derived in Deaton (1991) for the model with
liquidity constraints and in Carroll (1996) in the unconstrained case.

spell in which Y = 0 is set at p = 0.02 or two percent.10
    Recent work by Fuhrer (2000) provides some evidence about how to parameterize the
habit formation component of the model. Fuhrer estimates a perfect foresight version of
the C-O-W model on quarterly U.S. data and obtains a fairly tight parameter estimate
of γ = 0.8 for the parameter that indexes the importance of habits in utility. We follow
Fuhrer and set γ = 0.8.11
    For the purposes of this paper, the baseline habit formation model is parameterized
in such a way as to keep the inﬁnite-horizon coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion equal to
the plausible value of three speciﬁed in the baseline model with intertemporally separable
utility. As C-O-W show, the inﬁnite-horizon coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion in this
model is equal to (ρ + γ(1 − ρ)). To make this quantity equal to 3 given that γ = 0.8 as
estimated by Fuhrer, it is necessary to assume an instantaneous coeﬃcient of relative risk
aversion of ρ = 11.12
    The ﬁnal parametric choice is for the speed at which habits catch up to consumption,
λ. The baseline value is λ = 0.2, the value used in C-O-W for most of their analysis.
This value implies that the half-life with which habits move toward consumption is about
three years (because (1 − .2)3 = .512 ≈ 1/2). After presenting the results under these
baseline parameter values we will explore sensitivity of our results to this and our other
parametric assumptions.


4      Saving and Growth Redux
As a preliminary experiment with the model, we need to reexamine the question that
motivated the original work in C-O-W: is the apparent fact that growth causes saving
consistent with the baseline model without habits, and if not does adding habits help?
   Before attempting to answer this question we must specify the stochastic process
governing growth in this economy. Roughly speaking, the postwar history of growth in
Japan falls into three periods. The ﬁrst of these was the period of astonishingly rapid
growth from the late 1940s to the mid 1970s, which far exceeded the growth experience
  10
     A number less than the observed unemployment rate was chosen because the spells in this model
are assumed to last for a full year and there are no unemployment beneﬁts or other social insurance
mechanisms. Since both of these assumptions are probably too strong, we compensate by choosing a low
value of p.
  11
     Oddly, when the same model is estimated on a set of several countries in Fuhrer and Klein (1998),
Japan is the only country in which the model with habits is not statistically diﬀerent from the standard
model without habits. However, the Fuhrer and Klein paper uses high frequency variation in the data
to identify the structural relationships, and many aspects of Japanese NIPA data appear to have strange
properties at high frequencies. For example, Campbell and Mankiw (1991) ﬁnd that Japan is the only
country in which income growth is so unpredictable that their consumption model cannot even be esti-
mated. In any case, the Fuhrer and Klein paper does not provide point estimates for γ and λ for Japan,
so is simply not possible to use their results to parameterize this paper’s model.
  12
     Such a high value for the instantaneous coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion may seem implausible;
however, this is essentially the mechanism that allows models with habits to explain the equity premium.
Thus rejecting an instantaneous value of ρ = 11 is equivalent to rejecting the habit formation explanation
of the equity premium puzzle. See Campbell and Cochrane (1999) for more discussion of this issue.

                                                    8
of any other country in any previous era of human history. The second was the period
beginning in the early 1970s and ending in the late 1980s when Japan still managed to
achieve an impressive growth rate but not one that was radically higher than the growth
achieved in other industrialized countries. The third era is of course the decade of the
1990s when Japan’s growth has been dismal. In none of these three cases can a compelling
case be made that the change in ‘growth regime’ was widely anticipated in advance. The
simplest model that seems to capture this pattern of experience is a ﬁrst-order Markov
transition process for the underlying level of the growth process. For simplicity of analysis,
I will assume a two-state rather than a three-state Markov process that switches between
GL = 1.02 during the Low growth state and GH = 1.06 during the High growth state
with transition matrix

                                         GLt+1      GHt+1
                                 GLt   1-(1/30)     1/30
                                 GHt     1/30     1-(1/30)

where the transition probabilities are chosen so that the expected duration of the high
and low growth periods is 30 years, which roughly corresponds to the length of time Japan
stayed in the high-growth regime (mid-40’s to mid-70’s). In concord with this baseline
transition matrix, our simulation results will track an economy over a 90 year period that
consists of a 30-year-long period of slow growth followed by a 30-year-long period of fast
growth followed by a switch back to the low-growth state for the ﬁnal 30 periods.
    Having speciﬁed the actual growth process, we now turn to the question of how con-
sumers perceive that growth process. It turns out that the eﬀect of growth on saving
depends quite importantly on consumers’ expectations, and the appropriate assumption
to make is not at all clear. On the one hand, surely nobody in Japan (or anywhere else
for that matter) knew in the late 1940s that the country had just embarked on what
would turn out to be the most impressive and sustained period of economic growth that
the world had ever seen, in any country, in any era. On the other hand, once Japan had
been growing at this remarkable pace for, say, twenty years, it seems probable that the
twenty-ﬁrst year of rapid growth did not come as a complete surprise. Similar considera-
tions apply with respect to the period of very slow growth since 1989: presumably nobody
knew in 1989 what a dismal decade the 1990s would be. But after the poor performance
of the period through 1998, slow growth in 1999 was hardly a shock.
    A potentially plausible formal model of households’ perceptions about the income pro-
cess would be one in which households engage in Bayesian updating with respect to their
beliefs about which state the economy is in and about the values in the transition ma-
trices. However, such an exercise would greatly increase the already formidable diﬃculty
of solving the model, because it would be necessary for consumers to forecast their own
future forecasts and their own future forecasts of future forecasts, and so on. Instead, we
present two sets of results, each of which corresponds to one of the extreme possibilities:
either consumers always have perfect knowledge of the current state of the economy and
the transition probabilities (consumers are ‘smart’) or they attach equal probability at

                                              9
all times to the probability that the economy is in each of the two states (consumers are
‘dumb’) and thus they always forecast growth to be equal to the mean of growth in the
low state and growth in the high state. Presumably, the truth lies somewhere in between,
and presumably the results that would emerge from the Bayesian updating model would
also lie between the results that emerge from the two extreme cases presented here.
    A last detail is how we specify the initial state of our economy at the beginning of the
simulations. The usual procedure is simply to simulate the model for a long ‘presample’
period and then to begin monitoring it at the beginning of the period that is deﬁned as
the ‘sample’ period. Our procedure yields similar results but is more eﬃcient: in the
ﬁrst period of ‘life’ of our economy we endow all of the consumers in our model with a
stock of cash-on-hand and a habit stock equal to the ‘target’ values that are implied by
their consumption rules and their expectations. Speciﬁcally, the target value x∗ for xt is
deﬁned as the value of x such that Et [x̃t+1 ] = xt , and similarly h∗ is the value of ht such
that Et [h̃t+1 ] = ht . Actually, it is necessary to deﬁne x∗ and h∗ jointly, because the value
of each variable aﬀects the value of the other. Thus

                          xt+1 = (R/Gt+1 Nt+1 )(xt − ct ) + t+1
                                                      2
                     Et [x̃t+1 ] = Et [R/G̃t+1 ] exp[σN ](xt − ct ) + 1
                             x = Et [R/G̃t+1 ] exp[σN ](x∗ − c(x∗ , h∗ )) + 1
                              ∗                       2
                                                                                                 (12)

where we use the fact that if log N ∼ N (−σN

can write

                                        G̃t+1 Ñt+1
                         h = ((1 − λ)h∗ + λc(x∗ , h∗ )) exp[σN

and the target values of x∗ and h∗ are those values that satisfy equations (12) and (13)
simultaneously.

4.1     Dumb Consumers
As will be evident shortly, the actual average amount of wealth held by consumers in
this economy tends to be fairly close to the target stocks deﬁned by equations (12) and
(13).13 This is convenient because it allows us to use the expressions for the targets to
gain insight about the behavior of the aggregates.
    For example, consider a consumer in the baseline model (without habits) who happens
to hold exactly what he perceives to be his target stock of wealth in period t, xt = x∗ . But
recall that the ‘target’ wealth is deﬁned with respect to the expectation about the growth
  13
    This is unsurprising, but remember that because the decision rules are nonlinear, in principle the
average and ‘target’ values of xt and ht need not be close.

rate of permanent income G, which dumb consumers perceive to be given by Pr(Gt+1 =
GH ) = Pr(Gt+1 = GL ) = .5. Recall also that the accumulation equation is xt+1 =
(R/Gt+1 Nt+1 )st + t+1 . When the economy is in the ‘high’ state, the true mathematical
expectation of Et [1/Gt+1 |Truth] < Et [1/Gt+1 |Dumb]. It follows that Et [x̃t+1 |Truth] <
Et [x̃t+1 |Dumb] = x∗ . That is, because Gt+1 is greater than anticipated, xt+1 will be lower
than anticipated. We will call this story henceforth the ‘G shrinks x’ eﬀect.
     What can we conclude about the saving rate on the basis of the ‘G shrinks x’ eﬀect?
We know from Carroll and Kimball (1996) that the consumption function for this problem
is strictly concave with a slope greater than the slope in the perfect foresight case, which
implies that reducing xt will reduce consumption by more than the reduction in interest
earnings. That is, the lower level of xt boosts the precautionary saving motive and thus
the saving rate increases. The converse logic holds when the economy is in the slow-growth
regime. Hence for the economy with dumb consumers the ‘G shrinks x’ eﬀect implies that
the saving rate should rise when the economy switches to the high-growth regime and
should fall in the slow-growth regime. The size of these eﬀects can be determined only
by simulation.
     Figure 1 presents the results when we initialize a population of 5000 agents with the
target value of x∗ in period 1 and identical inital values of permanent income normalized to
one (i.e. {xi,1 , Pi,1 } = {x∗ , 1} ∀ i), and then simulate the 90 year sequence described above.
The ﬁrst point evident from the ﬁgure is that there is little movement in the aggregate
saving rate from the ﬁrst period to the thirtieth period, conﬁrming the earlier claim that
initializing the population such that everybody holds the target value of wealth generates

                                               11
aggregate results very similar to those obtained by starting at an arbitrary point and
simulating until the population has reached something close to the ergodic distribution.14
    The ﬁrst substantive conclusion is thus that the ‘G shrinks x’ eﬀect is virtually negli-
gible: While the saving rate is indeed higher in the fast-growth than in the slow-growth
regime, the diﬀerence in saving rates is so small that it is diﬃcult to detect.
    Now consider the theory for what we should expect to see in the habit-forming econ-
omy. The ‘G shrinks x’ eﬀect continues to hold in this model, so we can continue to
expect a modest boost to the saving rate from this eﬀect. However, there is another eﬀect
in the model with habits. Recall that habits evolve according to
                                                 ht + λ(ct − ht )
                                     ht+1 =                       .                                 (14)
                                                     GNt+1
Note that exactly the same logic holds with respect to the habits-to-permanent-income
ratio ht in this equation as held for the wealth-to-permanent-income ratio in the ‘G shrinks
x’ eﬀect: faster growth will shrink the habits ratio. Furthermore, the eﬀect of a lower
level of ht on ct is similar to that of lower xt : lower habits ‘drag down’ consumption and
thereby boost the saving rate. We will call this the ‘G shrinks h’ eﬀect.
    The simulation results for the economy with dumb habit-forming consumers (where
again all 5000 consumers are initialized in period 1 with {xi,1 , hi,1 , Pi,1 } = {x∗ , h∗ , 1}) are
depicted in ﬁgure 2. In contrast to the results for the dumb non-habit-formers, in Figure 2
the increase in the saving rate during the fast-growth regime is huge. Thus the ‘G shrinks
h’ eﬀect is apparently quantitatively much more important than the ‘G shrinks x’ eﬀect,
and as a result the saving rate increases steadily in the wake of the increase in growth.

4.2     Smart Consumers
Before examining the results that obtain when consumers are ‘smart’, another theoretical
excursion will be helpful. The standard perfect foresight permanent income model of
consumption without uncertainty implies that the level of consumption is given by
                                                                     Pt
                           Ct = (1 − R−1 (Rβ)IES )(Kt +                   )                         (15)
                                                                  1 − G/R
                                                               1
                           ct ≈ (r − ρ−1 (r − θ))(kt +            )                                 (16)
                                                              r−g
  14
     There is a conceptual problem with the model as described thus far: Because there are permanent
shocks to income for each consumer in each period and there is no mechanism which causes an individual
consumer’s permanent income to revert to the economy’s sample mean, in principle the variance of the
distribution of permanent income across consumers is perpetually increasing as time passes. This problem
can be overcome by assuming, a la Blanchard (1985), that consumers face a constant probability of death.
If the dying consumers are replaced by consumers with permanent incomes equal to the mean level of
permanent income of the deceased, the variance of the cross-sectional distribution of permanent income
no longer expands without bound as time passes. If we assume that the new consumers receive ‘bequests’
in their ﬁrst period of life equal on average to the wealth of the dying consumers, it turns out that the
implications of this more complicated model are numerically very close to those reported in the paper.
In order to keep the presentation and discussion of the model as simple as possible, the paper therefore
sticks with the version without death.

where IES stands for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (1/ρ), θ = 1/β − 1, and
the approximation holds for ‘small’ {r, g, θ}. If we set the aggregate value of k = 4 and
assume a value of r = .03 and g = .01 it is clear that the elasticity of consumption with
respect to the growth rate of income will be colossal. This enormous ‘human wealth eﬀect’
is a well-known problem with the perfect foresight/certainty equivalent life cycle model
of consumption, emphasized, for example, by Tobin (1967), Carroll and Summers (1991),
Deaton (1992), and Viard (1993).15
    There was no human wealth eﬀect of switching from GL to GH and back in the simu-
lations for dumb consumers, because by deﬁnition the ‘dumb’ consumers’ expectations of
G did not change when the actual aggregate state changed. However, the human wealth
eﬀect will clearly exist for smart consumers who do understand the aggregate growth
process. What is not so clear a priori is whether the human wealth eﬀect will be large or
small. Carroll (1997) has shown that the introduction of uncertainty can reduce the hu-
man wealth eﬀect from enormous to negligible if consumers are assumed to be suﬃciently
impatient, so we must turn to simulation results to see whether the eﬀect is large or small
in this particular context.

    Although some papers, notably Horioka and Watanabe (1997) and Horioka (1997), have argued that
movements in the Japanese saving rate can be explained by demographic trends, recent work by Deaton
and Paxson (1997, 2000) ﬁnds little support for the proposition that demographic diﬀerences can explain
cross-country saving diﬀerentials, a ﬁnding conﬁrmed by Rodrik (1999).

occurs in period 30 results in a dramatic plunge in the saving rate, indicating that the
human wealth eﬀect is quite strong: when consumers learn that they are going to have
vastly higher incomes in the future, they go on a spending spree. Over the next twenty
years the saving rate gradually climbs back up somewhat, but it never reattains the level
that prevailed before the economy shifted to the high-growth regime.
    When the economy switches back to the low-growth regime in period 60, the aggregate
saving rate instantly leaps upward, because of a negative human wealth eﬀect: consumers
suddenly learn that they will be much poorer in the future than they had thought, so
their consumption plummets.
    The next ﬁgure shows what happens when consumers are again smart but now have
habit-forming utility. The intitial drop in the saving rate when the economy switches
into the high-growth regime is so small that it is hard to detect - much smaller than the
plunge that happened in the non-habit-forming economy. Furthermore, the gross saving
rate quickly regains and subsequently exceeds its rate in the low-growth regime.
    The logic behind the diﬀerences here is somewhat subtle. One’s ﬁrst intuition is that
habits must somehow directly reduce the human wealth eﬀect. This turns out to be false.
Carroll (2000) shows that in this model of habit formation the formula for consumption
in the steady-state of the perfect foresight version of the model is
                                                            Pt

                            Figure 4: Smart Consumers, Habits

But remember that in parameterizing the habit formation model we chose the parameter
values precisely to keep the inﬁnite horizon coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion in the habits
model the same as in the baseline model without habits, and since the IHIES is just the
inverse of the inﬁnite horizon CRRA, IHIES = IES and therefore the level of steady-state
consumption implied by equation (17) is identical to the level of consumption that would
occur in the intertemporally separable model, equation (16). Thus, the human wealth
eﬀect is exactly as strong in the perfect certainty version of the habit formation model as
in the perfect certainty version of the model without habits!
    The only possible conclusion is that the diﬀerences in outcomes between the two models
(and in particular, the ability of the model with habits to explain the positive causality
from growth to saving) have to do with the eﬀects of uncertainty on the precautionary
saving motive. With a γ of 0.8, it was necessary to assume that ρ = 11 in order to
make the long-term intertemporal elasticity of substitution in the habit formation model
match the IES in the baseline model. Thus consumers in this model have an extremely
strong aversion to high-frequency ﬂuctuations in consumption and consequently have
an extremely strong precautionary saving motive with respect to high frequency risks.
As noted earlier, Carroll (1997) shows that the precautionary saving motive can vastly
decrease the size of the human wealth eﬀect for impatient consumers, essentially because
such consumers are not willing to spend today on the basis of their expected mean level
of future income, because of the risk of catastrophically low utility if they fail to save and
they experience a bad income shock.
    In sum, while the mechanism may be somewhat surprising, these results conﬁrm the

                                             15
argument made in C-O-W that habit formation can help explain why the saving rate in
East Asian economies seems to have risen systematically in the wake of their take-oﬀs into
rapid growth. The eﬀect is stronger if consumers are dumb (in the sense that they did not
immediately understand that the economy had switched to a high-growth regime) than if
they are smart because the powerful human wealth eﬀect tends to make smart consumers
spend more in anticipation of their higher future income. But even for smart consumers,
under our baseline parameter values an increase in growth causes a subsequent increase
in saving.


5     The Marginal Propensity to Consume Out of Per-
      manent Shocks
We now turn to the question of how habits aﬀect the marginal propensity to consume out
of permanent shocks to income (like the permanent tax cut proposed by some analysts of
the Japanese economy).

5.1    Deﬁnition
The ﬁrst step is to deﬁne the MPC out of permanent shocks. This is somewhat less
straightforward than one might guess, in part because the timing convention that all un-
certainty for period t is resolved at the beginning of the period leads to a minor conceptual
diﬃculty. The level of consumption in period t + 1 is

         Pt+1 c(xt+1 , ht+1 ) = Gt+1 Pt Nt+1 c ([R/Gt+1 Nt+1 ]kt + t+1 , Ht /Gt+1 Nt+1 ) ,   (18)

where we deﬁne the habit stock at the end of period t as Ht = ht + λ(ct − ht ) and the
derivative of the expression on the RHS of this equation with respect to the level of the
permanent shock Nt+1 is

   dCt+1        d
           =        Pt+1 c(xt+1 , ht+1 )

                         d
           = Gt+1 Pt         Nt+1 c(xt+1 , ht+1 )
                       dNt+1
                                                                                            
                                              ∂xt+1 x                  ∂ht+1 h
           = Gt+1 Pt c(xt+1 , ht+1 ) + Nt+1         c (xt+1 , ht+1 ) +       c (xt+1 , ht+1 ) .
                                              ∂Nt+1                    ∂Nt+1

But
                                   ∂xt+1        R
                                         = −       2

                                                                                               

                                                                        h

                                                                                                (20)
which depends upon the levels of Gt+1 , Pt , Nt+1 , kt , Ht , and t+1 . But a deﬁnition of
the marginal propensity to consume as a function in six dimensions would be extremely
unwieldy and diﬃcult to analyze - and does not really capture the essence of the concept.
Here I use the solution proposed by Carroll (1999) for the problem without habits: First,
normalize (19) by the level of permanent income in period t + 1, Gt+1 Pt , and then deﬁne
the marginal propensity as the expectation of the scaled version of (19) as of the end of the
previous period. This reduces the number of state variables by four, because normalizing
eliminates Pt and Gt+1 and taking expectations eliminates t+1 and Nt+1 .
    Thus, we deﬁne the ‘expected marginal propensity to consume out of permanent shocks
to noncapital income’ as

5.2      Dumb Consumers, No Habits
In the version of the model with intertemporally separable utility, habits do not aﬀect
utility and so ch (xt , ht ) = 0, and the formula for the MPC simpliﬁes to
                                                                                      
                                                                             R
                 χ(kt , Ht ) = Et c(x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 ) − c (x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 )
                                                       x
                                                                                     kt . (22)

   Consider the ﬁrst term of this expression, Et [c(x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 )], for a consumer who happens
to be exactly at the target levels of wealth and habits, kt = k ∗ , deﬁned as the level of
wealth such that Et [k̃t+1 ] = kt .
                                kt+1    =   (R/Gt+1 Nt+1 )kt + t+1 − c(xt+1 , ht+1 )

               Et [c(x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 )]   =   1 + k ∗ [Et [(R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )] − 1]
               Et [c(x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 )]   ≈   1 + (r − θ − g + σN   2
                                                                     )k ∗ .                               (23)
where g = .5(GH + GL ) − 1 and the approximation holds because the baseline values of
the parameters {r, g, σN

                         } = {.03, .04, .01} are small.
   The principal result in Carroll (1999) is to show that the impatience condition (11), in
combination with the results from Carroll and Kimball (1996), implies that for a consumer
with the target level of wealth kt = k ∗ the expectation of the second term in χ is
                                                      

                                                                           )k ∗ ,     (24)

                                                       17
and so substituting (24) and (23) into (22) we have χ(k ∗ , H) < 1 ∀ H. We can gain
more insight into this result by realizing that if the parameter values were such that the
impatience relationship were exactly on the knife-edge between failing and not failing,

                                    RβEt [(G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )−ρ ] = 1,                                    (25)

and if there were no precautionary saving motive, we would have χ = 1. The insight of
Kimball (1990) and Carroll and Kimball (1996) that precautionary saving boosts cx is
therefore the eﬀect that allows us to conclude that χ < 1. This is an interesting twist,
because it says that the reason the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent
shocks is less than one is because the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory
shocks is boosted by precautionary saving.
    The intuition of this is clear: a positive permanent shock reduces x, and therefore
increases the level of saving out of permanent income, reducing the ratio of consumption
to permanent income. This reduction in c means that the level of consumption C = cP
does not rise by as much as permanent income P , and so the MPC out of the change in
P caused by the shock N is less than one.
    One further theoretical insight is possible before we turn to the simulation results: we
should expect that χ will be lower during the GH regime than during the GL regime.
This follows because the human wealth eﬀect implies that the actual average value of xt
will be lower during the GH regime, and Carroll and Kimball (1996) establish that the
consumption function is strictly concave for problems of this kind, cxx < 0, so that the
marginal propensity to consume out of transitory shocks cx will be larger with a lower
value of xt implying a smaller MPC out of permanent shocks.16
    Of course, these results tell us nothing about the magnitude of the diminution to χ
caused by the precautionary motive, and so Figure 5 presents the simulation results. It
turns out that χ is around 0.80 in both the GL and the GH regimes, undergoing only a
very slight decline when the economy is in the GH regime.
    Results in the habit formation model, however, are more interesting. Recall the third
term in the habit formation model, Et [−ch (x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 )(Ht /GÑt+1 )], and remember that ch
is positive because consumption tends to be pulled in the direction of habits, so the term
as a whole will reduce the marginal propensity to consume as habits pull consumption
toward its past average level. Furthermore, our ‘G shrinks h’ argument above suggests
that h∗ will be lower in the fast-growing than in the slow-growing economy. However, we
have no analytical results for chh so we do not know whether the contribution of the habit
formation term will increase or reduce χ when the economy switches from slow to fast
growth.
    Simulation results presented in ﬁgure 6 provide the answer: χ does not change very
much across growth regimes. However, the ﬁnding of principal interest is that in both the
slow-growth and the fast-growth regimes, χ is a very small number: in either case, the
average marginal propensity to consume out of permanent shocks to income is between
  16
    This logic is loose because the argument is phrased as though there were a stable c(xt , ht ) function
across the two regimes, whereas in fact the aggregate state is a state variable and so there will be two

about 0.20 and 0.35. Thus, habits dramatically reduce the marginal propensity to consume
out of permanent shocks to income.

5.3       Smart Consumers
Earlier we noted that theory suggested, and simulation evidence conﬁrmed, that the
human wealth eﬀect would cause a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the saving behavior of
the dumb and the smart consumers across the diﬀerent growth regimes. What does theory
suggest we should expect the human wealth eﬀect to be for smart consumers?
    Starting with the consumers with intertemporally separable utility, the sharp reduction
in the saving rate in the GH regime leads to a sharp decline in the value of x∗ . But
as already noted, Carroll and Kimball (1996) have shown that cxx < 0 so that loosely
speaking we should suspect that a large reduction in x∗ should correspond to a substantial
increase in cx , and therefore, by the logic of equation (22) a substantial reduction in χ.17
How large ‘substantial’ is can be determined only by simulations.
    Figure 7 presents results: the steady-state value of χ in the slow-growth regime is a
bit over 0.80, but when the economy switches to the fast-growth regime the value of χ
heads down toward a new steady-state value of around 0.75 in the GH regime. While the
diﬀerence between χ in the low-growth and the high-growth regimes is much larger than
in the no-habits economy with dumb consumers depicted in ﬁgure 5, it remains true that
the diﬀerence between the two regimes is fairly small in terms of policy implications.
    Finally, we turn to the results for the economy with smart consumers who have habit-
forming utility. Once again, there appears to be little that can be said in theoretical terms;
the simulation results are in Figure 8. Interestingly, and in contrast with the results for
the saving rate, the value of χ does not change much across the two regimes: the steady-
state value is about 0.30 in the low-growth regime and less than 0.20 in the high-growth
regime. The important conclusion is that the marginal propensity to consume out of
permanent shocks is remarkably small regardless of the growth regime the economy is in.
This echoes the results obtained with dumb consumers in ﬁgure 6.


6       How Long is the Long Run?
In the long run, consumers must satisfy their intertemporal budget constraints, and so
eventually consumption will respond fully to any shock to permanent income. The mea-
sure χ calculated above reﬂects the ﬁrst period response only. This section examines how
quickly consumption moves most of the way toward permanent income after a permanent
shock.
   Consider informing the consumer at the end of period t that the process for next
period’s permanent income shock will be multiplied by 1 + η, i.e. the accumulation
equation (6) will be replaced (for period t + 1 only) by

                                      Pt+1 = Gt+1 Pt Nt+1 (1 + η).                       (26)

      Again, the logic is loose; see footnote 16.

nent shock η as

where Gt,t+n = Gt+1 Gt+2 . . . Gt+n Nt+1 Nt+2 . . . Nt+n . The appendix shows that for n = 1,
for a consumer who in period t is at the target level of consumption c∗ such that Et [c̃t+1 ] =
ct , limη→0 χ̂1 (kt , Ht , η) = χ(kt , Ht ) as deﬁned above, so (27) is a natural generalization of
the one-period MPC.
      Because the MPC out of permanent shocks in the model without habits was about
0.80, a natural deﬁnition of ‘the long run’ is the value of n such that χ̂n (kt , Ht , η) = 0.80.
Thus, the ‘long run’ corresponds to the length of time it takes before the consumption
ratio has adjusted at least 80 percent of the way toward its new steady-state level.
      This question would be exceptionally diﬃcult to answer by attempting to calculate
the numerical expectation of (27), because of the rapid multiplication of contingencies as
the number of periods increases. Fortunately, there is a shortcut. First, rewrite (27) as

    The results are presented in panel A. of Table 6, for dumb and smart consumers who
are living in the slow-growth regime. The table shows the average value of χ(kt , Ht ) along
with the estimated value of the AR(1) coeﬃcient µ from equation (28) and the standard
error for µ. From equation (32), µ and χ together imply the speed of adjustment statistic
reported in the column labelled ‘Years to 0.80.’ Also presented for completeness are the
R̄2 and the Durbin-Watson statistics for the AR(1) regression; see the appendix for details
of the exact procedure for estimating this regression. The ﬁrst row of the table indicates
that under the baseline parameter values, if consumers are dumb aggregate consumption
takes about 10 years to adjust 80 percent of the way toward its steady-state value; the
second row indicates that if consumers are smart, χ is virtually unchanged, but it takes
a few more years to reach 80 percent adjustment.


7    Robustness
This section examines the robustness of the preceding conclusions to alternative assump-
tions about parameter values. In order to organize the results, it is necessary ﬁrst to
consider the constraints on the possible combinations of parameter values. Recall the
‘impatience condition’ (11)
                                   Et [Rβ(G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )−ρ̂ ] < 1                              (33)
introduced earlier, where ρ̂ = ρ + γ(1 − ρ). In principle, this condition must be satisﬁed
for the problem to deﬁne a contraction mapping and therefore for the solution methods
employed here to work. Now consider the case where there is no chance that the aggregate
state will change, Gt = Gt+1 . . . = G ∀ t, and suppose that the permanent shock is
lognormally distributed, log Nt+1 ∼ N (−σN   2      2
                                               /2, σN ). Then (33) becomes

where the transition from (35) to (36) is obtained by taking the logarithm of both sides
and holds only approximately. This equation tells us that we cannot consider arbitrary
variations in ρ and γ - we are restricted to considering variations which satisfy (37).

Thus, for the slow-growth regime value of g = 0.02 our baseline parameter values might
appear to be on the knife edge of failing the impatience condition. However, recall that
these consumers do not actually expect g = 0.02; they believe that there is a modest
chance that the economy will switch into the fast-growth regime in which g = 0.06. Thus,
the baseline parameter values do satisfy the impatience condition properly speciﬁed to
take account of this probability.
    This is the place to point out that it is necessary to choose baseline parameter values
that are close to failing the impatience condition if we wish for the baseline model without
habits to produce sensible predictions for the magnitude of the aggregate capital stock.
If consumers are highly impatient, they will decide to maintain a modest buﬀer stock of
only a few weeks’ or months’ worth of income, and the aggregate capital stock predicted
the model will fall far below the true aggregate capital/income ratio of about 3. For
the baseline parameter values without habits, the model implies a steady-state ratio of
capital to labor income of about 2 (for an economy that remains in the two percent
growth regime and has no habit formation), somewhat smaller than the corresponding
empirical statistic for the U.S., for which g = 0.02 is a plausible assumption. For the
baseline model with habits, the prediction is for a capital to labor income ratio of a bit
less than 5, somewhat more than the corresponding empirical statistic in Japan. This
seems a reasonable compromise, since clearly the model cannot match the true empirical
capital/income ratio both with and without habits.19
    We will consider three kinds of experiments with the parameter values: Experiments
that leave ρ̂ the same but alter the values of ρ and γ; experiments that ﬁx the value
of ρ and experiment with the value of γ (leaving ρ̂ within the bounds set by (37)); and
experiments that ﬁx the value of γ and experiment with the value of ρ (again within the
range of values permitted by (37)). Because results with smart and dumb consumers are
very similar, we present results only for smart consumers.
    As Panel B. of the table shows, results are not particularly sensitive to the value of λ:
for values of λ between 0.1 and 1.0, the initial MPC ranges from about 0.25 to about 0.35.
Furthermore, even for the case of very rapid adjustment of the habit stock (λ = 1.0), the
economy still takes about 5 years to reach the ‘long run’ MPC. These ﬁndings echo those
of Fuhrer (2000), whose estimate of λ was rather imprecise because simulation results
were not particularly sensitive to the value of λ.
  19
    This diﬃculty points out the drawback of our small open economy assumption; in a closed economy
with a neoclassical production function, the equilibrium capital stocks would be closer to each other. To
see why, note that the habitless economy’s low capital stock would imply high interest rates which would
generate higher saving (compared to the partial equilibrium result here), while the large capital stock in
the economy with habits would drive down the rate of return and hence reduce saving.

                                                   25
    Panel C. explores the consequences of alternative combinations of ρ and γ which leave
ρ̂ = 3. The results illustrate that, as one would expect, the less important are habits (the
smaller is γ) the closer the results are to the outcome obtained without habits.
    Panel D. examines the eﬀect of changing the value of ρ while leaving γ ﬁxed at its
baseline value of 0.8. When ρ = 6 (implying ρ̂ = 2), the results are only modestly diﬀerent
from the baseline results: χ edges up and ‘years to 0.8’ drops to about 11. Even pushing
ρ as low as 2 (implying ρ̂ = 1.2) only boosts χ to about 0.50, though ‘years to 0.80’ drops
substantially.
    Panel E. leaves ρ ﬁxed at its baseline value of 11 but increases γ.20 The eﬀect of
increasing γ from the baseline 0.8 to 0.85 is to cut χ by about 0.05, and to increase the
‘years to 0.8’ statistic by about 3 years. Setting γ = 0.9 produces further changes in both
statistics of about the same magnitude, indicating that these statistics are roughly linear
in γ in the neighborhood of γ = 0.80. Thus, again, we see that changes in γ are quite
powerful in their eﬀects.
    Panel F. examines the consequences of changing the other parameters of the model
which do not aﬀect the impatience condition. In no case considered is χ changed from its
baseline value by more than 0.05, and in no case does the ‘years to 0.8’ statistic change
by more than about 4 from its baseline value. Hence we can conclude that the results are
robust to reasonable changes in these parameters.


8      Conclusion
A substantial literature has recently developed arguing that several diﬀerent aspects of
consumption and portfolio behavior can be explained using models in which consumption
exhibits important habit formation eﬀects. This paper derives a new implication of those
models: that the immediate marginal propensity to consume out of permanent shocks to
income should be substantially lower than in the traditional model with intertemporally
separable utility.
   In particular, if the habit formation explanation proposed by Carroll, Overland, and
Weil (2000) for the long-term rise in Japan’s saving rate is correct, the implication is that
permanent tax cuts might not be nearly as eﬀective in stimulating consumption in the
short- to medium-run as would be expected in a traditional permanent income model. If
the immediate marginal propensity to consume out of permanent tax cuts is as low as
30 percent, other forms of ﬁscal stimulus may be much more eﬀective than permanent
income tax cuts in stimulating aggregate demand.

    This panel shows only the eﬀect of increasing γ because reductions in γ would produce a conﬁguration
of parameter values that violate the impatience condition. Panel C. shows the results of reducing γ while
oﬀsetting the eﬀect on impatience.

then the value function for any period t < T can be rewritten as

and for any t the ct (xt , ht ) which maximizes (A.1), it is easy to show that Ct = ct (xt , ht )Pt
maximizes Vt (Xt , Ht , Pt ).

A.2      End-Of-Period Value Ω
In analyzing problems of this kind it is often useful to deﬁne the value of the program
at two points within a period: before and after the control variables have been chosen.
To do so however requires that we give names to the state variables at the end of the
period that are distinct from their names at the beginning. At the end of the period the
                                                      27
state variables for this problem are capital kt = xt − ct and Ht = ht + λ(ct − ht ), and the
end-of-period value function is
                                                                                       
       Ωt (kt , Ht ) = Et (GÑt+1 )(1−ρ)(1−γ) vt+1 ((R/GÑt+1 )kt + ˜t+1 , Ht /GÑt+1 ) .

and, denoting the derivative of a function f with respect to an argument z as f z we have

                        Ωst (kt , Ht ) = Et (GÑt+1 )ργ−ρ−γ Rvt+1
                                                               x

                                                                

       Using this deﬁnition, the maximization problem becomes simply

                    vt (xt , ht ) = max u(ct , ht ) + βΩt (xt − ct , ht + λ(ct − ht )),            (A.3)
                                        {ct }


and we deﬁne the inﬁnite-horizon solution as the limit of the ﬁnite horizon solution as the
horizon T approaches inﬁnity.21

have in hand the functions vt+1       and vt+1 , so in principle we can solve equation (A.9) to
ﬁnd ct for a grid of possible values of (xt , ht ), yielding values for vt (xt , ht ), vth (xt , ht ), and
vtx (xt , ht ) and so on recursively until the consumption rules have converged.

    It is necessary to impose some restrictions on parameter values to ensure convergence; see below for
a discussion of the necessary assumption.

                                                     28
A.3.2    Applying the Envelope Theorem
The envelope theorem on the variable xt says:
                                                   =0
                                               
                                        ∂vt     ∂vt ∂ct
                              vtx     =      +
                                        ∂xt     ∂ct ∂xt
                              vtx     = βEt (GNt+1 )ργ−ρ−γ Rvt+1
                                                             x
                                                                                         (A.10)
                              vtx     = βΩst                                             (A.11)

   Thus, equation (A.9) above can be rewritten as
                                                            
                       uct = vtx − βEt (GÑt+1 )ργ−γ−ρ λvt+1
                                                         h
                                                                                         (A.12)
                                                            
                       vtx = uct + βEt (GÑt+1 )ργ−γ−ρ λvt+1
                                                         h
                                                                                         (A.13)
                            vtx = uct + λβΩht .                                          (A.14)

   Noting that ∂ht+1 /∂ht = (1 − λ)/GNt+1 , the envelope theorem on the variable ht says:
                                            =0
                                    
                              ∂vt    ∂vt ∂ct
                      vth   =     +
                              ∂ht    ∂ct ∂ht
                                                                    
                               h                 (1−ρ)(1−γ) h ∂ht+1
                            = ut + βEt (GÑt+1 )           vt+1
                                                                 ∂ht
                            = ut + (1 − λ)βEt (GNt+1 )
                               h                         γρ−γ−ρ h
                                                                vt+1
                            = uht + (1 − λ)βΩht                                          (A.15)

   Using the ﬁrst order conditions (A.14) and (A.15), the problem is solved recursively
using numerical methods from the last period of life until successive decision rules have
converged, and we denote the converged consumption rule c(xt , ht ).

A.4     Proof that the Multiperiod MPC χ̂n Reduces to the Single
        Period MPC χ for n = 1 at the Target Level of ct
The goal is to show that

                                    lim χ̂1 (kt , Ht , η) = χ(kt , Ht )
                                    η→0


if Et [c̃t+1 ] ≈ ct .

           χ̂1 (kt , Ht , η) = Et                          | Pt+1 = Gt+1 Pt Nt+1 (1 + η) . (A.16)

c(x, h) with respect to x and h as cx , ch , this becomes
                                                         

χ̂1 (kt , Ht , η) = Et                                                             (A.17)
                                        Pt η
              = Et [c̃t+1 (1 + η) − ct ] /η                                                 (A.18)
                                                                                              
              = Et c (R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 (1 + η))kt + ˜t+1 , Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 (1 + η) (1 + η) − ct /η
                                                                                            
              ≈ Et c((R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )(1 − η)kt + ˜t+1 , (1 − η)Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )(1 + η) − ct /η
                  
              ≈ Et c((R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )kt + ˜t+1 , Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )                         (A.19)
                                                                                         
                        − η(R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )kt ct+1 − η(Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )ct+1 (1 + η) − ct /η
                                               x                         h



Now note that the ﬁrst term in equation (A.19) is the unconditional expectation of
Et [c̃t+1 (x̃t+1 , h̃t+1 )] in the normal circumstance where η = 0. By our assumption that
the consumer was at the target level of consumption in period t, we have Et [c̃t+1 ] = ct .
Using this fact, equation (A.19) becomes
                                    
           φ̂1 (kt , Ht , η) ≈ Et c((R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )kt + ˜t+1 , Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )  (A.20)

                                − (R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )kt cxt+1 − (Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )cht+1
                                                                                                 
                                −   η[(R/G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )kt cxt+1   −   (Ht /G̃t+1 Ñt+1 )cht+1 ]       ,

and the limit of this expression as η goes to zero is equal to the formula for χ(kt , Ht ) in
equation (21).

A.5     Estimating the Time Series Process for ct
The results about the speed with which consumption adjusts toward its ‘long run’ level in
response to a shock to permanent income asserted that the consumption process is well
captured by an AR(1). This section presents the basic evidence for that claim.
    The precise experiment is as follows. For each combination of parameter values in
Tables 6 and 6, the model is solved for the optimal policy rules and is then simulated for
99 periods in order to allow the population to settle down into something approximating
a steady-state. In period 100 the economy is hit by a shock η which increases every
consumer’s permanent income by a factor 1 + η compared to where it would have been
in the absence of the shock, where η = 0.1. The simulation then continues until period
200. At the end of the simulations, the following time series process for consumption is
estimated:
                                    ct = α + µct−1 + t .                                                (A.21)
                                               30
This equation is the source of the estimated values for the ‘AR(1) Coeﬀ.’ µ in Table 6.
