      The trend toward globalization of information in financial markets has

 appeared to accelerate in recent years. Perhaps most importantly, the plans

 for "Europe 1992" provide for better flows of information in both goods and

 securities markets for the major European economies. The planned changes, for

 example, should lead to more uniform reporting and accounting systems. The

effects of such improvements in the flow of information in financial markets

are generally considered to be beneficial, since they create more integrated

capital markets and more mobile capital flows. Given the amount of attention

that is being paid to "Europe 1992", it would seem timely to develop a more

detailed evaluation of the likely effects of improved information.

     It is disappointing, therefore, to find that portfolio selection theory

has not focused on analyzing the effects of an improvement in the quality of

information, such as might arise from the forthcoming European changes.

Indeed, Robert Nerton's presidential address for the American Finance

Association (Nerton [1987]) was directed at precisely this issue. Of course,

there is an extensive literature which studies the role of such factors as

transactions costs, taxes, and capital controls on international capital

mobility.     However, as we discuss later, the effects of imperfect capital

markets may differ substantially from the effects of imperfect information.

     The main objective for this paper is to provide a framework for analyzing

the effects of the globalization of information. We will focus, in particular,

on how the globalization of information influences real interest rate spreads--

differences in the levels of real interest rates among countries. We start, in

Section 1, by introducing the factors that lead to real interest rate spreads.

Section 2 then looks at the sources of imperfect information and at how the

quality of information may vary among investors. Section 3 provides a formal

portfolio selection model that links real interest rate spreads with imperfect

information. Section 4 develops the main conclusions concerning the effects of

the globalization of information.


1.    REAL INTEREST RATE SPREADS


      Frankel and MacArthur [1988] provide a useful framework for analyzing the

factors that cause real interest rates to vary across countries. The real

interest rate spread is defined as:


[lJ r -   r*   =   (j   -                - (j*     -



               = (i     -
                                i*)      -
                                             (1T
                                                   -


where r is the real interest rate, i is the nominal interest rate,                     is the

expected inflation rate, and asterisks represent foreign variables. By adding

and subtracting the expected depreciation of the home currency ne, and then

doing the same with the forward discount 5, equation [1) becomes:



[2] r -   r*   =   (i i*-            -         + e - ¶p + *)

and


[3] r -   r*   =   Ci       -   i*       -     + (5 -   + (ye -   +   y*)

      Equation [2] shows that the real interest rate spread can be expressed as

two terms, first the uncovered interest rate spread (1 -                     - iTe) and second

the expected real exchange rate depreciation e -                       + ¶T*). This means that



                                               --2--
  real interest rate spreads can result from factors in either financial markets-

  -the failure of uncovered interest rate
                                                  parity (UIP)--or real markets--the
  failure of purchasing power parity (PPP).

         Since the expected change in the exchange rate, ye, is not observable it

  is difficult to evaluate empirically whether
                                                      deviations from UIP or PPP are the
 more important source of real interest rate
                                                     spreads. Based on their empirical
 evidence, Frankel and MacArthur [1988] conclude that
                                                              expected real exchange
 rate depreciation is the more influential of these
                                                            two sources of real interest
 rate spreads. The evidence of Adler and Lehmann
                                                          [19831, however, implies that
 PPP may still hold on an ex ante, if not
                                                       , basis.    In this case,
 deviations from UIP would have to be the primary source of real interest rate

 spreads.

        In interpreting equation [2], it is also important to recognize that the

UIP and PPP terms may not be independent.
                                                   That is, deviations from UIP may

create deviations from PPP, and vice versa. In particular, the model in
Section 3 below illustrates a case
                                   in which larger PPP deviations are the
source of larger UIP deviations.

       Equation [3] shows that the uncovered interest rate spread can be further

decomposed into two terms, the first
                                             containing the covered interest rate
spread (1 -     1*   -
                         6) and the second containing the forward exchange market risk
premium (.5 -   ire).     This means that uncovered interest rate parity can fail to

hold either because covered interest
                                            rate parity fails to hold or because there
is a   forward exchange market risk premium.       The standard view in the recent
literature,   consistent with      the evidence of Frankel and MacArthur [l988J, is




                                   --3--
  that the covered interest rate differential is
                                                    likely to be small empirically. 2
  This implies that an exchange market risk premium is the most likely financial

  market source of real interest rate spreads.

       Given that covered interest rate parity does hold, it is logically

  equivalent to represent the exchange market risk premium either as a deviation

  from uncovered interest parity (as in equation [2]) or as the difference

  between the expected exchange rate depreciation and the forward discount (as in

 equation [3J). Whichever interpretation is preferred, the international

 portfolio choice literature indicates that a variety of specific conditions in

 the two countries, such as unequal supplies of wealth and securities, or

 unequal commodity (consumption) preferences, can be the source of the risk

 premiums (see Adler and Dumas [19831). The model
                                                      developed in Section 3
 illustrates how this works.

      Information plays a number of important roles in
                                                          determining exchange
 market risk premiums. First,
                                  uncertainty is a necessary cordition for risk
 premiums to exist at all. Otherwise, if investment
                                                        outcomes were known with

certainty, then riskfree arbitrage would eliminate all risk premiums. Second,

the particular form taken by stochastic processes can affect the measure used

for uncovered interest rate parity. For example, for the model developed in

Section 3 with continuous-time stochastic
                                             processes, the p4ty relationship
between interest rates includes covariance terms that are omitted from equation

[2J. Third, if the amount of uncertainty increases, then the size of risk

premiums will generally rise. This result is illustrated in Section 3 below.

Fourth, asymmetrca access to information--meaning that investors face

     2 Frankel
                and MacArthur [1988] refer to potential deviations from covered
interest rate parity as country risk, since such deviations would arise from
capital controls and other country-specific restrictions on capital flows.


                               --4--
 different levels of uncertainty--can affect both the size and the specific form

 of risk premiums.

      Even though information affects exchange market risk premiums in these

 various ways, the effects of changing the amount of information have not been

 closely studied. In this paper, we start to redress this shortcoming of the

 literature, by analyzing the role of imperfect information as a source of risk

 premiums and real interest rate spreads.


 Real Rate Spreads for Risky Securities


      Real interest rate spread equations, such as equations [11, [2], and [3],

have been analyzed traditionally only for securities that have no default risk.

To consider imperfect information, however, it is essential to include

securities with default risk. Otherwise, if the securities are assumed to be

free of default risk, then investors have no need to obtain information and

there is thus no role for imperfect information. The solution is to expand

equation [3] to cover risky securities--which can be interpreted as either

equity securities or as risky debt securities.

     For this purpose, let us suppose that r and r* are the expected real

returns and i and i* are the expected nominal returns on two risky bonds. The

expected returns (both nominal and real) on the two securities may include risk

premiums that comjensate investors for bearing the risk. Such risk premiums

will tend to be greater the more risk averse are investors and the greater the

extent to which the risk of default is not diversjfiable--as, for example, when

default depends on the macroeconomic performance of the economy.

    If we denote the risk premiums on the home and foreign securities as t and




                            —-5—-
   t* respectively, then equation [2J can be modified by adding and subtracting
                                                                                                                 r

  and r*:


  [4J    r -   r* =   [(i   -
                                t)   -   (i*   -
                                                   t*)   -
                                                             e' + (t -   t*)   + e -         + ,T*)
                                                                                       TTp


  The terms (i -      t)    and (i* -      t*)     are the expected returns net of risk premiums
  for the home and foreign securities
                                                         respectively, while the term (t -            t*)   is
  the difference between the two risk
                                                         premiums. Of course, if the two securities
 have equal levels of risk and investors evaluate
                                                                          the risk without regard to the
 country or currency in which the securities are
                                                                         issued, then t might equal t*.
 But even with equal risk, unequal risk premiums may still arise whenever the

 demand/supply balance for risk is different in the
                                                                            two countries. In Section
 3, we will analyze how the relationship between
                                                                         real interest rate spreads and

 security risk is affected by improved flows of information.


 2.     THE "GLOBALIZATIOn" OF INFORMATION


        We next consider how differences in information affect international

portfolio decisions and the level of risk premiums. The available information

concerning a country's securities may vary depending on such factors as the

size or stage of development of the country or the location of the investors.

As one case, information
                                     may be of lower quality in smaller or in less

developed countries, reflecting the absence of economies of scale for creating

uniform accounting standards or for carrying out investments that provide

additional information.

      As another case, the quality of security information in each country may

be higher for local investors
                                           than for foreign investors. That is, local
investors will generally have an advantage in locating and interpreting




                                         --6--
 information about local securities. In this context, "Europe 1992"
                                                                       provides an
 example where the quality of information for the securities of a region is

 about to improve. As these countries adopt more uniform accounting and

 reporting standards, the informational advantages of local European investors

 relative to foreign investors might disappear.

      To evaluate the effects of an improvement in information, we have to

 quantify what we mean by the quality of information. We will do that here

within the context of mean/variance portfolio selection models.    In these

models, investors require parameter values for the expected return vector and

the variance/covariance matrix of returns. Standard treatments of     portfolio
selection theory assume either that investors know these parameters with

certainty or that estimates of the parameters can be used as if they were

certain, given that the true values are unknown. In either case, this leaves

no room for situations in which there exists a range of quality levels for

information. An alternative framework is thus necessary in order to    analyze
the effects of changing the quality of information.


Parameter   Uncertainty and   Estimation Risk


     A more general, and for us more useful, approach for dealing with

information can be derived from the finance literature concerned with parameter

uncertainty.      The starting point is to recognize that because investors

generally do not know the true parameters, they have to use statistical

techniques to construct estimates. Moreover, although the estimation process

provides a set of point estimates for the parameters, a band of uncertainty



        See, for example, Barry and Brown [1985], Bawa, Brown, and Klein
[1979], or Brown [1979].


                               ——7——
  necessarily remains. The parameter uncertainty literature
                                                                    analyzes how this
  estimation risk is properly incorporated in
                                                    portfolio selection decisions and
  models.

       To illustrate how this works, assume that
                                                  the true information is given by
  the set e = {p,
                  E}, with p the expected return vector and E the

  variance/covariance matrix. The investor maintains a diffuse (uninformative)

 prior concerning the parameters, but has access to T data observations from

 which the parameters can be estimated. Let
                                                    the resulting point estimates for
 the parameters be e* =     [p*,   E*J. Although this example uses the number of
 observations T to measure the quality of
                                                information, the parameter uncertainty
 literature recognizes that other improvements
                                                     in information quality can affect
 the variance/covariance matrix in a comparable manner.

      While standard portfolio selection
                                               theory treats the point estimates e* as
 if they were the true
                          parameters, the parameter uncertainty literature uses the
pictive distribution to take
                                       parameter uncertainty into account (see Bawa,
Brown, and   Klein   [l979J). The upshot is that different parameter values,
namely 0     {p*, (1 +   [l/TJ)z*},    are used for making portfolio decisions. In
particular, the estimated variance/covariance
                                                    matrix E* is multiplied by an
adjustment factor, 1 +    (l/T),   which is generally greater than one.
      The adjustment factor approaches one only as the number of observations T

approaches infini€y--that is, as the information becomes certain. Otherwise,
the effect of parameter
                           uncertainty is to raise the size of the perceived

variance/covariance matrix. We will use this approach to model an improvement

in information as if it created a reduction in the parameters of the




       See, in particular, Barry and Brown [1985], p. 413.


                               ——8-—
 variance/covariance matrix used by investors for determining their optimal

 portfolios.

      An alternative approach is illustrated in the paper by Michael Adler and

Bhaskar Prasad, "Optimal Foreign Currency Hedging When Information is

 Imperfect," which also appears in this symposium. In their approach, new

information becomes steadily available to the investor, who uses it to update

the prior density. In our approach, in contrast, the change in the quality of

information is a one-time event.


Capital Market Imperfections and Informational Imperfections


     The parameter uncertainty model for imperfect information can be compared

with the barriers to international investment model for imperfect capital

markets.      In the barriers model, capital ma:ket imperfections--such as

transactions costs and comparable impediments to trade--are treated as implicit

taxes on the returns to foreign investment. Reducing these barriers to

international investment thus raises the level of the expected return for

investors. In contrast, with the parameter uncertainty model, improving

information quality decreases the size of the perceived variance/covariance

parameters.

     The main point here is that an improvement in information quality, such as

the plans for "Europe 1992," can affect investor decisions through the

variaxice/covariance matrix, without directly affecting the expected returns.

Since an increase in expected returns may seem more tangible than a reduction

in parameter uncertainty, an informational change may appear less important,

even when it creates exactly the same increase in investor welfare.


        See Black [1974], Stulz [1981], and the survey in Adler and Dumas [19831.


                              --9--
 Endoenous Information Quality


      Our   discussion   has so far treated information quality as an exogenous

 factor in the model, which is sensible when looking at the effects of

 developments such as "Europe 1992." There are other contexts, however, in

 which the quality of information should be treated as an endogerious variable.

      One important case occurs when access to information requires an

 expenditure of resources by the investor. 6 The cost of information can be

 either a fixed cost or a    variable   cost that rises with the amount of

 information. The cost of information may also differ between local and foreign

 investors, with local investors facing lower costs than foreign investors for

obtaining local security information.

     Even when local investors have lower information costs, their expected

returns after subtracting information costs may also be lower, since the lower

cost of information will cause them to purchase more information. Of course,

local investors will also be receiving the benefits of higher quality

information. The upshot is that information may affect both the expected

return vector and the variance/covariance matrix in equilibrium, thus combining

what we earlier called the barriers and the parameter uncertainty models.

     Another case of endogenous information arises when investors      can infer

information by observing the market price. In this case, the market will

include both informed investors who can directly obtain information at a low

cost and uninformed investors for whom the cost of information is high, even

prohibitive. Although the uninformed investors are at a disadvantage, Grossman

and Stiglitz [19801 have shown that the market price may provide uninformed

                              --10--
 investors with free access to the information held by the informed investors.

 To the extent that this happens, it reduces the incentive for informed

 investors to allocate resources to obtain information. Thus, even when

 information is endogenous, it is still likely to be imperfect.

      Another   aspect of markets with informed and uninformed investors is that
the welfare     effects of improved information become more complex. For example,

the model of Stein [1987] develops a case in which the entry of additional

uninformed traders creates random variations in market prices, which decrease

the welfare of the informed traders. In the context of "Europe 1992," a

comparable result would be that improving the quality of information available

to non-European investors could reduce the welfare of European investors who

lose some of their advantage in terms of information.

     Still another effect of endogenous information- -adverse selection--may

arise when particular classes of investors can be explicitly recognized. A

good example in the case of international investment is that local borrocers

(and other sellers of securities) may realize that less information is

available to foreign investors than to local investors. As a result, local

borrowers may offer to foreign investors securities that have an inferior

expected return/risk ratio compared to the securities offered to local

investors. Foreign investors will then tend to withdraw from such markets, in

the same way that they do when facing investment barriers or lower information

quality.

     The importance of adverse selection will vary across markets, depending on

the extent to which the identity of local and foreign (or informed and

uninformed) investors is relevant. For example, adverse selection should not

be a serious problem on organized stock markets, where the identity of the



                              ——11—-
  traders does not directly enter into the transaction.   On the other hand,      in
 banking markets, the quality of loans made depends critically on the

  information available to the lender. In this case, foreign banks may find that

 their borrower applicant pool is of lower quality than the pool available to

 local banks.


 Conclusions Regarding Information


      The portfolio selection model that we develop in the next section provides

 a convenient, but simplified, starting point for evaluating the effects of

 higher quality information. The model is based on the parameter uncertainty

 approach, in that higher quality information is assumed to reduce the size of

 the variance/covariance parameters, which are treated as exogenous. We also

consider various cases in which domestic and foreign investors have

differential access to information. Since the supply of information     is

exogenous, however, there is no explicit role for adverse selection.


3. A MODEL OF ThE EQUILIBRIUf RISK PRENIUM


     This section of the paper develops a formal model of the equilibrium risk

premium on nominal risky assets, and shows how it is affected by   improvements

in information, interpreted as reductions, in several ways, of the estimated

variance of returns. The model has two risky assets, one domestic and one

foreign, and two representative investors, domestic and foreign, who hold

portfolios composed of both assets. The returns on both assets follow

stochastic processes in continuous time, as do the exchange rate and the two


        If necessary, foreign traders could even use local agents to complete
their transactions. Of course, corrupt local agents can still take advantage
of traders, as we have seen recently in some U.S. futures markets.


                           --12--
price levels used to deflate wealth by the two investors.8 This represents an

extension of the models developed in Branson and Henderson [1985] and Fraga

[1986].

        We first derive the individual investors' portfolio demands, following the

example in Branson end Henderson [1985J. We then solve for the market

equilibrium risk premium, following the example in Fraga [1986]. The terms in

this risk premium can be interpreted as stochastic deviations from uncovered

interest parity (UIP) and purchasing-power parity (PPP). This analysis unifies

the literature on international risk premia, exemplified by Frankel and

MacArthur    [1988], and the finance literature on portfolio demands.

        In the following analysis, we study the effects on asset demands and the

risk premium of changes in information characterized by estimates of the

variance of the stochastic returns. We first look at a change in information

about the "foreign" asset that is shared by all market participants. Then we

study the asymmetric case in which the home investors' estimate of the variance

on the foreign asset differs from the foreign investors' estimate. This could

be interpreted as the effect of an action that reduces the foreign investors'

information advantage. We find that in both cases, an improvement in

information on the foreign asset shifts demand in that direction, reducing the

size of the foreign asset's risk premium.


International Asset Demands: Home Investor


        We begin with the problem facing the domestic investor, whose real wealth

is given by



        8Compared to Branson and Henderson [1985] and Fraga [1986], this sets
cz*   = 0, and makes the returns stochastic, to give us the case of risky assets.

The entire home investors' portfolio in the first separable form can be written

as

             This is the solution for A obtained by minimizing the portfolio variance

Here all of wealth is held in the minimum-variance portfolio, i.e.,

Amin +     (1    -            = 1, combined with holdings of a zero net worth speculative
                     Amin)
portfolio that are inversely proportional to RA. The second separable form of

the portfolio in [16) shows it as a weighted average of the minimum-variance

portfolio and the portfolio of a "logarithmic" investor with R = 1, i.e.

(D +   C   + Z)/A.        This is the form favored by Adler and Dumas [1983].

       We can immediately check the derivative of A with respect to cr, which

enters A and Z linearly, and D and C not at all. The result is given by



[18]         =       (1   -
                              A),



which is positive if A <                 1;   that is, less than all of wealth is held in the

home asset. In this case an increase in the home investors' estimate of

holding all covariances constant, increases the share of the home asset in the

portfolio, i.e., drives the home investor home. If A > 1, so (1 - A) <                       0,   the

home investor is borrowing abroad to hold more than all his wealth in home

assets. In this case,                              is negative. An increase in   reduces the

extent to which the investor borrows abroad.

       It will be useful in interpreting later results to study at this point the

derivative of A with respect to c, holding all correlation coefficient rs

constant. Using the definition of the covariance in terms of the correlation

coefficient Pfj =             jøfrf1,        we obtain the derivatives of A, C, and Z with

respect to o shown below in equations [33]. Using those, we obtain the result

 First    we note that if all r's =               0,   the expression in [19] is equivalent to

 [18]: an increase in af directly increases A. The sign of the coefficient of

 b rbf is unclear. Below we assume that rbf                            0. The sign of the coefficient

 of i..   rf   is negative; below we assume rf 0. The sign of the coefficient of

 0e ref is also unclear. Below we assume ref >                         0,   so this coefficient should be

positive to contribute to an increase in A. It is sufficient for this

coefficient to be positive that A <                    0.5   assuming R      1.


Demand by the Foreign Investor


        The foreign investors' real wealth is given by



[20]       =     = (B*/E) + F*


The foreign objective function is the same as [8] with W* substituted for W.

The foreign investors' portfolio shares are given by


[21] B*/E = A* W*, and            [22]   F* =     (1   -
                                                           A*)   W*.



We assume at this stage that information sets of the two investors are

identical, so the foreign investor observes the same stochastic processes (9]

[13) as the home investor. We also assume equal degrees of risk aversion.

Then, following the same procedure for solving the foreign investors' portfolio

problem as for the home investor yieJds the foreign demand for the home asset:

                                                                     Pep*)


Again, the foreign investors' portfolio can be characterized in terms of a

minimum-variance portfolio Ajn =                            Z*/A    and 1 -     plus a speculative

portfolio inversely proportional to RA.

       Again, we can check the effect of an increase in                             on the foreign

Investors portfolio. Noting that                                enters linearly in A and Z*, and not at

all in D or C*, we have

       * =1                -        > 0 if )* < 1,

similar to the result for the home investor. An increase in the commonly-

perceived riskiness of the foreign asset, represented by an increase in

 2
     holding all p s constant, drives both investors toward the home asset.

       It will also be useful in interpreting later results to obtain here the

derivatives of Ak with respect to o and °b' holding all r's constant. The

first will be useful in examining the effect of an increase in identical

market-wide information on returns on one asset (here F) on the equilibrium

risk premium D. The second will be useful in looking at the effects of an

improvement In each set of investor's information about the returns on the

others' assets.



                                            -—19—-
        Following the same procedure used earlier for aX/f, we obtain



                   2(1   - X*)        + (2X*     -
 (25]                                                   °b rbf

                   + (1    -

The first two terms are the same as in X/øf, with X* in for X. The sign of

the coefficient of the ae ref term is again unclear, because of conflicting

effects from Z* and A. The sign of the coefficient of the                              rf is
negative. An increase in the covariance of * and the return on F makes the

foreign asset less risky to the foreign investor.

        For the effect of            on X*, we obtain



[26j        = J [- 2) 0b       + (2X*      -

In general, we would expect an increase in °b to reduce foreign demand for the

home bond. The first term in [26] is negative. The sign of the coefficient of

of rbf is unclear, but later we assume rbf                            0. The coefficient of 0e reb is

unclear. We assume reb <             0, so X > 0.5 would ensure that the term is
positive. The coefficient of a rbP* is positive, but we assume rbP*                              0.



Conditions for Rome Asset Preference (HAP)


        Since the home and foreign investors deflate nominal wealth by different

deflators, we wish to see the conditions under which HAP holds. We define HAP

as X - X* >   0.    From [16] and [23],

                                      --20--
       X -    =            [C   -   C* + R(Z     -




Checking the definitions of C, C*, Z, and Z* will confirm that
C - C*   = -(Z    -             so we have for HAP


[27J x -      =       R-      1(Z -



where:


[281 (Z -    Z*) =        e     -
                                    be    +
                                              ef      -
                                                          ep+   Pfp -



                                                     + (Pep* + Pfp*


If R > 1, (Z -        Z*)     > 0     is sufficient for HAP. How do we interpret this

condition?

       First, if the assets were not risky, with non-stochastic returns we would

have

       z -    =           +           -
                      e         ep*        ep


as in Fraga [1986]. If PPP were to hold ex p, this would be zero." If PPP

does not hold ex , as the evidence overwhelmingly indicates {See Frenkel
[1981] or Frankel and               MacArthur        [1988]], then a larger, more positive Pep or a

smaller, more negative, Pep* would reduce HAP. This is an intuitive result.

From equation [5] for the home investors' real wealth, a larger Pep reduces

the risk in holding the foreign asset F, reducing X. From equation [20] for




       11See Appendix, Section 1.


                                              --21--
 the foreign investors' real wealth, a more negative               Pep* would reduce the risk

 in holding the home asset R, increasing X*.

        Second, if the asset returns are risky, but the price indexes are non-

 stochastic, we have



                     e      be      ef


 If TJIP were to hold ex fl2. this would be zero. 12 mis, too, is an intuitive

 result. From the point of view of the home investor, an increase in the

stochastic deviations from UIP makes the return on the foreign asset F more

volatile, increasing A. From the point of view of the foreign investor, an

increase in these deviations makes the return on the home asset more volatile,

reducing A*.

       The remaining terms in Z -        Z*    are the covariances of the asset returns and

price levels:


             -           + (Pf* -
                  Pf)
From [6] for the home investors' wealth, it is clear that an increase in               the
covariance       of the domestic price level and the home bond return relative to the

covariance of the domestic price level and the foreign asset will increase A.

For the foreign iavestor, an increase in the covariance of F and               * relative to
that   of B and P* will reduce X'.

       Thus the conditions for HAP           are   readily interpreted in terms of stochastic

deviations from PPP and          UIP, and the covariances of nominal asset returns and
price levels.

                                    --22--
Narket Equilibrium with Identical Information


        We can now proceed to the solution for the equilibrium risk premium, which

we have defined above as D =              ib -   lf   -   lTe   Following the way Fraga [1986) set

up the problem, we note that market equilibrium for the domestic asset B

requires that


[291 b = wX          + (1   -




where b = B/(W + EW*) and w = W/(W + EW*).                      Substitution from equations [16]

for X and      [23]      for )* and solving for D yields the equilibrium risk premium

with    identical information and risk aversion:

(30J D =      RAID   -   w(R    - l)(Z - Z*) - (C* + RZ*).

Here,    consistent with the macroeconomic literature, an increase in the relative
supply      of the domestic asset b will increase the risk premium, and a transfer

of wealth to domestic investors will reduce it, assuming RAP holds, that is,

z -    z*   > 0.

        One immediate result can be obtained by inspection of the expression for D

in [30J. The variance and covariance terms all enter linearly in A, Z, Z, and

C*. So a proportional increase in all variances, representing a general

increase in riskiness, would expand D around zero, making it larger in absolute

value by the percentage increase in riskiness, measured by the variances and

covariances.

        We can now ask what effect a change in the commonly-perceived riskiness of

the foreign asset has on the equilibrium risk premium D. We have two

alternative ways of characterizing this perceived increase in riskiness. The



                                        --23--
first is an increase in a, holding all covariance Pfi terms constant.13 This

yields a clear cut result. The second is an increase in of, holding all

correlation coefficients rfi constant, so that all the Pfj change by

   rfj døf. These results require further interpretation.
       First, we note that                     enters only A, Z, and Z in equation [30], with

each having a partial derivative with respect to                                  of unity. So on the first

interpretation of an increase in the riskiness of F, we have



[31]           = R(b         -
                                 1) < 0.
           2




An increase in the commonly-perceived riskiness of F reduces the size of the

risk premium on the home asset B. Conversely, if the perceived riskiness of

European assets were reduced by the 1992 actions, the dollar asset risk premium

would rise as investors shifted toward European assets.

       Now we consider an increase in o, holding all r's constant. From [30] we

have the differential:


                            BA                (aZ          az*       aC*   - 3*
[32] Ba = Rb                     -
                                     w(R -
                                             l),-      -
                                                           Ba)
                                                                 -




From the definitions of the terms A, Z, Z*, C, and C,


               =
       B           2(af + a ref - °b            rbf);

Note that if all r's (and therefore p's) are zero, [34] for D/aaf is

equivalent to [31] for aD/aa, holding all p's constant. The signs of the

coefficients in (33] are as follows


       2R(b - 1) <               0;

       R(2b - 1) depends on b

                                                         --25--
     The negative sign for the term in           and the uncertain sign for the term

in 0e ref are consistent with the results for A/of in equation [19] and

         in equation [25]. The overall result depends on the signs of the

correlation coefficients. We make the following assumptions:

     r1,, rf* > 0; nominal returns are positively correlated with own
1.


     inflation.

2.   rep >    0;   rep* <   0; devaluation raises the domestic price level and lowers
     the foreign.

3.   reb < 0; ref > 0; a shift in the return differential toward F generates a

     depreciation.

4.
     rbf, rf rbP* - 0.
With these presumptions, the second and fourth terms in [34] become

approximately zero, the first is negative, the fifth is positive, and the third

is unclear, but likely to be negative. The positive term in r*f represents

the reduction in risk on the real return on F as the covariance of * and the F

return rises.

     The uncertainty regarding the term in 0e ref arises from the possibility

that R(2b -   1) is positive. The 2b term appears because the overall variance

term RA is in the denominator of both A and X*, so an increase in Cf reduces A

and A* by increasing A. This alone would require an increase in D to maintain

equilibrium. This is offset by the positive effects through Z and Z* in the

numerators of A and A*. Thus is it likely that the term in 0e ref is negative;

it is sufficient that b =       0.5.
     Thus the general conclusion in the case of identical information is that a

reduction in riskiness of one asset shifts asset demands toward that asset,

increasing the risk premium in the other asset. The quantitative effects are



                                  --26--
given by equations [21J and [31 in our two cases, which are the same if all

fi terms are zero.


Market Equilibrium with Asymmetric Biased Information


        The experiments above assumed that information about the volatility of

the returns on the foreign asset improved identically for all investors. In

this section we ask what happens to the uncovered differential D if information

improves for only one set of investors. Specifically, we will assume that home

and foreign investors may have different estimates of the variance of the

returns on F; the home investors' cl differs from the foreign investors'

        This would be the case, for example, if the foreign investors had better

information on their home assets than the home investors have. A reduction in

    would represent an improvement in home investors' information about foreign

assets. This could be a result, for example, of the integration of European

financial markets in 1992. Non-European investors might acquire better (or

cheaper) information about European assets with no compensating change in the

knowledge available to Europeans on non-European assets.

        The procedure we follow is first to write the market equilibrium condition

                                             2           *2
for D, and      then    to calculate D/aaf, holding o and all covariance constant.

This    is equivalent to the first experiment above, but assumes that only the

home investors' information changes. This experiment can be interpreted as a

movement away from the identical information equilibrium if we begin with
2       *2                              2
    =
        o, and then change        only a.

        In   this case, with                 A and A* differ, as well as C and C* and Z

and Z*. So the equilibrium condition, from equation [29], is now



[35J b =         [D +   C   + RZJw +
                                     KX*[D
                                           + C* + RZ*1(l - w).



                                    --27--
Note here that since A A* we cannot linearize the solution, as before, and

that we could easily assume R R* without further complicating the analysis.

We consider a change in information to be more interesting that a change in the

taste for risk.

     If we isolate the terms in D in equation [35], we obtain




[36J b =         + lw]     +   C +RZ     +      -   ______


The home perception of riskiness of return on the foreign asset                 enters only

in A and Z, with A/ci =                = 1.     We can totally differentiate [36],

allowing D and     to change, use the solution for A in a substitution, and

solve for dD/da   to   obtain the result:


              w

     This result is intuitively clear. Given cli, an increase in                drives home

investors toward the home asset, reducing D.            The expression for X/Bcif in [19]
                                                      2                             *2
shows the shift in demand for the home asset. But X*/B0f = 0, since a , not

    enters the foreign investors' demand functions. So only home investors

shift home in this case, while in the case of identical information all

investors shift toward the home asset.

     A decrease in a,     representing       an improvement in home investors'

information about foreign assets, would increase D, raising the home interest

rate 1d relative to the foreign rate if. Thus one implication of the European


                                --28--
financial reforms of 1992 might be to reduce interest rates (and the cost of

capital) in Europe relative to outside Europe.

        Next we turn to the case where c changes, holding all r's constant. This

is the equivalent of the second experiment earlier, but with only the home

investor's demand functions shifting. Terms in                                  or fi enter A, C, and Z in

equation [36]; their derivatives with respect to                                are given in equation [33].

We totally differentiate equation [36], allowing D and o to change, holding

all rfjs constant, use the solution for A in a substitution, substitute the

and   aA/acf is given in equation [19] earlier. Note that, as in the case of

identical information, if all r's were zero, equation [38] would be equivalent

to [37].

      Since oniy the home investors' demands shift in this case, the home demand

shift is in the numerator of aD/30f. The direct effect via                                       is to reduce D

as a    rises,   as before. The effect via the 0e ref term is uncertain, as

discussed earlier. Since R >                1,   A <   0.5     is sufficient for this covariance

effect to be positive.




                                      --29--
Market Equilibrium with Symmetric Biased Information


       The last case we examine is one in which both sets of investors are

assumed to have better information about their home assets than the foreign

assets. This is a symmetric version of the case just discussed. We assume

that   it is possible that
                                   *            *
                                       and b °b' where the starred versions are

the foreign investors' estimates of the riskiness of returns. In this

framework we can examine the effect of a symmetric change in perceived risk by
                   *           *
              and °b' holding af and       constant. We will assume the changes in
changing
          *
   and 0b are equal to a common dø. We will then solve for the effects on D in

equation [36] in the two cases in which (a) all relevant p's are held constant,

and (b) all r's are held constant.

       Since the total differentiation of [36] effectively linearizes it, we

would expect the case of a change in symmetrically biased information to add a

term in the foreign demand shift to the numerators in the expressions in

equations [37] and [38] in the case of one-sided bias, with the opposite sign.

This is indeed the case.

       First, we note that the terms in dof will enter the differentials of A, C,

and Z in equation [36], and the terms in do will enter the differentials of
                                                                2       *2
A*, C*, and Z*. Totally differentiating (36], allowing D, o, and             to


change, holding all relevant p's constant, yields


       cm w
          x -l)+
                        l—w
[39] — = _________________
       d2  (w +l-w
           RA p*
Here the two demand shifts have offsetting effects on D.      With a symmetric

increase in perceived riskiness of the foreign return, both sets of investors

shift toward the home asset. So the sign of the numerator in [39] depends on

                              --30--
the net effect of the two shifts. If the entire model is symmetric, with A =

A*, w =     1 -    w, and (1 - X) = k*, then dD/do2 in [39] is zero.
     Turning to the case where all relevant r's are held constant, we must

first write the partial derivatives of A*, C*, and Z* with respect to

noting that in their previous definitions                is replaced by Ob:


     —aA*         20
                       b
                           -20f r*
                                 bf -       20 r*
                                                 eef'

   ac*

     — =-a f r*
     a z*
             bf                       +p* r*
                                           bp*
     aa

Now to obtain the solution for D/ao, we totally differentiate [36] allowing A,

A*, C, C*, Z, Z*, and D to change, and then substitute from [33] for

etc. to obtain


                   ax
                               + (1   -
                           f              w>.b

      —
                                   i —
                       (w      +
                       kRA          p*J

where A/a0f        is      given by equation [19], likely to be positive, and aX*/aab is

given by equation[26], likely to be negative.

     Although it is not obvious from the form in which [41] is written, if all

r's are assumed to be zero, it is equivalent to [39]. Again, the two demand

shifts have offsetting effects. It is obvious in [41] that if w               1 - w and

the two demand partials were equal in size, the effect on D would be zero. But

this is not likely to be the case, because the terms in the two partials are



                                            --31-—
not the same. But the general result from the cases of biased information is

that a one-sided improvement moves the investors with the improvement toward

that asset, reducing its relative expected return, while the effects are

offsetting with a two-sided improvement.



4.   CONCLUSIONS: THE EFFECTS OF IMPROVING INFORMATION



     We   can now summarize our main conclusions concerning the influence of
information   on portfolio decisions. A change in information always has the

direct effect, of course, of causing investors in each of the countries to

alter their portfolio decisions. But this is only the starting point for

analyzing the effects of changing information. For one thing, by aggregating

investor demand across countries, the effects of changing information on home

asset preference and on security risk premiums can also be deduced. For

another thing, if access to information varies by country, then changes in

information will have differential effects on investors in different countries.

     We assume in all cases that there are two countries--a home country and a

foreign country--each with a single risky investment asset. There then ensues

an improvement in information regarding investments in the foreign asset (the

asset in the foreign country). We will focus in this section on the case in

which the improvement in information reduces the variance of the return on the
                                                                                  14
foreign asset, while all covariances involving the foreign asset remain fixed.




     14 If the foreign asset variance changes while its covariances are
constant, then all the correlation coefficients involving the foreign asset
must be changing.


                             --32--
In Section 3, we derived comparable results for special cases, given that the

variance and covariance terms vary In proportion. 15

        We now summarize the results of a series of cases in which investors have

varying amounts of access to information changes.


Identical Access to Information


        We first consider the case in which all investors have identical access to

information, so that the reduced risk of the foreign asset is equally apparent

to   all of them. The direct        result is that investors in both countries allocate

a larger share of their portfolios to the foreign asset, as can be seen in

equations [18J and (24]. Since the improved information raises the demand for

the foreign asset, it will also reduce the foreign asset risk premium--the sum

of the nominal return on the foreign asset and the expected depreciation of the

home currency minus the nominal return on the home asset--as shown in equation

[31J.

         The   size of the increase in      demand   for each group of investors is
proportional, moreover, to the portfolio             share initially allocated to the

foreign asset. 16 Consequently, if home              asset preference is zero initially--

portfolio shares are      the same for home and        foreign   investors--then the change
in   information does not affect home asset preference. Alternatively, if home




     15 In this case, the correlation coefficients must be constant. Constant-
correlation coefficients and constant covariance terms yield the same resul: if
the correlation coefficients are all zero, or if the correlation coefficients
meet the other sufficient conditions identified in Section 3.

        16 For example,    from    equation [18J, it is easy to see that
     d(1 - X) =
                    -(l/A)(l   -

        da




                                   --33--
asset preference is positive--the foreign asset share is higher for foreign

investors than for home investors--then home asset preference will rise as

foreign asset information improves.


Asymmetric Access to Information


     As a second case, it is assumed that the home and foreign investors have

differential access to information regarding the foreign asset. In particular,

in Section 3, we examined the case in which home country investors, and only

home country investors, observe an improvement in foreign asset information.

This could correspond, for example, to a case in which better information

regarding European securities becomes available to non-European investors.

     The direct result is again that the relevant investors--only the home

country investors in this case- -increase the share of their portfolios

allocated to the foreign asset. The demand by foreign investors does not

change since, by assumption, there is no change in the information available to

them. Given that foreign asset demand rises overall, the foreign asset risk

premium will fall, just as it did in the case of identical information (see

equation [37]). Of course, the magnitude of the change in the risk premium

will be limited, because the change in information is assumed to affect only

one group of investors.

     Since only the foreign asset demand of home country investors rises, the

information change also has the effect of reducing the magnitude of home asset

preference. For example, if home asset preference were initially positive,

then it would fall as home country investors allocate a larger share of their

portfolios to the foreign asset.




                            --34--
Syunetric But Biased Access to Information


     As the third case, it is assumed that both home and foreign investors

receive improved information, but regarding only the assets of their own

country: the home asset for home investors, and the foreign asset for foreign

investors. The result is that home investor demand shifts toward the home

asset, while foreign investor demand shifts toward the foreign asset. Home

asset preference thus unambiguously increases. Moreover, the two shifts in

demand occur in opposite directions, so if they are also equal in magnitude,

then there will be no net effect on equilibrium risk premiums. This is a good

illustration of the complex manner in which information can interact with real

interest rate spreads.


Applications to "Europe 1992"


     In using these results to analyze "Europe 1992," the most relevant case

would appear to be an asymmetric change in information, in which home country

investors (non-Europeans) observe a decline in the riskiness of foreign

(European) assets. As we have just seen, the result should be an increase in

demand and a reduction in the risk premiums with regard to European securities.

The beneficiaries of this change would include both non-European investors and

European borrowers (issuers of securities).

     The overall results of "Europe 1992," however, may be more complex than

this simple, direct, effect suggests. For example, non-European investors may

be surprised to find that improved information results in lower, not higher,

expected returns on European securities. In other words, the benefits of

reduced uncertainty may seem subtle compared to the reduction in expected


                            --35--
returns caused by the demand shift. The complex nature of evaluating welfare

effects when information changes is also illustrated in the paper by Bruce

Miller and Thomas Copeland, "The Welfare Effects of Public Information in an

Asymmetric Information Market," which also appears in this symposium.

     More generally, the information changes created by "Europe 1992" may be

the source of a variety of additional effects, some of which we can now

examine. An immediate point is that a change in risk premium levels creates

losers as well as gainers. For example, as the risk premiums on European

securities fall, European investors will earn lower returns on their local

investments. European investors will thus lose some or all of the excess

return they had been earning as a result of their informational advantage.

     Accounting for gainers and losers will become even more complex to the

extent that European investors will also gain from improved intra-European

information. For example, French investors may obtain better information with

regard to Spanish investments. Consequently, a French investor will benefit

from improved information regarding his non-French European investments, even

while he is losing with regard to French investments.

     Another factor is that the improvements in information may be restricted

to certain classes of European securities. For example, additional information

may become available primarily for publicly traded debt and equity securities,

where uniform accounting and reporting standards are relevant. In contrast,

changes of this form are unlikely to create benefits for bank loans that are

originated in local markets and held by local banks. 17 Nevertheless, interest

rates on bank loans may still decline, assuming that "Europe 1992" encourages


     17 See Jaffee and Stiglitz [19891, for a discussion of the informational
aspects of bank lending.


                            --36--
entry by foreign banks into local markets as part of banking industry

deregulation.

       The   changes created by "Europe 1992" may even increase the riskiness of
certain      European securities. A particularly intriguing possibility is that the

government bonds of European countries may become risky as these countries lose

their autonomy with regard to monetary and fiscal policy.      In this case, the

government bonds of European countries would be similar to the bonds issued by

various state governments within the United States. The result, of course,

would be an increase in the interest rates for these securities.


The Role of Information for Real Interest Spreads


      This paper began by noting that real interest rate levels in countries

could vary as the result of risk premiums. Although the finance literature has

focused on such factors as unequal distributions for wealth and securities, or

different consumption preferences, as the source of real interest rate spreads,

we have shown that imperfect information may be an equally important source of

these rate spreads.

       In particular, an improvement in information will generally   be reflected
in   reduced real interest rate spreads. Although such changes are usually

beneficial, there will be a distribution of gainers and losers. With regard to

"Europe 1992," for example, the reduction in real interest rate spreads will

also reflect, among other things, a reduction in the ability of European

central banks to control their domestic interest rates through monetary policy.
