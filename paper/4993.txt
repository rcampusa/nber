                                          ABSTRACT

       This paper outlines the fundamental economic forces that have led to the decline in

traditional banking, that is the process of making loans and funding them by issuing short-dated

deposits. The declining competitiveness of traditional banking may threaten financial stability

by increasing bank failures and by increasing the incentives for banks to take on more risk, either

by making more risky loans or by engaging in "nontraditional" financial activities that promise

higher returns but greater risk. This paper argues that most nontraditional activities, such as

banks acting as derivatives dealers, expose banks to risks and moral hazard problems that are

similar to those associated with banks' traditional activities, and that these activities can be

regulated as effectively as can traditional activities. One regulatory approach to maintain

financial stability and strengthen the banking system is to adopt a system of structured bank

capital requirements with early corrective action by regulators. An important element in this

approach is that market-value accounting principles would be applied to banks and there would

be increased public disclosure by banks of the risks associated with their trading activities. With

this regulatory structure in place, banks could be permitted greater freedom to expand into

nontraditional activities.

I. INTRODUCTION
       The traditional banking business has been to make long-term loans and fund

them by issuing short-dated deposits, a process which is commonly referred to as

"borrowing short and lending long". In recent years fundamental economic forces

have undercut the role of traditional banks in financial intermediation. As a source

of funds for financial intermediaries, deposits have steadily diminished in importance.

In addition, the profitability of traditional banking activities (such as business
lending) has diminished in recent years. As a result, banks have increasingly turned

to new non-traditional financial activities as way of maintaining their position as

financial intermediaries.1

       This paper discusses two objectives: to examine the forces responsible for the

declining role of traditional banking in the United States as well as in other coun-

tries, and to explore the implications of this decline and banks' responses to it for

financial stability and regulatory policy. A key policy issue is whether the decline of

banking threatens to make the financial system more fragile. If nothing else, the

prospect of a mass exodus from the banking industry (possibly via increased failures)

could cause instability in the financial system. Of greater concern is that declining

profitability could tip the incentives of bank managers towards assuming greater risk

in an effort to maintain former profit levels. For example, banks might make loans


     Although many banks may be able to maintain their relative position as financial
intermediaries by engaging in "non-traditional" banking activitives, for policy purposes it is
important to focus on the economic forces that have undercut the role of "traditional"
banking. Indeed, an important question is whether important public policy issues are raised
by banks having to transform themselves into financial intermediaries that look more like
nonbank financial intermediaries.
                                           2
to less creditworthy borrowers or engage in "nontraditional" financial activities that

promise higher returns but carry greater risk. A new activity that has generated

particular concern recently is the expanding role of banks as dealers in derivatives

products. There is a fear that in seeking new sources of revenue in derivatives banks

may be taking risks that could ultimately undermine their solvency and possibly the

stability of the banking system.
       The challenge posed by the decline of traditional banking is twofold: we need

to maintain the soundness of the banking system while restructuring the banking

industry to achieve long term financial stability. A sound regulatory policy can

encourage an orderly shrinkage of traditional banking while at the same time

strengthening the competitive position of banks, possibly by allowing them to expand

into more profitable nontraditional activities. In the transitional period, of course,

regulators would have to continue to be vigilant against excessive risk-taking that

could threaten financial stability.

       The first part of our paper documents the declining financial-intermediation

role of traditional banks in the United States. We discuss the economic forces that

are driving this decline, in both the United States and in foreign countries, and how

banks have responded to these pressures. Included in this discussion is an examina-

tion the activities of banks in derivatives markets, a particularly fast-growing area of

their off-balance sheet activities. Finally, we examine the implications of the

changing nature of banking for financial fragility and regulatory policy.

II. THE DECLINE OF TRADITIONAL BANKING IN THE UNITED STATES

       In the United States the importance of commercial banks as a source of funds

to nonfinancial borrowers has shrunk dramatically.       In 1974 banks provided 35

percent of these funds; today they provide around 22 percent. (See Figure 1) Thrift

institutions (savings and loans, mutual savings banks and credit unions), which can

be viewed as specialized banking institutions, have also suffered a decline in market

share, from over 20 percent in the late 1970's to below 10 percent in the early 1990's.

(See Figure 2).
       Another way of viewing the declining role of banking in traditional financial

intermediation is to look at the size of banks' balance-sheet assets relative to those

of other financial intermediaries. (See Table 1.) Commercial banks' share of total

financial intermediary assets has fallen from around the 40 percent range in the 1960-

80 period to below 30 percent by the end of 1993. Similarly, the share of total

financial intermediary assets held by thrift institutions has declined from around 20

percent in the 1960-80 period to below 10 percent by 1993.2

       Boyd and Gertler (1994) and Kaufman and Mote (1994) correctly point out

that the decline in the share of total financial intermediary assets held by banking

institutions does not necessarily indicate that the banking industry is in decline. In

particular, banks have been increasing their off-balance sheet activities (an issue we

discuss later), and therefore their role in financial markets may be understated by

looking solely at the on-balance sheet activities. However, the decline in traditional

banking which is reflected in the decline in their share of total financial intemediary

assets raises important policy issues that are the focus of this paper.



III. WHY IS TRADITIONAL BANKING IN DECLINE?

        Fundamental economic forces have led to financial innovations which have

increased competition in financial markets.       Greater competition, in turn, has

diminished the cost advantage banks have had in acquiring funds and has undercut

their position in loan markets.      The result has been reduced profitability of
traditional banking, and an effort by banks to diversify into new and more profitable

activities.



        A. Diminished Advantage in Acquiring Funds (Liabilities)

        Until 1980 deposits were a cheap source of funds for U.S. banking institutions

(commercial banks, savings and loans, mutual savings banks and credit unions).

Banks were subject to deposit rate ceilings that restricted them from paying interest

on checkable deposits and Regulation Q limited them to paying specified interest

rate ceilings on savings and time deposits. For many years these restrictions worked

to the advantage of banks because a major source of their funds was checkable
deposits (which in 1960 and earlier years constituted over 60 percent of total bank

deposits). The zero interest cost on these deposits resulted in banks having a low

average cost of funds.
                                         5

       This cost advantage did not last. The rise in inflation beginning in the late

1960's led to higher interest rates and made investors more sensitive to yield
differentials on different assets. The result was the so-called disintermediation

process, in which depositors took their money out of banks paying low interest rates

(on both checkable and time deposits) and purchased higher yielding assets. In
addition, restrictive bank regulations created an opportunity for nonbank financial

institutions to invent new ways to offer bank depositors higher rates. Nonbank

competitors were not subject to deposit rate ceilings that restricted banks, and did

not have the costs associated with having to hold non-interest bearing reserves and

paying deposit insurance premiums. A key development was the creation of money

market mutual funds (MMMF's), which put banks at a competitive disadvantage

because MMMF shareholders (or depositors) could obtain check-writing services

while earning a higher interest rate on their funds. Not surprisingly, as a source of

funds for banks, low-cost checkable deposits declined dramatically, falling from 60

percent of bank liabilities in 1960 to under 20 percent today.

       The growing disadvantage of banks in raising funds led to their supporting

legislation in the 1980's to eliminate Regulation Q ceilings on time deposits and to

allow checkable deposits that paid interest (NOW accounts). Although these changes

helped to make banks more competitive in their quest for funds, it also meant that

their cost of funds rose substantially, reducing the cost advantage they enjoyed.

       B. Diminished Income (or Loan) Advantages

       Banks have also experienced a deterioration in the income advantages they

once enjoyed on the asset-side of their balance sheets. The growth of the commer-

cial paper market, the junk bond market and the increased securitization of assets

have undercut their traditional advantage in providing credit.

       Improvements in information technology, which have made it easier for

households, corporations and financial institutions to evaluate the quality of
securities, have made it easier for business firms to borrow directly from the public

by issuing securities. In particular, instead of going to banks to finance short-term

credit needs, many business customers now borrow through the commercial paper

market.   Total nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding as a percentage of
commercial and industrial bank loans has risen from 5 percent in 1970 to over 20

percent today.
       The rise of money market mutual funds also has indirectly undercut banks by

supporting the expansion of competing finance companies. The growth of assets in

MMMF's to over $500 billion created a ready market for commercial paper because

money market mutual funds must hold liquid, high-quality, short-term assets.

Further, the growth in the commercial paper market has enabled finance companies,

who depend on issuing commercial paper for much of their funding, to expand their

lending at the expense of banks. Finance companies provide credit to many of the

same businesses that banks have traditionally served. In 1980 finance company loans
                                           7
to businesses amounted to about 30 percent of banks' commercial and industrial

(C&I) loans; today these loans constitute over 60 percent of banks' C&I loans.

       The junk bond market also has taken business away from banks. in the past

only Fortune 500 companies were able to raise funds by selling their bonds directly

to the public, bypassing banks. Now, even lower-quality corporate borrowers can

readily raise funds through access to the junk bond market. Despite predictions of

the demise of the junk bond market after the Michael Milken embarrassment, it is

clear that the junk bond market is here to stay. Although sales of new junk bonds

slid to $2.9 billion by 1990, they rebounded to $16.9 billion in 1991, $42 billion in

1992, and $60 billion in 1993.

       The ability to securitize assets has made nonbank financial institutions even

more formidable competitors for banks.          Advances in information and data

processing technology have enabled nonbank competitors to originate loans,
transform these into marketable securities, and sell them to obtain more funding with

which to make more loans. Computer technology has eroded the competitive

advantage of banks by lowering transactions costs and enabling nonbank financial

institutions to efficiently evaluate credit risk through the use of statistical methods.

When credit risk can be evaluated using statistical techniques, such as is the case for

consumer and mortgage lending, banks no longer have an advantage in making loans.

An effort is being made in the United States to develop a market for securitized

small business loans as well.
                                          8

       U. S.banks also have been beset by increased foreign competition, particularly

from Japanese and European banks. The success of the Japanese economy and
Japan's high savings rate gave Japanese banks access to cheaper funds than were

available to American banks. This cost advantage permitted Japanese banks to more

aggressively seek out loan business in the United States, which resulted to the erosion

of U.S. banks' market share. In addition, banks from all major countries have
followed their corporate customers to the United States and have often enjoyed a

competitive advantage because of less burdensome regulation in their own countries.

Prior to 1980, two U.S. banks, Citicorp and Bank America, were the largest banks

in the world. In the 1990's neither of these banks ranks among the top twenty.
While some of this loss in market share may be due to the depreciation of the dollar,

most of it is not.



IV. EROSION OF BANK PROFITABILITY

       Not surprisingly, reduced advantages in raising funds and in making loans has

eroded the profitability of traditional banking.        Two standard measures of
commercial bank profitability (shown in Figure 3), the pre-tax rates of return on
assets and equity, both indicate a decline in bank profitability. The before-tax rate

of return on equity declined from an average of 15 percent in the 1970-84 period to

below 12 percent in the 1985-91 period. Although bank profits improved sharply in

1992 and 1993, many observers believe that these profits are transient and are due

to favorable interest rate developments that will not last.

       Overall bank profitability, however, provides a misleading indicator of the

profitability of the traditional banking business.   In the 1980's U.S. commercial

banks derived an increasing share of their profits from off-balance sheet activities.

(See Figure 4) As a share of total bank income, noninterest income derived from

off-balance-sheet activities, such as fee and trading income, averaged 19 percent in

the 1960 to 1980 period. By 1993, however, this source of income had grown to in

excess of 35 percent of total bank income. Indeed, if we look at bank profitability

excluding noninterest income, the declining trend in the profitability of banks'
traditional businesses becomes evident. The pre-tax return on equity excluding

noninterest income has fallen from       10 percent in 1960 to levels that approached

negative 10 percent in the late 1980's and early 1990's. (See Figure 5)

       The same forces are at work in other countries. The loss of banks' monopoly

power over depositors has occurred outside the United States as well. Financial

innovation and deregulation are occurring world-wide and have created attractive

alternatives for both depositors and borrowers.         Japan is a clear example.

Deregulation has opened a wide array of new financial instruments to the public,

causing a disintermediation process similar to that which has taken place in the

United States. European countries which have protected their banking sectors from
competition (such as Germany) will no longer be able to do so in the future with the

advent of European-wide banking.

       In recent years banks in other countries also have faced increased competition

from the expansion of securities markets.     Both financial deregulation and funda-

mental economic forces in other countries have improved the availability of
information in securities markets, making it easier and less costly for business firms

to finance their activities by issuing securities rather than going to banks. Further,

even in countries where securities markets have not grown, banks have still lost loan

business because their best corporate customers have had increasing access to foreign

and offshore capital markets, such as the Eurobond market. In smaller economies,

like Australia, which still do not have well-developed corporate bond or commercial

paper markets, banks have lost loan business to international securities markets. In

addition, the same forces that drove the securitization process in the United States

are at work in other countries, and will undercut the profitability of traditional
banking in these countries as well. Thus, although the decline of traditional banking

has occurred earlier in the United States than in other countries, the same forces are

at work in other countries and will ultimately result in a diminished role for tradi-

tional banking in these countries as well.




V. HOW HAVE BANKS RESPONDED?

       In any industry a decline in profitability usually results in exit from the
industry (often by widespread bankruptcies) and a shrinkage of market share. This

occurred in the banking industry in the United States during the 1980's. In the 1960

to 1980 period, bank failures in the United States averaged less than ten per year,
                                            11

but during the 1980's bank failures soared, rising to over 200 a year in the late 1980's.

(See Figure 6)
       In an attempt to survive and maintain adequate profit levels, many U.S. banks

are facing two alternatives.    First, they can attempt to maintain their traditional

lending activity by expanding into new, riskier, areas of lending. For example, U.S.

banks have increased their risk-taking by placing a greater percentage of their total

funds in real estate loans, traditionally a riskier type of loan. (Figure 7) In addition,

they have increased lending for corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts, which are

highly-leveraged transactions loans.      There is evidence that banks have in fact
increased their lending to less creditworthy borrowers. During the 1980's banks' loan

loss provisions relative to assets climbed substantially, reaching a peak of 1.25

percent in 1987 and remaining high thereafter. (Figure 8) Recent evidence suggests

that large banks have taken even more risk than have smaller banks: large banks

have suffered the largest loan losses (Boyd and Gertler (1993)). Thus, banks appear

to have maintained their profitability (and their net interest margins -- interest
income minus interest expense divided by total assets) by taking greater risk.3 (See

Figure 9)
       The second way banks have sought to maintain former profit levels is to

pursue new, off-balance sheet, activities that are more profitable. As we have seen

in Figure 4, U.S. commercial banks did this during the early 1980's, doubling the

      U.S. banks have an incentive to take additional risk because of federal deposit insur-
ance. Insured depositors have little incentive to monitor banks and to penalize them for
taking too much risk. This moral hazard problem is compounded by our de facto "too-big-
to-fail" policy for large banks.

 share of their income coming from off-balance sheet, noninterest-income, activities.

This strategy, however, has generated concerns about what are proper activities for

banks and about whether nontraditional activities might be riskier and result in banks

taking excessive risk. For example, there is considerable current controversy about

whether banks should be permitted to engage in unlimited derivatives activities,

including being off-exchange (OTC) derivatives dealers.          Some feel that such
activities are more risky than traditional banking and could threaten the stability of

the entire banking system. (We discuss this issue more fully at a later point in the

paper.)

          The United States is not the only country to experience increased risk-taking

by banks. Large losses and more bank failures have occurred in other countries.

Banks in Norway, Sweden and Finland responded to deregulation by dramatically

increasing their real estate lending, which was followed by a boom and bust in real

estate sectors that resulted in the insolvency of many large banking institutions.

Indeed, banks' loan losses in these countries as a fraction of GNP exceeded losses

in both the banking and savings and loans industries in the United States. The

International Monetary Fund (1993) reports that government (or taxpayer) support
to shore up the banking system in Scandinavian countries is estimated to range from

2.8 to 4.Opercent of GDP, which is comparable to the savings and loan bailout in the

United States (which amounted to 3.2 percent GDP).

       Japanese banks also have suffered large losses due to riskier lending,
particularly to the real estate sector. The collapse of real estate values in Japan left
                                          13

many banks, such as Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company, one of the world's

largest, with huge losses. Official estimates indicate the 21 largest Japanese banks

were holding over $136 billion of nonperforming loans -- loans on which interest

payments have not been made for more than six months--but many private analysts

think that the amount of nonperforming loans may be twice as large. Japan's

banking federation, with the assistance of the government, has set up cooperative

arrangements to shore up the banking system.
       Both French and British banks suffered from the worldwide collapse of real

estate prices and from major failures of risky real estate projects funded by banks.

 Olympia and York's failure is a prominent example. Just as in the United States,

the loan-loss provisions of British and French banks have risen in the 1990's,although

neither banking system appears to be threatened by major bank collapses. In addi-

tion, even in countries with healthy banking systems, such as Switzerland and

Germany, some banks have run into trouble. Regional banks in Switzerland failed,

and the Germany's BfG Bank suffered huge losses (DM 1.1 billion) in 1992 and

needed a capital infusion from its parent company Credit Lyonnais.              Thus,

fundamental forces not limited to the United States have caused a decline in the

profitability of traditional banking throughout the world and have created an
incentive for banks to expand into new activities and to take additional risks.

VI. BANKS' OFF-BALANCE SHEET DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES

         A good example of the controversy surrounding banks efforts to diversify into

off-balance sheet activities has been the increasing role of banks in derivative
markets. Large banks, in particular, have moved aggressively to become worldwide

dealers in off-exchange (OTC) derivatives, such as swaps.4 Their motivation, clearly,

has to replace some of their lost "banking" revenue with the attractive returns that

can he earned in derivatives markets.

         Banks have increased their participation in derivatives markets dramatically

in the last few years. In 1992, U.S. banks held derivative contracts totalling more

than $8 trillion (notional amounts).5 Of these, 52 percent were interest rate deriva-

tives, 46 percent were foreign exchange derivatives, and the remainder were equity

and commodity derivatives.6 In addition, most of these derivatives are held by large

banks, and are held primarily to facilitate their dealer and trading operations.7 (See

Table 2) In 1992, the seven largest U.S. bank derivatives-dealers accounted for more

than 90 percent of all derivatives contracts held by U.S. banks (based on notional




     As of the third quarter, 1993, all insured commercial banks held interest rate swaps
contracts with a notional value of $2.79 trifflon. See Bank Administration Institute and

amounts).8 (See Table 3) The profitability of derivatives activities for banks has

clearly been an important factor. In 1993, derivatives accounted for between 27 and

42 percent of the total trading income of four of the largest bank dealers.9 (See

Table 4)

         The increased participation of banks in derivatives markets has been a
concern to both regulators and legislators because they fear that derivatives may

enable banks to take more risk than is prudent. There can be little doubt that
derivatives can be used to increase risk substantially, and can potentially be quite

dangerous.'° In the last year many banks sustained substantial losses on interest

rate derivatives instruments when interest rate continued to rise. Because of the

leverage that is possible, derivatives enable banks to place sizeable "bets" on interest

rate and currency movements, which if wrong can result in sizeable losses. In
addition, as dealers in OTC derivatives markets, banks may be exposed to substantial

counterparty credit risk. Unlike organized futures exchanges, there is no clearing

house guarantee to mitigate the credit risk involved in OTC derivatives. Finally,

derivatives are often complex instruments, and may require sophisticated risk-control

systems to measure and track a bank's potential exposure. There is some question

about whether banks are currently capable of managing these risks.

         An example of the concern about the growing participation of banks in
derivatives markets are the remarks of Representative Henry Gonzalez, Chairman

of the Banking Committee of the House of Representatives:

            "1 have long believed that growing bank involvement in derivative products
is, as I say and repeat, like a tinderbox waiting to explode. In the case of many mar-
ket innovations, regulation lags behind until the crisis comes, as it has happened in
our case with S&L's and banks.
            "We must work to avoid a crisis related to derivative products before, once
again, ...the taxpayer is left holding the bag.""


         In May, 1994, Rep. Henry B. Gonzales (D., Tex.) and Rep. Jim Leach (R.,
Iowa) introduced The Derivatives Safety and Soundness Act of 1994. This bill directs

the Federal banking agencies to establish common principles and standards for
capital, accounting, disclosure and examination for financial institutions using
derivatives. In addition, the bill requires the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller

of the Currency to work with other central banks to develop comparable interna-

tional supervisory standards for financial institutions using derivatives. In discussing

the need for derivatives legislation, Rep. Leach said: "one of the ironies of the
development of [derivatives markets] is that while [individual firm] risk can be

reduced . . . systematic risk can be increased." A second problem, Leach said, is that

in many cases derivatives instruments "... are too sophisticated for financial

managers."

        A further indication of these concerns are the plethora of recent studies which

 have examined the activities of financial institutions in derivatives markets. Studies

have been conducted by the Bank for International Settlements (the "Promisel"

Report), the Bank of England, the Group of Thirty, the Office of the U.S. Comptrol-

ler of the Currency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and, most recently,

the U.S. Government Accounting Office (GAO).

        The GAO Report, released in May, 1994, focused on OTC derivatives and

concluded that there is some reason to believe that derivatives do pose a threat to

financial stability. The GAO Report raises the prospect that a default by a major

OTC derivatives dealer (and in particular by a major bank) could result in spill-over

effects that could "close down" OTC derivatives markets, with potentially serious

ramifications for the entire financial system. The GAO recommends that a number

of measures be taken to strengthen government regulation and supervision of all

participants in OTC derivatives markets, including banks.

       The fear of a major bank failure because of OTC derivatives activities appears

to stem from two sources. First, the sheer size of banks' OTC derivatives activities

suggests that they may be exposed to substantial market and credit risk due to their

derivatives positions. In particular, there is concern that as OTC derivatives dealers

banks may be exposed to sizeable counterparty credit risk. This concern has been

heightened in recent months by the near-bankruptcy of Metallgesellschaft, Germany's

14th largest firm and a major end-user (and counterparty) in the swap market.

Second, there is a fear that regulation (as well as managerial sophistication) has
                                            18


lagged   developments in the derivatives area, and as a consequence banks may be

taking more risk than is prudent (and more than they even realize).



         A. How Risky are Banks' OTC Derivatives Activities?

         Much of the concern about banks' activities in derivatives market has centered

on their central position as major dealers in the swap market. At year-end 1992, the

notional value of all swap contracts outstanding was $4.7 trillion." (See Table 5)

Interest rate swaps were 82 percent of this amount, with currency swaps making-up

most of the remaining contracts. (See Table 6)           Although detailed information

about the nature of these swap agreements is not available, it is likely that the bulk

of them are "plain-vanilla" swaps -- an exchange of fixed for floating rates. As such,

these contracts are similar to "strips" of forward or futures contracts (such as
Eurodollar futures strips).     Swaps are attractive to end-users because of their

customized nature, low cost, and longer maturities.

         As major dealers in the swap market, banks have extensive counterparty

obligations and may be exposed to substantial market and counterparty credit risk.

The notional (or principal) amount of the swap contracts that banks hold, however,

is not a good measure of the magnitude of their credit exposure. Unlike credit
instruments, such as loans and bonds, derivatives transactions (such as swaps) do not

involve payments of principal amounts.           Derivatives contracts require periodic


      This amount includes interest rate and currency swaps plus caps, floors, collars, and
swaptions outstanding. Equity, commodity, and multi-asset derivatives are not included.
The latter totalled $131 billion at year-end 1992. See Group of Thirty, (1993), p. 58.

payments based on notional amounts but not payments of the notional amounts

themselves. For example, a swap of a variable interest rate for a seven-percent fixed

rate on a $10 million principal (notional) amount commits the swap parties to annual

payments to each other of the order of $700,000,with differences in future payments

depending on how interest rates move in the future. A party's credit exposure, there-

fore, is not the notional value of the contract, as it is for a loan, but the "replacement

cost" of the contract.'4 Thus, the typical derivative transaction involves a credit

exposure that is only a fraction of its notional principal.

        The GAO Report closely examined fourteen major OTC derivatives dealers.

Together, these dealers held derivative contracts with a notional principal of $6.5

trillion, as of year-end 1992. The "gross"credit exposure (or "replacement cost") on
these derivatives, however, was far less. The GAO estimated the replacement cost

to be only $114 billion, or about 1.8 percent of the dealers' $6.5 trillion of notional

outstandings.'3

        In addition, this figure does not take into account the various risk-manage-

ment mechanisms that banks use to limit counterparty exposure.                       Bilateral



    14 Measured as of a point in time, only counterparties with profitable positions have a
credit risk. A losing counterparty has no credit risk. For example, assume that, under an
interest rate swap agreement, a firm receives fixed-interest payments and pays floating rates.
At the inception of this swap, the market value of the firm's position in the swap may be
zero. If, subsequently, interest rates decline substantially, the firm will receive more that it
will pay, so the fu-m will have a valuable or profitable position in the swap. This value,
created by the change in interest rates, is the firm's "replacement cost" for the swap, and
represents the credit risk to which it is exposed. If its counterparty defaults on future swap
payments, the replacement cost is the cost to the firm of replacing the swap on the same
favorable terms.

      These include both swaps and forward contracts.
                                             20
contractual netting provisions, which allow banks to offset losses with gains from

other contracts outstanding with a defaulting party and its corporate affiliates, are

common.        Also, when swaps are undertaken with lower-quality parties, such
counterparties are usually required to post collateral on a mark-to-market basis.
After taking these risk-reducing mechanisms into account, the GAO Report estimat-

ed the "net" credit exposure of the fourteen dealers to be only $68 billion, or about

1 percent of the notional value of their outstanding derivative contracts.

         This credit exposure is managed by banks in a variety of ways. Internal credit

limits are commonly used to diversify credit risk and to restrict the size of exposures

to individual counterparties, industries and countries. Most counterparties in swap

transactions are required to have investment grade ratings,'6 and credit "triggers'

frequently require the automatic termination of a swap agreement if the credit rating

of either party falls below a prespecified threshold (such as a single A rating).

         To put banks' derivatives credit exposures in perspective, the derivatives
exposures of bank-derivatives dealers' can be compared to credit exposures that the

same banks have as a consequence of their loan portfolios!7 For the seven largest

U.S. bank-derivatives dealers, derivatives-related "gross" credit exposures, as a

percentage of bank equity, were generally less than a fourth of their loan exposures.

(See Figure 10) Only Bankers Trust New York Corporation, which is probably the

most active bank in derivatives markets, had a "gross"derivatives credit exposure far

in excess of their loan exposure. While it is true that banks' credit exposure to

derivatives is substantial -- it exceeds 100 percent of the equity of all of the surveyed

banks, a bank's capital would be wiped out by derivatives' losses only if Jj
counterparties were to default, there were no offsetting netting agreements or other

risk-reduction mechanisms in force, and actual counterparty losses were identical to

total credit exposures. Such assumptions are extreme, for loan defaults as well as for

derivatives-related exposures.

        Properly measured, therefore, banks' credit-risk exposures associated with
their OTC derivatives activities do not seem out of proportion to their other credit

exposures, such as the exposure they have to defaults on their loan portfolio. Banks

also appear to be managing these derivative-related exposures reasonably well.
Indeed, the GAO reported that actual losses incurred by derivatives dealers as a

result of counterparty defaults have been quite small: 0.2 percent of their combined

gross credit exposure.'8

        Finally, derivatives activities also clearly can be used by banks to increase

their exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates (or to increase their

market risk). This kind of risk, however, is hardly new to banks. Banks have always

been exposed to such risks because of their holdings of fixed-rate, long-term, loans

and secuities, and because of their foreign operations and foreign currency positions.

Derivatives can be used either to increase or decrease these risks. Derivative
exposures, just as all other market risks, must be managed prudently.

           B. Regulation of Banks' Derivatives Activities

           There has also been concern that banks may be taking excessive risk in their

derivatives activities because of lax regulation.'9 Indeed, the GAO Report suggests

that there may be an intrinsic regulatory problem associated with banks' dealing in

OJC derivatives.

              "The regulation of banks is essential, because they have deposit insurance
and direct access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. At the same time,
however, this combination of deposit insurance and access also can result in potential
problems because it may induce the banks and their customers to inappropriately rely
on such backing. Therefore, banks may be willing to run greater risks in their trading
activities -- in relation to their capital -- than otherwise would be the case. In addi-
tion, market participants may prefer using banks for derivatives and related trading
activities simply because banks are perceived to be safer counterparties. In the past,
similar concerns caused us to recommend that nontraditional banking activities, such
as those associated with underwriting and dealing in corporate debt and equity
securities, be conducted only by well-managed and well-capitalized banks in separate
subsidiaries of the bank holding company. Whether derivatives should be placed in
this category depends on regulators' determinations on how they are being used by
individual banks."2°


          An important question, therefore, is whether banks' derivatives activities are

different from other bank activities such that they cannot be effectively regulated.

Is there something special about derivatives that makes it more difficult or even

impossible for prudential regulation to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and

taxpayers? A key issue is whether bank capital requirements, the central component

of prudential regulation, can be successfully applied to banks' derivatives activities.

If not, there may be an argument for either prohibiting derivatives activities (or

    19

States General Accounting Office (1994), pp. 69-84.

possibly dealer activities) or segregating them into separately-capitalized bank affili-

ates.2'

           Banks' derivatives activities are already subject to extensive prudential
regulation. Both U.S. and Basle Accord capital requirements apply to U.S. banks'

derivatives activities. U.S banks are required to comply with two different types of

capital requirements -- a risk-based requirement and a leverage ratio requirement.
The risk-based requirement applies to the credit risk associated with derivatives

contracts or activities. The leverage ratio requires banks to hold capital as a cushion

against losses arising from other risks associated with derivative positions, such as

operations risk. Not surprisingly, there is considerable controversy about whether

these capital requirements are too low or too high.

           The more important question, however, is whether an,y capital requirements

on derivatives activities can successfully control banks' risk-taking. Some argue that

derivatives are so complex and so non-transparent that it is impossible for regulators

to devise capital regulations to control banks' risk-taldng (or, for that matter, for the

market to monitor banks' derivatives activities).

           We are skeptical about this view. Although some derivatives instruments are

undoubtedly complex, exposure to derivatives risk does not seem much different from

exposure to many other bank activities, such as credit risk in a loan portfolio or

interest-rate risk on a variety of fixed-income securities. Banks can achieve high


    21
          Alternatively, there may be an argument for some form of "narrow banking," where
the deposit-taking function of the bank is separated from other activitIes of banks, such as
their derivatives activities.
                                             24

 leverage in a number of ways other than through derivatives, and can quickly change

 (or increase) their risk exposure in many different ways. While it is not clear how

 much capital should be required for a given derivatives risk exposure, and regulators

 may need to do some "catching-up," these implementation problems are not unique

 to derivatives activities.   All new bank activities are likely to present similar

problems.

        Thus, banks' recent push into derivatives activities raises all of the questions

commonly raised when banks engage in new off-balance sheet activities. Are these

activities too risky for banks? Do banks have the managerial capacity to engage in

these activities in a safe way? Can these activities be effectively regulated? The

challenges posed by these questions are no different for derivatives than they are for
other banking activities.



VII. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY

       The decline of traditional banking presents a challenge to regulators and

policy-makers. On the one hand, banks may respond to their shrinking intermediary

role and diminished profitability by taking greater risk, which, if unchecked, could

undermine the stability of the banking system. There is some evidence that banks

have in fact increased their risk-taking, either through riskier strategies in their tradi-

tional business lines or by seeking out new and more riskier activities. On the other

hand, long-run financial stability would benefit from a restructuring of the banking

industry that strengthens the competitive position of banks. To achieve this may
                                           25

require eliminating unnecessary (non-prudential) regulations and permitting banks

to enter new markets and to engage in new activities.

       One approach to achieving these dual objectives is to couple adequate capita]

requirements for banks with early corrective action by regulators in order to prevent

capital from falling below specified levels! Requiring banks to hold adequate

capital promotes financial stability in two ways. First, it provides a greater cushion

with which banks can absorb losses, lessening the likelihood of failure. Second, with

more capital at risk, banks have less incentive to take excessive risk -- they have

more to lose if their bets go wrong. To assure that banks hold the requisite
amount of capital and do not engage in either excessively risky or illegal activities,

supervision and field examinations of banks would continue to be necessary.24

       Requiring early corrective action by regulators, to recapitalize a bank that has

suffered an erosion in its capital, promotes stability in three ways. First, it provides

predictability for banks and bank shareholders.             Certain regulatory actions

predictably follow certain economic events. Second, it prevents a bank's capital from

falling to levels that threaten losses to the bank insurance fund. In addition, by



      This approach is discussed extensively in Benston and Kaufman (1988).

      To ameliorate the problem of potentially higher capital requirements imposing
additional costs on banks, bank capital could be defmed to include subordinated debentures
with a remaining maturity of at least two years and which are unredeemable for at least two
years.
   24 As Gorton and Rosen (1994) point out, corporate control (agency) issues may also
contribute to excessive risk-taking when traditional banking business declines. Thus steps
to control this agency problem may also be needed to control risk-taking. How to
accomplish this requires additional research and is beyond the scope of this paper.
                                               26
 requiring banks always to have a positive net worth, the moral hazard problem is

 mitigated -- banks will have something to lose by taking excessive risk. Lastly, early

corrective action mitigates the regulatory forbearance problem by preventing
regulators from using their discretion about whether or not to take action!
Regulators can no longer gamble with taxpayer funds.26

          A benefit of this regulatory strategy is that regulation need no longer restrict

banks' activities. As long as banks must hold sufficient capital against whatever

activities they engage in, taxpayers will be protected and banks will have an incentive

to avoid excessive risk-taking. Further, freedom to offer additional products and

services will better enable banks to compete with nonbank competitors (and with

foreign banks), and will make banks less susceptible to failure because they will be

better diversified. (An example of such diversification benefits is casualty insurance,

where losses are due principally to acts of god and have a very low correlation with

the losses that banks typically incur, which are due primarily to adverse economic

events.)

         A key component of this approach is that bank risk exposures need to be

measured accurately and capital requirements be set high enough to deter excessive



        As capital declined below certain "trigger" levels, for example, regulatory authorities
would be required to take specific actions, such as restricting the ability of the bank to
expand and preventing the bank from paying dividends and interest on subordinated
debentures.
   26
        The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 enacted a weaker version of this regulatory
approach. The legislation, nevertheless, appears to be working reasonably well in reducing
the costs associated with bank failures and in producing a healthier banking industry. See
Kaufman, (1994).
                                          27

risk-taking.   This requires, among other things, the adoption of market-value
accounting principles for valuing bank assets and liabilities.           Historical-cost

accounting principles do not assure that changes in the economic value of a bank's

assets and liabilities will be reflected in its true net worth. It is the market value of

a bank's assets and liabilities, and the market value of its equity capital, that
determines a bank's economic solvency. Further, the market value of a bank's net

worth is what the bank risks when it takes additional risk.

        Objections to market-value-based capital requirements center on the difficulty

of making accurate market-value estimates of assets and liabilities. Historical-cost

accounting has an important advantage in that it is easier to value assets and
liabilities. Market-value accounting, in contrast, requires estimates and approxima-

tions that are harder to justify and are often more expensive to obtain. Despite these

difficulties, market-value accounting may still be able to provide a more accurate

picture of a bank's economic condition. Clearly, an important research topic for

regulatory authorities is to examine the feasibility of applying market-value

accounting principles to banking institutions.
        Adoption of market-value accounting would have the additional advantage of

making a bank's condition more transparent and therefore making regulators and

politicians more accountable. Regulators and politicians are subject to a principal-

agent problem: they often have an incentive to hide potential problems, even though

taxpayers would be better off if they dealt with these problems sooner rather than

later (or not at all). Market-value accounting would make it easier for taxpayers to
                                          28
monitor the actions of regulators and politicians, and would make it more difficult

for regulators to engage in policies of forbearance. Finally, better public disclosure

of the risks that are incurred by all financial institutions, including banks, would

increase market efficiency and bolster market discipline. In particular, banks should

have to provide a meaningful depiction of the risks associated with their trading

activities, both in derivatives and in on-balance sheet securities, and of their ability

to manage these risks. More public information about the risks incurred by banks

will better enable stockholders, creditors and depositors to evaluate and monitor

banks, and will act as a deterrent to excessive risk-taking. This view is consistent

with a recent discussion paper issued the Euro—currency Standing Committee of the

6-10 Central Banks (1994), which goes so far as to recommend that estimates of

financial risk generated by firms' own internal risk management systems be adapted

for public disclosure purposes.27 Such information would supplement disclosures

based on traditional accounting conventions by providing information about risk

exposures and risk management that is not normally included in conventional balance

sheet and income-statement reports.



VIII. CONCLUSION

       The decline of traditional banking entails a risk to the financial system only

if regulators fail to adapt their policies to the new financial environment which is

emerging. A constructive regulatory approach is to adopt a system of structured

bank capital requirements together with early corrective action by regulators. An
important element of this system is the adoption of market-value accounting

principles for all financial institutions. In addition, greater public disclosure by all

financial institutions of the risks associated with their trading activities would be

beneficial. Lastly, to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of financial markets,

banks could be permitted to engage in a diversified array of both bank and
"nonbank" products and services. This general regulatory strategy, we believe, can

successfully keep in check excessive risk-taking by banks while providing the

flexibility for both banks arid regulators to restructure the banking system in order

to achieve greater long-term stability. Finally, we do not view banks' off-balance

sheet activities, such as their derivatives activities, to be a threat to financial stability.

Properly used and regulated, derivatives can facilitate the management of risk and

increase the long-term viability of banks and the financial system.
