This paper   derives statements   of the Heckscher—Ohlin Theorem which

remain valid In the presence of    market   power.   Following Helpman

(1981a), the paper explores restrictions on permissible trade patterns

that are Implied by the post—trade equilibrium conditions of Heckscher—

Ohlin theory.    Restrictions on the patterns or commodity trade are

derived to complement Helpman's factor content version or the

competitive Heckscher—Ohlin theory, and the introduction or factor

market power is shown to leave the validity or these restrictions

unaffected.    Restrictions on the pattern or Heckscher—Ohlin trade in the

presence of product market power are also derived, and conditions are

stated   under which Helpman's competitive factor content restrictions
continue to   hold.

     Efforts to generalize the predictions of the Heckscher—Ohlin (HO)

model of international trade have received a great deal of attention in

recent years.    A   gen   alization of the model to a world of many goods,

factors, and countries, In which factor prices are not necessarily

equalized or preferences i'ienttnl      and   homothetic can be found in

Deardorff (1982).     These predictIons take the form of correlations among

autarky factor prices, factor intensities, and multilateral trade in

goods and, like the standard HO predictions, can be stated in either a

commodity or a factor content version.         Such results are important in

that they demonstrate the implications of what Is perhaps the

fundamental assumption of HO theory——the international availability of

technology——without many of the additional assumptions that have made

the empirical relevance of the standard model suspect.

     One assumption that Is needed for Deardorff's results is that of

perfectly competitive markets.        Especially in light of the   'owing
interest in the causes and implications of international trade in the

presence of various forms of non-competitive markets, a generalization

of Deardorff's results to a world of non—competitive markets would be

useful.   Unfortunately, such a generalization seems unlikely, at least

until general gains—from-trade results in the presence of market power

become available.     This is because, as emphasized by Deardorff (p. 688),

the derivation of his results rely heavily on the existence of gains

from trade.     Since a general gains—from—trade theorem in the presence of

market power is not available, it is not clear how or even if
                                   —2—




Deardorff's results can be generalized once the assumption of perfectly

competItive markets Is dropped.

    While Deardorff's results provide general statements of the preclic—

tive power of   rky   factor prices for the pattern of trade, Helpman

                                                                   are

model's assumptions, these restrictions are of Interest as well, since

they represent testable implicatIons of the technological assumptions of

the theory in combination with various characterizations of the degree

of market competitiveneas.1

         Helpman's results are extended In two directions.         First,

restrictions on the pattern         f   nnmodty   trade are derived to complement

Helpnan's factor content versiDn of the competitive HO theory, and the

Introduction of factor market power is shown to leave the validity of

these restrictions unaffected.          This result is contained in section II.

Next, the Introduction of Imperfectly competitive product markets leads

to a simple and Intuitive generalization of Helpman's conditions to a

world with product market power.          Restrictions on the pattern of product

market power which leave Helpman's conditions unaltered are also

considered.        This is the subject of section III.     Finally, section IV

provides a concluding discussion and a brief comment on the implications

of      scale economies for the results of this paper.

                         It.   Non—Copet1tive Factor Markets


          While Helpman relies on properties of the ag'egate GOP function

to derive his factor content results, restrictions on the commodity

composition of trade are derived more           transparently   following the

nonparanetric approach of Varian (1984).            However, intuition In a two—

factor two—country world can be provided by the Lerner-Pearce diagram

familiar from Heckscher-Ohlin theory.            The diagram is depicted in Figure

1   .    Unit   isocost lines summarize the combinations of capital and labor

that can be hired for one dollar at factor prices                                       (w,r)    and   (w*,r*)

in the home and foreign country, respectively.                                    The unit value isoquant

labeled    x —               gives the combinations of capital and labor
                 1/Pt
sufficient to produce one dollar's wortb of                                   x    at price      P.    The ray

from the origin through the point of intersection of the two unit

isocost lines has slope                  =w          -    w*)/(r*   —   r).       The slope of this ray is

significant because, under perfect competitton, any good produced in

equilibrium in the home country must employ capital and labor in a ratio

greater than       ,         while       any good produced in equilibrium abroad must

employ capital and labor in a ratio lower than                                     k.

       Thus, if good            x    is exported from the home to the foreign country,

it must be produced domestically and, as depicted by the unit value

Isoquant for       x        in Figure       , the          ratio of capital to labor employed in

the domestic production of                      x        must satisfy          K/L      > (w —   w*)!(r*   —
                                                                                                               r),
or    [(w* r*) — (w r)] L                > 0.

Proposition I below provides a straightforward generalization of this

restriction to         M        factors and sector—specific factor prices.

       In particular, consider any commodity                              rt      exported from country

j    to country        i.       If the technology in this sector is linearly

homogeneous and firms minimize cost taking factor proes parametrically,

then unit costs of production for good                              n    in country         j    will be given

by    wa     where          w       is a        (1   x M)     vector of post-trade factor prices

                                                                is a      (M x 1)         vector of cost—

out monopsony but is               consistent with an economy-wide minimum wage (as in
Brecher, 1971;) and with factor market imperfections whioh lead                            to
intersectoral factor price differentials (as, for example, in tiagee,
1971).

       Commodity           n     is by assumption exported from           3    to    i,   so that   if
producers are perfectly competitive, and                        if subsidies to the export of
good n from 3 do not exceed transport costs and                            tariffs on imports
of   n        into    i,    then the unit cost of producing n can be no less in
i    thanin          3.    That     is,

     Condition (3)           provides         restrictions on the pattern of bilateral

commodity trade that must be satisfied by post-trade observations

consistent with the general HO theory embodied in the assumptions of

Proposition    I.       The condition says simply that the bundle of factors

embodied in a unit of any good produced for export must be no                                       more

expensive to purchase In the exporting country in the post—trade

equilibrium than it would be in the importing country.                                      An alternative

interpretation of Proposition                   I    can be obtained by transforming (3)                     into
a relationship between percentage bilateral factor price differentials

and factor intensities.                     Define           as a           (M x 1)     vector of factor

intensities in country                  j's    sector        n        with mth element given by

and define                  as a     (1 x M)             vector of percentage bilateral factor

price differentials in sector                        n    with mth element given by

average sense, intensive in factors that are relatively inexpensive in

the exporting country in the post—trade equilibrium.                                    This provides a

generalization of the results of Jones (1956—57) and Bhagwati (1972)

derived in a competitive two-factor world:                              that every good exported by

the capital-abundant                     country must       have a greater capital/labor ratio

than   every       good exported by the labor-abundant country.

       Helpman's factor content version of these restrictions can be

derived immediately from (3) by assuming the absence of Intersectoral

factor 'rice differentials.                          Dropping the Industry subscrIpts on the

factor price vectors, multiplying the two parts of (3) by the scalars

possibilIty that technologies are Indeed Identical but that the

Proposition I to Include a bilateral markup comparison in the importing

       A more precise Intuition can be provided by the two—factor Lerner-

Pearce diagram of FIgure 2.                              Suppose that good            x      is observed to be

exported from the foreign to the home country, but that Its capital

intensity in the foreign production process                                                   Is greater than

given the assumptions of identical technolog1es                              cost—minimizat1on                  and

perfect competition in the foregfl product market, the domestic markup

of    price    above cost implicit in Figure 2 is given by                           bc/Oc.           Hence,

to    be   interpreted as evidence against the HO presumption of

internationally identical                       technologies depends in a precise way upon

whether and to what degree the equilibrium markup in sector                                       x    differs

across countries.                       Proposition II formalizes this intuition.

the   way In which bilateral differences in the exercise of market power

can diminish the importance of factor intensities in determining the

pattern of commodity trade.                        That is, with respect to the importing

country's market for                  ,      the eater            is the markup of import-competing

producers relative to                 producers          abroad, the smaller will be the role

the   n    subscripts on the factor price vectors, multiplying the two

is the statement at the following Corollary.


Corollary:     If the assumptions of Proposition 111 hold and, in addition,

bilateral trade is balanced at export prices, then the existence of

product market power will leave intact Helpman's factor content

restrictions provIded that bilateral differences in market power and

bilateral export performance are non negatively correlated across

sectors in the sense that



             CorEM - M1,    T1]    > 0




Proof:     The result follows from Proposition III and the assumption of

balanced bilateral trade at export prices, which ensures that the sign

of the correlation between               - M1]     and       is the same as the sign

of the corresponding inner product.

cost of production in the oligopoly sector differs in the two countries,

the m/2 firms operating in the lower cost country will have relatively

high markups, and will individually and as a group capture a larger

share of the (world) market than the m/2 firms operating in the high

cost country.    If demand for the good is divided equally over the two

countries, then the country with high—markup firms will be a net

exporter of the good.    With this the only non—competitive sector by

assumption, condition (13) wIll be satisfied, and Helpman's factor

content restrictions will remain valid.

     Condition (13) is an equilibrium restriction on the interaction

between the pattern and degree of product market power and the pattern

of commodity trade which,   It'   satisfied, will ensure that the existence

of product market power does not invalidate the implications of the

competitive HO theory as derived by Helpman.       While various market

structures may satisfy (13) and thus leave in tact the implications of

the competitive HO theory, whether (13) is in fact satist'ied is largely

an empirical question.    As such, this corollary points to the Importance

of intormatlon on the empirical relationship between market power and
                                            —16—




sectoral trade performance in attempting to gauge the degree to which

the competitive HO theory will fall short in characterizing observed

patterns   of'   trade (or the factor content      of'   trade).   In that sense,

condition (13) provides the theoretical basis for an empirical

exploration of the taportance        of'   non—competitive trade theories in

accounting for the empirical shortcomings of the competitive
                                                             HO                    model.


                                    IV.    Discussion

       ThIs   paper has explored the possibility of developing general

restricttons on the pattern of International trade implied by a model

which assumes the existence of internationally available technologies

and little else.       In particular, restrictions Implied by HO theory have

been derived which remain valid in a world consIsting               of'   arbitrary

numbers of goods, factors, and            ountries   characterized by the existence

of'   market power In factor and product markets, trade impediments,

                                                                   nor
unequal factor prices, and preferences which are neither identical

homothetic.

        The results   of'   this paper provide clear statements of the way in

which post—trade factor prices, factor Intensities, and market power

combine to characterize the pattern of trade.               In partIcular, the tradi-

 tional HO emphasis on factor intensities as a guide to the pattern of

 trade remains appropriate in the presence of factor market distortions,

                                                          to characterize
 provided that post—trade equilibrium conditions are used

 HO trade patterns.         However, the focus on factor intensities will be

                                                                                   relatIve
 misguided in this context if the international distribution
                                                                             of'

produot market power     is related
                                inversely to export performanoex that
is if the greatest relative exeroise of dcmestio product market power
tends to coincide with a nation's import—competing seotors.
        Finally,   it s'iould be noted that the asswuption of linearly
homogeneous technologies maictai'ed throughout         this paper can be relaxed
somewhat    withoit invalidating any      cf the restCts. In particilar, the
above    restrictions "iust be ret   by   eqailibrisn trade patterns in the
presenoe of increasing retarrs provided that the minimun efficient        sale
of operation in the exporting count"y's sector n is no larger than the
amount of bilateral exports of good ni' Thus what is required is that
a single prodacer's scale economies in the exporting country would be
exhausted if       it
               alone were to roduce the bilateral export bundle of
good  n. While this Units the degree of scC.e economies, it r.everthe—
less allows a degree of increasing retirns that could conceivaoly give
rise to substantial      degrees of product market power.

     Though Helpman (198a) points out that his conditions remain valid
     in the specIal case of symmetric differentiated product equilibria
     where the scale of operation of firms in any industry is the same
     across countries.

2/   While factor market imperfections may exist independently of scale
     economies In production, It is natural for a relaxation of the
     constant-returns—toscale assumption to accompany the relaxation of
     perfectly competitIve product markets. The assumptIon of lInear
     homogeneity is maintained throughout the formal analysis, but
     section IV notes how scale economies that give            rise
                                                         to product
     market power can be introduced without invalidating any of the
     results.

1"   The need for    such conditions     has been emphasized     by Krueger   (1983,
     p.   80).
     Helpman assumes the absence of Intermediate inputs into production,
     and the same assumptIon will be made throughout this paper.
     However, all the results of this paper can be shown to hold in a
     world with traded intermediate goods as long as there are no
     Intermediate good tariffs or transport costs, and provided that the
     factor content of trade is measured on a direct basis, i.e.,
     excluding the factor content of intermediate inputs. For a
     discussion of the role of intermediate goods, see Staiger (1986).

     In this case, the factor content of country j's exports of good
     n can be calculated as the quantity of exports multIplIed by the
     average     factor
                    content of one unit of good n produced In
     country j. Similarly, industry markups can be interpreted as the
     markup of price above average cost, and would thus continue to
     represent unit economic profits. The condItions in this paper
     would then allow observed data to be checked for consistency with
     the equilibrium conditions of HO theory in the presence of such
     scale economies.
