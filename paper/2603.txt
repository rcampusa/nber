causes for the breakdown of the internal and external transfer processes.

The concepts of national and public sector solvency are used to evaluate

the mutual consistency and feasibility of fiscal,    financial and monetary

      Macroeconomic disequilibrium is a syndrome containing many or ros: of

external credit on commercial terms,                    A   history of capital flight,

resulting in a stock of external assets that is beyond the reach of the
duestic fiscal        authorities.        A large    incipient     current    accourt deficit

scmetimes     repressed     by external credit rationing           and by forecgn exchange

controls imposed by the domestic authorities.                   An overvalued real exchange

rate.      A high, although sometimes            partially repressed,        rate of t?flation

and significant recourse to the inflation tax as a source of public sector

revenue,      A large internal        public debt (in the more advanced developing

countries)    competing     for scarce domestic savings            in a generally repressed

domestic financial system.           A narrow and often inequitable and cneffcccent

public sector revenue base.           Real wages in excess of market—clearing levels

distribution and for changes in the size and scope of the tasks performed

by the public sector.

    These twin disequilibria,              which often interact         and    reinforce       each

other, tend to occur against a background of mass poverty,                    rapid population

growth,      and     major   social,      cultural      and    political      transformations.

Political     stability is often in doubt, both as regards                    the    survival of

incumbent  administrations and as regards the viability of the very
institutions of government. Credible precommitmenta to any long—term
economic strategy        are hard to come-by           in such an environment.              Scarce

administrative and managerial skills create further obstacles                       to the design

and implementationof economic reforms.

    Many of the diaequilibria and policy 'dilemmas just referred to have

been encountered also in the industrial countries,                       The    USA today        is

characterised by          unsustainable      fiscal     and    external current 'accoumc

deficits.     Hyperinflations      occurred in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Poland

in the l920s.         Many Western Eurcpean economies             have been diagnosed as

suffering during the l970s              and lPSOs     from a whole     array    of structural

rigidities,    sometimes referrable         to collectively as "Eurosclerosis",                that

prevent a full utilisation and efficient              (re)allocation   of resources.

    The range and severity of the stabilisation and structural                        adjustment

problems faced today by e.g. the IMP's IS highly indebted countries1 and by

a large number of sub—Saharan African countries2 are such, however,                        that a

fresh   restatement ;nd adaptation of conventional macroeconomic analysis

focussed on these countries' problems seem warranted.
       This paper     is both selective and eclectic           in its coverage and is only

 intended as a catalyst for a wider—ranging and deeper discussion of the

 issues (see Suiter        1986)    for an analysis focussed on developing country

 responses    to a range of external shocks).           The variety of economic systems,

 stages of economic development,             problems        and policy issues         among the

 developing and new industrial          countries       is    such,    that   it    is very hard

 indeed to find a useful middle ground between the Scyfla of ninety—odd

book—length country studies and a dozen exhaustive comparative analyses and

the    Charybdis    of a—historical,    institution—free         abstractions,         Section 2

cowers     the external and internal        transfer    probLems.        Section 3 considers

possible causes for the breakdom of the internal and external transfer

processes.         Section 4 deals     with national solvency and              Section     5 with

government solvency.           n Section 6 the inflation tax is considered in some

detail and in Section          7 a recent quantitative approach              used by the    ''orld

Bank to evaluate the consistency               of certain aspects         of a      goverrznerit's

fiscal, financial and monetary strategy is evaluated.




2.    Fiscal policy and the external and internal              transfer problems

      To reduce the      external    current    account      deficit    or    to increase      the

surplus is to increase the external transfer.                   To realise this increased

transfer of real purchasing power to the rest of the world an internal

reallocation real         resources    is    required:        production and          productive

resources    must be moved from the non—traded goods sector to the traded

goods sector,      i.e. to the production of exports or import competing goods.

This requires a decline in the relative price of non—traded goods and, if

the country has any international           market power, a lower relative price of

exports:    the    increased   external transfer can be effected only through a

lower real exchange      and a worsening of the terms of trade.                    It has by now
become established (if sloppy) usage,               to    refer   to   the   increase in the

external transfer as the external transfer.               I reuctantly adopt         this usage

where it does not lead to ambiguity or error.

       In many developing countries       (and indeed in such industrial              countries

as the USA), an unsustainable          or undesirable      external     deficit     tends    to be

associated,       both statistically     and     causally,    with an unsustainable or

undesirable    public sector financial deficit,            The reduction of the external

deficit in such cases requires         the reduction of the public sector deficit.3

This   can be achieved      either through cuts in public spending or through an
increase in public sector current revenues: taxes, income from tariffs,
public     sector   fees   and charges    etc.      The    expression (internal)            fiscal

transfer will he used to refer both to government revenue increases and to

public spending cuts.4

issues are considered further in Sections 6 and 5.

    Equations       (2a,b) below introduce           the   distinction between private and

public external debt,             This    distinction       has    often      been more important

formally than substantively.             The debt crisis since               1982 has been a recent

reminder    of the fact that many de jure or formally private liabilities                              are

de facto publicly guaranteed.                Private       foreign      assets often       escape the

grasp of      the    domestic fiscal authorities,                      Whether one        labels      this

(privately rational) external portfolio diversification or capital flight,

one of its consequences          is that the tax base becomes narrower, implying the

need for higher tax rates on the remaining tax base, increased recourse to

seigniorage       (the inflation tax) or increased borrowing.

      From (la) and (9a) we see that an increase                            in the current          account

surplus           requires an increase          in   the   combined private and public sector

financial           surpluses       or,   equivalently,       an   increase       in       national income
relative          to domestic (private plus public) absorption.                   This       underlines the

likelihood of a fiscal dimension                       to a   current account improvement: most
models of private               .consumption     behaviour      suggest that,              holding constant

taste, technology and external parameters,                      public revenue increases and/or
spending cuts           will in   general be   necessary       and ouf     cier.r   to increase     the

sum of the puolic sector financial                  surus      and private       saving.       The rain

exceptions are those models of private consumption behaviour that exhibit

debt      neutrality such as             representative        agent     models     or     overlapping
generations         models with operative            intergenerational           gift    and    becuest

motives.         Such models are extremely unlikely to describe accurately private

consumption behaviour               in    developing and          semi—industrial          countries.

Ignoring them in what follows, and assuming that public revenue                               increases

or     spending         cuts do not boost            private     capital         focation,       fiscal

retrenchment        will reduce national absorption relative to national                    income.

       Equation (Pa)         underlines     the    desirability of achieving a                  current

account improvement           via an increase          in   income rather than through                 a

reduction in absorption.                 Three channels     are potentially available               for

this:     (1)    increased domestic output,          (2) increased        foreign    aid and (3) a

reduction        in foreign interest obligations, either by reducing the interest

rate    on   the   external debt or by writing         don the debt.
       A boost     to   domestic output, Q, can be achieved             either    by taking     up any

slack     due     to deficient aggregate          demand or by fiscal or other measures

aimed at boosting aggregate              supply.    Since   output and absorption need not

be behaviourally independent of each other,                     it is essential          to adopt      a


general      equilibrium approach when evaluating                      alternative policies to

improve      the current      account.       E.g     successful supply—side             measures,     by

raising      both current and permanent             income, can be expected to stimulate

private consumption.           They may also induce a positive response of domestic

private investment.            The net effect on the current account need not be

positive,        absent further measures to restrain absorption.

     Fiscal measures' to stimulate                 output under conditions of Keynesian

excess capacity will involve expansionary actions such as tax cuts, public
 spending increases or expansionary monetary or credit policy measures that

 (subject    to well known qualifications      concerning the exchange rate regime

 and the degree of international capital mobility)                 are likely to     worsen   the

 current account.

      Increased    foreign aid will      only improve        the    current account,      given

 output,    if some fraction of the aid inflow is not spent.                f the increased

 aid relaxes a foreign exchange bottleneck            arid   if the additional external

 resources   are dedicated      to the importation of essential foreign productive

 inputs,    it can boost supply,       To the extent that the increased volume of

production does not generate a matching increase                     in private      r   public

spending,    this will improve the current account.

      Exactly the same holds as regards the current account consequences of a

reduction    in external interest payments.           The one—for-one improvement             in

the current account caused by interest rate or debt relief at 'iven levels

of output and absorption, will be augmented by any positive supply response

in countries      where production is foreign—exchange—contrained.                It will be

correspondingly     diminished by any positive effect of debt relief on public

or private spending.

      Equation (9a) also emphasises that, even if a reduction in absorption

is the current-account—improvingpolicy of choice, there are still a number

of ways of skinning that cat, each of which will have different short—run

and    long—run     supply      consequences   and     distributional implications.

Absorption cuts can be aimed at public spending or at private spending and,

within each of these categories, at consumption or at investment.                      Private

spending can be cut by raising taxes or tariffs, by cutting subsidies or by

raising the    cost    and/or    availability of credit to the             private    sector.

Taxing     imported lxury        consumer durables       will       have   very    different

distributional implications from cutting             subsidies       on the staple foods
 consuned mainly by the poor.     distributional consecuences of changes in
                                       The

exhausti-ie public spending (education, health etc) may be as irnoortant as
those of variations in transfer avments or taxes,          Theu should be

considered    together with the allocatiue consecuences and, in
demand—constrained sectors of the economy, the Keynesian, cyclical output

 effects
      These     distributional effects       of absorption—reducing policy measures

can be reinforced or offset by changes                 in the     distribution of factor

incomes       (wages   of different types      of labour,       rental incomes       from    the
osership of different types of land: profits accruing to the owners of
different types of capital and rentier incomes)     This is considered

briefly below in Section 3.

      The fiscal dimension of a current              account    improvement    can only be

understood properly by recoising that policies to influence                     the current

account are ipso facto concerned with the nation's interremporal                    allocation

of resources.          Intertemporal    relative   (shadow)     prices    such as the real

interest rate,         the    rates of return on other         assets and,     in repressed

financial       systems      with widespread credit    rationing,        both the    ost    and

availability of credit will play a                 central     role in the     transmission

mechanism between fiscal policy actions and current account outcomes.                       Wnen

e.g. the domestic financial          markets are not perfectly integrated into with

the   global financial markets, bond—financed           fiscal tightening will tend to

result     in               real interest rates or less severe credit
                lower domestic

rationing,  Even when domestic asset returns are fixed by the rest of the

world, the nation's solvency constraint and that of the public sector

(discussed in Sections 4 and 5) imply that fiscal tightening today implies

fiscal relaxation (relative to what otherwise would have been the case) in

th    future.
       Equations     (4)    and (5a.b) bring out the            static relative        prce       and

resource reallocation dimensions of a current account improvement.                         In the

short run, given the foreign interest rate, the net stock of external debt

and the aid flow, a current account                 improvement    is the    same thing as a

trade     balance       iriprovement.      A    trade    balance   improvement       requires     an

increase     in     the    production of        tradeables     and/or a    reduction in the

absorption of tradeables.            This will in general require changes in the real

exchange    rate    (the relative price         of traded and non—traded goods) and, if

the country       in question has some international market power, in the terms

of trade (the relative price of exports and imports).

       Fiscal tightening (an increase in taxes                 or a cut in public sector

absorption)     will almost certainly reduce the demand for non—traded goods at

the initial real exchange rate.                Income tax or indirect      tax increases     will

reduce private consumption,             part of which will fall on non—traded goods.

Higher taxes on profits and tighter private sector credit rationing will

discourage      private     investment    which rften has a significant               non—traded

goods component.            Public spending cuts         are   also likely to fall          to     a

significant extent on non—traded goods.                 In a well—functioningeconmy with

a flexible relative price               of traded to non—traded goods            and resource

mobility between           the    traded and      non—traded goods        sectors,     a   fiscal

contraction will reduce the relative price of non—traded goods and cause a

movement of resources            into the traded goods sector.         This eliminates the

incipient excess supply of non—traded goods at the old real exchange                       rate.

       The non—traded goods         market equilibrium condition,          given in equation

(10)    permits one to summarise            the    proximate    determinants of the          real

exchange rate in a convenient manner.

    Given aggregate            real     private      consumption,         private   consumption of

non—traded goods is an increasing                 function of the real exchange rate.                :n

point   such as           (with   a trade balance           deficit     measured by the vertical

distance    Z1 — fl1) to a point such as                   2   (with     a trade balance surplus

measured by     the vertical            distance           —

non—traded goods         (measured      by the absolute values of             the tangents to the
production possibility frontier (T1T1 and T2T2) and the indifference curves

(F11 and    22))         falls, i.e. T     rises.         The same qualitative effects follow

from a cut in public spending                   on non—traded goods;           even if    this   were

tax—financed,      the marginal private spending share on non—traded goods                           is

less than 100 per cent.

    Restrictions on factor mobility, but still unrestricted flexibility of

factor prices and          ''ive         goods    prices,      would result in a production

      Rigid relative prices or the emergence of Keynesian demand—constrained

equilibria would show up as movements                   inside     Ehe     production poss:biltt

frontier in response to a contraction of aggregate                          demand.     E.g.    in the

small country case where traded goods output is never demand—constrained,

one   could get a production equilibrium at                         instead of at i2 after a

fiscal contraction:             excess    capacity and           unemployment emerge           in   the

non—traded good sector.             where    the country has some market power                  in the

markets      for     its      tradeables,      demand—deficient            excess     capacity      and


unemployment can emerge also in the traded goods sector fol.owing a fiscal

contraction,

      An issue requiring         both more empirical             and more analytical research

concerns thosa characteristics              of countries that render them more likely to

experience         "Keynesian"      or      demand—constrained excess                 capacity      and

unemployment when subjected to policies                 aithed   at reducing absorption.            The

existence     of a large         modern or      "foal"       non—traded goods sector with

production for the market rather than for subsistence                          or.    in the traded

        sector,     a downward—sloping,         rather inelastic           world demand schedule
goods

for   exportables,      seem necessary for the emergence                   of demand—constrained

equilibria.        So is the existence of nominal inertia or stickiness of money

wages or output prices.              The     larger and more developed Southern Cone

countries,     and coumtries        such as Korea and Taiwan therefore                    seem more

likely to undergo episodes of Keynesian excess capacity when fiscal and/or

monetary policy are            tightened than the          poorer and smaller            developing

countries    with less extensive          formal sectors.          Even in the Latin American

and East Asian NfC's,              wage     and price flexibility              could reduce the

likelihood and severity of demand—deficientrecessions.                         Little is known of
 the peculiarities       of wage and price determnat.on in developing              countries,

 and of the extent to which the industrial country parables based on nominal

 or real wage rigidities need cc be adapted to fit the institutions and

 experiences     of about 100 very heterogeneous             developing atd new industrial

 countries.

       Within    the    traded goods       sector,    changes     in    the   composition of

production and demand are likely in response to a fiscal contraction (see

e.g.      Buiter   t1988b]       for   a   recent     theoretical       analysis   using     an

 intertemporal     model).      Figure 2A shows       an initial    production equilibrium

for importables and exportables at           f?1   on the QQ locus.      Domestic demand for

exportables      and import—competing good is at               l'   with a trade      balance

deficit     (measured      in   imports)   of   B.       The fiscal contraction moves

resources     out of the non—traded goods sector into the traded goods sector.

The production possibility frontier for exportables                    and importables moves

to Q'Q'       In the small country case considered in Figure 2A, the terms of

trade     are unchanged.        If the resources      released by the non—traded goods

sector don't favour either the exporting or import—competing                     sector,    the

new production point will be one like                  fl2    in Figure 2A:     both' export

production and import—competingproduction will increase.

      The fiscal contraction which started off the whole process will reduce

the    demand for imports        as well as for exportable goods               (barring    very

different income effects on the demand for exportables                   and imports).      The

new domestic demand point is at              with a trade balance surplus (measured

in imports) of     2B.
      A   country facing a        downward—sloping export demand schedule would

experience a worsening in its terms of trade as resources                     moved into the

cradeables sector.         Compared with the constant terms of trade case,                  the

increase in the        production of tradeables would favour import—competing
goods      rather than      the     production of     exportables.        n    Figure 23       the

production point would move from                  to a point such as 22 rather than

which would have been chosen at constant terms of trade.1 Domestic demand

 (not shown in Figure 2B) would be moved towards                 exportabea and away from

import—competinggoods, compared to what would happen at constant terms of

trade.




3.     Breakdowns in the internal and external transfer orocesses

      What can go wrong in the external—internal            transfer process? First, it

may     be economically or politically impossible                 to effect the         internal

fiscal      transfer,        This     means    either   that     the    governments       fiscal

instrumentarium        is insufficient    or that it is unwilling or unable to use it

i     the manner and to the extent required.

      On the public expenditure side, there is little point in a government

committing itself         to a programme of spending cuts if                  any    attempt    to

implement    such cuts leads to the fall of the government and its repacement

by a government unwilling to contemplate serious cuts.                  E.g. severe cuts in

spending on the military raise the danger of a military coup.                       Cuts'in food

subsidies,       in public sector civilian pay or employment or in Treasury

subsidies    to loss-making       state enterprises,     can lead to unrest, especially

among     the urbanised,     unioriised and       better educated sections           of society

capable of undermining or toppling governments.                 Debtor country governments

often play the "political           constraints    on public spending cuts' card quite

skillfully in their negotiations              with multilateral lending agencies,              and

foreign private and official creditors.                 While   these   constraints may be

real, they are not independent           of the past, present and anticipated future

actions     of   the    grvernments     in    question and the scope           for    strategic

b€aviour is      considerable.
       Raising current revenues            is difficult            rost develooitg countries,

given their narrow tax base.             For decades, widening the tax—base (through a

more broadly—based income               tax;    through    more effective          enforcement    of

existing income tax rules;               through    a broadly—based          sales   tax:    through

expenditure taxes         etc)    has   been a standard recommendation from anyone

considering options          for     fiscal reform          in     developing countries,         but

relatively little          has      happened      thus     far.       The    recommendation is

nevertheless repeated here.

       Figures 3, 4 and 5 and Table            1 show how the overall tax burden and its

composition differs across developing countries and between developing and

industrial countries.            The greater role of direct taxes on labour income

(including social security taxes) in the industrial countries                        stands out as

does    the   quite     important    role      of taxes    on international          trade   in the

developing countries         especially the poorest ones and the more open ones.

       Capital flight is another factor contributing to a narrow revenue base.

While     capital       flight    occurs       partly     in      response    to     macroetonomic

mismanagement (such         as the maintenance of an overvalued exchange rate)

part of it is likely to be motivated by a desire to evade taxe.                                  The

industrial countries that are the recipients of much of this flight capital

could strengthen the fiscal position of many developing countries by

reporting     foreign investment           income   to     the    fiscal authorities         of the

developing countries or even by acting as their agents in collecting taxes

that are due.

    Through      asset     sales,       including        privatisation of          publicly—owned

industries,    the government can achieve an apparent once—off improvement of

its revenue.          If these    assets    yielded a positive net cash flow to the

government,    the shd'rt—run improvement           of its financial          position will be

reversed in the longer run.             The asset sale is a financing item and like
 public sector borrowing, belongs                "below the Line'              There may of course be

excellent reasons for wishing                  to privatise,         incuding hoped—for positive

 incentive     effects      leading      to    efficiency and roductivity                  gains     in   the

privatised industries.             Revenue      considerations            should, however,      not play a

role except to the extent that the government can sell the assets to the

private   sector at a price              in excess      of the present discounted value of

future net cash flows under continued public                        oership
      Even if the internal fiscal transfer is effected, the external transfer

may not materialise              because      there    is    full     financial        crowding—out       or

 'crowding—in) or because resources                   do not flow into the right direction

and relative prices do not adjust.

      The financial crowding—out mechanism is Likely to be quite different                                in

in industria'      country where interest                   rates     and    financial     asset prices

approximate     the       market—clearing         paradigm more closely.                   with private

spending constrainedby the availability of rationed credit, the effect on
the   current account            of an     increase      in taxes           would,     with a      marginal

propensity to spend of unity, not be offset (even in part) by a rduction

in private ssving.                "Debt       neutrality",          the     independence     of    private

neutrality for        a    number of developing countries,                       are    therefore      very

surprising.      With debt neutrality,                government deficit             reductions    brought

about through tax increases               would lead to an equal                reduction    in private

saving,   leaving         tTie   current account            unchanged.           Permanent cuts           in

macroeconomies      (see e.g.      Blinder    [1987]).     The simplest version of this

involves an "Austrian" production model with lags between the application

of inputs and the emergence of saleable output,                   Such lags create a need

 distribution of            primary'     incomes)    depends     both       on     the   degree     of

 intersectoral  factor mobility and on the factor intensities of production
 Lfl the d:fferent sectors. Owners of factors 'specific to' the contracting

 sectors (typically the non—traded good sector in the case of a fiscal
 contraction)      will suffer a loss of rents              to these    fixed      factors.       Even

 where and when factors are mobile and priced competitively,                        the owners of

 factors used relatively intensively             in the contracting         sectors wiLL suffer

a fall in real income,            If these potential losers            are well organised or

easily mobilised and if they               cannot   be bought off with an acceptable

compensation scheme,           they may be able to block the                policy changes        and

prevent the necessary         adjustment.

        Even if    compensation        of losers    is   feasible,     it    is     likely to be

distortionary        and the efficiency losses involved                in the       side—payments
mcchanisms should be taken              into account in a comprehensive coat—benefit
analysis.

    Rent—seeking           behaviour     may   become    especially         intense when the
status—quo is threatened;          the real resource         cost of DUPE activites will

have to be added to the cost of failing to implement the fiscal program,                           if

the activities are successful.

    Often (but not always) the signal                that    both indicates         the need for

resource movements and motivates them, is a change in relative prices.                            The

adjustment process following a fiscal contraction can be frustrated by the

failure       to achieve   a sufficiently      large depreciation of         the    real exchange

rate, i.e.       a decline in the relative price of non—traded goods.                     This is

not too       surprising once one realises           that a depreciation of the               real

exchange rate tendsto be associated with a reduction                    in real consumption

public sector emplo'nnent and pay rules and a high degree of index—linking

of money wages           to the    cost of living.        Achieving a real depreciation in

such      a     setting      means     rather    more      than      implementing           a      nominal

"maxidevaluation" and validating this                      through appropriate               supporting

fiscal     policies (see e.g.             an    and    Lirondo     11987]     and van Wijnbergen

 1986]).        It means achieving a change in the balance of power in the labour

market by weakening          organised labour and strengthening                   employers,       private

and public,        through    legislation      and other measures.            Having altered the

fundamental       determinants       of industrial      bargaining (and lobbying)               power       (a

prooess       likely to involve significant             political        and social conflict)           ,    a

nominal maxi—devaluation may of course well be helpful in achieving                                     any

target     real devaluation at least cost.                For a nominal devaluation to be


superior to a nominal wage and price                     reduction,        some    form of nominal

inertia       in wage or price determination              thust    be present.         or   the     asset

revaluations associated with                 nominal     maxi—devaluations            must be        less


disruptive (or oontractionafl') than those                    associated with reductIons in

domestic nominal           costs    and   prices.       The     rigidities        stressed in most

discussions of developing countries'                 labour markets are, however,               real, not

nominal rigidities.          Nominal inertia (both in the level and rate of change

of money wages and prices) may however result from lags in the indexation

process,       staggered,     overlapping      wage contracts        and slow adjustment in

inflationary       expectations.          Possible    short—run     contractionary effects                  of

maxi—devaluations           have     been    stressed      by     many      experts         (see     e.g.

       Equation (13) means that the present discounted value of future trade

balance surpluses plus net inflows of foreign aid and remittances                        (as a

proportion of GDF) is just equal to the nation's current net external debt

(as a proportion of GDP)          J5J6      The sum of the trade balance aurtlus and

the net current transfers          will be referred to henceforth as the nation's

primary     surplus.
       The nation's primary       surplus    is occasionally called the nation's net

resource transfer.        In principle names don't matter, although poorly ohoaen

names can sometimes confuse the unwary.              The primary surplus      is the excess

of domestic income over nationsl absorption.                The current account surplus

ia the excess of national income over national absorption.

       The primary surplus measures the nation's net resource transfer to the

rest of the world when domestic income                is taken as      the   "benchmark"     or

             relative to which transfers          are measured.       The current    account
"origin"

surplus     measures   tife   nation's net resource transfer to the rest of the

world if national income is taken as the benchmark or origin.                      The first
                                                 —25—


 transfer    concept   emphasises the           location       of cesources           and the   income

screams     they yield within the nation's boundaries.                      The second concept

focuses on the ownership of cesources                  snd the associated income screams by

national residents, irrespective of the location of the tesourtes

     An     emphasis   on   the    "territorial'          definition over the             "ownership"

definition (or vice—versa)          is sometimes         adopted by those        with strong views

on the (il)legitimacy         or priority of foreign ownership claims on national

resources     (directly or through            the tax sysremY         It is (fortunately            not

necessary for what follows               to    get sidetracked        any further         into these

semantic discussions.

    Equation (13)       follows     from       the     asset—revaluations        and real—growth—

corrected current       account identity (12)               only if       the    following      rather

technical—sounding condition holds:                    The present discounted value of the

nation's net       external       debt    in     the    very    distant     (strictly         speaking

infinitely far) future is         zeroj7 What           this means is that, ultimately,             the

external debt/CD? ratio has to grow at a rate less than r* +                              y   — n   or,


equivalently,    that ultimately,        the real external debt has to grow at a rate

less than r* +    y,   or again that, ultimately,              the foreign currency value            of

the external debt should grow at a rate below                   i*.    Ultimately,        therefore,

the country will have to run primary surpluses                  in order to serzice (pay the

interest on) its debt,         Solvency does not require that the debt be repaid,

only that it is not possible indefinitely to finance                            the    interest bill

through further borrowing:         at some stage primary surpluses must be achieved

and any further borrowing will not be sufficient to pay the entire existing

interest bill.     The nation cannot play a successful Ponzi game.

    A debtor country (with f*<O) facing a resl interest rate on its debt in

excess of the rear growth rate                 need,     in principle,      never       achieve any

current account surpluses in order to pursue a strategy consistent with

ot repudiation.
    Given the existing debt, the primary surpluses projected for the future
and the projected future interest rates, expressions such as (13), or
(13') or (13") in footnote 16] can be used to assess the consistency of the
external debt strategy. If, under current policy projections, equation
(13) is violated (specifically if the left—hand side exceeds the
right—handside) this doesn't mean that default is inevitable, only that
the strategy under consideration won't work. What will "give" to achieve
equality in (13) is what the debate during the current debt crisis is all

about,    The lenders would like to see larger trade balance surpluses by the

borrowers (larger tb vsluea in equation (13) and indeed current                    account

surpluses to reduce the creditors' exposure in the debtor countries)                   .    rn
borrowers    would like to see some combination of more aid (larger a*)            ,       lower

interest rates (lower r*)     ,   better    terms   of trade     (negative   y),       higher

growth (larger n) or a write—down or write—off of (part of) the debt (a

smaller value of —f*).

     Capital flight introduces an important          further   dimension to equations

(12) and (13).    Net foreign assets, F* consist of official foreign exchange

reserves R* and, in many developing countries, of a large amount of.privste

      If the substitution of domestic government                      debt far iorelgn        pubc    debt

affected.       Private    external indebtedness                 must have increased by the same

amount as the reduction             in foreign indebtedness.                The governments balance

sheet will have been weakened while that of the private                              sector has become

stronger.       This creates a problem if and to the extent that the government

has   trouble    effecting the increased                  internal    fiscal    transfer      required to

service its costlier debt.

      If the substitution of more expensive                      domestic public debt for foreign

public debt takes the form of the government financing                              a larger share of

its flow deficit by borrowing                domestically,         there will be, as time passes.

If    the   private      sector cannot borrow abroad (or                        cannot   increase      its


borrowing abroad),         the      increased         government borrowing in the               domestic

capital markets will crowd out private                          investment,    either by pushing up

domestic real interest rates or by tighter credit rationing.                               The response

of private saving is less clear—cut, but under the conditions just stated,

the   private    sector financial             surplus     will have to increase by              the   full

amount of the switch of government borrowing from the external                                    to the

internal    financial      markets.           When private           access to the       international

financial markets is limited but non—zero,                         the short—run      response of the
current account is still likely to                   be   an improvement,             a.touh it     again      is


likely to have been purchased                     at a cost in terms            of domestic investment.

Over time,             the government would          also encounter the more acute                  internal

fiscal transfer problems discussed before.

The debt burden and the real exchange rate.

      As was discussed in connection with national solvency in Section                                    4.    a

depreciating real exchange                    rate    (y > 0)        increases         the   real domestic

resource cost of se7icing foreign debt (at any given world real interest

rate r*)     .        This   confronts   debtor countries with the unpleasant dilemma that

they must achieve an improved level of competitiveness                                in order to generate

the trade surpluses                 to required seice their debt, while the very process

of improving their competitiveness                   increases      the real burden of that debt,

      The    implications            of different     rates    of return on the public sector

capital stock2° can be brought out most easily by considering two extremes.

The first, optimistic,                scenario has the ned rate of return,                     — 5, equal to

the     opportunity cost of government borrowing,                             r* +    , if      in addition

r —   r* —       ',   the primary       deficit   driving     the debt dynamics in this case                   is


simply the current or consumption account deficit,                              c—     (a*+)
      The second, pessimistic               (or realistic?)     ,   scenario         has the gross rate of

return           equal       to zero.     Capital    effectively         ceases to be an asset and

gross    investment           (iG     dkG÷(&+n)kG)    is like public consumption expenditure.

Let     net public debt                 excluding capital           as    a     proportion of       GDP     be

a     (B_EFG*)/PQ.             If in addition we have r             —    r* +   y,    the budget identity

becomes

     When spending and revenue         projections      are     made and evaluated,             it is


important    to be aware of the spending and revenue implications of various

structural adjustment policies.

unless future primary deficits are reduced or future seigniorage                         revenues


are boosted.     'If   neither occurs, the debt will not be serviced in full and

we'll see, either eicplioit (partial)           repudiation or capital levies                     etc.


This is not necessarily a bad thing, although it is likely to affect

share (with labour and the owners of capital) in the burden of adjusting                        cc

internal and external exogencus shocks would seem to be a strong one.

      Replacing quotas and import licenses (which typically are not auctioned

the   World Bank,          will raise      government     revenue     in   addition to having

allocative     or     efficiency effects            and    may      reduce    th    returns     to

For a number of commonly used money demand functions such as the linear one

in (22a) and the log—linear one in (22b) the long—run relationship between

monetary growth and real seigniorage has the "Laffer curve" shape shown in

Figure 6.22

     For the linear demand function,                shown     in Figures 6A, it, and for the

log—linear demand function, shown in Figures 6C, iD                        there   is a unique,

finite,     long—run seigniorage          maximising rate of inflation             (a/2b    in    the

linear case,        i/b'     in the log—linear case).              No rational policy—making

process     would drive the long—run inflation rate beyond this point                        as in

addition to the costs of higher inflation,                    there   would be a reduction in

inflation     tax       revenues.       Many past and recent hyper—inflationary or

near—hyper—inflationary             episodes   nevertheless saw the rate of inflation

pushed well beyond the               point of      negative aeigniorage         returns.          The

political economy of                such monetary irrationality            is   not   very       well

understood.

    The importance of seigniorage              as a source of government revenue varies

widely across countries             at a point in time          and over time for any given

country.      Only- the      cross—sectional       variation is shown in Table         3.        Note

that all these data understate             seigniorage        revenue,   as they only refer to

currency outside banks.              Currency held by the banks as "till money" and
reserves held either as cash or in                    the form of bankers baances               with the

losses     involved in raising a given                total    revenue   by using all available

revenue instrumentC including the inflation tax.                         More reliable knowledge

concerning the effect cf changes in the inflation tax rate on the inflation

tax yield is required if this instrument                   is to be used properly.

       Seigniorage    as defined        here can be viewed as the expected inflation

tax.     If   he    government has a significant amount of long—dated                  nominally

denominated     (non—index—linked)          debt outstanding,        it can    in addition use

unanticipated inflation           as a capital        le'rj   on the holders     of this debt.

Since the external debt is denominated in foreign currency and much of the

domestic debt is effectively              index—linked,       this may not be as important       a

source of revenue as it could be in many of the industrial                      countries,      In

addition,     this policy suffers from the defect that repeated use will lead

to    inflation risk       premiums being        built into the nominal yields         on newly

issued nominal debt.
    Finally, inflation will affect the real yield of other taxes and
revenue sources (specific duties, charges, tariffs etc.) and the real value
of   public spending because many spending programmes, tax schedules etc. are

not   index—linked and adjust to inflation only with a lag.

      The biases do not          always    go    in the    same direction.      Inflation     will

raise the real yield of a progresive income tax when the progressive rate

schedule is not index—linked              and adjusted to inflation           only with a lag.

Delays in the collection of taxes can, unless the right interest penalty

for arrearages is imposed,              reduce    the real tax take significantly           in an

inflaticnary environment.            Again our quantitative knowledge of the effect

of inflation       on real public spending and revenues                  is very incomplete,

although Tanzits [19781 work suggests                 that very high rates        of inflation

unambiguously and significantly reduce real public sector revenues.
      What is      clear   is    that     the    pursuit    of reductions     in the   rate    of

inflation     in the fange       where this reduces            seigniotage   may have serious

7.     The    consistency of inflation                   tarZets     atd    financeable     deficits

       Recently          the world Bank has developed a 'short—hand consistency check
on     certain           aspects     of a         governments         fiscal        financial         and monetary

strategy.               This approach,        based on the work of Anand and van Wijnbergen

[l987, Knight [1986                  and Coutinho l986, 1988; within the Bank and closely

related to some recent work of mine (Buiter [l983a,b[                                           l985j,    :l987a,b[)

can be interpreted                 readily        using the accounting             framework of Sections                 6

and 7.

      Let        z      denote     the    real—growth—corrected                  operational         deficit      as    a

proportion of               GD?,     i.e.         the    su     of    the        primary    deficit         and        the

asset—revaluations—and—real—growth—corrected                                interest paid on the debt, as

a proportion of GD?:


      z       cG +         —
                                 (a*+r)   +   Q   + (r*+y_n)(b+d*G_p*)                                           (23)


      The public sector budget identity given e.g. in equation (18) can be

rewritten as


      0'     z     —    (1b+M*G.lp*)                                                                             (24)
       This    identity can be used in a number of ways.                             One        is    to      treat

mnetary        financing,    o.,    as the residual.

       To     implement     this,     proiections        are     provided for        z,    i.e.          for    the

primary deficit and the interest payments on the outstanding                                         stocks of

internal       and external         public     debt.      This     requires    projections               of real

interest       rates,     i.e. of domestic         and foreign nominal          interest rates, of

domestic and foreign                inflation     rates    and of changes            in the          real (or

nominal)       exchange     rate.       The     "financeable       deficit" is then calculated.

basically the desired (or permitted) changes in domestic indebtedness, Oh,

external indebtedness, dd*G, minus any desired increase in external foreign

exchange reserves,                    This uniquely       determines    a-,   the   value of          the real
resources (as a percentage of GDP) that the government will have to
appropriate by running the printing presses.
    With      the required amount of seigniorage                  from equation (24), plus a set

of equations relating base money to inflation,                       (typically      centred around a

high—powered money demand function)                      the     inflation    rate    implied by                the

fiscal—financial          programme on the right—hand—side               of equation (24) can be

determined.         A popular candidate                used in World Bank analyses                       is     the

long—linear base money demand                function (in the example considered here,                          the

income elasticity of money demand                   is constrained to equal                unity)               The

inflation      rate is the only other argument in this function.                           it   in equation

(25) denotes the desired or long—run demand for base money as                              a    fraction         of
GDP.


    h   —                                                             3'>O                               (25)


    The actual inflation              rate      is assumed        to exceed (fall         short       of) the

expected,      inertial or         'core'    inflation    rate      whenever h exceeds               .        This

     Given    o'    from equation   ,,24)   and eqcations    25       26   and    fi        we can

calculate     the inflation      ate    consistent with toe deficit soensrco and the

assumptions        about the financeable deficit.       This :mp,ied or consistent            rate

of inflation can then be compared with the target rate of inflation                            and

with the inflation assumptions that are implioct in the projections made to

obtain the right—hand—side          of equation p24).

     The converse approach is to start with a target path for inflation                        and

to derive the path it implies for seigniorage               c given equations          25     '26

and (27).          Given the amounts chat can be 'borrowed at home and abroad and

given the target change in international             reserves,    this implies a path for

the operational deficit,            This can then be compared with the scnIal plan

for the operational        deficit.

     Any inconsistencies         (in practice most likely to take the             form of an

implied inflation rate in excess of the target rate or an implied deficit

in excess of the target one) will have to be reconciled by some combination

of   revisions       in inflation projections,        cuts    in the       primary     deficit,

reductions in the internal or external interest burden, increased internal

or excernal borrowing (including arresrsges)                 or lower      foreign     exchange

reserves.

     Note that from       he    public sector solvency constraint given in equation

(29),     given the       initial net debt and the           projected path of future
(corrected)      primary deficits and of future real interest rates and grcwth

rates, the present discounted value              of future seigniorage required to make

these   projections      consistent with governent soluency can be calculated.

This PDV can of course be achieved with many different                    time paths   for   o-.




The approach outlined in this section picks among these many feasible                       time


paths     for      by     specifying paths        for    b + d5               (ie     for    the

financeable deficit)

     I consider this        approach (basically          a simple    "uses    and sources     of

funds" accounting        exercise    for the consolidated public sector with minimal

behavioural      fill—in (just the base money demand function and the inflation

equations)),      to be potentially useful because               it imposes the      essential

discipline of looking at the totality of plans                   for public sector outlays,

receipts and financing.         Such an integrated approach is the only one that

makes   sence.     Granted this 'global' approval of the method,                 I have some

worries     about misleading inferences              that    might be        drawn   from    its


pr.ima—faci.e    low   behavioural    content.     There also are, inevitably,         serious


problems with any actual empirical implementation.

Nothing from nothing

    The     approach carries         with it the        danger   that a casual reader or

careless user might infer that in order to engage in macroeconomic                     policy

evaluation all one needs is a base money demand function and an inflation

equation.       (If prices were perfectly flexible, one could even dispense with

the separate inflation equation).            In fact, in order to do the exercise,            a

vast amount of (implicit) economic and econometric modelling is required to

produce projections        for the right—hand—side          of equation (24).        There   we

find a number of key endogenous             variables       whose determination requires

(implicitly or explcitly) the kind of general equilibrium macroeconometric

modelling that the consistency check appears to short—cut.
     Among       these key endogenous variables                       are    the domestic real             nteresc

 rate,    the real exchange rate             through        -       and the growth          rate    anc Level    of
 real economic activity.              The latter enter                through       n and because real          tax

 receipts    and other current             revenues     and outlays              are    fnctions       of    among
 ocher things        the levels of output and employnent                              The   consistency check
 should   in principle be extended to include these variaoles,                                      Vhen this

 not done,       the danger extsts         that changes              in policy         that are intended        to

 eliminate       an ex—ante inconsistency               Detween inflation                   nlans    and    budget

deficit     plans will only do so by enlarging                            tne inconsistency         between the

inflation        and deficit projections             on the one hand and the real interest

rate,     real    exchange rate and real economic                           activity    assumptions         on the

other hand.

The base money aemsnd function

     Having estimated base money demand functions for the JK and USA for the

post—World—war—Il       period,       it   is   easy    to become impressed                    and depressed)

with the instability         of this relationship:                        Much of this can no doubt be

explained (ex—post) as reflecting irregular spurts of financial                                      inncvation

ard development.            In    addition        there             are     likely     to    be     episdea of
(ctis)intermediation        in response to changes in regulatory policy.                               In a new

industrial       count' such     as   e.g. Brazil       all these sources of instability are

likely to be present in force, plus some                        others.        Variations in the degree

of stringency of capital controls are likely to be reflected in variations

in the degree of (direct) international                     currency substitution.                   Changes    in

reserve    requirements are also likely to shift a simple base money demand

function such as the one given in equation (25).

The inflation function

    Equations        (26)   and       (27)      define          a     completely            backward—looking'

shift dumy x. There is also no room in the equation (again except through
x) for a role for indexarion arrangements. direct or indirect effscts of

is   easy to criticise any piece            of empirical       work for errors of omission

(and errors of commission)        ,    these   specific criticisms are born not out of a

scholarly       thirst for purity, but out of worries resulting from the fact

that    these    particular omitted         factors      are   widely recognised as having

played (and continuing to play)                a major    role   in the economic processes

governing contemporary Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,                 etc.

The seisniorage Laffer curve

       As was pointed out in Section             6,   many theoretirally and empiriosflv

acceptable money demand function have the property that there is more than
one rate of inflation that can generate any given amount of seigniorsge.

This is most easily seen if we consider stationary equilibria in whioh the

(actual and expected)          rate of inflation Th constant over time.                    (Not all

plausible    money demand functions            have this property;        e.g.    the hyperbolio

function h —      a"/(b"+r)    with a",b">O has seigniorage independent of                 he    tate

of inflation;       the   constant velocity version h — a, anO                   has   seigniorage

increasing with inflation             forever;   other reasonable        functions     yield many

local seighiorage peaks and troughs)

     The long—linear       function often used in the Bank's                 analyses      has    the

unimodal long—run seigniorsge Laffer curve depicted in Figure (Ec,d),                            When

the inflation rate is calculated that yields a given amount of seigniorage,

the lower of the two rates             is typically chosen in Bank analyses.                 While

this may be      god    prescriptive economics        (no rational policy—making process

would drive       the rate of     inflation      beyond the point at which it yields

maximal     revenue),     it   is likely to be bad positive economics,                          Every

the economy, conceivably to the point that the public deficit               rises   rather

than falls (see Buiter 11987b).             Phile these problems are not specific to

the    approach     under consideration,       they   are   important   when the    policy

response to an 'inconsistency verdict" is being pondered.



8.    Conclusion

      This paper is a non—systematicperusal of some of the key issues in the

design and conduct of          fiscal   policy for stabilisation and structural

adjustment       in developing countries.      Its coverage undoubtedly is subject to

both Type    I   and Type II errors.    I nevertheless      hope that its focus on the

external and internal transfer           problems.     national solvency and        public
sector solvency (with a fairly extended discussion of the inflation tax and

the consistency of fiscal,         financial    and monetary plans)      does provide a

useful starting point for further discussion.

     through an increase            in the savings rate, it    wdll      it.   zeneral    be veicome.

     In many of the poorer developing                  countries,    the       scope    for    this   is

     rather limited.            A reduction     in the private sector financial                  deficit

     through      a cut in private sector capital formation                     is unlikely to be

     desirable,

4    Again this ought to be called the increase                     in   the    (internal)       fiscal

     transfer,         but established usage and verbal hygiene conflict here too.

5    It is assumed for simplicity that the interest rate on foreign exchange

     reserves      is the same as that on foreign debt,

6    For sfmplicity all net external current transfers                    are assumed cc accrue

     to the government.             This assumption    is most inappropriate             in the case

     of private remittances.

     Qx     QM   and      are domestic production of the exportable               good, the

     k —    PG;   j      XM,N     are   domestic   demands   for    the three          goods   by the

     private,      (P), and public (0) sectors respectively.

S    In the long run, a smaller                stock   of external       debt obtained as the

     res'alt     of a period of cumulative current account surpluses                       permits    a

     country to run a sustainable              smaller trade balance surplus or a larger

     deficit.

9    Note that     C     is aggregate    consumption spending measured in GOP units,


     i.e.             tPx0 + PMC + PNCP_1.

10   Private investment spending on non—traded goods is held constant in

     this thought experiment and the next one involving                         changes    in public

     spending on non—traded goods.

        is the (Cobb—Douglas)              consumer price index;       T   is the consumer price

      index for         traded goods. 3 is the share            of imports       in traded goods

      spending and & the             share    of non—traded goods          in total    consumption

      spending.         If the non—traded goods price is a markup on unit labour

      cost then      N   —
                             (l+i)WL/QN where           is the proportional markup and                is

      labour employed in the non—traded goods sector.                      This implies

      If thre are no intersectoral                differences        in factor intensities            (so

      QN/LN       is independent      of    QN)   and    if the markup is constant then a

      decline       in the relative price of non—traded goods                    lowers    the    real

      consumption       wage.       This will be reinforced if the average product of

      labour in the non—traded goods sector declines as                    N/T   declines and

      contracts, which is likely to happen if the non—traded goods sector is

      relatively labour intensive.

Notes:    The first column is calculated as the end—of—year currency outside
          banks (IFS line l4a) minus the end—of—year value of the previous
          year, divided by the current year GDP.   The second column is the
          ratio of the average of beginning—of—year and end—of—year currency
          outside banks to current GDP. The third column is the percentage
          change in currency outside banks from end—of—year to end—of—year.
          The final column is the percentage change in CPI (IFS line 64)
          from December to December.  The geometric average of growth rates
          is used for columns three and four; the arithmetic average aS
          ratios is used for columns I and 2.
