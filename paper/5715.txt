                                                ABSTRACT



         Is there any empirical evidence that firms become more efficient after becoming exporters?

Do firms that become exporters generate positive spillovers for domestically-oriented         producers?

In this paper we analyze the causal links between exporting and productivity using firm-level panel

data from three semi-industrialized         countries.   Representing   export market participation    and

production       costs as jointly dependent autoregressive processes, we look for evidence that firms’

stochastic cost processes shift when they break into foreign markets. We find that relatively efficient

firms become         exporters,   but firms’ unit costs are not affected by previous       export   market

participation.     So the well-known efficiency gap between exporters and non-exporters is due to self-

selection of the more efficient firms into the export market, rather than learning by exporting,

Further, we find some evidence that exporters reduce the costs of breaking into foreign markets for

domestically       oriented producers, but they do not appear to help these producers become more

efficient.

I. Introduction
                                                                                                               2
        Many analysts believe that export-led development         strategies improve technical efficiency.     And

one oft-cited reason is that exporters may benefit from the technical expertise of their buyers!                        f


         . . . a good deal of the informationneeded to augment basic capabilities has come from
        the buyers of exports who freely provided product designs and offered technical
        assistance to improve process technology in the context of their sourcing activities,
        Some part of the efficiency of export-led development must therefore be attributed to
        externalities derived from exporting.” (Evenson and Westphal, 1995).

        Buyers want low-cost, better-quality products from major suppliers. To obtain this, they
        transmit tacit and occasionally proprietary knowledge from their other, ofien OECD-
        economy, suppliers. (World Bank, 1993, p. 320).

        The important thing about foreign buyers, many of which have offices in Seoul, is that
        they do much more than buy and specifi. . . They come in, too, with models and patterns
        for Korean engineers to follow, and they even go out to the production line to teach
        workers how to do things (Rhee, Ross-Larson, and Pursell, 1984, p. 41)

        In support of this view, empirical studies often find that exporting plants are more efficient than

their domestically   oriented counterparts   (Aw and Hwang, 1995; Bernard and Jensen, 1995, Chen and

Tang, 1987; Haddad, 1993; Handoussa, Nishimizu          and Page, 1986; Tybout and Westbrook,         1995;

Roberts, Sullivan and Tybout, 1995). But, with the exception of Bernard and Jensen (1995) none of these

studies has asked the question of whether exporting causes eficiency          gains.   Plausible arguments can be

made for causality to flow in the opposite direction:      relatively more e~cient     plants self-select into export

markets because the returns to doing so are relatively high for them.

         In this paper we attempt to sort out the direction of causality, and in so doing, determine whether

there is evidence that firms learn to be more efticient by becoming expotiers.         Further, to assess the case

for active export promotion,    we test whether exporters generate external benefits for other firms, either by

acting as a conduit for knowledge that they acquire through trade, or by causing improvements             in

         Our methodology         for detecting learning effects   is based on a simple idea. If exporting indeed

generates efficiency gains, then firms that begin to export should thereafter exhibit a change in the                       ?

stochastic process that governs their productivity growth. Hence their productivi~              trajectories must

improve in some sense afier they enter foreign markets, Similarly, if the presence of exporters generates

positive externalities,    non-exporters    in the affected industry or region should exhibit changes in their cost

process when the number of exporters changes.             Increases in the number of exporters may also make it

easier for others to break into foreign markets.

         To keep track of causal linkages we begin by specibing           the general optimization     problem that we

envision firms as solving (section II). Each manager faces stochastic cost and foreign demand processes,

and chooses which periods to participate         in foreign markets.   Their decisions are complicated       by the

presence of sunk start-up costs when they first sell abroad, since managers must research foreign demand

and competition,     establish marketing channels, and adjust their product characteristics         and packaging to

meet foreign tastes. The basic features of this model are taken directly from the hysteresis literature

developed by Baldwin (1988), Dixit (1989), and Krugman (1989).                Our twist is to add the possibility of

learning-by-doing      or, more precisely, learning-by-exporting,      and examine how this affects the

productivity    trajectories    of exporters and plants that switch markets, relative to those of non-exporters.

         Because the framework we develop does not lend itself to closed-fore               solutions, we discuss its

implications    heuristically    and using simulations.    Under certain assumptions      on the exogenous shocks to

productivity    and demand, the latter suggest that: (a) non-exporters       experiencing    positive productivity



          2 Many believe that these spillover effects are significant in developing countries. For example, Aitken,
Hanson and Harrison (forthcoming) write that” . . the development of garmet exporters in Bangladesh, suggests
that informational externalities are likely to be extremely important. The entry of one Korean garment exporter in
Bangladesh led to the establishment of hundreds of exporting enterprises, all owned by local entreprenuers. . .
Spillovers may take a variety of forms. The geographic concentration of exporters may make it feasible to construct
specialized transportation infrastructure, such as storage facilities or rail lines, or may improve access to information
about which goods are popular among forei~ consumers.”

relative productivity       after they begin exporting.                                                                            r


             With these results in hand, we examine the actual performance             of Colombian,      Mexican and

Moroccan producers (section III). To familiarize              ourselves with the data, we begin by comparing the

productivity      trajectories   of producers that enter export markets with those of non-exporters,           ongoing

exporters, and firms that exit foreign markets.             (Productivity   is proxied by average variable cost and by

labor productivity.)       This exercise reveals patterns that our simulations         suggest we should find in the

absence of learning-by-exporting           effects.    mat is, the plants that become exporters typically have high

productivi~       before they enter foreign markets, and their relative efficiency does not systematically

increase after foreign sales are initiated.           In some instances the relatively strong performance          of exporters

traces to high labor productivity;         in other instances it is due to relatively low costs of intermediate          goods.

             This first look at the actual trajectories     casts doubt on the importance     of learning-by-exporting.

But it does not constitute a formal test of whether becoming an exporter changes a firm’s productivity

trajecto~.      Accordingly,      in section IV we estimate econometrically         a reduced-form   version of the

theoretical     model which takes explicit account of the two alternative,            but not incompatible,    explanations

for the positive association between export-participation              status and productivity:   self-selection     of the

relatively more eficient          plants, and learning-by-exporting.        For the countries with suficient       data to

support inference--Colombia            and Morocco--we       find that export market participation     generally depends

upon past participation          and (weakly) upon past average variable cost (A VC), as implied by the model.

However, conditioning            on capital stock and past A VC realizations,      current A VC does not depend

negatively upon previous export market participation,               as implied by the learning-by-exporting          hypothesis.

Thus, the conclusion        suggested by our descriptive        analysis is borne out by formal Granger causality
tests.’ Finally, extending our model to look for externalities,           we find some support for the hypothesis that
                                                                                                                  .{
a firm is more likely to export if it belongs to an export-intensive            industry or region, but we find little

evidence of any associated productivity          gains.




II. A Model of Export Participation             with Learning Effects

           Our first task is to present a model that specifies endogenous            and exogenous sources of variation

in the two producer characteristics         we are interested in: exporting status and production costs. This

model, which will guide us in our empirical analysis, is a simple modification                of existing    models to

accommodate potential learning effects from export particiaption               (Baldwin,   1989; Dixit, 1989; Krugman,

1989).

           We begin by assuming monopolistic              competition,   so that each firm faces a downward sloping

demand curve in the foreign market, yet views itself as too small to strategically               influence the behavior of

other producers.     Specifically,    we write foreign demand qf for the firm’s product at price pf            as

 q f = z ~~ f )-d      ,   where the random variable z~ captures the usual demand shifiers (foreign income

level, exchange rates, and other goods’ prices) and UJ> 1.4 Firms face similar demand conditions                      in the

domestic market,       q h = z h (p h )-d     , and can price   discriminate    between foreign and domestic buyers.

           Assuming constant marginal costs, c, the current period gross operating profits can be expressed

as a function of marginal costs and demand conditions in both markets:




where z = (z J, z h ). The profits from exporting are the shaded area depicted in figure 1 below, where

                                                                                                         i
costs and trade barriers eat up a fraction of each unit of revenue generated in foreign markets.

                                      Figure 1: Gross Profits from Exporting




           Let the per-period,   fixed costs of being an exporter, (e.g., dealing with customs and

intermediaries)    be M. Then, the plant will earn positive net operating profits from exporting whenever

 Xf(c,zq    > M    .   Accordingly,   if there were no start-up costs associated with becoming an exporter and

no learning effects, producers would simply participate          in foreign markets--choosing     the profit-maximing

level of exports--whenever       this condition was satisfied.   As figure 1 demonstrates,      given demand

conditions,    all firms with marginal costs below some threshold would self-select into export activities.

           But as Baldwin ( 1989), Dixit ( 1989), and Krugman ( 1989) have recently stressed, sunk strart-up

costs modify the problem in a non-trivial way. Suppose that an entry cost of F dollars is incurred every

time the plant decides to (re)start exporting.      Then, once exporting,    it maybe   optimal to keep exporting

even if n~(c,z ~       is currently less than A4since, by remaining in the export market, the plant avoids future

re-entry costs. So, if sunk costs are important--and       micro evidence suggests that they are (e.g., Roberts


                                                           5
and Tybout, 1995)--producers          face a dynamic optimization
                                                             problem where, in each period, they must
                                                                                                     2
choose whether or not to export on the basis of currently available information. This makes decision-

making forward-looking          and opens the possibility that firms export today in anticipation        of cost               ?

reductions later. Hence, even if there are no learning-by-exporting              effects, sunk start-up costs may imply

that reductions in the marginal cost of production            follow entry into foreign markets.

           Because expectations       are important in this context, we must be specific about the processes that

generate the state variables c and z. To account for heterogeneity             in behavior we allow idiosyncratic,

serially correlated shocks to demand and cost for each firm. We, therefore, assume that the demand

shifier z is exogenous to the plant, and follows some serially-comelated,             plant-specific   process (for

simplicity, the plant-subscript       is omitted until section IV):


                                                        z, = fix,, z:?,)                                                 (2)



where      X, is a vector   of exogenous    variables   that shifi the demand processes,    e.g., the exchange rate and

plant-specific     noise, and     z~fll= (z.,, z,_,, z,.,, . . ) denotes the vector of previous realizations    on z,, up to

and including period t-1.

           Marginal cost also depends on its own history and, in addition, is potentially affected by the

firm’s exporting decisions if there are learning effects:


                                                    c, = g(w,,   c:?,,
                                                                   f?,)                                                  (3)



where      w, is a vector of exogenous cost shifiers, e.g., factor prices and plant-specific           noise, and

 ~[-t
  t = (Y,, Y,_,, Y,.2,          ) denotes the history of the binary variable     Y which, in turn, indicates whether the

plant was exporting j periods ago ~j = 1) or was not, &,., = O). Note that we model learning-by -

exporting in a very specific manner:          participation      in the foreign market lowers marginal costs of

production,      irrespective   of the volume of exports? If firms learn from other producers that export,



           5 This assumption simplifies the empirical analysis significantly because of the endogeneity of the level of
exports.   It also places fewer restrictions on the data. Note also that, for simplicity, the per-period fixed costs of

                                                                 6

the demand processes. Thus, to sort out the relationship                 between c and Y we need to develop a

representation      of firms’ exporting decisions.      Following the hysteresis literature, we assume that managers

take equations (1) through (3) into consideration,            and plan their export market participation      patterns to

Here       Y~+}= (Y,, r,+,, Y,+,,   . } denotes the entire future trajecto~        of Yvalues,    ~ is an expectations

operator conditioned        on the set of information     available at time [, and b is the one-period discount rate!

Domestic profits enter this expression          on] y because export market participation         may affect the future cost

production     are not affected by the export participation   history.

          bThis formulation implies that producers who exit the export market and re-enter face the same start-up
costs as producers who never exported. In our econometric rendering of the decision to export we will allow start-
up costs to depend upon previous exporting experience.

                                                                 7

That is, incumbent exporters continue exporting whenever current net operating profits from exports plus

the expected discounted future payoff from remaining an exporter is positive, and non-exporters                 begin

exporting whenever this sum, net of start-up costs, is positive. Expected future pay-offs include the value

of avoiding start-up costs next period and any positive learning effects that accrue from foreign market

experience.   Without learning effects, expression (6) has appeared in various forms in the hysteresis

literature; it will prove usefil in section IV.

         If we allow for much generality in the cost process (3), and/or for the dependence              of export

profits on exporting history more than one period ago, it is very difficult to characterize            optimal behavior

in this framework.      However, some insights can be gained by assuming that c follows a discrete, first-

order Markov process that depends only on ~., .7 Then learning-by-exporting               can be represented     by

assigning this term the transition matrix P.if the firm is not exporting, and some stocastically             better

matrix, say P,,
              if the firm is exporting. That is, among exporters the probability             of a decrease in c is

greater, and the probability     of a increase is less. The no-learning     case simply assigns POto all firms.

         Simulations     of cost trajectories   based on this relatively restrictive framework      and arbitrary

parameter values are presented in figure 2. (Details are provided in appendix 1.) The trajectories               are

averages over repeated simulations        for four subgroups of firms, labelled “non-exporters”          (those that

never export), “exporters” (those that always export), “entrants” (those that begin exporting),               and

“quitters” (those that cease exporting).        For all firms that begin or cease exporting, we measure time




         7 Demand shifters can be held constant since their effect on profits is qualitatively   the same as that of c.

Several patterns merit note. First and most obviously, regardless of whether learning effects are present,

costs among the enfrant and the exporter firms are lower than costs in the other two groups. This reflects


                                                                      9

                                                                                                                 j
cost comparisons      between exporters and non-exporters         to make inferences about learning.

            Second, regardless of whether learning effects are present, firms that become exporters exhibit                   ,

cost declines before they enter the market.         These firms self-select    into exporting only when their unit

costs fall below some threshold, so they must experience a period of falling costs prior to entry. Hence

selection effects may create the illustion that becoming an exporter actually retards productivity               growth.

            Third, one distinguishing   feature of the learning trajectories     is that exporting firms exhibit

ongoing cost reductions afier initiating foreign sales. Only when learning effects are present, do firms

continue to pull away from non-exporters           afier foreign market entry.

            Finally, relative to the no learning case, learning makes firms enter (and stay in) export markets

at higher costs. This occurs because the incentives to export are larger when learning occurs. Productivity

dispersion may thus be higher among exporters when learning effects are present, and the productivity

gap between exporters and non-exporters           may be smaller.s

            Of course, these results are only suggestive, and more complicated          cost processes might reverse

some of the patterns. For example, if costs were to follow a second- or higher-order              autogressive     process,

they might continue to trend downward            after export market entry even without learning effects.

Accordingly,      to look for learning effects and externalities,    we rely on econometric     estimates of a general

form of the cost finction     (3), recognizing     that export market participation    is governed by the behavioral

rule (6).




III.        Learning Effects: A Look at Actual Data

             Before we report the results of that exercise, however, it is instructive to visually examine cost

data on actual producers from three semi-industrialized           countries.   Though merely suggestive, this will




          6 More generally, this result suggests caution interpreting studies that use productivity dispersion as a
performance measure. (See especially the “efficiency frontier” literature). When learning effects are present,
exporters may look relatively bad.

the distinguishing patterns that our simulations suggest we should find when learning effects are present.




A.       The Data

         Our data allow us to follow individual producers through time in Colombia, Mexico and

Morocco.      In the case of Colombia, they describe virtually all plants with at least 10 workers over the

period 1981-199 1; in Mexico, they describe 2800 of the larger firms over the period 1986-1990, and in

Morocco they cover most all firms with at least 10 workers over the period 1984-1991?               Standard

information   on inputs, outputs and costs is provided in each of these data bases, as well as information           on

export levels. To simplify estimation we throw out firms that do not report information           for the entire

sample period, creating a balanced panel. The data were cleaned and deflated as described in Appendix

II.

         Finally, to sharpen the analysis, we focus only on the export-oriented        industries in each country.

These industries exported at least 10 percent of their output      and had at least 20 exporting plants!” Table

1 provides descriptive   information   on each country.    Note that although most plants tend to stay in the

export market or stay out there are substantial transitions      in the data.




         ‘ Although some countries report plant-level data and some report furn-level data, we will hereafter use the
term “plant” to describe the unit of observation. In semi-indus~ialized countries where the calculation is possible,
we have found that 95 percent of the plants are owned by single-plant fins.

        ‘“In a few cases, industries that exported less than 10 percent of their output were included because they
hand many exporting plants and/or accounted for a substantial share of total manufactured exports.

B.       Comparing        Productivity      Trajectories

         We wish to familiarize       ourselves with the marginal cost trajectories            of plants with different

export market participation       patterns, controlling for industry-wide           time effects, and observable plant-

specific productivity      determinants     like capital stocks and age.        We use two marginal cost proxies:

average variable cost (A VC) and labor productivity             (UB).     The former is defined as the sum of labor and

intermediate       input costs divided by real output, and the latter is real output divided by number of workers.

Real output is the sum of nominal output for the domestic market and nominal output for export, each

deflated by its own product-specific          deflator.

         To purge these productivity         measures of industry-wide         time effects and observable plant-specific

characteristics,     each is expressed in logarithms and regressed on time dummies (specific to year 1 and the

J’h 3-digit ISIC industry), age of the plant (A), age of the plant squared, capital stock of the plant (K), and

capital stock of the plant squared.         Both age and capital stocks are measured in logarithms:



                      ln(~ VC,,) = ~ ~ yj~j,      + ~1ln(-4i,) + ~z ln(,4 ,,)2 + ~31n(KiJ + ~, 1n(K,J2 + Ei,
                                   j=, ,=,




                                                                12
         The residuals from these two regressions are then used as our indices of deviation from time- and
                                                                                                       i
industry-specific productivity norms. Note that there is no need to deflate variable costs directly because

industry-specific      time dummies play the role of price deflators (inter alia). Also, because logarithmic            ?

variable costs are purged of correlation with capital, the residuals can be viewed as the measure of

variable factor productivity     that obtains from a total cost function of the form

 C,, = a, (Ki,, W,,) + ~, (Ki,, W,) Q,, , where parentheses       denote functions, Kj, is capital, and Wtiis the

vector of factor prices.

          To isolate the relation between export market participation         and productivity    performance,    we

distinguish the five varieties of plants defined in Table 2, and for each plant we re-define period zero to

be the year in which a change in export status takes place. Then we isolate five-year blocks of time,

running from two years prior to the status change (1 = -2) to two years after (t = 2); 1 For non-exporters

and exporters there is no change in status, so we take five yens in the middle of the sample period (for

Colombia we take seven years).         Finally, after re-indexing    time in this way, we aggregate our productivity

indices by plant type and compare them. Because switching firms strongly resemble exporters we omit

them from our graphs to reduce clutter.

by plant type in Figures 3.1 through 3.3. We begin by considering                                   Colombia and Mexico,    since these        ,

countries show similar patterns.            Most strikingly, plants that cease exporting get steadily worse before

they drop out of foreign markets, and are substantially                             less efficient than the other plant types.     Also,

entering plants and exporting plants share the distinction of having the lowest variable costs, and non-

exporters consistently   exhibit costs slightly above average, but less than quitters. These patterns are

similar to the simulations   in figure 1 for both the learning and non-learning                               models, except in that the

performance   of quitting plants is somewhat worse in the actual data.

          One might argue about whether the entrants show evidence of reducing their costs afier

beginning to export, but the effect is certainly not dramatic. The F-statistic for the null hypothesis that the                 -

mean average cost level among entrants shows no variation relative to the industry norms has a p-value of

.08 in Colombia, and a p-value of .25 in Mexico. ‘2 Further, in Mexico, entrants’ average costs are

slightly higher relative to industry norms after three years of exporting than they were three years before.

          The Moroccan graph is more complex.               Most obviously, there is much less variation in

trajectories   here than we found in Colombia and Mexico.                   Further, what little variation there is does not

conform to the patterns described above. Two years after exiting, the plants that abandon foreign markets

emerge as the worst plants, but their average variable costs are highly volatile, and no higher than the

indust~    norm one year after exiting.       Exporters usually do better than non-exporters,            but even this is not

guaranteed.

          These patterns may well reflect the fact that, unlike in Mexico and Colombia,                   most of the impetus

to become an exporter in Morocco came from firm-specifc                        demand side shocks. Many Moroccan

exporters are young plants that were founded with the exclusive purpose of selling particular apparel and

policies during the sample period also provided various subsidies to exporters, and these may have

allowed less efficient plants to compete.      Once again there is little statistical evidence that average costs    ?

among plants that begin exporting are anything but flat relative to indust~         norms (the p-value is .24).

          The results discussed thus far are based on unweighed        averages of our variable cost measures.

But small plants are much more common than large plants, so Figures 3.1 through 3.3 do not necessarily

describe sector-wide performance.        To determine whether aggregate performances        looked similar, we

therefore redid the calculations,    weighting each plant’s average cost by its share in the total output among

those of its type. We also redid the plant-specific     average cost measures themselves,      leaving capital

stocks and age out of the regression,     because we did not want them to be purged of correlation       with size

for this exercise.

          The weighted average cost trajectories     by plant type are presented   in Figures 4.1 through 4.3.

For Colombia the pattern looks very similar, except that exporters’ costs are no longer below those of

non-exporters.       So small exporters are apparently more efficient than large exporters in terms of variable

costs. In Mexico the pattern is also similar, except exporters’ costs now turn up dramatically         in the last

period.   This is presumably     because of one or several very large plants.    Finally, it remains true that

entrants exhibit relatively low average costs, both before and afier the transition year. There is no

obvious tendency for costs to fall afier exporting operations are initiated.

          In Morocco, the weighted average trajectories        areas flat and tightly clustered as their unweighed

counterparts.    As with the other countries, there is no evidence that costs drop afier exports are initiated.

However, the weighted figures do provide better support for the assertion that exporters tend to be lower

cost than non-exporters.

        Labor productivity:        An alternative        measure of performance        is output per worker.   Unlike costs, it

does not reflect valuation effects due to changes in factor prices, as might happen if exporters began

using imported inputs under a duty drawback scheme, or if real exchange rate fluctuations                      affected

producers to the extent that they used imported intermediates.                 Like average variable costs, labor

productivi~   is not a true measure of total factor productivity,            but afier it has been purged of correlation

with capital stocks it is conceptually         closer,

to show the next best performance,     and quitters continue to show the worst performance,         particularly      ?

around the time of their exit. So in Colombia,      it appears that output per worker is one important source of

variation in average variable costs, and we have the first bit of evidence that exporting might improve

performance,

         Quitters and ongoing exporters     in Mexico follow the Colombian        pattern.   But Mexican entrants

do not. Their average labor productivity     is very stable relative to indust~    norms ~-value     = .61 ), and a

bit below average (Figure 5.2), So there is no suggestion of a learning effect from exporting in this

country, nor, for that matter, does it appear that cross-plant     exporting patterns can be traced to differences

in labor productivity.

           Finally, in terms of labor productivity,              Moroccan patterns appear to resemble Colombia’s (Figure

5.3). Entrants’ productivity jumps in the year that they begin exporting (although the p-value is .41), and

ongoing exporters exhibit higher labor productivity                          than either non-exporters            or quitters!4 Interestingly,

there is much more variation across plant types in our Moroccan                              labor productivity         series than we found

in our average cost series, suggesting that labor costs co-vary negatively with intermediate                                     goods costs in

this country.

           Weighting our labor productivity               series by plant size gives a better picture of aggregate

performance     for each of the plant types.             We report the results of this exercise in Figures 6.1 through 6.3,

using series that have not been purged of correlation                            with capital stocks or age. In Colombia,           the pattern

for entrants and quitters seems largely unchanged                          from Figure 5.1, although there is no longer any

recovery in labor productivity           among the latter in the years after they exit. Also, ongoing exporters no

longer consistently    outperform         non-exporters,         suggesting that this was mainly a small plant phenomenon.

These are the same contrasts we identified with our weighted versus unweighed                                         average cost series.




           “ The one exception       is that labor productivity            is high for exiting plants during their last year in foregin

         The Mexican trajectories                      do not seem to depend much upon whether we use weighted or

unweighed      labor productivity,                 although quitters’ performance                  is more stable with the former (Figure 6.2).

On the other hand, in Morocco our use of a weighted series (Figure 6.3) undoes much of what emerged in

the unweighed        series. (Figure 5.3). Exporters become the Zeasf productive                                    when we weight by size, and

the tendency for entrants to improve afier they begin exporting is dampened.                                           These results, in conduction

with the low power of test statistics for our unweighed                                   trajectories,   suggest that the unweighed        series

reflect the influence of small plants that are outliers.

         Labor @ali~:                  One fundamental              source of variation in labor productivity                is associated variation

in the skill mix of employees.                    To see whether differences                 in skill mixes are behind the labor productivity

differences we analyzed the ratio of skilled to total labor in the same way we analyzed our two

productivity     series. 15 The results for Colombia are presented in Figure 7.1. Interesting                                     y, entrants appear

to have high labor productivity                    partly because they use skilled labor relatively intensively,                     and quitters

have low productivity             because they use little skilled labor. There is also some evidence that relative labor

quality improves over time for the entrants (the p-value is .09). The high labor productivity                                          of ongoing

exporters does not, however, appear to come from unusually h igh ski 11intensity.                                           None of these patterns

One interpretation   is that breaking into foreign markets requires new product design and other forms of

technical assistance, but established export production            can be routinized.

         In Mexico, labor quality trajectories      match labor productivity            trajectories   for ongoing exporting

plants (which are skill-intensive)    and exiting plants (which are not). However, although Mexican entrants

resemble Colombian     entrants in terms of skill intensity, this is not sufficient to get them high labor

productivity   (Figure 7.2 versus Figure 5.2). The Mexican results are somewhat sensitive to weighting;

when this is done non-exporters      actually exceed exporters in terms of skill intensity.               Nonetheless,

entrants remain above average, and quitters are well below average.

         In summary, our performance              measures indicate that entrants generally do better than non-

exporters and exiting plants.     They have higher labor productivity, and this appears to be partly due to

their heavier reliance on skilled labor. Also, despite their high quality workers, new exporters have

relatively low average variable costs. On the other hand, we find little to suggest that productivity                            gains

follow entry into foreign markets.        Labor productivity              and skill-intensity          appear to improve for

Colombian plants that begin exporting,             but this phenomenon             did not show up in the other countries.

Interestingly,   Bernard and Jensen (1995) have recently reported that many of these patterns are evident

among U.S. manufacturers      as well.




Iv.      An Econometric      Test of harning            Effects

         The figures we report in the previous section are revealing,                         but they do not consitute a direct test

for whether past export market participation             influences current costs; the F-statistics               we calculated merely

indicate whether cost trajectories      for entering firms deviate significantly                      from industry norms. Hence in

this section we develop an alternative        approach to test for the presence of learning-by-exporting                       effects in

the data. Specifically,   we estimate a fairly general version of equations (3) jointly with a reduced form of




                                                                    24
(6), and test whether exporting history,            ~~      , enters significantly     in the cost equation?’   In other
                                                                                                                               .
                                                                                                                           i
words, we perform Granger causality tests in a non-linear context.




A.          The Econometric       Model

            Our treatment of the export market participation              decision follows Roberts and Tybout (1995).

First, we generalize equation (6) so that firms which exit and re-enter the export market pay different

start-up costs than firms that never exported.            Specifically,     defie FO as the start-up   cost for a non-

exporter with no previous experience,          and FJ as the start-up cost faced by a firm that last exported j- 1

years ago (note that F 1= O). Then equation (6) generalizes to imply that the th firm will export in year t

(i.e., will choose ~ = 1) whenever




 ~’(cfl z .’) – ~ + 5[E,(V,,+,
        !   ,f              I Yir=l) - Er(v,,+, I Yi,=o)]~ F“ - ~ (FO-Fj)i,,.j                     ,                               (7)
                                                                j=,



where       fit.,   is one if the firm last exported in year t-j and zero otherwise!7 Next, we define the latent

variable Y’ as current net operating profits plus the expected future return to being an exporter in period t:



 Y,: = rtf(ci,,zj     - M +   6[E,(ri,+,IY,,=l) - E,(vir+, lYi,=o)]



Equation (7) then implies that ~, obeys the following dynamic discrete process:




           1’ If we allow for much generality in the processes (2) and (3), it becomes very diff]cult to estimate all the
structural parameters of the model. Yet imposing restrictions on these processes may well lead us to incorrectly
conclude that past participation in the export market influences current marginal costs. For example, misspeci~ing
equations (2) and (3) to be first-order processes may force any dependence of current costs on additional lags (e.g.,
C,.J,C,-J)to come through Y,.,, giving the impression that export market participation affects costs. Thus, if the goal
is to look for learning effects, it is desirable to pursue a reduced-form approach,


                                                                         j-,
            17 Note that   ~i,.l = Yi,.l   and, forj>2,     ~i,.j = Yi,.j II ( 1- Yi,_k) .
                                                                           k=l


                                                                25
                                                                                                              i
                                                                                                                   (8)
                    O otherwise
                                                                                                                         ●




          Finally, we express the latent variable    ~, - F as a reduced form in demand shifters, marginal

costs, as well as the variables that help predict future margiml        costs and demand in each market. ‘a

Operationally,    this means including exogenous plant characteristics      ( Xi,), time dummies (D,), a

distributed   lag in our marginal cost proxy, AVCil , and a serially correlated     disturbance.   Writing start-

up costs at the iw plant as their mean value plus another disturbance,        we have:




                                                                                                                  (9a)

                                                                                                                  (9b)




Then substituting (9a) and (9b) into (8) we obtain a representation        of export market participation

decisions that can be estimated:




                                                                                                                  (lo)

                    o      otherwise




where    q,, is a serially correlated   compound    disturbance   based on the errors in equation (9).

          Notice that the estimated coefficients    on our lagged participation   variables measure the discount

on entry costs that plants with exporting     experience    in previous years enjoy, relative to plants with no

exporting experience.     For example,    a plant that most recently exported j-l years ago pays

ordy    F“ - Fj   to resume exporting operations,      while a plant that never exported pays start-up costs



          ‘8 This reduced form approach is also used in Sullivan (1995) and Roberts, Sullivan and Tybout (1995).

         As noted in section II, if firms learn by exporting the stochastic process that generates costs

also depends upon the history of Yuvalues.                              Accordingly,            a general log-linearized                    specification   of the     r

marginal cost function (3) includes not ordy capital stocks, lagged cost, and factor prices, but lagged ~,

values as well:

                                                                                                                                                                (11)
                                                         ~.,                 j=~                                ,=,




Here time dummies              control     for changes             in factor prices        that are common                   to all plants.

         Together,      equations          (10) and (11 ) describe                 export      market       participation             patterns   and marginal

costs realizations      for the case of no learning externalities.                              Estimated as a system, they should reveal

whether marginal costs influence the export participation                                      decision, as the model implies, and whether

firms typically experience cost reductions once they have begun to service foreign markets, as posited by

the learning-by-exporting                hypothesis.           Tests on the cost coefficients                         in the participation       equation indicate

whether firms respond to cost reductions                            by becoming more likely to expom and tests on the ~,j

coefficients    in the cost function indicate whether exporting experience                                                 leads to lower costs. It is, of

course, the latter direction of causality that is of primary interest to us.

          Serial correlation             is likely in both equations because persistent unobserved                                          plant characteristics

make some firms consistently                 low cost and/or consistently                       prone to exporting, conditioning                      on observable

variables.     Hence, we model each disturbance                           as composed of an unobserved                            (random) plant effect a,

and aj, ph.Is transitory noise:               qir = a,, + Eli, and                   Vi,   =   a2i   +   E2it         .   We allow the plant effects and the

transitory noise to be correlated across equations.                                Also, without loss of generality,                        we impose the

normalization        Var(qi)       = I so that all coefficients                    in equation ( 10) are measured relative to total

unexplained     variation.

effects, so they are correlated with the disturbance.        But this dependence       is not captured by equation (10)

nor by equation (11) for the first J years of data. We adopt Heckman’s (1981a, 1981 b) solution to this                        ,

“initial conditions problem” by adding extra equations to the system that represent ~, through Ytias

functions of ali (inter alia), and AVCi, through AVCU as functions of azi (inter alia). The result is a variant

of Keane, Moffitt and Runkle’s (1988) and Sullivan’s (1995) estimator?9                The system is estimated using

maximum likelihood, integrating       out the two random effects with Gaussian quadrature.               Details of the

likelihood finction    maybe    found in Appendix III.




B.       The Evidence on Learning

         Because we expect the cost function, the profit function, entry costs, and the potential for active

learning to differ across industries, we fit our system of equations separately to each industry in which we

have sufficient observations     to support inference.     We include industries which are relatively intensive in

human capital (e.g., Chemicals)      as well as those that are not (e.g., Apparel) in order to look for

corresponding     variation in active learning effects.    Although the model can be fit to our Mexican              panel,

the time period    spanned   by that data set proved    to short to isolate   random    effects   from the history   of cost

and export market partication. 20 We therefore         focus our attention on the Colombian          and Moroccan results

reported in Tables 3.1 and 3.2.

         The participation     equation yields results similar to those reported elsewhere (Roberts and Tybout,

1984; Roberts, Sullivan and Tybout, 1995). In all countries and in all industries, plants with large capital




          19Sullivan’s (1 995) estimator does not deal with initial conditions problems in the equation that has a
continuous dependent variable; and Keane, Moffh and Runkle’s (1988) estimator does not deal with dynamics at all.
Otherwise the structure of our estimator is the same.

           201nMexico we observe only five yems of data, and three of these years are lost to lags on participation and
average costs, leaving two in-sample years. Estimates of the model (available upon request) attribute too much
explanatory power to lagged cost and export participation, and imply that var(a,)     = var(a2) = O . Nonetheless,
the results concerning the effect of lagged participation on cost realizations are consistent with those obtained in the
other countries. The convergence of random effect Probit estimators to simple Probit estimators when T is small is
discussed in Guilkey and Murphy (1993).

                                                              is that there are fixed costs associated
                                                                                                      i
with export shipments, and producers who can produces large batches are better able to spread these

costs. Consistent with our conceptual       framework,    plants that have lower marginal costs are more likely           -

to be exporters, other things being equal.        But individual lags of this variable are never statistically

significant, perhaps because of the high collinearity       between them, and, even though in some instances

the estimated coefficients    alternate in sign, their sum is always negative?l       The fact that standard errors

for cost coefficients   are relatively large for Morocco is consistent with the lack of cost variation across

types of firms observed in the graphs discussed earlier in section III.

          The effect of export experience     is most dramatic for plants that exported last period, and hence

face no re-entry costs. In all industries the effect is substantial.       In Morocco, the effect is smaller in

textiles than in chemicals.    This result jibes with our priors that breaking into the foreign textiles market

involves less sunk cost than breaking into the them ical markets.            Although exporting experience acquired

more than one year ago proved marginal Iy significant            in earlier work on participation   (Roberts and

Tybout, 1994), it appears to be unimportant        for most industries in the present application.        This finding

is probably due to the relatively small samples we use here, since the coefficients            on lagged participation

variables themselves     are not systematically    smal Ier in Morocco.

          In theory, devaluations    should increase the probability      of becoming an exporter, but we only find

significant effects of the exchange rate in Colombian textiles and apparel industries.              These are the goods

that Colombia sends north, so it is not surpising that the real exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar is a strong

predictor for both industries.      Chemicals, on the other hand, are mainly sold in Latin America and

producers in that industry do not show as much responsiveness              to real exchange rates. Point estimates of

the response to devaluation      in Morocco resemble those for Colombia, but have much larger standard

errors.




           “One reason these results are less dramatic than our graphs is that here we condition on lagged
participation, which is colinear with A VC. Put differently, fms with low unit costs tended to be exporters in the
past, so recent innovations in A VC have limited explanatory power.

         Now consider the cost equation, which is the focus of our analysis?2 As expected, plants with
                                                                                                        z
larger capital stocks tend to have lower marginal costs, although there are some insignificant coefficients.

Also, conditioning         on capital stocks and unobserved plant effects, marginal costs appear to follow a                                    “

second-order,     or higher, autorregressive            process.z’ But critically, exporting history contributes               little to

the explanation      of marginal costs once we have conditioned                     on these variables.     Indeed, in the few

instances where lagged experience                 is statistically      significant, the coefficient   suggests that exporting

increases costs.

         Might this cost increase be a statistical artifact?                    One possibility    is that we systematically      over-

estimate the price of exported products, so that when producers start exporting the real value of their

output is systematically         under-estimated,            causing average costs to be overstated and labor productivity                 to

be understated?’       Another source of bias derives from the fact that we are not measuring total costs. If

the production       technology       for exports is more labor-intensive             (or skilled-labor   intensive)   than the

technolo~    for domestic goods produced by the same firm, we might miss offsetting reductions in capital

costs by fwusing       exclusively       on labor and materials. Third, workers may capture efficiency gains as

higher wages, leaving average variable costs unaffected.                         Finally, we may well be picking up some of the

sunk entry costs associated with bcoming                      an exporter in our variable cost measure.          But in Colombia the




          ‘*One estimation detail worth noting is that the variance of the random effect in our cost equation is always
very close to zero. This is apparently because the lagged cost variables pick up all of the relevant heterogeneity.
One implication is that we really didn’t need to estimate the cost functions jointly with the participation equation:
there is no reason to think that lagged participation is comelated with the disturbance.

         23 Indeed     ~   prelfi~w       work,     a th~d     ]ag   of tie cost variable was sometimes statistically significant.
Because the result; and conclusions are not significantly changed by the inclusion of a third lag of costs, and
because of the increased complexity of the estimation, we decided to work with the more parsimonious specification.
The same apllies to the use of year dummies instead of the exchange rate.

         24 Given our methodology for construction of price indices, this could happen if we over-estimated the
change in the real exchange rate between the base year and the current year. Note, that it is unlikely to result from
changes in product quality. If quality improvements accompany foreign market entry, they should increase both the
numerator and the denominator of A VC, so this phenomenon need not be a tendency to mis-interpret quality
improvements as adverse cost shocks.

effects.   If they are not driven by measurement       problems, these estimates suggest that negative cost

shocks can Granger cause increases in the expected return from exporting.                But the act of exporting does

nol Granger cause reductions in marginal costs.




c.         The Evidence on Externalities

           In order to test for regional and indust~    spillover effects, we re-specified     equations (10) and (1 1)

to include regional and industry export intensity variables.         Export intensity was measured as the

percentage of firms in the industry/region     that were exporting in the particular year. These variables were

added to the participation    equation to test whether sunk entry costs depend upon exporting activity by

other firms. They were also added to the cost finction           to test whether al 1 firms enjoy cost reductions

when some firms export. To control for permanent,           unobserved    regional effects like access to ports,

regional dummies were also included.

           Adding our measure of industry-specific        export activity to the model increased the collinearity of

the explanatory variable set because, like the exchange rate, it is common to all firms in the industty.            The

(absolute) correlation    between these two variables lies between 0.66 and 0.76 in Colombia, and between

0.62 and 0.91 in Morocco, depending        upon the industry.      These correlations,    while high, do not prohibit

estimation.    However, the condition number of the moment matrix of the regressors--the               square root of

the ratio of the largest to the smallest characteristic     root--lies between 648 ad 1018 in Morocco, but only

between 47 and 56 in Colombia?5 In addition, the estimated coefficients             of the exchange rate and the



          25For the purposes of these calculations the regressors include only a constant, the exchange rate, the
proportion of exporters in the industry, the proportion of exporters in the region, and the regional dummies. A
condition number above 30 suggests potential multicolinearity problems (Belsley, Kuh and Welsch , 1980).

                                                                                                                   .2

coefficients    for the Colombian   externality variables in Table 4. All but one of the externality coefficients

in the participation   question are positive; however, only one is significant.        Nonetheless,   this seems to

provide some evidence that the presence of many exporters increases a firm’s chances of being an

exporter itself. These results buttress Aitken, Hanson and Harrison’s (forthcoming)             conclusions   based on

cross-sectional    analysis of Mexican data.

          The same cannot be said of the effect on average variable costs. Four out of six coefficients            are

positive, suggesting that high export intensity actually raises costs. The chemical industry is particularly

noteworthy      because the two coefficients    are both significant   and they have counteracting    effects. Unit

production costs are reduced by export intensity in the region, perhaps because of demonstration              effects,

and the development      of better transport services for exporters. On the other hand, the presence of other

chemicals exporters appears to increase unit costs. One interpretation            is that other exporters in one’s own

industry bid up the local cost of specialized       inputs. These possibilities    are intriguing, but given the

inconsistence      across industries we refrain from generalization.




          “Using the proportion of exporters in the region instead of the proportion of exporters in the industry is not
feasible in Morocco because most firms are located in one region. For example, 90 percent of the chemical firms
and 70 percent of the textile fms are in the Casablanca area.

V. Summary and Conclusions

         Micro data in developing           countries ofien show that exporting firms are more efficient than non-

exporting firms. This study confirms that pattern, and adds the finding that plants which cease exporting

are typically less efficient, sometimes dramatically              so. But more impofintly,       this study addresses the

question of whether the association            between exporting and efficiency reflects causation flowing from

exporting experience to improvements              in performance.        Surprisingly,   despite many anecdotes in the

literature to the contrary, we find scant evidence of such a causality pattern.

         If learning-by-exporting           is important, then the stochastic processes that generate cost and

productivity        trajectories   should improve with changes in exporting status. To get some sense for the

nature of the respone, we began by plotting cost and exporting trajectories                  from actual plant-level panel

data from Colombia, Morocco and Mexico.                    We found that plants which begin exporting tend to have

relatively low average variable cost, and plants that cease exporting are becoming increasingly                   high cost,


                                                                  35
as implied by the model.      Similar patterns emerged when we used labor productivity                as our performance
                                                                                                                      2
measure.     However, cost and productivity     trajectories        generally did not continue to change afier entering

foreign markets.     That is, the patterns we found in the actual data resembled our no-learning-by-exporting                 “

scenario, under which the positive association between export status and productivity                  is due solely to the

self-selection    of relatively more efficient plants into foreign markets.

           To formally test whether the association        between exporting and efficiency reflects more than

self-selection,   we simultaneously    estimated an autoregressive          cost function and a dynamic discrete choice

equation that characterized     export market participation          decisions.    Exporting history did not significantly

shift the cost function, and to the extent that it did, the shift was in the “wrong” direction.              The

association between exporting and e~ciency          is thus most plausibly explained as low-cost producers

choosing to become exporters.

           Finally, looking for evidence of externalities,          we found that the presence of other exporters might

make it easier for domestically-oriented       firms to break into foreign markets. In principle, this opens the

possibility that export promotion policies are welfare improving.                 On the other hand, the presence of

exporters does not appear to reduce the unit production              costs of neighboring    firms in most instances. So if

exporters act as conduits of foreign knowledge to local producers, this effect is weak, slow, or masked by

other cost-increasing     spillovers of export activity.

A.       The Numerical        Solution

         In the type of problem presented in section II, the optimal participation            policy usually involves

two trigger levels defined, for our purposes, in terms of marginal cost levels, ~ < Cu, such that a non-

exporting plant will start exporting when its costs are no larger than ~, and an exporting plant will cease

exporting when its costs equal or are larger than CV

         We will assume that this is indeed the type of policy followed by the plant and focus on

computing the trigger points. For this pupose, we assume that c is a random variable that takes any one

of K discrete values cl,.. .,c~, and evolves over time according to a stationary Markov process with

transition probability    matrix P = [Rj], where Rj denotes the probability         of observing Ciat t given that Cj

occurred at t- 1.

         The value of any particular policy (Cfi Cu) is



                                                                                                                       (Al)




where expectations       are taken over marginal costs conditional      on the value of the current marginal cost

and the export status at the beginning of period t, and where,

is the binary variable that takes the value of one if the plant is exporting and O otherwise.             We treat the

demand shifter ias       fixed and we ignore learning effects on domestic market profits.

function of ~). Then, the policy’s value equals the discounted expected value of the sequence of returns

R~u(st+,). Because c and Y are discrete, ~+.takes any one of 2K possible values. Let s =

i= 1 ,...,2K.   Then, for example, the discounted         expected value of tomorrow’s returns is simply an average

of the 2K possible returns weighted by the one step-ahead (conditional)                   probabilities   of being next period

in state ~, given that today’s state is ~ and that the plant uses the policy (Cfi Cu). Denoting these

probabilities    by eij this values is~s

from the 2K x 2K one-step transition matrix for the state vectors,                denoted by ~u, one can easily obtain

the n-step transition probability       matrix P~u and compute the expected discounted                value of a policy for

any initial state as,

           28Al~ough    it is omitted for notational   convenience,   it should be understood   that ev depends on the values
of the trigger points and should therefore be also indexed by (L, ~. For example, if L=3 then, when C=cl, the plant
will be exporting. Hence, the probability of being in states, is zero since (C1,O)can never happen.

         Notice that the trigger points in (A6) are expressed in terms of the indices of the cost vector.                                ?

From (A6) we can infer which states have probability                       zero under the optimal policy.        States with Y = O

and costs low enough so that Ci s C~(Ci,~,and, conversely,                     states with Y = 1 and Ciz Cu(ci,/, have probability

zero of occurring.

         At this point a numerical example can be illustrative.                      Consider the case where K = 10 and the ten

possible realizations      of the marginal costs are ( 1,2,..., 10). Assume also that given a cost q today the

plant can move only to neighboring                   costs Ci.,or Ci+,with probability         or remain with the same cost with

probability    2-2p. The optimal trigger points associated with each realization                      of ~ =(c,,Y) are shown in

their marginal costs are lower or equal than their trigger points.        Plants with c >3, will remain outside the               ~

export market.     Exporting plants will remain in the market till their cost raise to 4 or more, at which level

they will cease exporting.      Thus, a non-exporting    plant with cs 2 will enter the export market and an

exporting plant with c z 4 will quit exporting (CL= 2 and Cu = 4). Table A 1 fully characterizes                   the

dynamic process followed by the plant.




B.       The Structure of our Simulations

         Our simulations are based on the numerical example presented above. The critical issue is how to

represent the stochastic cost process summarized        by equation (3). Our strategy is to treat costs as

following a first-order Markov process that, in the case of learning, is relatively favorable to exporting

firms. Specifically,     we discretize q into K possible realizations     (c, , . . . . c~ ) and define a transition

matrix POthat governs movements         between the alternative values from one period to the next.                This

matrix is assumed to be band-diagonal:       given a cost q today the plant can move only to neighboring                  costs

c;., or ci+l with probability    or remain with the same cost with probability         I-2p, Note that this

specification    does not allow us to explore the effects of higher order cost processes.          Recall, however,

that, our econometric     tests in section IV do not suffer from this limitation.

         When there is no learning-by-exporting,        the POmatrix described above applies to all firms. But

in the learning case, we let the probability    of obtaining a lower cost next period be relatively large for

exporters .30 We analyze three alternative ways in which the matrix PO changes into the matrix P,, where

PI is stochastically   better than PO. In the first case (learning    model ~, the probability      of moving to a

lower cost level for exporters is p + A, and the probability         of moving to a higher cost level to p - A. The



         30 Duration in the export market or volume of cumulative      exports do not have additional effects.

lowest        cost remain at that cost forever; the other columns of Pl are as in the no-learning             case. This is the

purest instance of technological            catch-up through exporting:       once the best-practice      technology      is

achieved, the catching up is accomplished.                The values we assume for p, A. and other model parameters

are given in Table A2.31

               With the optimal behavioral       rules (A6) and the parameter values in hand, we simulate the

dynamic process followed by a plant. We start form an initial state in period 1, q = (cl, Y.) randomly

selected among the 2K possibilities. 32 The optimal trigger value for this state is obtained from (A6) and

compared to c1. The result from this comparison                   tells us whether or not the plant changes its export status

from that given by YO. This is how Y1 = Y(sl) is determined.                    Assuming that all these decisions are made

at the beginning of period ~ Y, is then the export status of the plant during period 1?3 Czis now randomly

drawn according to the probabilities             in the column of the transition matrix P that corresponds             to q, and Sz

= (c,, Y,) is thus obtained.          Following the same steps as in period 1, Y3 = Y(s2) is generated and so on.

In this fashion, we obtain for each plant a time series of {q, Y,}. For each hypothetical                     plant, we simulate

periods and are left with 11 observations                        on c and Y, For each of the four learning regimes, we repeat                       ?

this process 2,000 times.           The number of observations                          corresponds   approximately    to the number of plants

in our actual (non-simulated)             data and to the typical length of the time-series                      data available for each plant.

          In order to look at the patterns of association between exporting status and costs under our

alternative assumptions            about learning-by-exporting,                        and to facilitate comparison    between simulated and

actual data, we sort trajectories             according to the five varieties of plants described in table 2 in the text.

Next, for each plant were-define                time zero to be the year in which a change in export status takes place,

and isolate seven-year blocks of time, running from three years prior to the status change (t = -3) to three

years after (t= 3)?4 For non-exporters                         and for exporters there is no change in status, so we take the seven

years in the middle of the eleven-years                        period.     Finally, afier re-indexing        time in this manner, we average

the simulated marginal cost data by plant type and plot them against time.35




c.        The Simulations

          Figure Al summarizes                our simulations              for the case of no learning. 36 Note that non-exporters

and exiting firms have higher production                         costs than exporters, but exiting firms maintain a cost advantage

over perpetual non-exporters.                 Without learning effects, producers exit when drawing a c z 4. More

important for our purposes is the constancy of the marginal cost trajectory for entrants after period O,



          34 ~u~     fOr   enmm~     period     o   ~dicates       the   first   yew    expofiing and for exitors it indicates the first Year not
exporting.

         35Since the entry/exit decisions occur in different periods we are averaging costs from different years but
equally distant from the period in which the plant changed export status. Entrants were required to have at least 4
years exporting and 3 years non-exporting while exitors were required to have at least 4 years non-exporting and 3
years exporting.

their entry time. In order to become an exporter, a plant has to draw a cost equal to or below 2 and

                                                                                                                                            ?
selecting plants that eventually enter the export market induces the negative slope in the cost trajectory

prior to period O. After entry, there does not seem to be a significant                          change in production     costs. In

short, the simulations           in figure A 1 reflect the premise of our no-learning                 transition matrix: becoming an

exporter does not have any significant effects on the stochastic cost process:’

           Notice that, given our transition matrices, it typically takes more than one period of declining

costs to reach the entry threshold.                    Hence the negative slope of the cost trajectory for entrants prior to

entry is a consequence                of our grouping criteria and not of learning-effects             or sunk-entry costs?a

           Figures A2. 1-A2.3 show that the main difference between the passive and active model of export

participation         is that entrants continue to lower their costs after entering the export market.                    The pattern of

cost trajectories        for the other types of plants does not change much with the introduction                       of learning

effects.   In particular,        it remains true that exporters have systematically                lower cost than non-exporters,

and exitors experience cost deterioration                     prior to their exit.   Interestingly,     even with learning effects, the

rate of reduction in marginal costs slows when firms become exporters.                                This illusory negative effect of

becoming an exporter is simply a consequence                         of the selectivity effects.      To reach marginal cost levels

low enough to become an exporter, firms must typically experience                             several consecutive     years of cost

reductions.          Table A3 summarizes               the results of the simulations.

of the lingering effects of pre-entry cost reductions.

cost trajectory afier entry reflects the symmetric first-order markov process followed by costs.

          Because the incentives to export increase when learning occurs, the trigger points shifi upwards.

That is, it pays to enter at a higher average cost level in anticipation                  of lower cost due to leaming-by-

exporting and, similarly, it pays to remain an exporters even at higher cost levels. This property of the

model implies that the cross-sectional           distribution     of costs for exporters shifts to the right when leaming-

by-exporting   occurs.     This may well result in higher expected costs for exporting plants when learning

effects are present.     Put differently,   less-efficient       firms tend to enter the export market and remain

exporters for longer periods of time when learning effects prevail .

         Figure 2.2A provides such an example.                  In this case, the entry trigger is ~= 4 and the exit trigger

is Cu= 8. After three years in the export market the average costs is 2.93 while in the no-learning                          model it

equals 2.08. Hence, even though costs decline by 27 percent afier 3 years exporting, the average costs of

exporters relative to the average cost of non-exporters                  is higher when learning-by-exporting          is present. 39

         The message of this example is simply that drawing conclusions about the presence of learning

effects across industries from comparisons             of entrants’ cost levels vis-a-vis the costs of non-exporters




         39 Note also that the average costs of non-exporters is higher when learning occurs.

                                                                   49

may be misleading.      Hence, cross-industry    comparisons     of the productivity   gap between exporters and

non-exporters    tell us nothing about the relative strength of learning effects in different industries.         Put       ~


differently,   in order to discriminate   between explanations    for the export-productivity     relationship,   one has

to examine the dynamic trajectory of costs; a single cross-section         will not do.

A. The Panel Data Sets

           The Colombian       data were obtained from the Departamento            Administrativo    National   de

Estadistica for the period 1981-1991.           They provide annual information        on the inputs, outputs, exports,

and characteristics     of all plants with at least 10 workers.      Similar annual survey data were obtained from

Morocco’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry for the period 1984-1990 and from Mexico’s Instituto

National    de Estadistica Geografia e Inforrnacion         for the period 1984-1990, although the Mexican data

only cover 3200 of the larger firms. Most of the details on the cleaning and deflating of each of these data

bases may be found in the relevant country study chapters of Roberts and Tybout (forthcoming).

However, for our analysis of average costs it was necessary to pay special attention to the deflation of

exports, so additional measures were taken.            Our procedure is summarized        below.




B. Construction        of Export Unit ValuH,          Price hdices   and Average Cost Measures’”

           Trade data for tie the selected sectors for Colombia,          Mexico and Morocco were obtained from

the United Nations Trade Database.             The data are amual     total values and quantities for exports and

imports for the years 1980-1992.            The values are in nominal U.S. dollars, and the data are at the most

disaggregated      level available within the selected sectors.       Disaggregate       export unit values were

constructed      from this data, but could not be used directly in deflating the expoti volumes reported in

the country databases for two reasons.            First, because the countries use industrial classification         systems

that differ from the U.N. system, the classification           systems had to be matched.           Second, the unit values

had to be aggregated        up to the level observable     in the survey data in each country.

         Colombia uses a version of the International        Standard Industrial Classification     System (ISIC),

system at the four digit ISIC level for the industries of interest,       Because a detailed listing of products

in each four digit ISIC is available (United Nations,        1973), this matching is quite accurate.       The

Mexico Industry Classification       System (Censo Industrial      1975, referred    to here as MICS) was matched

to the SITC for those four digit industries within the eight industries of interest that actually appear in

the Mexico data from 1984-90.         This matching is less precise because MICS is ordy available at a

higher level of aggregation       than the SITC.    The Moroccan      Nomenclature     of Industrial Activity

(NMAE) was matched to the SITC at the very disaggregated               six digit level, and the correspondence

should therefore be accurate.

         After the industry classification     systems were matched,      the disaggregated    export unit values had

to be aggregated.       Initially, export unit values were aggregated    across all SITC commodities        contained

in a country-specific     disaggregated    sector (e.g., Colombia four digit ISIC) using as weights actual

export value shares from the country data.         Some of the export unit values for the SITC commodities

showed an unreasonable        amount of variation from year to year, however,          and this persisted in these

initial calculations    of an export unit value for an aggregate     of these commodities.      Because of this, the

export unit values were instrumented         using import unit values.    Three methods of using the import unit

values were considered,       two of which use information     from all countries for which SITC data was

obtained.4’   First, a weighted average of import unit values for each commodity              was calculated using as

weights the actual import value share of each country for each commodity.                Second a weighted average

import unit value was calculated using the average import value share of each country for each




   4[ In addition to data from Colombia,    Mexico and Morocco, Venezuela    trade data was used in instrumenting
export unit values.

commodity,      where the average is taken over the time period for which the data was obtained.                  Third,

for each country,     the import unit values from that particular     country could be used.        Ultimately,     the         z

second method of aggregating            the import unit values was chosen.    The first method using actual shares

was not chosen because the import unit values in each year were greatly influenced by commodities

entering or exiting the unit value aggregation.         The third method using ordy country specific

information     was not used because it ignored valuable information         on unit values from other countries.

         The actual export unit values were regressed on the import unit values calculated using the

second method described           above, yielding fitted values for each disaggregate       SITC commodity.         Two

methods of aggregating       the export unit values for these SITC commodities          to the level observable      in the

country databases were considered.           The fitted export unit values could be aggregated       using either

country-specific    actual export value shares or average shares over time from the SITC data.               The latter

method was chosen, again to elimimte            the effect on the unit values of changes in the commodity

composition     of the sectors.

         These instrumented         export unit values were in nominal U.S. dollars, and had to be converted               to

domestic currency units before they could be used for deflating export values reported in the country

databases.    This required nominal exchange rate indices and a U.S. price index.              The U.S. producer

price index for consumer goods reported in International           Financial Statistics was used to convert to real

U.S. dollars.      For each country,      the annual average nominal exchange rate between the domestic

currency and the US dollar reported in various issues of Intematioml             Fimncial    Statistics was used to

convert the export unit values in real U.S. dollars to domestic currency units.

         Country specific output price indices were constructed,          where possible, using the survey data,

or in some cases using other information          provided by the respective countries.      The Colombia database

contains data on both nominal and real total value of production          for each plant.     The ratio of nominal to

real value of production is the implicit output price deflator, and this is sector specific at the three digit

SIC level. There is some unexplained variation in the three digit price index across plants within an                 ‘

industry, so the mean price index across plants in an industry is used as the output price index.           Several

plants are deleted from the calculation of the mean price index in particular years because their implicit

price index as calculated from the survey data is far from the industry average in a particular year. A

broad based output price index for Colombia       was constructed   as a weighted average of the sectoral

output price indices, where the weights are sectoral shares of total real value of production.

        For Morocco,       the sectoral domestic output price index is taken from various years of the

Moroccan     Statistical Bulletin.   A broad based domestic output price index was constructed       as a

weighted average of the sectoral output price index, using sectoral shares of total manufacturing

production   as weights.

                There are two complications                    involved in estimation.                  The first is that the error components

  az and al,             are unobserved,                  so they cannot be conditioned                 upon in estimation.        The second derives

from the fact that lagged endogenous                            variables appear in both Z, and Zz,. To deal with the first problem,

we assume a bivariate normal distribution                            for the error components                   , ~(a,, aZ) , and integrate them

out!z To deal with the second problem, we follow Heckman’s(1981                                                  ) suggestion of adding equations to

Gaussian quadrature. See Sullivan (1995) for details.
