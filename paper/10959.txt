                                           ABSTRACT

The two models of international trade with developed factor markets -- Heckscher-Ohlin and

Specific Factors -- both suffer significant defects. For example, their predictions about the patterns

of domestic production and international trade are for the most part either indeterminate or uselessly

complex. The problem with these models is that the supply of factors to an industry is either

perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic. Using a model in which heterogeneous workers sort across

industries we eliminate this problem. The result is a multi-good model with sharp predictions about

(1) the domestic pattern of production, (2) North-North and North-South trade, (3) the demand for

protection, (4) the determinants of domestic income distribution, and (5) the effect of trade on

economic development.

1. Introduction

The two models of international trade with developed factor markets – Heckscher-Ohlin

and Speci…c Factors –both su¤er signi…cant defects. For example, their predictions about

the patterns of domestic production and international trade are unsatisfying. Except in

the case of two goods and two factors, Heckscher-Ohlin production and trade patterns are

either indeterminate or uselessly complex. In the Speci…c Factors model, these patterns have

little intuitive appeal (Jones and Neary, 1984, page 24). For another example, the Speci…c

Factors model was developed in order to explain why industries rather than factors lobby

for protection (Mayer, 1974; Mussa, 1974). Unfortunately, the explanation is driven entirely

by the deus ex machina assumption of immobile factors. This raises questions about what

economic process generates the cross-industry distribution of immobile factors and why the

immobility itself is not explained by the theory (Leamer, 1980; Grossman, 1983).

       We show that these problems stem from the extreme assumption that factors are either

perfectly mobile across industries or perfectly immobile. To avoid this problem we model

labour markets using the Heckman and Sedlacek (1985) variant of the Roy (1950, 1951)

model which describes the sorting behaviour of heterogenous workers endowed with two

attributes e.g., problem-solving and communication skills.1 Workers sort across industries

based on Ricardian comparative advantage. Industries di¤er by skill requirements and each

worker sorts into the industry that pays the most for her particular bundle of skills. As

a result, each heterogeneous worker has a preference for a particular industry because the

   1
     Leamer (1999), Grossman and Maggi (2000) and Grossman (2004) o¤er very interesting trade models
featuring worker sorting, but the sorting and hence the predictions are very di¤erent from our own. This
will become clear shortly.



                                                   2
next best alternative industry pays discretely less. Further, heterogeneity of workers means

that even within an industry some workers are less productive and hence less well paid than

others. These least productive workers will be the …rst to switch out of the industry should

…rms in the industry lower wages. This makes each industry’s partial equilibrium supply of

labour slope upwards. Restated, unlike the Heckscher-Ohlin and Speci…c Factors models,

factors are neither perfectly mobile nor perfectly immobile and the degree of mobility is

generated endogenously.

   This simple alternative to the Heckscher-Ohlin and Speci…c Factors models leads to

…ve important results. First, we obtain a complete generalization of the Rybczynski and

Heckscher-Ohlin theorems for the case of arbitrarily many industries. Partial mobility is the

key to this remarkable result since it implies that industry supply functions are continuous

and upward sloping. In contrast, in the Heckscher-Ohlin and Ricardian models industry

supply is discontinuous and in…nitely elastic where price equals average cost. In the Spe-

ci…c Factors model the arti…ce of exogenous speci…city makes industry supply continuous

and upward sloping, but this comes at a cost: the patterns of domestic production and

international trade have little intuitive appeal. Further, the patterns depend heavily on the

cross-industry distribution of speci…c factors, a distribution that is exogenous and for which

little intuition is available.

   Second, partial mobility leads to new predictions about the political economy of pro-

tection. A worker who is a very good …t with the industry is endogenously immobile and

demands protection for her industry. A worker who is only a modestly good …t with the

industry is endogenously more mobile and will support protection for all industries that



                                              3
intensively use her type. The tension between the ‘long-run’Stolper-Samuelson prediction

about factor-based lobbying and the ‘short-run’speci…c factors prediction about industry-

based lobbying is eliminated. Leamer (1980) and Grossman (1983) were the …rst to recognize

and deal with this tension. However, our resolution improves considerably on this earlier

research by eliminating the need for exogenous mobility costs.

   Third, while the e¤ects on trade of international di¤erences in average endowments are

well known, nothing is known about the e¤ects of other moments of the distribution of

worker types. For example, since average endowments per capita are similar across rich

countries it is often argued that the distribution of endowments cannot explain North-

North trade. However, it is also often argued that di¤erences between Japanese and U.S.

workers in‡uence production patterns and comparative advantage. For example, Japanese

comparative advantage in goods involving long chains of production and requiring reliability

is often ascribed to a more uniform distribution of such skills as e¤ective communication

in worker circles. We model this in terms of higher moments of the distribution of worker

characteristics. The idea that higher moments matter was put forward by Grossman and

Maggi (2000) and Grossman (2004). We extend their insights using a very di¤erent model

of labour markets.

   Fourth, our model easily handles international technology di¤erences without requiring

it. Countries that use older vintages of technology survive by skimming the cream, that

is, by operating at a smaller level of output and employing only those few workers whose

skills are almost a perfect match for older-vintage technologies. While almost perfect, these

matches are less productive and less well paying than rich-country matches of workers to



                                             4
new-vintage technologies. This is an essential observation for development economics where

the international coexistence of old and new technologies has long been highlighted (Pack,

1984).

   Fifth, the predictions of the model do not require factor price equalization. Worker

earnings can di¤er across countries and will di¤er within industries because of di¤erences

in worker skills. As a result, we are able to develop the rich predictions about inequality

associated with the Roy model. We discuss within-group inequality and within-industry

inequality and then investigate the impact of trade and skill-biased technical change on

these inequality measures.

   The model we will be presenting is most closely related to the international trade model

of Leamer (1999). Leamer considers a model with sorting based on a single worker character-

istic, namely e¤ort. E¤ort complements capital which leads to worker sorting. Introducing a

second worker characteristic, as we do, leads to additional and important predictions about

production, trade, earnings and inequality.

   Our work on North-North trade is strongly in‡uenced by Grossman and Maggi (2000)

and Grossman (2004) though the mechanisms are di¤erent. In Grossman and Maggi (2000)

machines are produced in long chains of production involving many workers. The machine

is reliable only if each worker’s input is reliable. This ‘supermodularity’ means that in

equilibrium each hired worker will have a minimum level of talent. In contrast, software

output depends on the input of the most talented worker. This ‘submodularity’ means

that one hired worker will be highly talented and the remaining workers untalented. The

main prediction is that the country with the greater dispersion in worker talents will have



                                              5
a comparative advantage in software. In our model there is no teamwork between workers,

but there is ‘teamwork’between the two attributes that a worker brings to the workplace.

This leads to our section 5 trade-and-dispersion result. In Grossman (2004), machinery

requires teamwork and software does not. Teamwork is subject to costly monitoring and

incomplete contracting, which encourages talented workers to sort into software. Trade

leads the country with greater dispersion in talent to increase software production. This

resolves the contracting problem for talented workers, thus raising inequality. In contrast,

our section 5 inequality-and-dispersion result is driven by sorting rather than incomplete

contracting.

   Our research is also related to an excellent paper by Ru¢ n (1999) who uses Rosen’s

(1978) model of two-factor sorting to explain away the tension between the political economy

predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin and Speci…c Factors models. However, in his model

worker heterogeneity is not enough to explain away the tension. His argument relies critically

on allowing capital to be perfectly mobile across industries, something we will not need or

want: worker heterogeneity even without any capital accomplishes the same end in a crystal

clear way. This last point indicates that our work is related to Melitz (2003) who uses …rm

heterogeneity to generate an upward-sloping supply of …rms into export markets.

   The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2-3 set up the model. Sections 4-6 develop

multi-good Rybczynski, Heckscher-Ohlin, and income distribution theorems for higher-order

moments of the distribution of endowments. Sections 7-9 describe the implications of the

model for political economy, international technology di¤erences and domestic income in-

equality.

2. The Model

Each worker brings two attributes to the workplace, h and l. While human capital and

brawn are obvious and familiar attributes, in describing trade among rich countries we also

have in mind subtler attributes such as problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and

team-work skills. A type (h; l) worker employed in industry i produces a task level of ti (h; l).

Each worker chooses the industry that pays the most for her attributes. This leads to worker

sorting based on the standard logic of Ricardian comparative advantage.2

       An employer cannot unbundle a worker’s attributes and thus cares only about ti (h; l).

This ‘bundling’assumption is the core assumption of a large class of Roy-like (1950; 1951)

models. The particular formulation used here is due to Heckman and Sedlacek (1985).3

       For simplicity we make two assumptions which together ensure that a worker’s marginal

product is log-linear in h and l. First, we assume that industry output Yi is the sum of the

tasks performed by workers in the industry. Mathematically, if industry i employs a set of

workers whose attributes (h; l) lie in a set                     h      l   then output is


                                                Z       Z
                                     Y i = Ai                   ti (h; l) fhl (h; l) dl dh                              (1)
                                                    h       l




where fhl (h; l) is the measure or number of (h; l) types in the economy and where Ai is a

Hicks-neutral technology parameter. The linearity of output in worker tasks is the standard

   2
      The logic is usually stated as follows. With two industries and two workers types (h; l) and (h0 ; l0 ),
t1 (h; l)=t2 (h; l) > t1 (h0 ; l0 )=t2 (h0 ; l0 ) implies that the (h; l) type sorts into industry 1 and the (h0 ; l0 ) type
sorts into industry 2. This Ricardian sorting mechanism is fundamental to our model. We repeat it here
only because it will be harder to see once more structure is added to the model.

(1987), Bartel and Sicherman (1999) and especially Rosen (1978) and Heckman and Honoré (1990).




                                                                  7
simpli…cation in the sorting literature because it implies that a worker’s marginal product is

independent of the characteristics of other workers in the industry e.g., Heckman and Sed-

lacek (1985). Notice that we have no other inputs such as capital. These can be introduced

but add no additional insights. Given equation (1), the log earnings of a type (h; l) worker

is

                                    wi (h; l) = ln qi + ln Ai + ln ti (h; l)


where qi is the producer price.

         Second, we assume that the task function is log-linear: ti (h; l)          h i l1   i   . Without loss

of generality, we rank industries such that            i   is increasing in i. In this way, i indexes the

h-intensity of the industry. This is needed for Heckscher-Ohlin-style predictions.4

         Under these two assumptions, equilibrium with sorting is easily characterized. To facil-

itate this, de…ne



                       L    ln l;     S     ln(h=l);        and      pi    ln qi + ln Ai :                  (2)

     4
    While the production function (1) and the task function ti are uncomfortably restrictive, they are more
general than what has been used in the sorting literature. One can distinguish three types of sorting models
based on the number of worker types and the number of industries.

     1. In models with a continuum of industries, there is perfect sorting so that all workers in an industry
        are the same in key aspects e.g., Sattinger (1975) and Teulings (1995). This allows one to generalize
        the industry production function. However, the continuum-of-industries assumption is useless here
        because it is precisely the heterogeneity of workers within each industry that interests us.
     2. In models with only 2 industries, one can always rede…ne or ‘rotate’attributes so that only one factor
        is used in each industry e.g., Heckman and Honoré (1990) and Ru¢ n (1999). In our setting, this is
        equivalent to setting 1 = 0 and 2 = 1. Since we allow for n > 2, such rotation is not possible and
        our approach is clearly more general.
     3. In the remaining models (2 < n < 1), either there is a …nite number of worker types or a Leontief
        production assumption e.g., Rosen (1978). Again, our production function is more general than this
        and the generality is substantive.




                                                       8
Then ln ti = L +      i Si   and the log earnings of a type (S; L) worker employed in industry i is

given by

                                          wi (S; L) = pi + L +          i S.                                    (3)


Sorting is illustrated in …gure 1 which plots wi (S; L)                  L = pi +     iS   against S. The …gure

plots these earnings pro…les for industries i               1, i, and i + 1. A worker with an S between

Si   1   and Si chooses industry i. Si satis…es pi +          i Si    = pi+1 +   i+1 Si   i.e., worker type (Si ; L)

earns the same in industries i and i + 1. Thus, the sorting rule is



                                     Choose i       ,       Si   1    < S < Si                                  (4)

     As drawn in …gure 1, the line for industry i lies above the intersection of the lines for

industries i      1 and i + 1. This ensures that the Si are increasing in i; as we have implicitly

assumed in equation (4). If this is not the case then no worker chooses industry i and

industry i has no domestic employment. It is therefore convenient to let i = 1; :::; n index

industries with positive domestic employment. Then the Si are increasing in i.

     Figure 1 highlights a key feature of the model. Suppose …rms in industry i o¤er slightly

higher earnings so that the wi (S; L)            L pro…le shifts up. Then industry i …rms will attract

slightly more workers (those with S near either Si                1   or Si ). That is, the partial equilibrium

supply of workers to the industry is upward sloping. This di¤ers from the Heckscher-Ohlin

and Speci…c Factors models. In the former, a slight rise in industry wages attracts an in…nite

supply of workers. In the latter, a slight rise in industry wages attracts either an in…nite

supply or no additional supply depending on whether labour is the mobile or immobile

factor. Our model lies in between these extremes.

       Note also that an upward-sloping supply of workers will imply an upward-sloping indus-

try supply function. This does not appear in the Heckscher-Ohlin model (except via general

equilibrium feedbacks) and appears in the Speci…c Factors model only through the deus ex

machina of an exogenous …xed factor.5

   5
     The fact that an employer cannot unbundle a worker’s attributes and thus cares only about ti (h; l)
is important for generating an upward-sloping supply of workers. Indeed, bundling is a standard sorting-
literature device for inducing upward-sloping supplies. Further, upward-sloping supplies are often taken as
evidence in favour of the bundling hypothesis. More formal evidence from structural econometric models

for output Yi . From equation (2), ti = h i l1                i   = (h=l) i l = exp( i S + L). Let fSL (S; L) be

the measure or number of type (S; L) workers in the economy.6 Then

    Turning to the de…nition of equilibrium, labour market equilibrium is described by a set

of earnings functions wi (S; L) ; i = 1; :::; n that satisfy pro…t-maximizing demand for tasks

(equation 3) and earnings-maximizing supply of tasks (equation 4). Product markets are

perfectly competitive and equilibrium in product markets is described by a set of producer

prices q1 ; : : : qn . We will sometimes discuss the determination of the qi , especially when

comparing autarky with free trade. At other times we will take the qi to be exogenous. This

is in keeping with a small open economy facing exogenous world product prices and trade

costs.

    For some of the results of this paper we will need to make an assumption about fSL (S; L).

Since there are no scale e¤ects in the economy we take fSL to be a density function i.e., a

positive function that integrates to unity. We follow the time-honoured tradition in the Roy

can be found in Willis and Rosen (1979), Heckman and Sedlacek (1985), Heckman and Scheinkman (1987),
and Bartel and Sicherman (1999).
   If workers can unbundle their h and l and take them to di¤erent industries then we are in a Heckscher-
Ohlin world. If they must take their h and l to the same industry, but …rms can unbundle workers’h and
l (i.e., the …rm only cares about the aggregate amounts of h and l that are hired) then we are almost in a
Heckscher-Ohlin world, though now both countries and …rms must be in the factor price equalization set.
This point is developed in a debate between Welch (1969) and Rosen (1983).

  is the correlation between S and L.              and    L   are not particularly interesting parameters

so that we almost always set them to unity. All results in this paper hold for the general

case of      6= 1 and     L   6= 1: This is explicitly shown in the appendix proofs where we do

not restrict    or   L.   Appendix C gives an expression for output under the assumption of

normality.



3. The Role of Two Attributes: Income Distribution

The obvious thing about …gure 1 is that workers are sorting based on the single attribute S

just as in Leamer (1999). What then is the role of two attributes? It turns out that both

attributes are needed to discuss production, earnings, and earnings inequality. In particular,

  is crucial. To see this recall that under normality the expectation of L given S is



                                            E (LjS) = (S                 ):                           (8)



From this and equation (3), the average log wages of type S workers who have sorted into

industry i is

                                  E ( wi (S; L) j S ) = pi           +(       i   + )S:               (9)


The top panel of …gure 2 plots E (LjS) against S and plots a contour line for fSL (S; L) for

industries. This wage pro…le is piecewise linear with slope       i+   on S 2 (Si 1 ; Si ). The   and

  terms correspond to productivity and two-attribute sorting e¤ects, respectively. Holding

L constant, @wi (S; L)=@S = @ ln ti (S; L)=@S =         i.   That is, workers with more S produce

more ti and hence earn more. This is the productivity e¤ect. Further, @E (Lj S) =@S =

i.e., the average amount of L that an S type has depends on . If            is negative then higher

S is associated with lower L and hence with lower productivity and earnings. This is the

two-attribute sorting e¤ect.

      Figure 2 displays the case where            1   +   <0<     2   +   so that the two-attribute sorting

e¤ect dominates in industry 1 and the productivity e¤ect dominates in industry 2. More

generally, the average earnings pro…le illustrated in …gure 2 can be downward sloping, V-

shaped, or upward sloping. The message to be taken from this is that while S determines

worker sorting, it does not determine the amount of the other productive asset L that

workers bring to the workplace. Thus, S alone does not determine output, earnings, or

inequality.



4. Have and Have-Not Economies ( )

The next three sections describe the role of the distribution of endowments for the patterns

of production and trade. We start with . An economy with a high positive value of                      is a

‘have and have-not’economy. Workers either have a lot of both S and L or have very little of

both S and L. International di¤erences in                 are readily explained by a host of international

di¤erences in institutions and policies. For example, Sweden has a strong institutional bias

towards redistribution and extensive social policies involving early childhood interventions

which ensure that each worker obtains at least one marketable attribute.7 In contrast, in

the United States where these institutions and policies are muted, the acquisition of S and

L are more highly correlated because acquisition is driven by causes such as parental income

that a¤ect both S and L. This is consistent with evidence that intergenerational mobility

is lower in the United States than in countries such as Sweden and Canada (Björklund and

Jänti 1997; Blanden 2004). See Solon (2002) for a survey. Thus it is of interest to assume

that the Swedish      is smaller than the U.S. . We now investigate the implications of this

for the patterns of production and trade.


4.1. Production: Rybczynski Revisited


To get the ‡avour of things, let’s return to the 2-industry example of …gure 2. The …gure

is reproduced on the right side of …gure 3. The left side illustrates the case of        > 0. A

rise in    causes E (Lj S) = (S         ) to pivot around the point ( ; 0). To keep …gure 3

simple, we have drawn it for the case where S1 =          . Note that the rise in       does not

alter the sorting rule S1 . (See equation 5.) The bottom panels of …gure 3 plot E (wi j S).

Since E (ln ti j S) = E (wi j S)   pi , the bottom-panel wage pro…les are similar to the output

pro…les.

   As      rises the average level of L falls for workers with endowment S < S1 so that the

average level of output Y1 falls. For workers with endowment S > S1 , the opposite is true so

that Y2 rises. This is a Rybczynski-style result: as   rises, Y2 rises relative to Y1 . Rybczynski

results typically hold in clear form only when there are two industries. A remarkable feature

of our …gure 3 result is that it holds for any number of industries.


Theorem 1. d(Yi =Yi 1 )=d > 0 for i = 1; 2; : : : ; n. That is, an increase in the correla-

tion between S and L increases the output of S-intensive industries relative to L-intensive

industries.

be used repeatedly.

      If this is not clear see the precise mathematical statement in appendix equation (18).

Si   1    < Ei ( ) < Si .


Proof of Lemma 1: Si                 1        x < S < Si               x implies Si       1   < S + x < Si . Hence

Si   1    < Ei ( ) < Si . Likewise, Si        2   < Ei 1 ( ) < S i     1   so that Ei 1 ( ) < Si 1 .


Proof of Theorem 1: As shown in appendix D, di¤erentiation of Yi with respect to

yields
                                                  d ln Yi
                                                          = Ei (   i   + )       .                                    (11)
                                                    d

Hence d ln(Yi =Yi 1 )=d = Ei (            i   + )       Ei 1 (   i 1   + ). From lemma 1, Ei (         i   + ) > Si   1   >

Ei 1 (        i 1   + ) for i > 1 so that d ln(Yi =Yi 1 )=d > 0.

         As     rises, Yi rises relative to Yi 1 . It would be nice to add to this the existence of

an industry i such that all industries i > i expand and all industries i                                   i contract. A

su¢ cient condition for this is S1 <                   < Sn 1 .9 With many industries so that industries 1

and n are small (i.e., S1 is a large negative number and Sn                           1   is a large positive number)

this condition will be satis…ed.


4.2. Trade: Heckscher-Ohlin Revisited


In this section we consider trade patterns between two economies that di¤er only in terms

of . The conventional wisdom is that the similarity of endowments among Northern coun-

tries makes the Heckscher-Ohlin model irrelevant for describing North-North trade. Recent

     9
    From lemma 1 and equation (11), Si 1 < d ln Yi =d + = Ei < Si . Hence d ln Y1 =d < S1               which
is negative for S1 < . Further, d ln Yn =d > Sn 1         which is positive for Sn 1 > . Since d ln Yi =d
switches signs between i = 1 and i = n and is increasing in i there must exist an i such that d ln Yi =d > 0
,i>i .



                                                              17
research suggests otherwise by pointing out that North-North trade is partly driven by sub-

tle di¤erence among Northern workforces in such dimensions as communication skills and

team-work. For example, consider studies of workplace change involving new technologies

combined with new forms of work organization such as team production, statistical process

control, and total quality management. As Osterman (1995) points out, the most strik-

ing assessments of the productivity bene…ts of such workplace innovations are studies that

contrast U.S. and foreign …rms. There are two studies that will be known to economists.

Bailey and Gersbach (1995) demonstrate that communication and team skills, in additional

to technical skills, are much more important in German enterprises than in American enter-

prises. This results in a German comparative advantage in products involving long chains of

production. Murnane and Levy (1996) review di¤erences in the worker screening practices

of U.S.-owned versus Japanese-owned auto plants located in the United States. Japanese

interviewers focus on the ability to solve problems in changing environments, the ability

to work in groups, and the ability to communicate e¤ectively. Murnane and Levy (1996)

then show that Japanese screening for these skills translates into higher productivity. These

studies demonstrate that subtle di¤erences in workers’skills are important for productivity

and hence for comparative advantage.

       To model this we begin by establishing that when there are only two industries, the low-

economy has a higher autarky price of good 2 (relative to good 1) and hence a comparative

advantage in the L-intensive industry 2.10 Assume that preferences are homothetic and

identical internationally. Also assume that the economies are identical except for di¤erences

  10
    With more than two industries, we know that strong comparative advantage theorems do not hold and
indeed comparative advantage is di¢ cult to de…ne e.g., Dixit and Norman (1980, page 6).



                                                 18
in . It follows from theorem 1 that in autarky the low- economy will have a low Y2 =Y1

and hence a high relative price of good 2 (a high ln q2            ln q1 ). The opening up of trade will

lower ln q2    ln q1 . Since pi      ln(qi Ai ), the opening up of trade will lower p2        p1 and, from

equation (5), raise S1 . The rise in S1 leads to an expansion of industry 1 and a contraction

of industry 2. Further, the lower ln q2         ln q1 raises consumer demand for industry 2 relative

to industry 1 so that in equilibrium, the low- economy exports good 1 and imports good

2. That is, we obtain the standard comparative advantage results.

       We turn next to a trade theorem for the multi-industry case. We make the usual

Heckscher-Ohlin similarity assumptions.


Assumption 1. (i) Preferences are homothetic and identical internationally. (ii) Technol-

ogy parameters Ai and         i   are identical internationally. (iii) Consumers in all countries face

the same prices qi . (iv) Trade is balanced.


Theorem 2. Let assumption 1 hold. Also assume that the distribution of endowments

fSL (S; L) is the same internationally except that the correlation             between S and L is larger

at home than abroad. Then there exists a unique industry i < n such that the home

country exports all relatively S-intensive commodities (i > i ) and imports all relatively

L-intensive commodities (i           i ).


The proof is simple and appears in appendix E.11

       The Heckscher-Ohlin theorem predicts trade based on levels of S and L. Theorem

2 predicts trade based on a higher moment of the distribution of endowments. Also, in

  11
    If i > 1 then it is possible that the imports of industry i are 0, but this requires a very particular set
of parameter values.


                                                     19
contrast to the Heckscher-Ohlin model our production and trade predictions are determinate

and easily described even when there are more than two goods.


4.3. Earnings and Inequality


We have already seen in the bottom panels of …gure 3 that as                     rises average earnings

fall in L-intensive industries (i        i ) and rise in S-intensive industries (i         i ). This is a

general result. From equations (9) and (10), E wi (S; L)jSi            1   < S < S i = pi +      i   +(   i+


 )E(S jSi    1   < S < Si ) is linear in . Hence



             dE wi (S; L)jSi      1   < S < Si
                                                 = E S j Si      1   < S < Si       Ei ( 0 ) :
                          d

This implies that as          rises average earnings fall in L-intensive industries and rise in S-

intensive industries.12 Thus, when comparing Sweden with the United States, the high-

  U.S. economy will have higher average wages in S-intensive industries as compared to

Sweden. The U.S. will also have lower average wages in L-intensive industries as compared

to Sweden.

    We next turn to inequality. Our model has a lot to say about within-industry inequality

as measured by the variance of log earnings within an industry. To keep the notation

simple, let V ( wi (S; L) j i ) be the variance of wages conditional on choosing industry i (that

is, conditional on Si    1   < S < Si ). From appendix equation (26), this is just

  12
     This follows from two facts. First, by lemma 1 the derivative is increasing in i. Second,
E (S jS0 < S < S1 ) = E (S jS < S1 ) < E(S ) = 0 and E S jSn 1 < S < Sn = E S jSn 1 < S >
E (S ) = 0 so that the derivative is negative for i below some cut-o¤ and positive for i above that cut-o¤.




                                                    20

                          V ( wi (S; L) j i ) = 1         +(   i   + )2 V ( S j i ) :


                   2
The term 1             is the within-group variance where ‘group’is de…ned as the set of workers

with the same S. (         i   + )2 V ( S j i ) is the between-group variance.13 Thus a rise in

has within-group and between-group e¤ects on inequality. In the case where                       < 0 and

 i   +     > 0 for all i, the within- and between-group e¤ects move in the same direction.

The high- economy will have higher within-group, between-group, and within-industry

inequality in all industries.

       Much of the empirical work on trade and wages has focussed on between-group inequality

e.g., production-nonproduction worker wage di¤erentials. When                    > 0, as it most certainly

is in the United States, between-group inequality is rising in .

       One conclusion that emerges from this section is the care that is needed in isolating the

e¤ects of trade on inequality.        determines both the pattern of trade and the level of earnings

inequality. A      that is higher in the United States than in Sweden causes both U.S.-Swedish

trade and higher between-group inequality in the United States than in Sweden. In trying

to assess the impact of trade on inequality in cross-country studies one must therefore be

very careful to ensure that the correlation between trade and inequality is not being driven

by a third, unobserved factor, namely .

  13
    At the risk of some di¢ cult but obvious notation, the standard within-between decomposition may be
written as
                  V ( wi (S; L) j i ) = E [ V ( wi (S; L)j S) j i ] + V [ E ( wi (S; L) j S) j i ] :
where the …rst and second terms on the right are the within-group and between-group variances, respectively.

5. Endowment inequality

We next turn to the role of endowment inequality. Consider two economies, one of which has

more mass in the tails of its bivariate density fSL (S; L) and hence has more individuals with

extreme values of either S or L. This will have implications for trade ‡ows and inequality

that are related to those discussed in Grossman and Maggi (2000) and Grossman (2004).

As noted in the introduction, our trade mechanism is related to the Grossman and Maggi

(2000) supermodularity mechanism and our inequality mechanism is very di¤erent from the

Grossman (2004) incomplete-contracts mechanism. To focus ideas consider …rst a simple

example with 3 goods: movies, information technologies, and machinery. The production of

Hollywood ‡icks is intensive in creativity L and the production of Silicon Valley information

technologies is intensive in numericity S. In contrast, machinery is an ‘O-Ring’reliable good

whose production involves many components and whose overall reliability is the reliability

of the least reliable component. Reliability therefore depends on a mix of worker skills in the

sense of requiring both L and S. If, say, the United States has a more unequal distribution

of endowments than Germany, then the United States will export movies and information

technologies to Germany and Germany will export machinery to the United States.

   Formalizing this is tricky because there is no good de…nition of ‘greater inequality’for bi-

variate distributions. We proceed by de…ning a form of mean-preserving spread for bivariate

distributions. To ease notation we have been setting the variance of S ( ) and the variance

of L (   L)   to unity. In this section we reintroduce     and   L   explicitly. We de…ne a bivariate

mean-preserving spread as an increase in       and    L   that does not change means E(S)        and

E(L)      0 or conditional means E (Lj S)         L (S       )= and E (Sj L)        +    (L   0)=   L.

of endowment inequality and let ( ) and            L(    ) be increasing unit-elastic functions so that

d ln( =   L )=d ln   = 0. Then an increase in            raises variances    and   L   without a¤ecting

means or conditional means. We associate an increase in endowment inequality with an

increase in .14


5.1. Production: Rybczynski Revisited


An increase in       has no e¤ect on the sorting rule (the Si ) nor our diagrams. All that

an increase in       does is redistribute the mass of fSL away from its middle towards its

tails. Therefore, the most L-intensive and S-intensive industries attract more workers and

experience a relative rise in output.


Theorem 3. Consider an increase in endowment inequality . There exists a generically

unique industry i with i < n and with the following properties.


 (1) Consider two L-intensive industries i.e., industries with i               i . Then as inequality

       rises, the more L-intensive of the two industries experiences a relative increase in

       output: d(Yi 1 =Yi )=d > 0 for all i        i .


 (2) Consider two S-intensive industries i.e., industries with i > i . Then as inequality

       rises, the more S-intensive of the two industries experiences a relative increase in

       output: d(Yi =Yi 1 )=d > 0 for all i        i + 1.

tion of second-order stochastic dominance, which they use to measure bivariate inequality.

integer constraint and let i be the industry for which Si = 0.

    Consider part (1) of the theorem where i                                i so that Si         1   < Si            0. In this case,

the equation (12) condition Si                1    x < S < Si                   x implies Si         1   < S + x < Si < 0 or

Si 2 < (S + x)2 < Si 21 . Further, this is true for all x. Restated, Si 2 < E2i ( ) < Si 21 .

It follows that E2i ( ) < Si 21 < E2i 1 ( ). Thus, d ln(Yi 1 =Yi )=d ln                                  = E2i 1 (       i 1   +   L)


E2i (   i   +   L)   > 0.

    Now consider part (2) of the theorem where i                                 i + 2 so that 0                Si   2   < Si 2 1 < Si .

In this case, Si      1     x < S < Si             x implies Si 21 < (S + x)2 < Si 2 . Further, this is true

for all x. Restated, Si 21 < E2i ( ) < Si 2 . It follows that E2i 1 ( ) < Si 21 < E2i ( ). Thus,

d ln(Yi =Yi 1 )=d ln        = E2i (   i   +       L)       E2i 1 (   i 1    +      L)   > 0.

       Finally, consider part (2) of the theorem where i = i + 1. If E2i +1 (              i +1   +   L)   >

E2i (    i   +   L)   then d ln(Yi   +1 =Yi   )=d ln    > 0 and we are done. If E2i +1 (   i +1   +   L)   <

E2i (    i   +   L)   then d ln(Yi 1 =Yi )=d ln        > 0 for i = i + 1 and the proof follows with i

replaced by i + 1 in the statement of the theorem.15



5.2. Trade: Heckscher-Ohlin Revisited


North-North trade is left unexplained by the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model because aver-

age levels of endowments are similar across industrialized countries. Industrialized countries,

however, di¤er in the inequality with which endowments are distributed. Theorem 3 shows

that international di¤erences in Northern production patterns can be driven by endowment

inequality. This has immediate implications for trade.

       First consider a comparison of autarky with free trade. Let assumption 1 hold and

suppose that there are only two countries, A and B, with country A having the higher level

of endowment inequality . Theorem 3 implies that in autarky country A produces more of

the most L- and S-intensive goods than does country B. Hence A has a lower relative price

for these goods than does B. Hence, country A’s comparative advantage lies with the most

L- and S-intensive goods and A exports these goods while importing moderately L- and

S-intensive goods. Restated, endowment inequality is a source of comparative advantage

for L- and S-intensive goods.

       To formalize this we will need i in theorem 3 to be greater than 1 so that there is at

  15
    If E2i +1 ( i +1 + L ) = E2i ( i + L ) then theorem 3 holds both for i and i + 1. This means
that i is not unique and that d ln(Yi +1 =Yi )=d ln = 0, both of which violate the theorem. However,
for almost all parameters (i.e., generically), E2i +1 ( i +1 + L ) 6= E2i ( i + L ). It follows that i is
generically unique and that d ln(Yi +1 =Yi )=d ln > 0 generically.


                                                         25
least one extremely L-intensive industry (i = 1).


Theorem 4. Let assumption 1 hold and assume that i > 1. Also assume that the distrib-

ution of endowments is more unequal in the home country than in the rest of the world i.e.,

the home country has a larger        than the rest of the world. Then there exist two industries

i and i (with 1         i < i        n ) such that the home country imports all goods i with

i < i < i and exports all other goods. That is, the home country exports all goods that

are either extremely L-intensive (i      i ) or extremely S-intensive (i   i ).


The proof is relegated to appendix G.

   Theorem 4 demonstrates that di¤erences in endowment inequality provide a coherent

account of trade between rich countries. To return to our example above, the United States

has greater endowment inequality than Germany. As a result, the United States has a

comparative advantage in Hollywood ‡icks, which intensively use creativity L. The United

States also has a comparative advantage in Silicon Valley information technologies, which

intensively use numericity S. On the other hand, Germany has a comparative advantage in

machinery and other ‘O-ring’reliable goods produced using long chains of production and

for which each link requires moderate levels of both S and L in order to ensure reliability.

   Our model also provides implications for inequality. We state without proof that the

country with greater endowment inequality will have greater within-industry inequality

V ( wi (S; L) j i ) in all industries.




                                                26
6. Average endowments

We …nish up our discussion of endowments and trade with the role of the average level of

endowments. This is a standard Heckscher-Ohlin exercise. Intuitively, a country with a

high average S per worker (i.e., a high ) should have production patterns that are skewed

towards S-intensive goods. This in turn should lead the country to export S-intensive goods.


Theorem 5. d (Yi =Yi 1 ) =d    > 0 for i > 1: That is, an increase in the mean level of S

increases the relative output of S-intensive industries.


Proof of Theorem 5: As shown in appendix H, di¤erentiation of Yi with respect to

yields
                                   d ln Yi
                                           = Ei (   i   + )                             (14)
                                     d

where Ei is de…ned in lemma 1. Hence lemma 1 establishes that d ln Yi =d ln     is increasing

in i.


    As in the discussion following theorem 1, if there are many small industries then there

will be an industry i such that output expands for the most S-intensive industries (i     i )

and contracts for the most L-intensive industries (i < i ). Note that i is the same industry

as the i industry in theorems 1 and 2.

    The Rybczynski theorem 5 has immediate implications for trade ‡ows.


Theorem 6. Let assumption 1 hold. Also assume that the home country is more S-

abundant than the foreign country in the sense of having a larger      . Then there exists

a unique industry i > 1 such that the home country exports all relatively S-intensive

commodities i    i and imports all relatively L-intensive commodities i < i .

                                              27
See appendix I for the proof.

      This is our counterpart to the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. Note that we have obtained it

without reference to the number of goods, cones of diversi…cation or factor price equalization.



7. The Political Economy of Protection

Although workers can move costlessly from industry to industry, our labour market does not

behave as in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Rather, it behaves as a hybrid of the Heckscher-

Ohlin and Speci…c Factors labour markets. This leads to demands for protection that

partly coalesce around factor-based lobbies as in the Stolper-Samuelson theorem and partly

coalesce around industry-based lobbies as in the Speci…c Factors model.

      Key to our political economy prediction is the rent-seeking behaviour of workers. To see

this, consider the arrow in …gure 4. A type S worker who has selected into industry i earns

discretely more in industry i than in any other industry. From the worker’s perspective, this

earnings di¤erential can be thought of as a rent associated with the existence of industry i.16

Now consider a tari¤ that raises the industry price qi . Since wi (S; L) L = ln qi +ln Ai + i S,

the tari¤ shifts up the industry-i wage pro…le while leaving all other industry wage pro…les

unchanged.

      Which workers demand this protection? Workers near the middle of the interval [Si 1 ; Si ]

are endogenously immobile in the sense that it will take almost total industry collapse to

induce them to switch industries. These workers demand protection for their industry and

only their industry. To the extent that they succeed in organizing a lobby, the lobby will

 16
      Of course, the worker is paid the value of her marginal product and in this sense there are no rents.

be industry-based as in the Speci…c Factors model. Workers who are near the boundary

Si   1   are endogenously mobile in the sense that they will switch into industry i if industry i

receives a tari¤ and switch into industry i 1 if industry i 1 receives a tari¤. These workers

do not demand protection for a particular industry. Rather, they demand protection for

industries that intensively use worker types near Si 1 . To the extent that such workers

succeed in organizing a lobby, the lobby will consist exclusively of workers whose S is near

Si 1 . That is, the lobby will be factor-based as in the Stolper-Samuelson theorem.

     Such heterogeneous worker responses to changes in industry fortunes are frequently ob-

served in the data. In response to impending mass lay-o¤s, workers who stay with the …rm

typically do better than those who are laid o¤, but do less well than those who voluntarily

quit. This is indicative of worker sorting. Workers who quit are closer to Si   1   while those

who are laid o¤ are closer to the middle of the interval. Jacobson et al. (1993) provide

strong evidence on these points using data drawn from the early 1980s import surge that

devastated the Pennsylvania steel industry. Casual empiricism suggests many other exam-

ples e.g., union members often disagree about whether or not to strike –workers near Si 1 ,

who have good outside options, are less supportive of a strike than workers near the middle

of the interval [Si 1 ; Si ].

    Returning to our prediction that industry-based and factor-based lobbies will coexist,

note that there is now abundant evidence that the Stolper-Samuelson and Speci…c Factor

lobbying predictions are both partially supported by the evidence. Magee et al. (1989) and

Goldberg and Maggi (1999) …nd evidence in support of the proposition that industry-based

lobbying is important. Rogowski (1989), O’Rourke and Williamson (1999) and Slaughter

and Scheve (2001) present evidence in favour of the proposition that factor-based lobbying

is important. Tre‡er (1993) and Beaulieu (2002) …nd evidence of both factor-based and

industry-based trade policy preferences. The coexistence of industry- and factor-based lob-

bying is always explained away by noting that industry-based lobbying dominates in the

short run while factor-based lobbying dominates in the long run as immobile factors melt

into mobility. However, the evidence for factor-based lobbying in Tre‡er (1993), Slaughter

and Scheve (2001) and Beaulieu (2002) is short run. Further, many industry lobbies have

succeeded in obtaining long-run protection. For example, the steel industry has been pro-

tected since the 1960s despite the fact that all of its 1960s capital stock was written o¤



                                            30
due to the introduction of new technologies such as the ‘mini mill’. A simplistic distinc-

tion between long and short periods is clearly not rich enough to explain the coexistence of

industry- and factor-based lobbying. Our model points to the need for identifying the degree

of worker speci…city and shows clearly how this is to be estimated in terms of a standard

econometric sorting model. Our model also shows that the degree of speci…city and how it

evolves in response to industry shocks is central for explaining the evolution of international

trade protection.

   Finally, despite important similarities between our model and the Speci…c Factors model,

there are important di¤erences. We have already seen one. In the Speci…c Factors model

the speci…c factor is homogeneous. In our model the speci…c factor is heterogeneous and this

heterogeneity is both what generates upward-sloping industry supply functions and what

generates the coexistence of industry- and factor-based lobbying. A second di¤erence is that

in the Speci…c Factors model the speci…c factor is exogenous, as is its distribution across

industries. In our model the degree of speci…city and the distribution of the speci…c factor

across industries is endogenous. This provides both a deeper level of explanation and results

in sharper predictions about trade and the political economy of protection.



8. International Technology Di¤erences

In the Ricardian model and in extensions to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, international tech-

nology di¤erences typically lead to specialization. This is hard to reconcile with work by

Pack (1984) and others on the international coexistence of di¤erent vintages of technology.

In our model, a country using an inferior technology can still compete by essentially skim-

ming the cream, that is, by operating at a smaller level of output and employing only those

few workers whose skills are almost a perfect match for the industry’s needs. Poor countries

compete by foregoing all rents associated with these skills.

   More formally, consider …gure 5 which plots the wage pro…les wi (S; L)          L = ln qi +

ln Ai +   i S.   Recall that Ai is a Hicks-neutral productivity parameter. Since rich countries

   How large can international technology di¤erences be before there is Ricardian special-

ization i.e., before the rich country becomes the sole producer of i? When APi oor drops to Ai

or below, the poor country is so unproductive in industry i that the poor-country industry

shuts down. Ai is trivial to compute. Noting from equations (2)-(5) that Si        1   and Si are

linear in Ai , Ai satis…es the linear equation Si 1 (Ai ) = Si (Ai ). The next theorem formalizes

these points and o¤ers a trade prediction.


Theorem 7. Consider international di¤erences in technology Ai .


  1. A rise in Ai raises output in industry i (dYi =dAi > 0), lowers output in industries i    1

      and i + 1 (dYi 1 =dAi < 0, dYi+1 =dAi < 0), and leaves output in all other industries

      unchanged (dYj =dAi = 0 for j 6= i     1; i; i + 1).


  2. Let assumption 1 hold except that Ai is higher in the home country than in the foreign

      country. (a) If Ai > Ai in both countries then good i is produced in both countries.

      (b) The home country exports good i while importing goods i          1 and i + 1.


With only two goods, the theorem reduces to the standard Ricardian result, namely, dY2 =dA2 >

0 > dY1 =dA2 and the home country exports good 2 while importing good 1. However, with

only two goods     1 = S0 < S1 < S2 = 1 i.e., both countries must produce both goods.

Thus, sharp Ricardian specialization cannot occur.

9. Trade and Inequality

The Heckman and Sedlacek model that we are using, and indeed most variants of the Roy

model of labour markets, yield very rich predictions about the determinants of inequality.

Given length constraints of this paper, we focus on within-industry inequality. Despite the

importance of within-industry inequality – after all, trade policy is typically conducted at

the industry level – within-industry inequality has received virtually no attention. Bartel

and Sicherman (1999) is the exception.

       Consider a tari¤-induced increase in the price of good i. As in …gure 4, this expands

both ends of the interval [Si 1 ; Si ]. Recall from …gure 2 that average wages take on their

extreme values at S = Si          1   and S = Si .17 Thus, within-industry inequality rises because

the tari¤ attracts workers both with very high and very low wages. Theorem 8 formalizes

this.


Theorem 8. An increase in the industry i price (due perhaps to a tari¤) raises inequality

in the industry:


               dV (wi (S; L)j i)   ( i + )2 dV (S j i)         (       i   + )2 dV (S j i)
                                 =                                                         > 0:                (15)
                    dqi             i+1    i  dSi                  i         i 1  dSi 1


Further, an increase in the industry i price lowers inequality in industries i                    1 and i + 1:


                dV (wi   1   (S; L)j i   1)                  V (wi+1 (S; L)j i + 1)
                                              <0    and                             < 0:
                             dqi                                      dqi

  17
    If i + > 0 then S = Si is the maximum of E ( wi (S; L)j S) and S = Si        1   is the minimum. If   i+    <0
then S = Si is the minimum and S = Si 1 is the maximum.

The proof appears in appendix K and uses the fact that dV (S j i) =dSi > 0 and dV (S j i) =dSi                   1   <

0. We emphasize that international trade impacts on inequality only via the sorting rule

i.e., only via the impact of qi on Si and Si 1 .18

       It is tempting to argue that international trade must either lower or raise inequality in

all industries.     Theorem 8 make it clear that international trade can raise inequality in

some industries while lowering inequality in others. To investigate further we calculated

changes in within-industry inequality using 1984-1994 Current Population Survey data. We

found that 1984-94 changes in V (wi (S; L)j i) ranged from                0:06 in Logging to +0:11 in

Footwear. Thus, despite rising inequality economy-wide, changes in industry-level inequality

have varied widely across industries. Equation (15) serves as a basis for investigating whether

this variation can be explained by industry-speci…c trade shocks.

       This leads us naturally to a discussion of how within-industry inequality is impacted

by international trade (changes in qi ) versus skill-biased technical change (changes in                  i ).


Both of these alter the sorting rule Si = (qi             qi+1 + Ai      Ai+1 )=(   i+1      i ).   However,

only skill-biased technical change has direct e¤ects on inequality. The reason is a deep

one. Earnings depend on price multiplicatively so that a price change has a proportionate

e¤ect on the earnings of all workers in the industry. Restated, qi has no direct e¤ect on the

within-industry variance of log earnings. qi operates only via the sorting rule. In contrast,

skill biased technical change has the direct e¤ect of making S more productive. Figure 6

illustrates this point.

       In the left-hand panel of …gure 6, a rise in the price of industry 2 raises inequality in

  18
     All the key insights of this section hold when we additionally condition on observable worker character-
istics such as L i.e., when we investigate V ( wi (S; L) j L; i ).

industry 2 and lowers it in industry 1. This occurs as a result of worker sorting.19 In

contrast, not only does skill biased technical change a¤ect the sorting rule, it also a¤ects

the productivity of S. This appears in the right-hand panel of …gure 6 where a rise in                    2


steepens the earnings pro…le of industry 2. A rise in             2   can increase or decrease S1 . In

…gure 6 we illustrate the case where skill biased technical change decreases S1 . In this case,

the sorting e¤ect complements the direct productivity e¤ect in increasing inequality. More

generally, the two e¤ects can be o¤setting, which raises the possibility that unskilled-biased

technical change in developing countries may have raised inequality there.

       A key conclusion that emerges from this analysis is that skill biased technical change has

a richer set of channels for altering within-industry inequality than does international trade.

    Since …gure 6 plots wi (S; L) L, for this claim to be rigorous we must know what is happening to the

variance of L. However, the variance of L conditional on S is just 1      . Since this is independent of S
and the industry of a¢ liation, we can ignore the variance of L.

Both trade and skill biased technical change a¤ect inequality by altering the sorting rule.

However, only skill biased technical change has direct e¤ects on within-industry inequality.

This is due to the fact that skill biased technical change di¤erentially alters workers’marginal

products whereas trade alters all workers’marginal products by the same proportion. Our

observation thus o¤ers a deep insight into relative channels for the trade-and-wages debate.



10. Conclusions

We examined the implications of worker sorting for the patterns of domestic production

and international trade as well as for the demand for protection, income distribution and

economic development. Borrowing from Heckman and Sedlacek (1985), our model featured

heterogeneous workers who di¤er in two dimensions e.g., problem solving and communication

skills.

    We started o¤ by showing that two-skill heterogeneity leads to much richer predictions

for production, earnings, and inequality than does the one-skill heterogeneity of, say, Leamer

(1999). We then described how higher moments of the bivariate distribution of skills are

interesting predictors of trade between rich countries. For example, ‘have and have-not’

economies such as the United States with its high     will export S-intensive goods to Sweden

and import L-intensive goods from Sweden. For another example, economies with high

levels of endowment inequality will export goods that intensively use either S or L, but not

both. We used this to explain U.S. dominance in industries such as …lm and information

technologies and to explain German dominance in machinery and other ‘O-Ring’ reliable

goods involving long chains of production.



                                              37
       A key feature of our model is that it yields sharp and easily characterized predictions

about international patterns of production and trade, even in the case of many goods. In

the Heckscher-Ohlin model these predictions are sharp and easily characterized only in the

2-good, 2-factor case. The Heckscher-Ohlin predictions fall ‡at in all other cases.20 In the

Speci…c Factors model the patterns of production and trade depend on impossibly detailed

supply elasticities (Jones and Neary, 1984, page 24). These elasticities in turn depend on

the cross-industry distribution of industry-speci…c factors, a distribution that is exogenous

and for which little intuition is available. Thus, our model provides a major improvement

in our ability to concisely and intuitively predict international patterns of production and

trade.

       Our model o¤ers an alternative explanation for the demand for protection. The Heckscher-

Ohlin model predicts factor-based lobbying, which has proved useful for understanding broad

trade policy debates between labour and capital e.g., Rogowski (1989) and O’Rourke and

Williamson (1999). The Speci…c Factors model predicts industry-based lobbying, which is

useful for understanding short-run lobbying by industries with clearly identi…able and ex-

ogenous speci…c factors e.g., mining. Our model predicts both industry- and factor-based

lobbying and emphasizes the tension within an industry between those who are endogenously

immobile (demanders of industry-based protection) and those who are endogenously mobile

(demanders of factor-based protection). Our analysis o¤ers an empirically implementable

framework for thinking about the sources of worker immobility or speci…city, something the

Speci…c Factors model does not and cannot o¤er.

  20
    (i) In the even model with many goods and factors, predictions depend on the complex inverse of the
technology matrix and so have no intuitive appeal. (ii) With more goods than factors the predictions are
indeterminate. (iii) With more factors than goods the model is simply not interesting.


                                                  38
   The model presented o¤ers two additional insights. It explains how a country with

a backward technology can survive international competition and how this leads to low

earnings. Also, the model has rich predictions about the e¤ects of trade and skill-biased

technical change on income distribution. Future research suggested by the model includes

(1) empirical work on di¤erences in inequality across industries, (2) empirical work on the

role of speci…city for lobbying behaviour, and (3) the role new technologies play in enabling

multinationals to unbundle worker skills and thus locate design and production in di¤erent

countries.

D. Proof of Equation (11)
Di¤erentiation of equation (27) yields

                         d ln Yi                            (Si          i)      (Si   1            i)

Simplifying using equation (21),

                 1 d ln Yi
                           = i + E S jSi 1                               i    < S < Si                  i

where the second equality comes from equation (19) i.e.                            i       =        i           L.   Equation (11)
follows from the de…nition of Ei ( i ) in lemma 1.


E. Proof of Theorem 2
Let YiW be world output of good i. By market clearing it equals world consumption of
good i. Let Ci be home consumption of good i. By homotheticity, Ci =YiW equals the home
country’s share of world income and so is the same for all i. By theorem 1, Yi =YiW is
increasing in i. Hence (Yi Ci )=YiW is increasing in i. Let Ti        Yi Ci be net exports.
By balanced trade, at least one good is exported and at least one good is imported. Since
Ti =YiW is increasing in i, if Ti > 0 then Ti+j > 0 for all j > 0 and if Ti < 0 then Ti j < 0
for all j > 0. It follows that there is a unique i < n such that Ti > 0 for i > i , Ti     0,
and Ti < 0 for i < i .


F. Proof of Equation (13)
We begin with a preliminary result. Any variance can be rewritten as the expectation of the
square minus the square of the expectation. Thus, V (Si ja < S < b) = E (S 2 ja < S < b)
[E ( S ja < S < b)]2 . Plugging this into equation (22) yields

                              b (b)        a (a)
                                                 = E S 2 ja < S < b                            1:                               (28)
                                (b)         (a)

   We next provide an expression for d ln Yi =d ln . Di¤erentiation of equation (27) with
respect to yields

     d ln Yi     2                   1 (Si +        i   ) (Si            i)  (Si 1 +           i       ) (Si    1      i)
             =   i   +    i   L                                                                                             :   (29)
       d                                                   (Si            i)   (Si 1                    i)


Substituting Si +    i    = (Si           i)   +(   i   +   i     ), d = d ln , equation (21) and equation

   We next provide an expression for d ln Yi =d ln                        L.      Di¤erentiation of equation (27) with
respect to L yields

                     d ln Yi                                      (Si          i)           (Si   1           i)

From equation (21) and d       L   =       L d ln       L,   this simpli…es to

              d ln Yi      2
                      =    L   +       i       L    +        LE       S jSi   1         i   < S < Si                   i       :            (31)
              d ln L
Finally, from the de…nition of , an increase in leads to proportional increases in and L :

d ln =d ln = d ln L =d ln = 1. Thus, from equations (30)-(31) and 2i          i   + 2 2L +

G. Proof of Theorem 4
Let YiW be world output of good i. By market clearing it equals world consumption of
good i. Let Ci be home consumption of good i: By homotheticity, Ci =YiW equals the home
country’s share of world income and so is the same for all i. By theorem 3, Yi =YiW is
increasing in i for i > i and decreasing in i for i     i . Let Ti    Yi Ci be net exports.
            W
Then Ti =Yi is increasing in i for i > i and decreasing in i for i       i . It follows that if
i were exported (Ti > 0) then all goods are exported. By balanced trade at least one
industry must be imported. Hence i is imported.
    Suppose some good i > i is exported. Then since Ti =YiW is increasing in i there must
be a good i such that Ti < 0 for i = i ; : : : ; i 2; Ti 1 0; and Ti > 0 for i = i ; : : : ; n.
Similarly, suppose that some good i < i is exported. Then since Ti =YiW is decreasing in
i there must be a good i such that Ti > 0 for i = 1; : : : ; i     1; Ti    0; and Ti < 0 for
i = i + 1; : : : ; i . It remains to show that some good i > i is exported and some good
i < i is exported.
    Let be the home country’s income share. By homotheticity, Ci = YiW . Since i < n
by assumption, theorem 3 implies Yn > Ynw . Hence Tn           Yn Cn > 0 i.e., some good
i > i is exported. Since i > 1 by assumption, theorem 3 implies Y1 > Y1w . Hence


                                                               43
T1   Y1   C1 > 0 i.e., some good i < i is exported.


H. Proof of Equation (14)
From equation (27),

                       d ln Yi           1 (Si                    i)           (Si         1            i)
                               =                                                                             +         i:
                         d                 (Si                    i)           (Si         1            i)


Simplifying using equation (21) and substituting in                                i       =        i            L    from equation (19) yields

                   d ln Yi
                           =E S +              i   j Si   1              i   < S < Si                             i             L:        (33)
                     d

Equation (14) follows from the de…nition of Ei ( i ) in lemma 1.


I. Proof of Theorem 6
By comparison of equations (11) and (14), the proof is identical to the proof of theorem 2.


J. Proof of Theorem 7
The derivative of output in industry i with respect to ln Ai is:
                                       1                                               1
               d ln Yi     1                       (Si              i)   +                              Si       1          i
                                   i+1     i                                       i       i 1
                       =1+                                                                                                      > 0:

The derivatives of output in industries i                 1 and i + 1 with respect to pi are:
                                                          1

                              =                                                                                        < 0:

    To prove part 2 of the theorem let YiW be world output of good i. By market clearing
it equals world consumption of good i. Let Ci be home consumption of good i: By homo-
theticity, Ci = YiW for all i where is the home country’s share of world income. By part 1,
Yi > YiW ; Yi 1 < YiW1 , and Yi+1 < Yi+1W
                                           . Hence Ti Yi Ci > 0, Ti 1 < 0 and Ti+1 > 0.
                 W
Finally, Yj = Yj for j < i 1 and j > i + 1 so that Tj = 0.

K. Proof of Theorem 8
From equation (26) with V(S ji) written out in full as V(S jSi 1 < S < Si ), the derivative
of the variance of log earnings in industry i with respect to qi is
                        2   dV(S jSi     < S < Si ) dSi                  2   dV(S jSi 1 < S < Si ) dSi 1
  dV (wi (S; L)j i)     i              1                                 i
                    =                                   +                                                :
       dqi                             dSi          dqi                              dSi 1          dqi

From equations (2) and (5), dSi =dqi = 1=( i+1      i ) and dSi 1 =dqi = 1=( i     i 1 ) from
which equation (15) follows. Heckman and Sedlacek (1985, proposition 1) states that
dV (S j i) =dSi > 0 and dV (S j i) =dSi 1 < 0 if S is distributed according to a log concave
distribution. The normal distribution is log concave. Applying this to equation (15) yields
dV (w (S; L)j i)=dqi > 0:
    The derivatives of the within-industry variance of log earnings in industries i 1 and
i + 1 with respect to qi are given by:
                                                         2
                  dV (wi (S; L)j i + 1)                  i+1           dV (S j i + 1)
                                        =                                             < 0;
                          dqi             (         i+1             i)     dSi

                 dV (wi (S; L)j i      1)                 i 1          dV (S j i 1)
                                            =                                       < 0:
