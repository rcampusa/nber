I.      INTRODUCTION

        Much, if not most, of the substantial recent literature on trade and environment

(see Anderson and Blackhurst (1992), Beghin et al. (1994), Dean (1992), Esty (1994),

Runge (1994), Ulph (1994) and Whalley (1991)) has largely concerned itself with the

issue of whether policy linkage between trade and the environment can, in some sense,

be justified.      Is there a rationale for special trade rules to reflect environmental

concerns?       When does more trade help or hurt the environment?                 Should countries be

allowed to use protection to achieve environmental goals?              Should trade provisions in

global environmental         treaties be agreed to, even if they override provisions of trade

treaties?

     In contrast,        this paper accepts that trade-environment          linkage has entered the

trading system, if for no other reason than that a natural instrument linkage exists, since

(actual      or threatened)      trade    measures    can support     transnational      environmental

objectives of importing countries and (although little discussed ) environmental actions

can, in principle, also support trade objectives of exporting countries (see Copeland and

Taylor (1995)).          Such linkage was implicitly accepted at the 1994 Marrakesh meeting

that concluded the Uruguay Round, when a GATT/WTO                          Committee     on Trade and

Environment (CTE) was established.              This Committee is to present its initial report at

the first WTO ministerial meeting to be held in Singapore, December 9-13th 1996, and

how this linkage will be reflected in the wider post Singapore trading system now seems

a more pertinent issue rather than whether a justification for linkage exists.

     The paper makes a number of points.              Both because of the technical problems and

wider       precedents      involved     with   any   modifications   to     the     GATT/WTO       for

environmental      considerations,       and the North-South    divisions generated by the issue,
                                                 2


  progress within the GATT/WTO          on this issue looks likely to be slow and painfilly

  incremental rather than bold as environmental groups would wish to see. The mandate

  of the Committee on Trade and Environment for its Singapore report is largely limited

  to exploring what are the important environmental trade linkages. Little by way of new

  substantive proposals can be expected from it in Singapore.

       Indeed, even taken largely as a GATTAVTO issue, there seem to be no widely

  agreed upon feasible options as ways to proceed; all proposals for ways forward to

  GATT/WTO        trade    and environment   reform   offered   thus far seem to encounter

  problems.     Advocacy that a fiture WTO Trade Round should be lead by the trade and

  environment issue (as a ‘Green Round’) seems not to reflect a realistic assessment both

  of where things stand in GATTAVTO on the issue, and the elements of reciprocity

  needed to drive a new Round forward.

       The paper also argues that despite (and beyond) Singapore, one also has to go

  firther   than the      GATT/WTO    to see the potential      evolution   of the trade   and

  environment issue. Developments      on the trade and environment issue seem likely to be

  driven in the next few years as much by factors outside the GATT/WTO             as well as

  within it, as new global environmental arrangements,     some with potentially large trade

  implications (such as carbon emission limitation agreements), emerge. This has already

  arisen in the CTE with discussion of how to treat trade provisions of existing and new

  multilateral environmental    agreements (MEA)s, such as the Montreal protocol, under

  the GATT/WTO.            A credible argument   is that the focus thus far on trade and

. environment    issues of symbolic but limited quantitative    significance in the trade and

  environment debate seems poised to change as discussion (outside of GATT/WTO)             of
                                                 3


a possible      global   environmental     measures     with   potentially   large    trade   effects

accelerates.

      The paper concludes by reemphasizing            the potential the trade and environment

issue has revealed for reigniting the recently dormant North-South                divide on trade.

Developing countries see trade and environment as a discussion of how trade barriers

might go up against them and slow their growth and development,                 all in the name of

meeting environmental      objectives espoused by vocal NGOS in the developed world.

Some of them use language such as ‘green’ or ‘eco’ imperialism, and argue that they

should instead be compensated            for showing environmental       restraint.    In contrast,

environmental     groups in the developed world argue that environmental              issues are so

serious that these should be the dominant considerations            in the setting of the global

policy framework, rather than trade concerns.           This is a conflict that seems likely to

intensifi.

     In summary, trade and environment          remains an issue in flux, and one which is

unlikely to be resolved quickly either in Singapore or through subsequent GATT/WTO

negotiation.    Also to treat trade and environment as solely a GATT/WTO                 issue risks

missing the wider potential significance of environmental          policy issues for the trading

system; and its ability to resurrect North-South        divisions in the trading system.      This is

especially the case given the complicating precedents the issue raises for other types of

fiture negotiable trade linkages (such as labour standards).

    II. THE TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT                                  ISSUE, THE lVTO, AND
        THE URUGUAY ROUND

   General Consideratio]ls

         The trade and environment issue is one that has come to have high profile in both

   the trade and the environment communities in recent years, In reality, there is no single

   issue, but instead a series of inter-related subissues which have agglomerated to fiel an

   ongoing debate as to what should be done about trade and environment                      linkage both

   within the framework of the WTO and more broadly.

        At one level, consensus over possible trade and environment linkage derives from

   the argument,      made early on in the debate, that increased trade inevitably implies

   increased consumption and production, and hence, lowered environmental quality. This

   theme was reflected in Congressional debates in 1991 and 1992 on NAFTA as it went

   throush its various stages, where extreme environmental problems in the Maquiladora

   zone, including large untreated discharges into rivers, high infection rates in US border

   communities     attributed   to shared US-Mexican          aquifers, and other related problems,

   were seen as inevitably worsening under a NAFTA with yet more US-Mexican trade. 1

        This view that environmental worsening necessarily follows from increased trade

   is, however, now widely seen as overly simplistic.            In the last few decades, developing

   countries who have been more outward-oriented               in their trade policies (such as Korea




   1Leonard and Christensen ( 1991) strongly made Lhesearguments

  2 Ho\vever, Copeland and Taylor (1994) sho~vhotv a simple static model of North-South trade can be
‘ used to examine lifiages bet~k’eennational income, pollution, and international trade and produce
  results along these Iines. TIVOcountries produce a continuum of goods, each differing in pollution
  intensity. -They sholv that the higher income country chooses stronger environmental protection and
  specializes in relatively clean goods. By isolating the scale, composition, and technique effects of
  international trade on pollution, they also sho~vthat free trade increases }vorld pollution. An increase
  in the Rich North’s production possibilities increases pollution, \vhile a similar gro~~~hin the poor
  South lo}verspollution; and unilateral transfers from North to South reduce ~vorld}videpollution.

compared to, say, India up to the late 19S0s) seem to have achieved higher rather than

lower environmental     standards,     In part, this is due to their need to sell into higher

income markets      with higher environmental        standards,     which has required them to

produce higher environmental         standard products,    In achieving high grow-th rates for

significant periods of time, and hence higher living standards, these same countries also

seem to have witnessed a clear positive impact on environmental quality, reflecting, in

part, the income elasticity of their own demand for environmental                 quality.      OECD

countries’ standards for air and water quality are also considerably higher today than

they were 50 years ago (again due to higher incomes, and a positive income elasticity of

demand for environmental       quality), even though these same economies                  now trade

considerably more as a percentage of GDP than formerly.              The GATT (1992a) Annual

Report built on these observations       to argue, that, firstly, because gains are achievable

through trade, real incomes will rise with increased trade; and, secondly, that if these

income   gains    are spent   on environmental        protection,     higher   rather    than   lower

environmental quality will result

     At quite another level, debate on trade and environment              linkage centres on the

claim that environmental      problems are now so serious that new and much needed

environmental policy cannot be allowed to be thwarted by concerns over trade policy3.

The argument is that the use of trade-restricting         measures on environmental          grounds

should be allowed, even if presently not sanctioned by GATT/WTO.                        Thus, special

trade promotion    devices related to environmental objectives (such as export subsidies

for pollution control equipment) should be allowed; trade restrictions which offset the

effect of low environmental      standards     are justifiable;     and provisions      contained   in



3 See Sh~bman (1989, 1990).
                                                        6


    existing trade treaties      (such as GATT/WTO,           or the Treaty of Rome) should not

    preclude the use of new environmental arrangements, simply on grounds of precedent.

    The line of argument           is that what      is needed    is to develop      appropriate     global

    management      strategies for scarce environmental resources, and that trade policy is a

    key supporting      mechanism to implement such resource management,                   rather than a

    policy to be decided upon solely on trade considerations.

         The counter arguments to this reflect the contention that the benefits of an open

    trading system in the form of gains from trade have been slowly built up over 50 years

    of multilateral negotiation,     and should not be easily surrendered to new protectionism

    sanctioned     by environmental     concernsq.     Any special treatment       for the environment

    under existing trade rules is also seen as setting a dangerous precedent.                  A domino

    theory of the trading system is sometimes raised; i.e., that special treatment for one

    issue will lead to special treatment for other issues, with, eventually, a disappearance in

    generality of the rule regime in the trading system as we know it today,                  Reinforcing

    these concerns is the risk of environmental capture; i.e. that trade policy could become

    more protectionist,     not due to genuine environmental considerations             motivating trade

    policy, but rather from protectionist       interests using environmental arguments for their

    own ends and legitimizing their narrow sectional interests by appeal to environmental

    rationales~.

The }VTO

        Within the GATT/WTO,         the trade and environment issue has also steadily grown

in profile in recent years with the development              of the wider trade and environment

debate outlined aboveb, In its first forty years relatively few environmental cases came

before GATT dispute           settlement,     and the only (somewhat        oblique)   environmental

content of GATT contained            in Article XX remained little clarified by dispute case

resolution’,

        A central event in changing this situation was the report of the 1991 GATT panel

requested      by Mexico      following     US trade actions based on the practices          of tuna

fishermen off the Mexican west coast, and which subsequently                    ruled in Mexico’s

favour.    The issue was that tuna were being caught in nets which incidentally entangled

dolphins, causing some of the dolphins to be killed,                The United States had made

repeated representations       to Mexico to reduce the number of dolphins killed in these

tuna catches,     Appealing to US legislation under the Marine Mammal Protection                 Act,

Earth     Island Institute,    a California    nonprofit   group,   moved    in 1990 to ban the

importation     of canned, frozen and fresh tuna into the US from 5 countries (Mexico,

Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador           and Vanuatu),         The US also implemented        a labelling

requirement under this law that set out the conditions under which canned tuna sold in

the United States could be described as caught in a dolphin-friendly manner.

7 Appendix C of Es~ (1994) outlines both previous GA~ cases, and rele~:antUS and EU case Ia\v.
Some of the earlier GAn cases \vhich touched on environmental issues invol~ed excise duties on
imported petroleum and products in the US to fund environmental clean up (the 1971 Superfund case);
Canadian restrictions on esport of unprocessed fish products from the West Coast fishery (1988), and
import bans on cigarettes in Thailand (1990),

          The request for a panel by Mexico and the subsequent panel decision in Mexico’s

   favour attracted widespread attention because it was the first time that a GATT panel

   was asked to rule on an environmental                 issue in this way.       There were public

   representations    made in Geneva from environmental            groups protesting      the case and

   emphasizing what they saw as the anti-environment            nature of the GATT.       In their view

   concern for dolphins, not profit, should have been the driving force behind trade policy

   in the case,

          Mexico based its case on two separate arguments.           The first was that the US had

  no rights under GATT to impose such a trade ban.                  The United States argued that

  under Article XX(b) of the GATT it had rights to use trade bans to protect endangered

  species.     The Mexican argument was that were no endangered species at issue; in this

  case the only point of contention         was the nature of the fishing methods used.             The

  Mexicans also appealed the US Iabelling condition as to when canned tuna could be

  displayed with a logo indicating that dolphin-friendly methods were used to catch the

  tuna,     on the grounds     that this would       involve a violation      of the mark-of-origin

  provisions of the GATT under Article IV, which only requires an indication of country

  of origin,

          Following the tuna-dolphin panel report in favour of Mexicos, dissatisfaction grew

  on GATT’s position on trade and environment issues on several fronts.                   Environment

  groups saw GATT as anti-environment               since it did not uphold the use of a trade



  * The panel tinding on behalf of Mexico mled that the US ban ~1-asa violation of GATT Article III, and
‘ that the Article XX exceptions in GA~ could not be applied on an extraterritorial basis ruling them
  inapplicable in this case. Ho\vever, the panel report ruled in favour of the US on the labelling issue.
  The panel-report \vas not pushed fonvard to adoption by the GATT Council for a variety of reasons,
  including Mexico’s then emerging NAFI’A negotiation; so the EC subsequently brought a second
  complaint on tuna-dolphin dealing }vith import bans in the US Marine Mammal Protection Act from
  third countries \vho trade \vith countries against \vhom primary actions are taken. The panel report
  (Tuna-Dolphin II) in 1994 ruled against the US, but on some~vhat different grounds. See Es& (1994)
  pp.268-269.

  restricting measure to limit incidental dolphin kills. The US Congress saw GATT as

  overriding    the content     of domestic     US legislation to protect       mammals; and more

  broadly the environmental        content of GATT was seen as vague, weak, and in need of

  clarification and repair.     The extremely limited environmental content of the Uruguay

  Round decisions (reflecting the 1986 negotiating mandate) intensified these concerns,

  as did the absence of any reference to the environment in the founding charter of the

  WTO,




  The Uruguay       Round

        Despite the profile of the trade and environment issue in the mid to late stages of

  the Uruguay Round9, the decisions from the Round do not deal directly with trade and

  environment issues since they were not formally part of the negotiating mandate. Much

  was made by environmental groups of the observation that the word ‘environment’ did

  not appear in the Drafi Final Act from the Round (the Dunkel Text), which, including

  tariff schedules, ran to some 26,000 pages of textlO. Also, the failure of the decisions

  establishing the WTO to set out fiture environmental objectives was seen as a chance

  squandered, and maybe lost for decades, to centrally address the trade and environment

  issue and establish broad principles in this area to guide the WTO in its fiture work.

       Nonetheless,    trade and environment issues were important in developments running

  parallel to the negotiations      themselves, and in particular played a role in defining the




‘ 9 A number of events contributed to raising the profi Ie of trade and environment (virtually unheard of
  at its launch in Punts del Este in 1986) during [he later part of the Uruguay Round besides the
  tuna/dolphin dispute. These included the Earth Summit at Rio in June 1992; the vocal opposition of
  environmentalists to the NAFTA, and the effofis of environmental groups to block adoption of both the
  N~A       and the Uruguay Round decisions in the US.

work program for the WTO following the Round,                    Also, as Uimonen (1995) argues, it

is not the case that the Uruguay Round decisions are free of environmental implications

The Round       includes    agreements      which discipline the trade restricting            effects    of

standards and regulations which have environmental implications, and the agreements

on subsidies, countervailing     duties and intellectual property rights all have implications

for environmental issues.

      At a more technical level, the sanita~              and phytosanitary     measures and technical

barriers to trade (TBT) agreements address problems raised by a number of contentious

environmental    and trade casesl 1, Their objective was to minimize the extent to which

standards and regulations can have negative effects on trade, or act as disguised trade

barriers, while still permitting GATT contracting parties to adopt or maintain standards

that are necessary for the protection of human, plant, and animal life and health.

      In the    technical   barriers   to    trade    agreement,       measures     include   those     for

environmental protection,       as well as those regulations which apply to production                  and

process methods       (PPMs.)     Each of these agreements             defines a national treatment

obligation as well as a necessity test, with the aim of minimizing adverse effects of

measures taken, much like in GATT Article XX, with loose harmonization agreements

for each of the two.

     As Uimonen        notes,   the TBT       agreement        could   prove    a catalyst    for future

environmental     trade because the Uruguay Round disciplines in this area seemingly

restrict   domestic   policies rather than border measures.                   European   countries,     for

instance, have been playing a leading role in developing new regulations covering waste




11Including the Canadian beer can case \\’hich involved a ne~venvironmental le}~ on beer packaged in
cans. For details, see GATT (1992b) Focus 91, p.2
                                                     11


production and recycling, which include waste take-back schemes requiring producers

to either take back their packaging waste for disposal or recycling, or pay fees to local

authorities to accomplish the same objective, and these could be affected.

      The Uruguay Round Subsidies Agreement makes several changes to earlier trade

rules, and with potentially          significant    implications   for environmental        issues.   The

approach is one of recognizing the rights of contracting parties to protect themselves

through the use of PPMs and related subsidies, while avoiding misuse of countervailing

measures of protection,        The Agreement offers a definition of subsidy, previously not

contained in the GATT, in the form ‘specific’ ‘z subsidies, and classifies them according

to three categories.        The Agreement          also lists general subsidies characterized             by

government      financial contributions      as nonspecific and nonactionable           subsidies; thus

nonspecific environmental subsidies are now permitted.

     On other environmentally         related matters, the Uruguay Round generated                results

with varying degrees         of ambiguity.         In the area of standards,       the thrust     of the

agreements from the Round is to discipline trade barriers, while allowing for differences

in non-border     measures.      Exactly how much discipline will be exerted on national

regulations, especially in the case of sanitary and phytosanitary standards, and what will

constitute sufficient scientific justification       for high standards remains unclear.          Under

the subsidies agreement,        however, the use of countervailing           measures to deal with

unfair trade practices in the form of lax environmental standards is not permitted.                   But

the agreement does imply that subsidies that take the form of foregone revenue for

environmental taxes can be countervailable if they are specific.


‘2A ‘specific’ subsidy is one considered only available to ‘an enterprise or indust~ or group of
enterprises or industries \vithin the jurisdiction of the authority granting the subsidy’, GA~ (1994).
The definition of a subsidy also rests on \vhether there is a financial contribution by a government or
any public body.

Post Uruguay     Round13

     At the ministerial meeting which concluded the Uruguay Round at Marrakesh in

April 1994, the contracting parties agreed both that trade and environment should be on

the fiture    agenda for the WTO, and that a new Committee                  on Trade     and the

Environment    (CTE) should be formed to assess trade and environment linkages.              This

Committee is to give its first report in Singapore in December 1996.

     It was agreed that the agenda for the CTE work on trade and environment would

cover (i) the relationship     between    multilateral   environmental   arrangements    and the

GATT/WTO,       (ii) how environmental policies with significant trade effects impact the

trading system (iii) how environmental taxes and charges interact with trade rules (iv)

eco-labelling issues (v) WTO dispute settlement and MEAs (vi) environmental                policy

measures and market access and (vii) domestically prohibited goods,           Progress on most

of these issues has been slow. In essence, developed countries, and especially the EU,

have argued for modifications       to GATT/WTO          disciplines for environmental   reasons;

while developing countries, feafil       of legitimizing protection against their exports have

taken a more cautious stance. Little of substance in any of these areas is expected to be

concluded at Singapore.

     On production    and processing methods, proposals have been made to modifi the

present   GATT principle      of national treatment       contained   in Article III, and more

specifically, the concept of like products, which presently disallows any distinction in

trade policy treatment between products made in a clean’ and ‘dirty’ manner.              Present

environmental issues in Woolcock (1996).
   GATTfiVTO       rules are seen as inconsistent     with activist   domestic    environmental

   policies, since they inevitably imply a competitive disadvantage to domestic industries,

   if exporting countries have lower standards,     On MEAs, the aim has been to secure a

   GATT/WTO        accommodation    of the trade provisions of their agreements before any

  GATT/WTO       inconsistent measures are taken under the Montreal protocol.            Proposals

  include expanding the scope of GATT Article XX exceptions to explicitly cover MEA

  trade measures; the granting of GATTAVTO Waivers for such trade measures; and the

  grant of limited (contained)     waivers which would condition the use of MEA trade

  measures.    On other less significant issues, accommodation         may be possible; joint

  Codes of Conduct for eco-labelling schemes is one. But in general, the picture is one of

  limited movement      on the trade and environment        issues in the CTE agenda           pre

  Singapore,

       At a less technical     level, however,    trade   and environment     continues     to be

  repeatedly cited as a major component of the likely fiture focus for global trade policy

  negotiation and debate.    Renato Ruggiero, Director General oft he WTO, has identified

  trade and environment     as one of four issues (along with competitive        policy, Iabour

  standards, and investment) which will shape the fiture work programme of the WTO,

  and eventually     form the lead issues of a fiture       multilateral   negotiating     Round.

  Immediately afier the Uruguay Round, there were several calls for a new negotiating

  Round to be a ‘Green Round’, and such calls, while less frequent, are still heard.

       This profile for trade and environment     as a lead issue within GATTAVTO thus

. seemingly coexists with difficulties in making much progress in Singapore, and clear

  divisions between developed and developing countries on the issue.             The trade and

  environment component      of any fiture negotiation would also be a rule writing rather
                                              14


than traditional   reciprocity   based negotiation,   and one with precedents     for other

potential rule writing exercises (such as Iabour standards).   LVhile the Uruguay Round

established precedents for rule writing concessions (for instance, in Intellectual Property

by the developing countries) it further complicates any leading role to be played by the

issue in a fiture multilateral negotiating Round.

III. THE ENVIRONMENTAL                         AGENDA FOR GATT~VTO AFTER
     SINGAPORE’”

      Given both the limited concrete pro,gress on the trade and environment issue that

seems likely in Singapore and its likely continued high profile as a potential lead issue

for a fiture negotiating Round, it seems usefil to speculate how the debate on the issue

may develop within the WTO after Singapore, out into the medium term.                     I would

argue both that the technical problems and worries over precedent will complicate any

accommodation        within the WTO on the trade and environment               issue and cleavage

between developed and developing countries on trade and environment will be likely

remain and even intensifi afier Singapore.            Also, increasingly it will be the case that

developments       outside the GATT/WTO,           such as the potential trade effects of new

global environmental         agreements, and, to a lesser extent, environmental arrangements

concluded in regional agreements,          will enter and drive the debate.


     Thus, the talk of either a separate environmental negotiation - a ‘Green Round’ of

negotiations,     or an environment-lead       new wider Round - talk that was heard even

before the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, may well continue,                The pressures which

have been building for changes to be made within               the GATT/WTO to accommodate

environmental concerns may also remain as the focus for GATT/WTO debate on trade

and environment afier Singapore, but with growing frustration both from advocates and

opponents       of change.      Concerns    of environmental    groups   over what they see as

secretive GATT/WTO            processes, in which they have no rights to appear or appeal will

persist.   Linkage not only of GATT/WTO              arrangements to multilateral environmental

 agreements but also to new MEAs and onto trade patterns will become an evermore a

 key issue.

     None of this indicates that nothing can be done in GATT~TO           post Singapore on

 trade and environment,     as those who saw the seemingly deep divide on services pre

 Uruguay Round (in early 1986) will recall.         But exactly how trade and environment

would eventually be accommodated           in GATT/WTO       at this stage is unclear,    both

technically and politically; and what the GATT/WTO         response would be, if there were

one, to the wider impacts of environmental policies is at this stage unknown.




Broad GATT/WTO          Modification

     A variety of proposals have been offered as to how environmental        considerations

could be taken into account in fiture GATT/WTO agreements.           One might be to more

filly utilize what is presently available in the GATT, including the Article XXV waiver

mechanism     to allow for the use of otherwise          GATT-inconsistent    measures      on

evnironmental grounds.     Another would be to seek changes to the GATT/WTO rules so

as to allow for wide-ranging exceptions on environmental grounds.       There could also be

more narrowly focused elaborations and clarifications to the GATT agreements now in

the WTO, aiming to deal centrally with environment and trade issues,

    Waivers for individual Contracting      Parties under Article XXV could be used for

environmentally related trade restricting measures that would otherwise violate present

GATT/WTO        arrangements.    Approval of a waiver requires a three-quarters   majority.,

Environmental    waivers could possibly take on more general forms than those which

have been seen in the GATT thus far, which are usually narrowly focused and granted

to only one Contracting         Party at a time.     There could be bloc waivers,        given
                                                    17


simultaneously to subgroups (or even all) Contracting Parties, and allowing them to use

specific trade-restricting     measures for environmental         purposes.    There could even be

broad-ranging      waivers     setting    out general     conditions    under which environmental

exceptions would be allowed.

     Waivers have the attraction of addressing environmental concerns while leaving the

existing structure of GATT/WTO              disciplines unchanged, thus avoiding any need for a

potentially     complex and divisive rule rewriting negotiation.              However,       a series of

waivers granted       on a case-by-case        basis runs the risk of yielding a chaotic              and

inconsistent     outcome,     Each waiver request would have to go through                   a separate

waiver approval process, repeatedly raising potential problems in reaching agreement.

Also, more widespread use of waivers in the environmental area seems to go against the

current GATT/WTO            trend of downplaying the use of waivers in other areas (such as

agriculture).

     Another      way   to    bring      environmental     considerations     more   filly     into   the

GATT/WTO          would be to directly amend the General Agreement to allow for more

explicit environmental exceptions than it now contains, although the requirements                     are

stringent,     Some key GATT articles (including Articles I and III) require acceptance by

all members, while others require a two-thirds              majority.    Furthermore,    amendments

must pass national treaty ratification procedures, which further reduces the potential for

success,

     Table 1 reproduces        a list of the main GATT articles that could potentially                be

involved in such a negotiation given in Uimonen and Whalley (1996) 15. The scope of

the possible changes to the GATT~TO               is immediately striking.      Central to any such

                                                  18


negotiation would be an attempt to clarify or change the language of XX(b) and XX(g).

But other articles, including ~N          and national treatment     (Articles I and III) - the

cornerstones    of the GATT - might also be subjected to environmental review, as might

a number of other key articles (VI, XI, XIII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XX) and trade provisions

explicitly applying to developing countries (XVIII, and Part IV). Such a wide ranging

negotiation     on   rule    rewriting   covering      many   GATT    Articles   would   almost

certainlyprove dificult to conclude, especially as many non environmental issues would

likely be raised by individual countries,     Alternatively, narrowing such a negotiation to

only a few Articles makes it dificult to launch, because individual countries would want

to see issues of particular importance to them dealt with.

     An alternative but       related approach might be to negotiate a side agreement on

trade and the environment to so as to supplement and clari& the meaning of existing

Articles of the General Agreement and other agreements in the WTO as they relate to

environmental    issues.    For example, rules ranging from subsidy and competitiveness

issues to procedures        for the application     of unilateral measures   for environmental

protection    could be subject to clarification and elaboration.         In addition, following

GATT tradition       since the Kennedy Round,          ‘special and differential treatment’   on

environmental issues could be granted to less-developed countries, perhaps in the form

of longer time periods to implement environmentally related decisions.

        However,       in the   short    run,    it seems         likely that   the    only   practical     mechanism


  available     for    fundamental       environmental            rule    modification        in the      GATT/WTO

  fundamentally        will be waivers,          and these         seem likely to yield an unsatisfactory

  conclusion.      Even over a longer period, it remains unlikely that the GATT/WTO would

  be fundamentally amended, given both the scope of change and the practical difficulties

  involved. It at some fiture             date, the Contracting             Parties attempt to agree on new

  trade/environment        rules, it would most likely be in the form of a side agreement

  supplementing and interpreting            existing rules.




  Article XX Reform

       At the forefront         of any effort to change GATT rules as they apply to the

  environment         would     be   both       clarification       and    reconsideration        of      Article   =

  exceptionslG.       The issue here is as much one of determining what the current rules

  actually imply, as it is one of changing existing rules.

       There is currently substantial confision                   about the precise meaning of Article XX

  exceptions,     Previous      Article XX panels appear to have reached a consensus,                               that

  measures      must be ‘necessary’             for health and safety or ‘primarily aimed at’ the

  conservation        of an exhaustible          resource.          But    confision     remains       over whether

  exceptions should be narrowly defined to prevent their abuse, and the justification for

  such a narrow definition.             For instance, the first17 tuna-dolphin                 panel restricted the

  scope of Article XX by limiting its jurisdictional                         application.       The second panel

. backtracked from the first panel on this point, and it substituted a criterion whereby a

country could not impose trade restrictions for environmental             or other reasons, if the

only way it could achieve its objective was by forcing the affected country to change its

domestic policies.

     There have been proposals for wide-ranging              amendments     to Article XX, to the

effect that nothing in the GATT/WTO              would prevent any Contracting           Party from

taking any action ‘which it may deem necessary to protect the environment, including

the establishment       of import   or export     restrictions,   and the use of subsidies         ...’

(Shrybman,     1989).    These have been linked to provisions that, in any GATT/WTO

dispute regarding actions taken to protect the environment (domestic or otherwise) the

onus should be on the complainant to prove that the measure ‘was not taken in good

faith and that it was unreasonable’ (Shrybman, 1989)1s. A precedent for such proposa!s

appears to be GATT Article XX(h) which provides                   exemptions    for signatories    to

international commodity agreements along related lines. The obvious weakness is that

such exemptions would provide open-ended cover for protection,                 as well as promote

inefficient environmental     policy.    Under the cover of such an exemption             any trade

actions could, in principle, be taken in the name of environmental concerns 19, Because

of this, opposition to such proposals is especially strong, particularly from developing

countries.

     Trade restrictions on products with PPMs that cause environmental damage in the

importing country are also an Article XX issue (as well as an Article III (MFN) issue)

since they were called into question in the second tuna-dolphin panel report,             The panel

report asserted that the trade restrictions at issue could not, by themselves, achieve their


]8 Similar proposals for broad-ranging exceptions from GA~    obligations for environmental purposes
may be found in Arden-Clarke (1991),

19This obviously raises the political economy issues discussed in Hillmand and Ursprung (1994),
                                                       24


environmental      objective;      and so, if allowance is to be made for such second-best

policies, the circumstances under which they would be permitted need to be addressed.

This raises once again the issues implicit in the tuna-dolphin                   panel reports concerning

‘necessity’ tests;      whether      extrajurisdictional     measures     should be disciplined         more

severely,     and how measures             taken   in the context       of international      environmental

agreements should be dealt with.

       One   possible     change    might     be to permit   trade    measures      for extrajurisdictional

environmental     protection,      but require that they be ‘necessary’ in a stricter sense than for

measures to protect domestic health, safety, or environment.                      Such additional criteria

might include demonstration           of prior attempts to negotiate an international agreement

under the auspices of an agreed upon international body, such as UNEP; and a ‘good

faith’ estimate and offer of resource transfers, or even trade compensation.

       Future reconsideration        of the use of trade measures under Article XX may also

draw     on the results         of UNCED,          which reiterated     the need to avoid           arbitrary

discrimination    and disguised trading barriers, as with existing GATT rules.                      The Rio

Declaration     called on countries to avoid unilateral attempts to address environmental

problems which originate outside a country’s territorial jurisdiction.                     Furthermore,       it

called on countries to base their solutions on international consensus as far as possible.

    If there is a general approach to rewriting Article XX so as to clari~ general

exceptions from GATT/WTO                   disciplines for environmental      trade measures emerging

from these documents, it is to avoid unilateralism and new forms of protectionism                      as far

as possible.       However,        there    is widespread     disagreement       as to exactly      how to

circumscribe     future     allowances       for environmentally        motivated     trade   measures        in

elaborating on these general principles.

Environmental        Regulation

     An equally central GATT/WTO             issue beyond Singapore will be the interaction of

environmental     regulation      and trade policy.      The national treatment          obligation under

GATT/WTO         in Article III requires       Contracting      Parties not use internal taxes or

regulations in ways which give domestic protection,               and requires domestic policies to

treat imports    no less favorably         than ‘like’ domestic           products.      The GATT        has

interpreted   this provision       as requiring Contracting       Parties not to use measures             to

discriminate in favour of products.           The concept of ‘like’ product has been widely

interpreted as prohibiting trade restrictions based on the processes and methods (PPMs)

used to produce imported goods.             PPM-based      trade restrictions         become prima facie

violations of national treatment,       which then must be justified under Article XX if they

are to be allowed.

     There are a variety of ways in which these disciplines might be relaxed.                           One

approach might be to allow any measures which do not violate MFN and national

treatment obligations.      This would clearly be inadequate to discipline the protectionist

use of such measures.       Another might be to change the wording in Article XX(b) from

‘necessary’   to ‘relating to’ as in Micle            XX(g),      with the aim of weakening              the

requirement that has evolved in past panel disputes, that a measure must be the least

GATT-inconsistent         measure    reasonably    available20.      New language          might require

measures to be ‘consistent with, and a part o~ the framework of environmental policies

of the nation imposing          the measure’      (Patterson,     1992,     107).      Thus,    rather than

considering trade-restrictive       measures within the set of all possible policies to achieve a

given objective with a view toward identi~ing             a less GATT-inconsistent             measure, this



20See Patterson (1992),
                                                   26


approach     might   allow    trade-distorting     measures     related      to a nation’s      domestic

environmental policies, as long as they avoid (in some sense) in protectionist abuse.

     Dispute    settlement    panels have already          examined   whether      regulatory     or tax

distinctions used for non-trade       objectives are allowable in determining whether ‘like’

products are treated in accordance with Article III.              The task for the WTO dispute

settlement process on these matters has been to walk a line restricting national policy-

making that inevitably        entails incidental    trade effects, and permitting         the use of

ostensibly domestic taxes and regulations for protectionist purposes.

     Even if domestic taxes or regulations              violate the national treatment       obligation

under Article III, they may still be justified under Article ~.                This will raise firther

questions post Singapore as to how stringent such exceptions might be.                    The GATT

approach to trade measures taken to protect domestic health, safety and environment

under Article XX(b) thus far has been to permit them as long as they can be shown to

be ‘necessary’ for the purpose, i.e. that they are the least GATT-inconsistent,                 or trade-

distorting, measures available.      For example, the Umguay Round discisions discipline

standards that are more stringent than international norms, to ensure that they are the

‘least trade-distortionary’   measures available. Whether this approach prevails will be an

issue.




Transparency

     Concerns have been frequently expressed in the environmental community over the

seemingly closed procedures used in GATT/WTO                  negotiations     and dispute settlement

of environmental cases, These issues seem likely to persist post Singapore21, The most



21See also Arden-Clarke (1991) and Jackson (1992).
                                                  27


significant concerns have focused on the seeming secrecy of the dispute settlement

process since most domestic legal systems define rights to appear before administrative

tribunals, and also give rights to interested parties to appeal decisions,             The absence of

such rights in GATT disputes            involving environmental       issues has concerned           many

environmentalists.

     The response       from the trade community         is usually to argue first, that panel

procedures     represent     efforts   to depoliticise   political   conflicts     involving      national

governments,     and that a more open process would undermine                    these efforts.      They

argue, second, that if such rights are granted to environmental              groups, similar rights

would have to be granted to other political groups in both environmental                       and other

cases, potentially derailing the process.

     Another transparency        issue involves the provision        of information      to judge the

environmental effects of proposed policy changes, including the outcome of any fiture

multilateral negotiation..     In the US, federal policies ofien require environmental impact

statements (EISS), under the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act. An unsuccessful

attempt was made in the US courts to force compliance with this act arguing that the

NAFTA and Uruguay Round agreements should be subject to its requirements.                          While

there may be justification for assessments where narrowly focused trade policy changes

with a significant      environmental     link are at issue, a requirement           for entire trade

agreements where most elements have no direct environmental relationship immediately

apparent,    runs the risk of significantly complicating        the negotiation       and ratification

processes.

    While an open process for trade negotiations,            such as the Uruguay         Round,      may


make exchanges       of concessions more difficult, a more transparent set of procedures for
                                                    28


  dispute settlement would seem to be an improvement,                  especially for disputes arising

  over the trade effects of domestic policies, such as those under the S&P and TBT

  agreements.       Under     these agreements,     either party to a dispute         can request     the

  formation of a technical expert group to examine the scientific merits of standards that

  appear stricter than international norms.        The work of the expert group is then used by

  the panel; such panels may, but are not required to, seek information from outside

  sources.      Some have suggested      that a special catego~          of cases be established      for

  environmentally-related      disputes, before which expert opinion can also be placed.




  Subsidies     and Competitiveness     Issues

       Questions     will also arise post        Singapore   about     the relationship     between   to

  environment, subsidies and competitiveness.            These include whether to change current

  trade rules that restrict export and domestic subsidies, even if used for environmental

  protection; whether relatively lower environmental standards should be countervailable;

  and whether trade discipline on the use of subsidies might be environmentally beneficial.

       The Uruguay Round increased restraints on the use of export subsidies, and these

  new rules apply equally to pollution             abatement    and other        non-primary    product

  industries,    The idea behind limiting the use of export subsidies is to both prevent an

  ‘unfair’ trade advantage accruing to exporters receiving such subsidies, and to achieve

  neutrality with respect to trade policies (i.e., tariffs and export subsidies).

       Export subsidies for environmentally          friendly products     are seen as a mechanism

. through which environmental protection technology could be transferred to developing

  countries,    even though     cash transfers to developing         countries   adopting   appropriate

  environmental policies and not tied to purchase of particular products, would be more
                                                  29


efficient.    However, there is a general reluctance to allow the use of such subsidies in

light of experience in agriculture where subsidy wars have occurred.               Furthermore,     if

not carefilly     designed,    such special exceptions      for export subsidies could lead to

incentives to adopt end-of-pipe        clean-up technologies       as opposed    to products      and

processes that pollute less and are inherently cleaner,          Also, any use of such subsidies

should be approached          with caution because they can stimulate entry into polluting

industries.     Allowance for domestic environmental          subsidies not ‘generally available’

would also need to be carefully designed to prevent abuse.

     Thus, while environmental allowances for export and domestic subsidies will likely

be explored post Singapore,         particularly with respect to increasing access for less-

developed countries to environmental protection technology, this will probably be done

cautiously so that incentives to use subsidies (as opposed to ‘polluter-pays’ policies) do

not grow,




Other GATT Articles

     Post Singapore there will also likely be a discussion of environmental issues with

other GATT Articles outside of Article XX,                Table 1 earlier gives a list of GATT

articles which could potentially       come under scrutiny in any attempt to rewrite the

GATT/WTO in the light of environmental concerns.

     Articles I and III, the non-discrimination        and national treatment cornerstones of the

GATT, could bean initial focal point for such efforts, The objective would be that they

be modified so as to allow discriminatory          trade actions on environmental        grounds.

While Article XX is the natural route for countries seeking to use such measures, this

will likely not preclude such changes being sought in the fiture,               Under Article IX,
                                                        30


 various ecolabelling, issues such as those implied by recent EU policy may be raised. At

 issue     is the    extent     to    which    such    measures       represent      non-transparent      trade

 discrimination, or impose added costs on foreign producers.

       Possible issues with Articles XI and XIII could be discriminatory                         import bans

similar to those under dispute in the tuna-dolphin case. Pressures could be exerted here

for special environmental            exceptions to these two Articles, without the need to argue

cases under the general exceptions of Article XX.

       Micle      XVIII, which implies less stringent discipline on less-developed                 countries’

use of tariffs and trade restrictions either to promote infant industries or for balance-of-

payments reasons, could be a firther focal point. Arguments could be made here either

to grant firther special rights to developing countries to allow use of trade restrictions

which are, in some way, environmentally                  enhancing.       Alternatively,     existing special

provisions could be restricted to make them conditional on the environment impacts of

the policies used.

       With Article XIX, which deals with safeguards,                      (circumstances      under which

countries      can use trade-restricting          measures    to deal with import surges into their

markets), an argument that has surfaced is the need for special rules to deal with surges

from countries with environmentally               lax standards or to deal with imports of products

from      areas   of recently        determined     environmental        damage,       A    requirement    for

environmental impact statements to be added into Article XXIV, which deals with free

trade areas, is one possible direction that discussion could take.

       Finally, Part IV of the GATT (Articles XXVV-XXXVIII),                         which both details the

special and differential treatment            developing     countries    are to receive in the trading

system,     could    still be an important          element    in a fiture         trade   and environment
                                               31


negotiation, because of the basic commitment it gives to developing countries to open

trade and, hence, compensation for environmental restraint.




Environment        in a New Trnde Round

     As noted above, we are still some considerable way from the launch of a new trade

round   in the WTO,        and some have even suggested         that with ongoing      2-yearly

ministerial meetings, a form of permanent negotiation might replace the GATT Rounds

of the past.     As I have indicated in a recent piece with Colleen Hamilton (Whalley and

Hamilton,      1996), I would see this as unlikely for a number of reasons; deadlines to

terminate force decisions; initial agenda forming negotiations define the bargaining set;

and they also focus the reciprocal dealing to follow.       Also, the 10-year implementation

period for the Uruguay Round makes the launch of a new Round quickly unlikely.

Nonetheless,      even for Singapore there have been calls for a commitment to be made

to Global Free Trade by 2015 to lead the way to new multilateral               negotiations   to

counterbalance     regional initiatives such as APEC and FTW.

    Where then does trade and environment fit into all this?            I suggested above that

trade and environment       seemingly is in the odd position of having enormous political

momentum        behind it as a lead issue for a fiture   negotiation,   while at technical and

negotiating level seemingly being boxed in by problems of precedent and diticulties           of

counteracting     the intent of established    trade   rules.   These    problems   are greatly

compounded       by the North-South   divide which seems to face any proposed significant

change in the area,

    Trade and environment will in my view remain a lead symbolic issue to the WTO

work programme,         but several developments       could serve to slowly downplay         its
significance    in a fiture   Round,   One Wou[d be a fiture   Round   more heavily focused on

traditional    reciprocity than rule writing (exchanges of concessions involving the new

(post Uruguay Round) tariffs in agriculture, post MFA elimination tariffs in apparel,

bound tariffs in developing countries),        Another would be fragmentation         of the current

four “new-new”22 key issues of environment, Iabour standards, competition policy and

investment     into separate     negotiating   boxes, which could happen with competition

policy and investment.        Yet another would be the continued non emergence of an issue

on which developing countries could be given something in return for concessions by

them on environment.

     Thus, the post Singapore scenario I see is a continued high political profile for the

trade and environment         issue in the GATT/WTO,     but with little substantive agreement

either before or during a subsequent negotiating Round.

 IV. IVIDER DIMENSIONS OF TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT
     LINKAGE POST SINGAPORE


        Because of the arguments I make above regarding the prospects for progress post

 Singapore in the GATT/WTO              on fiture trade and environment linkage, it should be no

surprise that I also argue that the way that the trade and environment issue evolves post

Singapore will reflect a range of factors beyond the technicalities of the GATT.                       These

include the likely quantitative importance of what is at stake, the political divisions the

issue    creates    and environmental         provisions   of regional         trade    arrangements    (not

discussed here in any detail)2s,




Implications       of Qllnntification      of Trade find Environment           Linkagesz’

        The    preliminary   indications      now    beginning     to   emerge         from   model    based

quantitative analyses of trade and environment interactions is that those that have been

the subject of most debate and discussion in the GATT and other fora thus far may be

of largely symbolic importance,            with only limited consequences              for global economic

performance,         On the other hand, the trade consequences                  of major environmental

intementions       not yet figuring prominently in the trade and environment debate, such as

those that would follow from a possible global carbon tax, could seemingly be more

substantial,      In an extreme case, they might even reverse the growth in world trade in

manufactures        that we have seen in the last four decades                   of GATT-based         trade

liberalization.      These    studies    typically   involve     calibration     of models      to various




23However, see the discussion in Es[y (1994) and in Uin~onen and Whalley (1996).

24This subsection draws on the discussion in Whalley ( 1996b).

   benchmark or base case data sets, followed by counterfactual                 analysis around base

   cases.

           One study suggesting      small effects from those trade and environment               policy

   linkages discussed thus far is Perroni and Wigle (1994) whose model covers six goods

   and sectors chosen to allow a separation between industries with more emissions and

   those    with less, and to also allow separation              of higher technology      from lower

   technology industries.     They calibrate their model to a 1986 global data set covering 3

   major regions,    (North      herica,     Other Developed        and Low and Middle          Income

   countries),   and a variety of pollutant        activities.   Emissions   generated    by industrial

  activity interact with various natural and geographical           processes, including absorption

  and transmission     of particulate        via the atmosphere      and oceans,    impacting     global

  environmental     standards,    and hence environmental          quality for consumers,       Having

  calibrated their model to a 1986 benchmark data set, Perroni and Wig,le are able to

  analyze the effects of increased trade on environmental               quality by alternative trade

  policy scenarios, including removal of all global trade barriers in their model.                 They

  directly capture the welfare effects of changes in environmental standards in the form of

  damage finctions in explicit utility evaluations.

       Their model results suggest that increased international trade generally has little

  impact on environmental         quality.   They also conclude that the magnitude of welfare

  effects of environmental       policies are not significantly affected by simultaneous changes

  in trade policies when new environmental policies are introduced, Furthermore,                the size

. and regional distribution       of the gains from trade liberalization        appears    to be little

  affected by environmental policies. Their tentative conclusion is that the extent of trade
                                                        35


   and environment         interactions   seem smaller than might have beeen suggested               by the

   intensity of debate on trade and environment up to the time of their writing (1993).

         Another model based piece examining more conventional                       trade and environment

   linkages is Low (1992), which attracted substantial attention when published because of

   the similar conclusion that the trade impacts of environmentally oriented trade policies

   seem sma112j. Low reports a model based calculation of the effects of possible trade

   barriers being adopted in the United States to countemail perceived lax standards in key

   trading partners, including Mexico, and reports their impacts on trade, He uses data on

   pollution abatement costs by type of expenditure and by sector for the United States,

   which are, in turn, used to infer at what level trade barriers             could be introduced in the

   US to counteract competitive disadvantages under an assumption of zero costs being

   incurred by firms in Mexico, The effects of such trade barriers on trade are then

   analyzed,       using   a model    structure     which    captures     relevant    demand   and supply

   elasticities,

        Low identifies pollution intensive, or ‘dirty’ industries, as those with the highest

   pollution       abatement   expenditures.        These    industries     are evaluated      as to their

   contribution      to Mexico’s exports, and a simulation used to assess the effects on the

  exports of a special US import tax along the lines outlined above, In Low’s data, such

  expenditures       currently represented        only a small part of total costs incurred by US




  25Lo\v’s conclusion is also consistent \\’ith that reached by Tobey (1990) \vho uses an econometric
  approach to test the significance of pollution effects in a Heksher-Ohlin-Vanek model. A commodity’s
‘ relative pollution intensity is defined in terms of pollution abatement costs incurred in production
  compared to similar US data, }vith endokvment data from Learner (1984), and trade data from UN trade
  statistics. Tobey’s conclusion is that stringent environmental regulations imposed on industries in the
  late 1960s and early 1970s by most industrial countries have not affected trade patterns to any
  measurable extent in the most heavily polluting industries. A more recent piece by Levinsohn (1994)
  concludes that differing environmental regulations across stales have little effect on location decisions;
  in part because, once again, the cost shares involved are smal 1.
                                                      36


 industries, with only 18 out of 123 industries incurring more than 10/0of the value of

 their output in pollution abatement costs,           On this basis alone, the impact of a special

 import tax, while still dependent on assumed values of elasticities, would thus be likely

 to be small.

       Using a simple elasticity-based approach and 1986 data, Low’s results suggest that

the imposition       of such a tax would cause a reduction of less than 2°/0 in Mexico’s

exports.       This compares with an approximate doubling in real terms for Mexico’s trade

with     the    United   States     between    1985    and    1992,    suggesting     that,   if actually

implemented,       such environmentally       based trade measures would have only a small

effect on direct trade flows, because the cost components                   involved are themselves

small.

       However,     a firther     set of model based analyses, analyzing the effects of major

global environmental       initiatives due to Whalley and Wigle (1991) and Piggott, Whalley

and Wigle (1993) in two interrelated modelling papers, suggest that much larger trade

effects would follow from new global arrangements                     designed to deal with major

environmental problems, such as carbon emissions.              The purpose of these two papers is

to analyze the effects such as a possible carbon tax set at levels designed to stabilize

global carbon emissions at early 1990s levels (the so-called ‘Toronto                    call’, afier the

setting of such an objective at a 1989 global scientific conference in Toronto)2b.                     In

both models, there is a production            and demand structure in each region, with CES

production finctions      defined over primary factors and other inputs. Primary factors, in

turn, are broken down into energy and non-energy inputs, which cover greenhouse and

   non-greenhouse,      and carbon and non-carbon      products,      This leads to production     of

   composite      energy and, in turn, the eventual production       of energy intensive and non-

   energy intensive products.     International trade then takes place in energy-intensive       and

   other goods, and carbon based products,

       In the first piece, the possible international      impacts of carbon tax options         are

  evaluated,      In the second the extent of sub-regional or unilateral country reduction in

  carbon emissions which would be undertaken to deal with global warming are analyzed,

  using a model extension        with an explicit parameterization        of preferences   towards

  climate change.      Results from these models suggest large effects on international trade

  flows from major environmental          policy interventions,     such as a carbon tax,        The

  published papers do not directly report trade impacts since this was not their major

  focus, but in the presence of large carbon taxes which apply to a significant input

  component for manufacturing       (and where the tax rates required range as high as 800°/0

  in order to generate reductions in carbon emissions to stabilize globally at 1990 levels)

  the cost component feeding through to manufactures is large. The result is a potentially

  major impact on international      trade in manufactures,       and resulting changes in global

  trade patterns.    Global consumption    of energy intensive manufactures falls sharply, and

  with it global trade.     Some model scenarios suggest that taxes at such high levels as

  these could have more major consequences             for trade     in the global economy        as

  developments under GATT the post-war years.

       Thus, for example, in Whalley and Wigle (1991) there are major changes in net

. trade patterns between energy intensive goods and other goods for major regions.

  Japan, for instance, changes from net exporter of energy intensive manufacturers            to a

  net importer,     Other Europe, including eastern Europe, changes from a net importer to
                                                      38


     a net exporter, and the EU also changes from a net exporter to a net importer. In some


     results in Piggott,   Whalley    and Wigle (1993, p. 127) there are firther reductions in trade


     in the order of 50°/0 from large global carbon taxes.

          The implication is that major environmental policy initiatives in the post Singapore

    trading system may have more significant impacts on trade pattern, than initiatives

    undertaken within the GATT/WTO             framework to more directly address the trade and

    environment issue.       The GATT/WTO          has little to say about such initiatives, and yet

    their implications for trade could overwhelm the trade impacts of anything done directly

    in the WTO on the trade and environment issue. While a carbon agreement may still be

    some years (or even decades) away, its significance for the trade and environment

    debate seems clear.




    Developing     Countries,    Property    Rights and Trnde and Environ mel]t

         A further important factor to take into account in charting the fiture of the trade

    and environment        debate post Singapore involves the developing             countries,   who see

    linkage of trade to environmental          quality as being driven largely by environmental

    interests in the higher rather than the lower income countries.27 Their implicit argument

    is that environmental       quality is a luxury good, and see consumer preferences             of the

    higher income countries,         not the lower income countries,       as behind proposed        rules

    linking trade and environment.          From their perspective,      these rules largely involve

    threats of trade restrictions being placed on their exports to pressure them to change

.   their environmental      policies,   while richer industrialized     countries     seem not to be




        27See the more extensive discussion of the developing counlry position on [hese issues in Whalley
    (1994).
                                                      39


targeted. The outcome they fear is that their growth and development                     is truncated by

policies targeted at environmental conservation objectives set for their economies from

outside.     Developing countries, therefore, talk of ‘green’ or ‘eco’ imperialism, arguing

that if the trading system continues to develop in this way, in the long run it can only be

disadvantageous      to them.

      The tension is between the objectives of environmental                   advocates      in industrial

countries,    and the strongly stated interest of developing countries                 in being able to

pursue trade-led developmental          strategies free from trade restrictions,         including those

motivated by environmental           concerns.      The developing countries also emphasize the

extensive unilateral liberalization that has taken place in the developing world in the late

1980s and early 1990s, the trade gains which have flowed from this, and the industrial

countries    who have strongly         supported      it.   Trade restrictions      against    developing

countries in the name of environmental concerns of the wealthy in the developed world

seem, to developing countries, to mn counter to what they have been encouraged to do

in recent years within the trading       system.


     Developing countries thus argue their property rights as far as any fiture trade and

environment linkage is concerned,            On issues such as deforestation,28 they argue that

the developed countries industrialized             two hundred years ago and largely deforested

during the process.      They question the grounds on which the developed countries now

assert rights over management            of forests in developing        countries,    when their own

deforestation    was so clearly unrestrained         in earlier years.    Some developing countries

go even firther and argue that they should be compensated for showing environmental

products,
                                                            40


restraint,     rather    than being penalized          if they fail to adopt environmental                    policies

advocated by industrial countries.

      These issues were strongly in evidence at the ‘Earth Summit’ in 1993 at Rio de

Janiero.       The Summit          was held as part of the United                       Nations     Conference     on

Environment          and Development           (UNDED),          and the North-South            tensions     over the

property rights issues discussed above were clearly evident.                         Three agreements resulted

from the Rio meeting; the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;                                     Agenda

21; and the Forest Principles.               Two further agreements were separately negotiated but

signed at      RO;      the   UN   Framework         Convention           on Climate      Change,     and the     UN


Convention       on Biological     Diversity.

     The Rio Declaration            states    (in Principle       12) that trade     policy     measures     used for


environmental         purposes     should     not involve         arbitrary    discrimination     or be disguised

trade restrictions,       and that unilateral      actions       should   be avoided.      Chapter    2 of Agenda

21 stresses     that all countries     should     benefit     from an open trading system.             While in no

way representing         binding and enforceable commitments,                    these statements      nonetheless

add political support to developing country positions on trade and environment issues,

and threaten to fiel whatever post Singapore divisions emerge on the issue.

     Post-Singapore,          trade and environment              is also one of several elements of trade

policy linkage to non trade objectives which threatens to revive North-South                               tensions in

the trading system (trade and Iabour standards is another).                         These were pronounced in

the 1970s and early 1980s, but began to ebb in the mid 1980s when many developing

countries abandoned            import substitution          protection,       liberalised unilaterally, and then

participated     much more actively than before in the Uruguay Round.                                 Having been

assured      that the trading        system would           be structured         to speed their growth           and
                                                   41


  development,       finding in the mid 1990s that trade barriers against them may go up

  because of environmental        concerns can only serve to uni~ developing countries in a

  rediscovered common cause.           Mer   moving away from the perceived blocwide interest

  of special and differential treatment         towards   pursuit of count~    interest, trade and

  environment post Singapore could well be the key to reviving the pursuit of a common

  Southern interest.

       The trade and environment         issue is thus seen by several developing countries in

  negative, and even hostile, terms,         To them environmental    pressure groups in wealthy

  countries in the developed world want to set global standards for environmental quality

  which meet their preferences,         not those of the developing       world.   The ability of

  developing       countries to provide environmental       quality at these levels, and in ways

  which do not jeopardize their ability to achieve growth and development, is the issue.

       Their rallying cry is one of compensation          for environmental restraint, rather than

  legimitization     of trade-based   retaliation against environmental   practices through trade

  rules. If developed countries are concerned about forest cover, they have the option of

  replanting    trees in their own countries which they deforested         centuries earlier even

  though       to the more vocal environmental       groups in developed countries     such trees

  represent the lungs of the earth, a communally owned resource to be managed on a

  global basis. Developing countries thus see a policy agenda emerging in the developed

  world in which trade and environment           plays a major role which seeks to define the

  parameters of a global resource management regime, independently of their growth and

. development aspirations,

V. CONCLUSIONS

     This paper seeks to map out how the trade and environment issue may play out

after the Singapore WTO ministerial meeting in December                1996, where the WTO

Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) is scheduled to offer its first report.

    The paper first discusses trade and environment narrowly as a GATT/WTO                   issue

arguing both that relatively little is expected to be concluded in Singapore,             and that

change post Singapore looks equally difficult to achieve.       All ways forward to change;

waivers, general GATT/WTO        exceptions, rewriting GATT Articles, seem to encounter

problems,

    The paper then argues that wider developments outside GATT/WTO                  are likely to

prove   equally if not more important        to the fiture     evolution    of the trade       and

environment     issue.   These include the trade impacts of new major environmental

arrangements,    such as global carbon taxes; and the hardening position on these issues in

the developing      world,   When    taken   together   with   other    factors,   such    as the

environmental    provisions of regional trade agreements,      the post Singapore prospects

for trade and environment seem likely to be shaped as much by developments                 outside

the GATT/WTO as within it.
