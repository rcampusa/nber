                                         ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of e-commerce on pricing behavior and welfare. Using Japanese
data, we find that the entry of e-commerce firms significantly raised the rate of intercity price
convergence for goods sold intensively online, but not for other goods. E-commerce also lowered
relative inflation rates for goods sold intensively online. We overcome data challenges using long
data series and historical catalog sales as an instrument for e-commerce sales intensity. We
estimate that reductions in price dispersion raised welfare by 0.3 percent. E-commerce also
lowered variety-adjusted prices on average by 0.9 percent, and more in cities with highly
educated populations.

1    Introduction
How has e-commerce affected prices and consumer welfare? Answering
this question is difficult because researchers often face three data challenges.
First, researchers typically do not have access to data on what share of a
consumer's purchases of any particular good are made online and offline,
making it difficult to assess how important online sales are for most goods.
Second, we lack long time series, which hinders our ability to know whether
price dynamics associated with e-commerce were present even before e-
merchants entered the market. Finally, we lack good instruments for e-
commerce sales intensity that can control for endogeneity biases that might
stem from a correlation between e-commerce entry and market conditions.
    This paper makes use of a unique Japanese data set containing house-
hold expenditure shares by retail channel--catalog, e-commerce, and phys-
ical store--for the set of goods that make up the Japanese consumer price
index (CPI) which enables us to overcome these empirical challenges. The
long time series of our data (1991 to 2016) enables us to control for important
pre-trends in the pricing dynamics of the types of goods available from on-
line merchants. Finally, the fact that the data contains information on cata-
log expenditures by product for the period before the advent of e-commerce
provides us with a powerful instrument to correct for measurement errors
and an endogeneity bias.
    Consistent with Goolsbee and Klenow (2018), we find that goods sell
intensively online have significantly lower relative rates of price increase.
While one might be tempted to attribute this result to the impact of on-
line merchants, we exploit the long time series in our data to show that
this pattern was also true before e-commerce firms entered the Japanese
market. Thus, the differential pattern in pricing behavior seems to be a
characteristic of the types of goods amenable to online sales rather than
a feature of e-commerce per se. Nevertheless, we document that after the
entry of e-commerce merchants, the difference in the rate of price increase
between goods not sold intensively online and those sold intensively rose,


                                       1
suggesting that e-commerce lowered the relative rate of price increase of
e-commerce intensive goods.
    We also document that e-commerce had important impacts on the con-
vergence rates of intercity price differentials at physical stores. We find
that prior to e-commerce, the rate at which the retail price of a good con-
verged across cities was similar regardless of whether that good would ul-
timately be sold intensively online or not. However, after the advent of
the e-commerce, we find that the rate of price convergence for goods sold
online rose significantly, but this was not so for other goods. Based on our
estimates of how e-commerce differentially affected the ability of merchants
to price discriminate across cities, we compute the impact of e-commerce on
Japanese welfare using the model developed in Jensen (2007). We estimate
the welfare gains due to e-commerce to be 0.3 percent of consumption ex-
penditure in 2014 in our baseline specification.
    In addition to the gains arising from improved price arbitrage across
cities, we also compute the consumer gains due to new varieties. We model
goods purchased online as new varieties either because online purchases
enable consumers to buy goods that were not available locally before or
because an online shopping experience differs in important ways (conve-
nience, service, etc.) from an offline shopping experience. As Brynjolfsson
et al. (2003) and Dolfen et al. (2019) have argued, these variety channels are
likely to be quite important, and we follow them by modeling e-commerce
as a new method of conducting retail purchases. We use the approach de-
veloped in Feenstra (1994) to compute the gains due to varieties. Using this
framework, we estimate that e-commerce lowered the price index faced by
consumers by 0.9 percentage points. Interestingly, we also find evidence of
a digital divide in terms of which consumers benefit the most from new va-
rieties. Since e-commerce expenditure shares are strongly correlated with
college education in Japan, these gains accrued far more in cities with pop-
ulations with a high share of college graduates like Tokyo than in cities with
low levels of college education.

1.1    Related Literature
Our results are related to a number of papers examining how informa-
tion technology has affected pricing and welfare. Following Cavallo (2018),
we argue that e-commerce is a technology that promotes uniform pricing
across locations. However, our work differs in our focus on convergence
rates and the resulting welfare implications. Our work is also related to
the large literature has demonstrated that information technology serves to
reduce price dispersion and promote trade. Freund and Weinhold (2004)
show that countries with more web hosts export more to each other. Jensen
(2007), Aker (2010), and Allen (2014) examine the impact of the introduc-
tion of mobile phones on fish or agricultural markets in India, Niger, and
the Philippines, and Steinwender (2018) examines the impact of the transat-
lantic telegraph cables on 19th century textile prices and exports. Our work
is complementary to these papers in that we show that e-retail also serves
to reduce price dispersion across locations. However, we differ in focus and
scope--our study examines the role played by e-commerce in an advanced,
modern economy on the prices of hundreds of goods in physical retailers.
Our paper also relates to the literature on internet pricing. In particular,
Cavallo (2017) shows that online prices and prices in physical stores are
quite similar.1 This fact helps motivate our assumption that local retailers
with high prices should face stiff competition from online retailers.
    Our work is also related to studies of the impact of e-commerce on wel-
fare. Much of this research has focused on the gains from variety that arise
as consumers can purchase products that are not available in local stores.
For example, Brynjolfsson et al. (2003) compute the variety gains from in-
ternet book sales, Fan et al. (2018) examine the relative variety gains in large
and small Chinese cities associated with internet usage; and Dolfen et al.
(2019) estimate the gains from e-retail due to shopping convenience and

   1
     Cavallo (2017) found that the ratio of online to offline prices in Japan tended to be
lower than in other countries, but this may reflect the fact that all but one of his offline
stores in Japan were electronics stores whereas a much broader sample of stores was used
in countries like the US.

                                             3
new varieties in the U.S. An important difference between these studies and
ours is our focus on price convergence across locations and the fact that we
make use of representative surveys in order to measure internet sales inten-
sities.
    Other papers have examined how the internet affects local markets.
Goldmanis et al. (2010) examine regional patterns in online purchase be-
havior change the market structure in bookstores, travel agencies and car
dealers. Goyal (2010) finds that the introduction of internet kiosks raised
soy prices in rural India. Couture et al. (2018) conduct a randomized con-
trol trial in eight rural Chinese counties and find little effect of the introduc-
tion of e-commerce on the local economy. Brown and Goolsbee (2002) show
that the creation of online insurance sales systems reduced the variance of
insurance pricing. Our work differs from these studies in terms of scope
(the large number of different sectors considered), the link to physical retail
prices across an entire economy, and identification strategy (the ability to
examine differential rates of price convergence before and after the advent
of e-commerce).
    Finally, our paper is also related to the large literature on purchasing
power parity convergence regressions. Parsley and Wei (1996) were the
first to document that differences in convergence coefficients across cities
were linked to trade costs, an insight that we build upon in this paper. We
estimate that intercity convergence rates for Japan are higher than those ob-
tained in Parsley and Wei (1996) and Cecchetti et al. (2002). These studies
found no price convergence across U.S. cities once one controlled for city
fixed effects. In contrast, we find that the advent of e-commerce is associ-
ated with a significant rise in the rate of price convergence for goods with
high internet sales intensity after the advent of e-commerce. Our ability to
better detect intercity price convergence probably arises from the fact that
Japanese CPI data is based on the sampling of identical or extremely simi-
lar goods across cities, whereas U.S. price data is based on similar but non-
identical sets of goods across cities. Our approach also builds off Bergin
et al. (2017), who employ a similar triple difference strategy to show that


                                        4
rates of price convergence across European countries increased after join-
ing the euro area. It is also related to Crucini et al. (2015) who examine how
distance affects the rate of price convergence across cities.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 intro-
duces the estimation strategy and provides the theory for the welfare cal-
culation. Section 3 presents the data and provides some stylized facts about
e-commerce suitability. Section 4.1 presents our results on national prices.
We present our main estimates for the impact of e-commerce on price con-
vergence and welfare in Section 4.2. Section 4.3 presents consumer gains in
the new trade theory models, and Section 5 concludes.

2     Theory
In Section 2.1, we model the impact that e-commerce has had on interre-
gional price differentials and show how the decline in these differentials
raises welfare in Section 2.2.

2.1   Estimating the Impact of the E-Retail on Price Arbitrage
We begin by defining some notation. Let pict  ln Pict be the log price of item
i in city c in time t. Define the k operator as k pict  pict - pic,t-k ; thus,
if we set k = 1, we can examine annual changes, but we can also examine
longer differences by setting k equal to a whole number larger than one.
Let xEib  [0, 1] be the "e-commerce sales intensity" of a good measured in
a survey year b, where zero indicates it is not sold online and one indicates
that its share of online sales relative to offline sales is the highest among
all goods. Let Dt be an indicator variable that is one if e-commerce is an
option in period t and zero otherwise. We assume that the change in the
price of any item in a city c can be written as a standard purchasing price
parity specification in which the rate of price convergence depends on their
availability online, i.e.,




                                      5
        k pict = it + ct +  + 1 xE                 E
                                 ib + 2 Dt + 3 Dt xib pic,t-k +       ict      (1)
                = it + ct + iE (Dt ) pic,t-k +   ict ,


where iE (Dt )   + 1 xE                       E
                            ib + 2 Dt + 3 Dt xib . In this specification, it is an
item-time fixed effect; ct is a city-time fixed effect;  is a parameter that cap-
tures the rate of intercity price convergence for goods not available online;
1 is a parameter that captures the rate of price convergence for goods avail-
able online prior to the entry of e-commerce firms; 2 captures whether there
was a change in overall convergence rates after the entry of e-commerce
firms; 3 captures the increase in rate of price convergence for online goods
after the entry of e-commerce firms; and ict is an iid error term. We think of
this error as a price shock arising from period t local supply-and-demand
conditions for an item in a city that is not common to all items in the city
and is uncorrelated with past prices.
    If iE (Dt ) = -1, equation (1) collapses to pict = it + ct + ict , and there-
fore the price of any item can be decomposed into its national price (it ), a
common local market premium (ct ), and an iid error term that is not per-
sistent. In this case, any idiosyncratic price shock to a good in a city ( ict )
has no impact on prices in the next period. Hence, price convergence occurs
in one period, and prices always equal their conditional mean of (it + ct )
plus a random iid shock. At the other extreme, we have the case of where
iE (Dt ) = 0, which implies that prices follow a random walk with a drift
term given by (it + ct ). In intermediate cases where iE (Dt )  (-1, 0) ,
prices converge across cities by price differences across cities can persist for
more than k years.

2.2   Welfare in Partial Equilibrium
We can map the price changes into welfare gains by using the framework
developed in Jensen (2007). Jensen considered a technological change that
enabled arbitrage between a high-priced region (H ) and a low-priced region


                                        6
(L). If e-commerce reduces price dispersion, we should expect the price in
region H to fall and the price in L to rise as shown in Figure 1. Consumers
in H will gain (A + B ), and sellers will gain (C - A), yielding a net gain
of (B + C ). Similarly, in region L, consumers will lose (D + E ) and sellers
will gain (D - F ), yielding a net loss of (E + F ). Overall, the welfare gain
is (B + C ) - (E + F ), which will necessarily be positive in the case of linear
demands with equal slopes as long as the final price in H is at least as large
as the price in the region L (i.e., P (QH + Q)  P (QL - Q)). One can also
see this condition holds in the figure because both trapezoids (B + C ) and
(E + F ) have identical bases and differ only in the lengths of their parallel
sides.

    Jensen (2007) considered a case in which the marginal cost of supplying
a good is zero, which enabled him to compute the lengths of the parallel
sides of the quasi-trapezoids by just using the prices. When thinking about
production more generally, however, marginal costs are likely to be positive,
so technically we should subtract marginal costs from prices when comput-
ing the lengths of the parallel sides of the quasi-trapezoids. However, as

                                                               7
one can see from Figure 1, if we assume constant and equal marginal cost
of production for a given good, then G = G , and we can still compute the
welfare gain as (B + C + G) - E + F + G = (B + C ) - (E + F ).2
    We can use our estimates of the impact of e-commerce on price conver-
gence to calibrate the Jensen model. In order to compute the partial equilib-
rium welfare gain due to e-commerce, we consider the difference in implied
gains in two counterfactual cases. In each case, we assume that the economy
has deviated from a steady-state equilibrium but experiences different rates
of price convergence. The first case corresponds to one in which consumers
do not have access to e-commerce, so price convergence is slow, which re-
sults in small movements towards a common price. The second case is one
in which consumers do have access, which results in greater price conver-
gence and therefore greater welfare gains. We then set the welfare gain as-
sociated with e-commerce to be equal to the difference in the welfare gains
arising from the different convergence rates.
    Let D denote each counterfactual case, where D = 0 corresponds to a
counterfactual with no e-commerce, and D = 1 corresponds to a counterfac-
tual with e-commerce. We will consider a counterfactual in which observed
prices constitute deviations from a free-trade steady state in which goods
prices are the same in all cities p       
                                    ic = pi . One of the features of thinking
about convergence to this free-trade steady state is that we can show that
there will always exist a p i such that price convergence towards that level
will result in no net increase in demand, as in Jensen (2007). A necessary
condition for the existence of steady-state prices (pic ) is


                          p                   E        
                           ic = 0 = it + ct + i (Dt ) pi .                               (2)

   By definition, the common steady-state prices (p    i ) do not vary with t.
           E
Similarly, i (Dt ) will not vary with t as long as we remain in a counterfac-
tual world in which Dt (which we now refer to as D) always equals zero
    2
      The assumption of equal marginal costs is probably not extreme for Japan given the
small physical size of the country (most major cities are within a few hours drive of Tokyo),
which means that transport costs are unlikely to produce large price differences across
cities.

                                             8
or one. Therefore, it must be the case that in the free-trade steady state,
              
it + ct = i    . This condition intuitively implies that in the steady state it
and ct cannot vary with time, so it = i and ct = c t =   . Thus, we can
rewrite this equation as

                                
                            0 = i +   + iE (D) pi.                                    (3)

   Suppose that we start in this steady state and perturb steady-state prices
(pi ) in period T - 1 to some other values, pic,T -1 . In period T , we will observe
                                  
prices change by picT (D) = i      +   + iE (D)pic,T -1 . If we subtract equation
(3) from this equation, we obtain

                       picT (D) = iE (D) (pic,T -1 - pi).                             (4)

Using the log change as an approximation for the percentage change,
the price level in period T , PicT (D), can be written as PicT (D) =
Pic,T -1 1 + picT (D) . If we assume a constant elasticity of substitution
(CES) demand system, the demand for good i in city c in time t in coun-
terfactual D is given by
                                                                                1
                                                                       1-
            (Pict (D) /ic )-
                                                                               1-

where  is the demand elasticity. It will also be useful to denote the log
change in the city price index by pct = ln [Pct (D) /Pc,t-1 ].
     Following Jensen, we consider a set of price changes that are consistent
with equation (4) and imply no aggregate quantity changes, i.e., QiT (D) =
   c QicT (D ) = 0. In other words, just as Jensen made the partial equi-
librium assumption that eliminating deviations in fish prices did not raise
aggregate consumption of fish, we are assuming that eliminating regional
price variation in e-commerce intensive products (e.g., books) did not in-
crease aggregate consumption of books. Equation (5) implies that
           q icT (D) = ( - 1) pcT (D) -  picT (D) +  ln EcT ,

where ln Qict = qict . If we make the partial equilibrium assumption that

                                         9
aggregate prices and urban expenditures are unchanged, this equation re-
duces to
                              qicT (D) = - picT (D) .                                 (6)

Using the log change as an approximation for the percentage change, the
counterfactual change in urban consumption in any city c in time T can be
written as QicT (D) = Qic,T -1 q icT (D). Substituting equation (6) into this
equation and summing produces

                                     Qic,T -1 picT (D) = 0.                           (7)
                                 c

If we then substitute equation (4) into equation (7), we obtain

                              Qic,T -1 iE (D) [pic,T -1 - pi ] = 0,
                          c

which means that the steady-state price for each good is given by
                                         E
                             c Qic,T -1 i (D ) pic,T -1

   The welfare gain arising from prices moving from their values in T - 1
towards their steady state values (Pi ) can be written as

                    1
       WicT =         (2PicT -1 + P icT (D)) QicT (D) - mi QicT (D) ,
                    2

where mi is the marginal cost of producing the good. This welfare gain will
be positive whenever prices are higher than their steady-state levels and
negative otherwise.
   The national welfare change associated with a price convergence toward
steady state price levels equals

                1
  WiT (D) =              (2PicT -1 + P icT (D)) QicT (D) - mi             QicT (D).

3       Data
Japanese data is useful for testing the theory because e-commerce expanded
rapidly in Japan, which allows us to break the time series into pre- and
post-e-commerce periods. Moreover, the share of e-commerce transactions
in Japan is similar to those in the U.S.3 By April of 2000, when Japan's
largest e-commerce firm, Rakuten, announced its initial public offering, it
had grown to be a platform in which consumers had access to goods avail-
able from 2,300 merchants, and the Rakuten website was getting 95 mil-
lion hits per month--almost one hit for every man, woman, and child in
Japan.4 The following year sales on the Rakuten platform exceeded ¥52 bil-
lion (about $430 million). Thus, within five years, Japanese consumers in
any city went from only being able to buy locally or from catalogs to being
able to purchase goods from thousands of merchants located across Japan.
Rakuten's growth was part of a broader e-commerce boom in Japan. Ama-
zon entered the Japanese market in 2001, with Rakuten still accounting for

      Japan's Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry reports that 5.8% of all
retail transactions were done online in 2017, roughly equalling the U.S. level
in 2014.          See http://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/0425_002.html and
https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf.        While we do
not know when each city obtained broadband internet, we do know that every pre-
fecture in Japan had digital subscriber lines (DSL) and cable TV connections available
by 2001, and about a quarter of all households were subscribing to DSL by the end
of 2004. In addition, many consumers also used cell phones to make purchases.

30% of Japanese e-commerce transactions in 2010.5 By 2017, e-commerce
firms accounted for 5.8 percent of Japanese retail sales or about ¥16.5 tril-
lion (about $149 billion).
       A major advantage of Japanese data is that one can obtain measures of
consumer expenditures by product and retail outlet. The National Survey
of Family Income and Expenditures (NSFIE) is a representative survey of
households with two or more members that reports consumer expenditures
by product and retail outlet type.6 Starting in 2004, the NSFIE also began a
quinquennial recording the expenditure share of each product from online
merchants.
       One of the problems with the NSFIE data is that it tends to under-
report aggregate internet sales because mixed-method retailing (e.g., seeing
a product in a store and buying it online tends to be placed in the "other"
category). Fortunately, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI)
reports very reliable aggregate estimates of sales by e-commerce and other
retailers by surveying actual sales to consumers by retail merchants. We
therefore scale the NSFIE data by the ratio of aggregate sales in the METI
data relative to the NSFIE data in order to obtain the same value for ag-
gregate e-commerce sales in the two datasets. In order to make sure that
sampling problems are not driving our results, we will use catalog sales as
an instrument to deal with classical measurement error and also conduct a
robustness check for all of our main results using data on Rakuten sales by
product category.
       We construct a measure of the e-commerce sales intensity for each of
the CPI expenditure categories by computing the share of online expen-
ditures in total expenditures. Let eib denote the average household total
expenditures in category i in survey year (b  {1999, 2004, 2009, 2014}. We
denote expenditures in category i from retail channel r in survey year b by
srib , where r can take on three values (E, C, and R): the first two are based on


   5
     Rakuten, Inc. (2010) Annual Report.

     The retail outlet types are small retail, supermarket, convenience, department, club,
discount, catalog, internet, and "other".

expenditure data from the NSFIE survey of e-commerce and catalog expen-
ditures and the last is based on Rakuten's reported e-commerce sales. We
then define the retail channel "intensity" xr
                                            ib of category i by dividing the ex-
penditures through retail channel r by total expenditures (eib ), normalized
by the maximum value of this ratio, i.e.,
                                    sr        sr
                            xr
                             ib =
                                     ib
                                        / max jb .                         (10)
                                    eib    j  ejb

Thus, our measure of the expenditure intensity of retail channel r equals
zero if there are no expenditures on goods via a retail channel r in expendi-
ture category i and a value of 1 if the expenditure through retail channel r
relative to that in the economy is the highest among all categories of goods
sold through that retail channel. Expressing retail channel intensity this way
makes our intensity variable (xr ib ) invariant to the size of sector i.
    Table 1 makes clear some basic stylized facts of our data. In order
to see how e-commerce intensity varies across products, we aggregate
the FIES product categories into broader ones so that we can display the
data in a compact form. The rows are ordered by a category's share
of Japanese expenditures on goods. The first column of Table 1 reports
the percentage of expenditures in category among goods in 2009 as re-
ported in the FIES (E b  i eib / j ejb × 100), where  is the set of
items in some more aggregated category . In the second column, we
report the percentage of online expenditure in 2009 that corresponds to
that category (S E b 
                               E
                            i sib /
                                          E                   E
                                       j sjb × 100), where sib is online expen-
diture from NSFIE). Columns 3-5 report the e-commerce intensity (i.e.,
xE      E                 E
  b  S b /E b / maxk Skb /Ekb ) .
    There are three important takeaways from this table. First, there is
enormous variation in the e-commerce intensity. Some of this reflects the
fact that highly perishable, non-standardized items (e.g. fresh foods), and
restricted/time-sensitive items (e.g., medicine and physical newspapers)
are not sold much online. At the other end of the spectrum, we see that
more standardized goods--e.g., electronics, books, clothing, footwear, and

     Note: Shares are expressed as percentages. This table shows the share of consumption expenditure, e-commerce expenditure, and

     (10).
furniture and furnishings--are sold very intensively online. Interestingly,
we see that domestic utensils, household consumables (which include non-
durable household supplies like paper products and cleaning agents), and
recreational goods (which include items like sports equipment and garden-
ing supplies) are sold very intensively online as well. Second, if we compare
the values for 2004, 2009, and 2014, we see a lot of persistence in what is sold
online. Newspapers, meat, dairy products, and fruit and vegetables were
not sold much online in 2004 and have low e-commerce sales intensity in
all subsequent years. Similarly, electronics has the highest internet sales in-
tensity in all of the survey years. Third, as one can see in the second-to-last
column, Rakuten sales intensity is highly correlated with e-commerce sales
in the NSFIE data ( = 0.57), which suggests that these datasets are in broad
agreement as to what goods are sold intensively online.
    One of the other striking features of the table is that if we compare cata-
log sales intensity (column 7) with e-commerce intensity (columns 3-6), we
see that there is a lot of similarity between goods that are sold intensively
online and goods that were sold intensively by catalogs in 1999. In that
year, e-commerce firms in Japan were still in their infancy: Amazon had not
yet entered the Japanese market and Rakuten only had 5.5 million dollars
worth of sales on its platform (Olson (2012)). Thus, we can be fairly con-
fident that Japanese catalog sales were probably not much influenced by
e-commerce sales. Nevertheless, it is clear that goods sold intensively on-
line tend to have characteristics that are similar to those goods historically
available in catalogs, which will motivate our instrument.
    In addition to the retail sales data that we have been discussing, we also
make use of the fact that the Japan Statistical Bureau (JSB), which produces
the Japanese CPI, provides detailed information on representative prices.
These prices are sampled in 168 cities on average, which gives us the ability
to not only track product prices across time but also across space. This in-
formation identifies the brand of an item or provides a detailed description
(e.g., "Big-eyed tuna, sliced (for sashimi), lean, 100g"). Since the objective
of the JSB sampling is to make meaningful intercity price comparisons, the


                                      15
JSB tries to select products available in all cities. Finally, we use the official
quality-adjusted price quotes for Tokyo computed by the JSB in order to ad-
just the prices in other cities when goods are substituted into and out of the
sample.7
    One potential concern with these data is that the JSB may not be sam-
pling the same goods in different cities, so unlike barcode data in which
goods are precisely defined, some of the price variation in our sample may
be capturing unmeasured quality variation instead. Since Hottman, Red-
ding, and Weinstein (2016) show that the correlation between price and
quality in barcode data is 0.9, we should expect sampling problems to pro-
duce greater levels of price dispersion in JSB data because it would be cap-
turing both price and quality variation. In order to check for this, we com-
                                                                          1
pute the log relative price of each good in each city ( p  ~ict = pict - C   c pict )
and take the standard deviation of p   ~ict . When we do this, we find that the
standard deviation of intercity price differences for the same good in Japan
is 17 percent. By contrast, Broda and Weinstein (2008) find the standard de-
viation in intercity prices of bar-coded goods is 22 percent in the US and 19
percent for Canadian provinces. The fact that intercity price dispersion of
goods in the Japanese CPI is lower than that for bar-coded goods in the US
and Canada suggests that the JSB item definitions probably do not include
goods that differ substantially in quality in different cities and therefore that
quality variation across cities for the same product is unlikely to be a major
problem in our data.8
    Table 2 reports the sample statistics for our data. The first three lines
of the table report the measure of e-commerce intensity (xE      ib ) computed for
each of the survey years b  {2004, 2009, 2014}. These summary statistics
highlight the skewness in the distribution of e-retail sales intensity that we
saw in Table 1. Some goods are sold very intensively online, but most goods
are purchased predominantly in physical stores. Looking at the value of e-

commerce intensity in the middle of the period (xE     i09 ), we see that goods in
the upper 90th percentile of the distribution have an e-commerce sales in-
tensity of 0.19 over the full sample period, which is more than eight times
higher than a good with the median intensity. We also can see that there
are substantial increases in e-commerce intensity at the 50th and 90th per-
centiles, which reflects the growing importance of e-commerce across the set
of goods in the sample. The fourth line of the table recomputes e-commerce
intensity using the data from Rakuten (xR                          E        R
                                            i10 ). The values of xi09 and xi10 are
quite similar, indicating that both datasets indicate similar distributions of
the e-commerce intensity. The fifth line of Table 2 presents catalog sales in-
tensity in 1999, which has a similar distribution as e-commerce intensity,
especially in the later years. Finally, the last row shows the annual growth
rate of prices from 1991 to 2016. Eighty percent of annual product price
changes in cities were less than 11 percent in absolute value, with the typi-
cal price change being close to zero.

4     Results
We present our results in three sections. Section 4.1 shows how e-commerce
has affected national prices. In Section 4.2, we present plots to show that
price convergence is a central tendency in the data and that the internet
appears to have changed the rate of convergence for goods available online
but not for other goods. This provides some prima facie evidence that our
focus on relative intercity price movements of goods sold by e-retailers is
in line with the data. We next estimate the impact of e-retail on the rate of
price convergence and we present our estimates of the welfare gain from
e-retail. Finally, in Section 4.3, we show welfare gains in new trade models.

4.1   E-commerce and National Prices
Goolsbee and Klenow (2018) found that goods traded online have rates of
price change that were about 1.3 percentage points lower than the rates for
goods in the same product categories in the CPI. Here, we present comple-
mentary evidence that there are different rates of price increase for goods
sold intensively by e-merchants relative to other goods. We also find that
differential rates of price increase were present long before the entry of
e-commerce firms; these became more pronounced after the entry of e-
commerce merchants; and they arose in part because the rate of price in-
crease of goods not available online rose. In order to examine this in the
data, we regress annual log price changes of goods (pict ) from 1991 to 2016
on good fixed effects along with an indicator variable, Dt , that is one start-
ing in 1997 (the year the first e-commerce firm, Rakuten, opened) and zero
before as well as the e-commerce intensity of the good interacted with this
dummy (xE  i09 Dt ):

                      pict = i + Dt + xE
                                       i09 Dt +      ict ,                 (11)

where i is a parameter to capture any pre-trends in the data that might
arise if goods available online exhibit different price increase trends than
goods not available online. If any differential trend in prices emerged af-
ter 1996, we should pick it up in our estimate of . The most interesting


                                      18
parameter for our purposes is the coefficient on the e-commerce intensity
interaction term (), which indicates the differential rate of price change for
goods traded online after the entry of e-commerce firms.
    One of the advantages of our specification is that we can eliminate any
good-specific pre-trends (i ) that might confound specifications that com-
pare price growth rates of goods available online with those not sold online.
In order to understand whether controlling for these pre-trends is likely
to be important, we split the sample into two groups by e-commerce sales
intensity. The first sample of goods (XB ) consists of products that have
an e-commerce sales intensity (xEi09 ) in the bottom quartile, and the second
sample is composed of goods with an e-commerce sales intensity in the top
quartile (XT ). We then computed the average rate of price increase for the
two sets of goods by running the following regression separately for each
sample:
                                     pict = t +       ict ,                                (12)

where the estimates of the time fixed effect t in each sample tell us the
average rate of price increase for the goods in each sample.
    We plot these expenditure-weighted estimates and the 95-percent con-
fidence bands in Figure 2. There is clearly some volatility in each of the
series. Most notably, there are very negative rates of price increase for low
e-commerce intensity goods in 1992, which (as we show in the online ap-
pendix) is entirely due to idiosyncratic movements in fruit and vegetable
prices that year. The relative magnitude and approximate timing of the
price swings of e-commerce intensive products CPI data line up (within a
year) with fluctuations in the domestic producer price index, which sug-
gests that part of the volatility reflects the underlying price volatility of do-
mestically manufactured goods.9

    9
      For example, the annual growth rate of Japanese domestic producer price index fell
from 0.0 in 2000 to -1.4 percent in 2003. It then rose to 1.3 percent in 2007 and 4.0 percent in
2008 before falling to -5.0 percent in 2009. By 2014, Domestic producer prices were rising at
a 2.8 percent annual rate. Source https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JPNPPDMMINMEI#0.
In the online appendix Figure A.2, we also present unweighted estimates, which show a
similar pattern. The relatively low bottom-quartile point estimate for 1992 is driven by

Note: The lines show the average rate of expenditure-weighted price increase for the goods
in two groups: products with bottom quartile e-commerce sales intensity (thick line) and
products with top quartile e-commerce intensity (thin line). Shaded areas show the 95-
percent confidence bands. The red dashed line shows the average rate of price increase
before and after the entry of e-commerce firms for goods with bottom quartile e-commerce
sales intensity, and the blue dashed line shows that for goods with top quartile e-commerce
sales intensity.


    Before the entry of the Rakuten in 1997, the average rate of price in-
crease for the types of goods that would ultimately be sold on e-commerce
platforms was -1.8 percent per year, while the average annual rate of price
increase for goods that did not sell much on these platforms was 1.0 per-
cent per year. Thus, even before the entry of e-commerce firms, there was
a 2.8 percentage point gap between the relative rates of price increase for

fruits and vegetable prices in 1992, as can be seen by looking at the online appendix Figure
A.1. When we drop fruits and vegetables, which have very volatile price movements in
Japan, the rates of price change of goods in the bottom and top quartiles look quite similar
in 1992. Ahn et al. (2011) argue the 2007 spike in prices may have been related to credit
constraints.

                                             20
goods that would be sold intensively online relative to those never sold in-
tensively online. These differences in rates of price increase may reflect the
fact that the production of standardized, non-perishable goods, which tend
to dominate e-commerce platforms, may benefit more from the cost reduc-
tions associated with modern manufacturing techniques.
    It is also interesting to see what happened to this gap in rates of price
change after the entry of e-commerce firms. While we do not see much
change in pricing behavior in the first five years after the entry of Rakuten,
by 2002, we see that the differences in the price growth rates between
the two sets of goods widened significantly in subsequent years, when e-
commerce firms became major players in Japanese retail. Goods in the top
quartile of e-commerce sales intensity had an average rate of price growth
from 1997 to 2016 of -3.0 percent per year: a 1.2 percent per year fall in
the rate of price growth. By contrast, the rate of price growth for goods
in the bottom quartile of e-commerce sales rose to 2.9 percent per year: an
increase of 1.9 percent per year. Thus, the gap widened by 3.1 percentage
points. Nevertheless, the fact that the rate of price increase for e-commerce
intensive goods fell while that of non-intensive goods rose suggests that one
must be cautious about interpreting this evidence in terms of e-commerce
having an effect on aggregate inflation.
    Turning to our differences-in-differences specification, we present the
results from estimating equation (11) in Table 3. The first column presents
the results from estimating equation (11) over the period 1992 to 2001. Con-
sistent with what we observed in Figure 2, we do not find much of an ef-
fect from e-commerce in the first few years after the entry of Rakuten as
evidenced by the insignificant coefficient on the post-e-commerce intensity
interaction (xE i09 Dt ) term. However, as one can see in column 2, we do see
a significant decline in the relative prices of goods available online when we
include later years in the sample.
    As we have argued earlier, one possible challenge to our identification
strategy is that e-commerce firms are not likely to have chosen which sec-
tors they are likely to have entered randomly. In order to deal with this en-

dogeneity, we use catalog intensity (xC  i99 ) as an instrument for e-commerce
             E
intensity (xi09 ). Table 4 presents the first-stage results, which show the
strength of catalog sales intensity as an instrument for e-commerce intensity.
As one can see from the F-statistic reported in the first two columns of the
table, catalog sales intensity in 1999 is a strong instrument for e-commerce
sales intensity in 2009. Sectors that on average were major channels for cat-
alog sales also became major channels of e-commerce firms. In the third
column, we simply regress the e-commerce intensity of sectors in 2009 on
catalog intensity in 1999 to show that the relationship holds in the cross
section.
    We report the results from our instrumental variables (IV) estimation
in columns 3-4 of Table 3. Instrumenting for e-commerce sales intensity
does not affect the results significantly, which suggests that there is not a

serious endogeneity bias.10 As before, we do not see much of an effect
of e-commerce on national pricing in the first few years after the entry of
Rakuten and the other e-commerce firms, but we do see strong effects in
subsequent years. Overall, our IV estimate of the impact of e-commerce in-
tensity (xE
          i09 Dt ) on price increases is about 20 percent larger in magnitude
than the OLS estimate in the full sample estimates (columns 2 and 4), but

   10
      However, we do find that instrumenting does matter when we use the Rakuten defi-
nition of e-commerce sales intensity, which may reflect the fact that it may help eliminate
attenuation bias when using measures of e-commerce intensity not based on random sam-
ples.

                                               23
the difference is not significant. As we noted earlier, these results indicate
that there is not significant endogeneity bias when thinking about aggre-
gate prices. It is also consistent with our e-commerce variable not exhibiting
much measurement error, which would also produce an attenuation bias in
the OLS results. In terms of economic significance, the results in column
4 imply that the entry of e-commerce firms caused a good at the 90th per-
centile of internet sales intensity to have relative rates of price increase to
fall by -2.2 percentage points per year.

4.2    Gains Due to Price Arbitrage
In this section, we explore an alternative mechanism through which e-
commerce affected prices in Japan: reducing price dispersion across cities.
We first consider two five-year periods: the first period (1991-1996) pre-
dates e-commerce and the second one (1997-2001) ends after Rakuten was
a prominent, listed company. It is difficult to compare price changes
across goods and cities in their raw form because rates of price change
vary across goods and cities. We therefore normalize the data by regress-
ing pict and pict on product and city fixed effects and construct normal-
ized log price changes (5 pict -   ^ it -   ^ct ) and normalized log price levels
(pic,t-5 - ^ it-5 - ^ ), where  ^ it ( ^ it-5 ) and   ^ct (^ ) are the estimated
                     ct-5                                   ct-5
fixed effects from the regression of pict (pict-5 ) on product and city fixed
effects. Thus, these normalized log prices remove the effect of any com-
mon price movements at the product or city level. Figure 3 presents plots
of normalized five-year log changes in prices (5 pict -        ^ it -  ^ct ) against the
normalized five-year lag of log prices in each city (pic,t-5 -       ^ it-5 -  ^ ).
                                                                                ct-5
    The top panel shows how normalized log price changes vary with nor-
malized log prices before and after the entry of e-commerce. There is a
clear negative relationship between initial urban price deviations and future
price growth, which indicates that goods that had high prices in cities tend
to have lower rates of price increase than goods with low relative prices.
This mean reversion is likely the product of price arbitrage. As one can see
from these two plots, 30 percent of any relative price difference tends to

Note: This graph plots normalized price changes against normalized price levels. Normal-
ized log price changes (log levels) equal the actual log price changes (log levels) less the
fixed effects from a regression of log price changes (log levels) on product and city fixed
effects. The left plots show normalized price changes before the entry of e-commerce, and
the right panel shows them after the entry of e-commerce. The top-two plots are for all
goods; the middle-two are for goods with e-commerce intensity lower than the bottom
quartile, and the bottom-two are for goods with e-commerce intensity higher than the top
quartile.

be eliminated within five years before the advent of e-commerce, and this
number rises to 38 percent in the five years after e-commerce firms entered.
These plots also speak to the relatively high quality of the Japanese data.
For example, studies using U.S. data (c.f., Parsley and Wei (1996)) find no
evidence of price convergence once one controls for city fixed effects.11
    The next two pictures show what is driving this increase in the intercity
rate of price convergence. Here, we divide the sample into the set of goods
with an internet sales intensity in the lowest first quartile of the distribution
in 2009 (xEi09 < 0.014) and the set of goods in the highest quartile of the dis-
tribution (xE i09 > 0.117). As one can see from the middle panel in Figure 3,
there was almost no change in the rate of convergence for goods not sold
on the e-commerce. The slope of the line for goods not sold intensively on-
line in the early period is -0.35, which is almost identical to the slope in the
post e-commerce period (-0.33). In other words, the entry of e-commerce
firms seems not to have affected the speed at which intercity price differ-
entials converged for goods not sold intensively online. However, we see a
very different pattern for goods with an e-commerce intensity in the upper
quartile of the distribution. The slope steepens by 50 percent, rising in mag-
nitude from -0.35 to -0.53. Thus, enabling consumers to shop online seems
to have significantly reduced the ability of merchants to charge different
prices in different cities for the same good. We now turn to exploring this
result rigorously.
4.2.1   Estimating Convergence Rates
Table 5 presents the results of estimating equation (1) for five- and one-year
intervals using 1999 catalog sales intensity as an instrument for e-commerce
sales intensity. In the first two columns, we present separate regressions for
1996 and 2001, where we let the convergence rates vary across the two time
periods as we did in the earlier plots. Comparing the first rows of columns

   11
     One plausible reason for the weaker evidence of price convergence in the U.S. is that
the data used in Parsley and Wei (1996) is not based on purposive sampling, so price
changes in cities are based on different goods in different locations (as shown in Hand-
bury and Weinstein (2015)).

                                           26
1 and 2 reveals the convergence rates for goods not suitable for e-commerce
(i.e., those where xEi09 = 0) were almost identical before and after the en-
try of e-commerce, which is the result that we saw in Figure 3. The co-
efficient on e-commerce intensity interacted with lagged prices (xE   i09 pic,t-5 )
in column 1 indicates that the rate of convergence for goods suitable for
e-commerce sales was not significantly different than the convergence rate
of other goods prior to to the entry of e-commerce. However, the nega-
tive and significant coefficient on the triple interaction term (Dt xEi09 pic,t-5 )
in the post-e-commerce sample indicates that goods sold intensively online
exhibit significantly faster convergence rates after the entry of e-commerce
firms, which formally confirms the result we saw in Figure 3.

Note: E-Commerce intensity (xE     i09 ) is defined in equation (10); Dt is dummy variable that
is one after 1996 (i.e., the post e-commerce period). The table shows regression results of
equation (1) using IV: e-commerce sales intensity in 2009 is instrumented using 1999 cata-
log sales intensity. The first column uses the five-year log differences in prices between 1991
and 1996 and the second column uses five-year differences from 1996 and 2001. The third
column uses two five-year periods, 1991­1996 and 1996­2001. The dependent variable in
the fourth column is the annual log differences in prices from 1991 to 2001. The F-statistic
corresponds to the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald statistic. Standard errors in parentheses.

    In column 3 of Table 5, we estimate our baseline differences-in-
differences specification of equation (1) using a five-year differences by let-
ting t take on two values: 1996 and 2001. The most important result for our
purpose is the estimate of the coefficient on the interaction term on the e-
commerce intensity coefficient. As one can see from the table, the coefficient
is negative and precisely measured. Not surprisingly, the estimated coeffi-
cient on pic,t-k (^ ) does not change much, and we continue to get a negative
and significant coefficient on the e-commerce intensity interaction term in
the five-year difference specification (  ^3 = -0.961) and in the one-year dif-
ference specification (  ^3 = -0.598). The estimate of 1 is insignificant, which
means that before the entry of e-commerce firms, there was no clear differ-
ence in the rates of price convergence between goods that would ultimately
be sold intensely online relative to those would not. This result is very much
in line with the bottom two left-hand side plots in Figure 3.
    We now turn to exploring the robustness of these results to alternative
specifications. The first three columns of Table 6 replicate column 4 of Ta-

e-commerce intensity (i.e., we use xE            E      E     E
                                       ib  xi04 , xi09 , xi14 ). The results are all
qualitatively similar. Interestingly, we find that the OLS results (reported
in the online appendix section A.2) have the same sign as our IV results,
but tend to have significantly smaller coefficients. For example, the point
estimate on the triple interaction (Dt xE i09 pic,t-5 ) is half as large (-0.237, with
a standard error of 0.100) if we estimate the parameters just using OLS. In
the next three columns, we replace our continuous measure of e-commerce
intensity with a dummy in order to reduce the potential role played by out-
liers. "High E-Commerce Intensity" is one if xE         ib is above the median. The
results reported in columns 4-6 are qualitatively similar to the results based
on the continuous measure of e-commerce intensity, which suggests that
outliers are not driving our result.
    The second concern that one might have with the results is that we may
have a data measurement problem that is influencing the results. In order to
make sure that some idiosyncratic component of the NSFIE survey method

Note: E-Commerce and catalog intensity are defined in equation (10); Dt is dummy vari-
able that is one after 1996 (i.e., the post e-commerce period). The first three columns of
the table show the regression results of equation (1) using 1999 catalog sales intensity as
an instrument for e-commerce sales intensity in 2004 (column 1), 2009 (column 2), and
2014 (column 3). The last three columns of table present regression results with discrete
e-commerce intensity variable that indicates whether a good has an e-commerce intensity
above the median. The F-statistic corresponds to the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald statistic. De-
pendent variables are the annual log price differences from 1991 to 2016. Standard errors

of e-commerce intensity based on Rakuten sales data instead. We report the
results from this exercise in Appendix A.3 Table C3 for over period 1991 -
2001 and Table C4 for 1991 - 2016, which shows that we obtain very similar

Note: Wt equals the change in welfare in each year as a share of expenditure in the
previous year and is computed according to equation (9).

    Aggregate consumer gains due to faster price convergence can be calcu-
lated from equation (9). One of the features of these equations is that the
welfare gain is proportional to the choice of demand elasticity. In all cases,
we base our estimates of the impact of e-retail on the rate of convergence
in Table 6 column 2. Estimating these elasticities using our data is difficult
because we do not have good instruments for the price of goods in each city.
We, therefore, choose to rely on prior estimates of demand elasticities. Inter-
estingly, estimates of the elasticity of substitution across goods available in
retail stores and across retail merchants tend to be close to four, so we will
adopt that estimate as our baseline one in the welfare calculations in this
section and the next.12 Table 7 presents that welfare gains arising from price
   12
      For example, Dolfen et al. (2019) estimate the elasticity between online and offline
merchants to be 4.3. Hottman (2019) estimates the elasticity of substitution across stores
within a city and obtains a median estimate of 4.7. Hottman et al. (2016) estimate the elas-
ticity of substitution across firms selling packaged goods for a wide range of products and

                                            30
arbitrage for 2014. We find that if we adopt an elasticity of 4, we estimate
that the gains from faster price arbitrage equals 0.3 percent of expenditure.
The magnitude of the gain is proportional to the elasticity used in the calcu-
lation, but all reasonable estimates of the elasticity of substitution suggest
substantial welfare gains through this channel.

4.3    Variety Gains
An alternative mechanism through which e-commerce might affect welfare
is by enabling consumers to access new varieties as in Brynjolfsson et al.
(2003). One of the challenges of estimating the gains from new varieties is
that our data does not enable us to see which varieties became available.
Fortunately, we do observe sufficient statistics that enable us to compute
the welfare gain even in a world in which we do not see the underlying
varieties. In order to do this, we adopt the framework of Feenstra (1994)
to compute the change in the CES price index due to new varieties. Since
there is no clear evidence that e-commerce affected average prices, we will
assume that these prices were unaffected by e-commerce and only focus on
varieties. In this case, Feenstra showed that the log change in the consumer
price index due to new varieties can be written as:
                                      1        t
                            ln Pt =       ln        ,                    (13)
                                     -1       t-k
where t  (0, 1] is the share of consumer expenditures in period t on vari-
eties available in both periods t and t - k .
    In order to take the theory to data, we need to make some additional
assumptions. First, we assume that purchasing from an e-commerce mer-
chant differs in some way from purchasing the good from a physical store
and that this differentiation is captured in  , which we continue to set equal
4 in our base case. Second, we assume that there was no change in the qual-

obtain a median value of 3.9. Thomassen et al. (2017) estimate that the median markup for
supermarkets in the UK to be 1.30, which in a CES setup with monopolistically compet-
itive firms would correspond to an elasticity of substitution across retailers of 4.3 (where
we make use of the fact that in a monopolistically competitive setting with CES preferences
the markup equals / ( - 1).

                                            31
ity of the shopping experience in physical stores over this period. While
there definitely was turnover in physical retailers over this time period, this
is not a problem for our estimation if the stores that exited were replaced
with stores of comparable quality, so that consumers' shopping experience
in physical stores remained unchanged.
    There is evidence that this assumption is reasonable. For example, when
Rakuten entered the Japanese market in 1997, there were 1,015 square me-
ters of retail floor space per capita, and in 2014, this number stood at 1,061
square meters. Similarly, the amount of physical retail space in Japan stayed
almost constant at approximately 130 million square meters over the entire
time period, and employment in retail trade stayed constant at 7.4 million
people between 1994 and 2012.13 Thus, the rise of e-commerce is not asso-
ciated with a fall in the amount of space used to display goods by physical
merchants or the number of sales staff in these stores. Based on this, we
think that it is fair to assume that consumers entering Japanese physical
stores could continue to experience comparable shopping experiences. In
this case, we can set t-k and t equal to the share of expenditures in physi-
cal retailers in periods t - k and t.
    The rise of e-commerce merchants is necessarily associated with a de-
cline in expenditure shares in physical retailers. Based on equation (13), it
is straightforward to see how e-commerce will affect prices. If we start in
a simple case in which consumers face two choices for goods purchases--
e-retail or other retail--and choose a base period (t - k ) that predates e-
commerce, it must be the case that t-k = 1 because the initial share of
purchases from e-commerce firms is zero by construction. However, the
share purchased in period t (t ) will be less than one because consumers in
the later period will only purchase a fraction of their goods from other re-
tail stores. Thus, the price level in period t will fall because consumers now
have access to new (online) varieties.
    One problem with this approach is that it implicitly assumes that the

                                      32
elasticity of substitution between physical retailers and e-commerce mer-
chants ( ) is the same as that between e-commerce merchants and catalog
merchants. However, it may be the case that e-commerce is more substi-
tutable with catalog sales than it is with purchases in physical stores. If
e-commerce is perfectly substitutable with catalog sales, then we should
compute our  ratios based on the purchases from physical stores divided
by the sum of purchases from physical and telemarketing merchants (i.e.,
e-commerce and catalog merchants). In this case, the share of purchases
from physical merchants in period t - k (t-k ) will be less than one be-
cause consumers purchased some goods from catalogs before the entry of
e-commerce firms. Similarly, we will also have t < 1 because in the later
period consumers purchase from both catalog and e-commerce merchants.
Intuitively, the price index will fall as long as t /t-k < 1, which is equiva-
lent to saying that a necessary condition for e-commerce to lower the price
index is that its sales did not come completely at the expense of catalog mer-
chants. We will refer to the price change based on this assumption as PtT
to reflect the fact that the change in the price level can be thought of as the
consumer gain from telemarketing.
    In order to implement these calculations, we need to first adjust the data
to take into account that not all consumer expenditures occur through re-
tailers. We first do the calculation under the assumption that we can treat
all retail channels other than e-commerce as continuing to sell a constant set
of varieties of constant quality. In the NSFIE data, the share of household
expenditures purchased from retailers () was 62 percent in 2014, with the
remaining expenditures (e.g., utilities, travel, and education) being made
from non-retail sources. In 2014, e-commerce expenditures on goods as a
share of all retail expenditures, which we denote by  , was 0.0437. The
share of household expenditures from non-e-commerce firms in 2014 was
therefore 14 = (1 -  )  + 1 -  = 0.97. Assuming an elasticity of substi-
tution of 4, we can use equation (13) to obtain an estimate of the percent-
age price drop between 1996 and 2014 associated with e-commerce in Japan
        E
( ln P14   ) of 0.9 percent. We report this number in the first column of Table


                                      33
8 along with a number of alternative estimates based on different plausi-
ble estimates of the trade elasticity. These consumer gains range from 0.5
percent to 1.4 percent in 2014.

Note:  ln PtE is the implied log price change associated with the entry of e-commerce
firms under the assumption that elasticity of substitution between e-commerce and physi-
cal retail is the same as between e-commerce and catalog merchants.  ln PtT is the implied
log price change associated with the entry of all telemarketing firms (e-commerce and cat-
alog merchants).


    The second column in Table 8 defines local sales as total expenditures
less expenditures on products sold over the internet or through catalogs.
These estimates will be smaller if e-commerce sales came at the expense of
catalog sales, but will be larger if both e-commerce and catalog sales ex-
panded relative to retail sales. Interestingly, we see that associated price
reductions ( ln PtT ) are larger when we allow for the fact that consumers
purchased and continue to purchase goods through catalogs. This result
may be due to the fact that all telecommunications prices fell, which ben-
efited both catalog and e-commerce merchants at the expense of physical
retailers.
    The implicit gain due to varieties is larger than the estimate from the
price arbitrage approach in Section 4.2.2 and reflects the impact of differ-
ent modeling assumptions on the welfare estimates. In the price arbitrage
approach, e-commerce may generate exports of products from one city to
another (which might appear in the data as e-commerce transactions) but
there is no variety gain. Instead, the welfare gain arises from the reduction
in price dispersion across cities from sales of the same products. By contrast,

in the variety approach, consumers gain from the ability of shopping from
e-commerce firms even if these merchants offered the same products at the
same prices (perhaps because online shopping saves time). If one thinks the
first approach applies to commonly available goods and the second one to
new ways of purchasing goods, one could add the two estimates to obtain
the total. However, in an Eaton and Kortum (2002) setup, there is no variety
channel, so as Arkolakis et al. (2012) argue, in this case the "variety" chan-
nel would simply be measuring the gains from trade arising from prices
converging to their free-trade levels. In order to be conservative, we will
therefore assume that the two methods of measuring gains are not additive,
so our baseline estimate of the gains due to e-commerce (using an elasticity
of substitution of 4) ranges from 0.3 to 0.9 percent.
    One of the characteristics of calculations of the variety gains due to e-
commerce is that the magnitude of these gains is driven entirely by the
increase in the share of sales by e-merchants. This share is strongly cor-
related with the share of college graduates in a prefecture as one can see in


                                                                                                            35

the prefectural level (Pct    , where c denotes prefecture) against the share of
that prefecture's population with a college degree.14 One plausible expla-
nation for this high correlation between e-commerce use and education is
that highly educated people are likely to be more comfortable using com-
puters and other information technologies and also are more likely to use
credit cards and non-cash payments. Whatever the cause, this result sug-
gests that variety models imply a digital divide in which regions with a
large share of highly educated people benefit more than regions with fewer
highly educated people. These differences are economically significant. In
column 1 of Table 9, we regress the price change due to e-commerce on the
share of people with a college education in each prefecture. We estimate that
the e-commerce gains for a city like Tokyo with a share of college-educated
people equaling 0.35 is 1.2 percent, while a city with a college share of only
0.175, like Fukushima, is only half as large.15
    One obvious concern with this plot is that the share of college-educated
people might be correlated with other factors that matter for internet pur-
chases. For example, Dolfen et al. (2019) document that e-commerce in the
U.S. is positively associated with city size. This is also true in Japan as well,
where Tokyo is both the largest city and the city with the second-highest
share of college-educated people. Alternatively, it may be the case that in-
come or age is associated with e-commerce intensity. In order to understand
the robustness of our regional results to controlling for these factors, we
regress the welfare gain on population (which is a proxy for urban vs. rural
prefectures), prefectural income per capita, and average age and report the
results in columns 2-6 of Table 9. We find that none of these variables are
significant once we control for the share of college-educated people in a pre-
fecture. When we include the share of secondary-school graduates, we find
that it is significant in one specification, but it has a positive sign, which re-
   14
     Japanese prefectures are roughly the size of US counties.
   15
     Whether we include or exclude catalog sales does not matter substantively for our pre-
fectural results. We do not find a similar pattern when computing arbitrage gains because
gains are not highly correlated with the share of e-commerce purchases in a locale.

inforces our earlier point that it is highly educated people that are the main
users of e-commerce.16

5        Conclusion
This paper makes use of a unique Japanese data set covering hundreds of
products over close to three decades to examine the impact of the e-retail
on Japanese relative prices and welfare. While we find that at the na-
    16
      This may explain why Fan et al. (2018) find no link between education and internet
sales intensity. Chinese education levels are much lower than in Japan, which means that
very few people have gone to college in their sample. The average number of years of ed-
ucation in Fan et al. (2018) is only 8.8 years, whereas the average in our sample of Japanese
cities is 11.9 years.

tional level, the price increases for goods sold intensively online are lower
than those sold principally in physical stores, we show that this result was
present even before the advent of e-commerce. Nevertheless, the entry of
e-commerce firms is associated with a widening of this gap, which is con-
sistent with e-commerce affecting relative price increases.
    At the local level, we find strong evidence that the rate at which inter-
city price differences converge rose significantly for goods sold intensively
online after e-commerce sales became common in Japan, but goods sold pre-
dominantly offline experienced no change in their rate of price convergence.
This provides evidence that information technology significantly reduced
the ability of stores to charge different prices in different locations. Analyz-
ing the impact of this faster rate of price convergence through the lens of
the Jensen (2007) model indicates that the welfare gains due to e-commerce
were sizable: Japanese welfare in 2014 was 0.3 percent higher as a result of
e-commerce.
    We also explored the consumer gains due to e-commerce through the
lens of models featuring variety gains. These models suggest that the entry
of e-commerce firms lowered variety-adjusted prices by 0.9 percent and that
these gains benefited highly educated regions more than less educated re-
gions. Although a feature of new-trade theory models is that no location can
be made worse off as a result of trade liberalization, the estimated welfare
gains in relatively rich cities like Tokyo are two times higher than in most
small cities. This result arises from the fact that higher-educated consumers
buy substantially more online than less-educated consumers.
