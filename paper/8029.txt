1 Introduction
Taxation is a key instrument in the hands of the government to redistribute among indi-
viduals. Assessing the power of di erential commodity taxation versus nonlinear income
taxation for redistribution is a central tax policy question which has attracted much at-
tention in the literature on optimal taxation. The role of di erential commodity taxation
has been severely undermined by the in uential paper of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976).
They showed that, under a condition of separability of leisure and consumption choices,
optimal non-linear income taxation makes commodity taxation useless. This result, ap-
plied to dynamic models, has provided a strong theoretical argument against the use of
capital income taxation in the presence of nonlinear taxation of wage income.
   Atkinson and Stiglitz derived their result in a way that made economic interpreta-
tion diÃ†cult. A number of studies by Mirrlees (1976), Christiansen (1984), and Konishi
(1995), have tried to understand in more depth the Atkinson-Stiglitz result. Mirrlees
(1976) showed that commodity taxation is desirable on goods that are relatively more
preferred by the high skilled individuals. Christiansen (1985) showed that goods that are
complementary with leisure should be taxed. However, all these studies have considered
the Atkinson-Stiglitz result in a context of strong homogeneity of preferences for consump-
tion goods. Namely, they considered models where all individuals would buy exactly the
same bundle of goods when provided with the same amount of disposable income.
   This strong homogeneity in tastes for goods is clearly unrealistic and the goal of this
paper is to investigate how the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem can be adapted to the case of
heterogeneous consumption preferences. This improves previous ndings on two grounds.
First, considering the general case of heterogeneous tastes displays the conditions un-
der which the Atkinson-Stiglitz result is robust. Second, the stringent homogeneity as-
sumptions considered by previous studies obscure the economic mechanism behind the
Atkinson-Stiglitz result. Considering the general case clari es the key economic assump-
tions necessary to obtain the result and allows perhaps a more transparent interpretation.
   A number of studies have examined optimal income and commodity taxation in the

                                            2
context of two skill types and have obtained a simpler economic interpretation of the
Atkinson-Stiglitz result in that particular case. Stiglitz (1982) showed that when leisure
and goods are separable, di erential taxation of commodities cannot be used as a basis
of separation of the two types and is thus sub-optimal. Naito (1999) obtained a similar
interpretation and showed that the Atkinson-Stiglitz result breaks down when wages and
prices are endogenous.
   Recently, Cremer, Pestieau, and Rochet (2000) have investigated the role of commod-
ity taxation in a discrete type model with optimal income taxation. Their important
innovation is to consider a situation where individuals also di er along their initial en-
dowment. This second source of heterogeneity can be seen as a rst step toward the
general case considered in the present paper. Cremer et al. (2000) note that, in their
model, separability is no longer enough to obtain the Atkinson-Stiglitz result. They do
not, however, investigate the conditions necessary to restore the Atkinson-Stiglitz result
which is the focus of the present paper. They center instead their analysis on the size of
optimal commodity taxes. Their study can therefore be considered as complementary to
the present paper.
   The present paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3
investigates and discusses the conditions under which no commodity taxation is desirable.
The present method of analysis generalizes the original method of Christiansen (1984). A
brief application to the case of the taxation of savings is presented in Section 4. Section
5 o ers concluding remarks.


2 The Model
Individuals are indexed by h belonging to a possibly multi-dimensional index set      H.   To
                                      P
simplify notation, I use the symbol    h   to note summation over all individuals even though
H should be thought as a continuum.        The total number of individuals is normalized to
one. There are K consumption goods and labor supply. Individual utility is denoted by


                                                3
U h (c; z ) where c = (c1 ; ::; cK ) is the vector of consumption goods and z is earnings.1 I
denote by p the vector of before tax prices of goods. The government sets a non-linear
income tax on earnings T (z ). I denote by t the vector of tax rates on goods and q = p + t
the after tax commodity prices. Individuals maximize utility U h (c; z ) subject to the
budget constraint q  c  z T (z ). The individual choice of consumption goods on the
one hand and the labor supply choice on the other hand play a key role in the problem
we investigate. Therefore, as in Christiansen (1984), I decompose this maximization into
two parts: rst, the choice of consumption goods c and second, the labor choice z .

     Consumption Choice
    Assume that a given individual h supplies labor in order to earn a given income level
z and is given an amount R to spend on the K goods. That individual would choose c to
maximize U h (c; z ) subject to q  c  R. I denote by v h (q; R; z ) the corresponding indirect
utility function and chk(q; R; z ) the demand for good k for a labor supply level generating
earnings z , and a disposable income level R.

     Labor Choice
    In fact, disposable income R and earnings z are related through the income tax by
the equation R = z   T (z ). Individual h chooses z so as to maximize v h(q; z                     T (z ); z ).
The optimal earnings level z h is a function of q and the tax schedule T (:).

    Assume that the government does not use commodity taxation (p = q ) and im-
plements an income tax T (:) so as to maximize a weighted sum of individual utilities
          P                                               P
W=         h    v (p; z h
               h h
                            T (z h ); z h ) subject to        h   T (z h )  E where E is an exogenous rev-
enue requirement for the government and subject to the fact that each individual chooses
z h to maximize utility. I denote by  the multiplier of the government budget constraint.
 is thus equal to the marginal value of public funds. I denote by g h = h vRh = the social
   1 In   the original formulation of the optimal non-linear income tax problem by Mirrlees (1971),       h   is
scalar and positive and U h (c; z ) = u(c; z=h).   z=h   is labor supply and h is the wage rate.



                                                          4
marginal weight on individual h. These weights summarize the redistributive tastes of
the government. At the optimum, the government is indi erent between giving one more
dollar to individual h or getting g h more dollars of public funds.
   The following analysis relies critically on small variations around the optimal tax
schedule. Therefore, I assume that the number of individuals is large enough so that
average consumption demands by earnings levels are smooth functions of earnings.
   More importantly, in order to apply standard calculus of variations, it is necessary to
assume that the optimal income tax schedule is regular and that there is no bunching nor
gaps in the optimal schedule. Without this assumption, a small variation in the income
tax could produce discrete jumps in quantities consumed or supplied and the rst order
analysis would be invalidated. Christiansen (1984) and Konishi (1995) also made their
analysis assuming smooth income tax schedules. The conditions necessary to obtain a
smooth income tax schedule in the one-dimensional skill distribution model they consider
has been extensively analyzed (see notably Mirrlees (1976) and Seade (1977)). The case of
multi-dimensional skill characteristics considered in this paper has been much less studied.
The small literature on multi-dimensional screening models has shown that it is diÃ†cult
to obtain general assumptions insuring that the optimal tax schedule is smooth (see for
example the analysis of Rochet and Chone (1998)). The present paper will nevertheless
ignore completely this issue and make the strong assumption of a smooth schedule.


3 When does commodity taxation improve welfare?
I assume from now on that the income tax schedule T (:) is optimal and smooth as de-
scribed previously. In order to see whether a commodity taxation improves welfare, I
consider, as in Christiansen (1984), the introduction of a small tax dt1 on (say) commod-
ity 1. This small tax reform has three e ect on welfare and tax revenue.
                                              P
   First, the tax raises mechanically dM1 =       c dt1 = C1 dt1 additional taxes where C1
                                                   h
                                                 h 1

denotes aggregate consumption of good 1.


                                             5
   Second, the tax has a negative welfare e ect on individuals consuming good 1. Using
Roy's identity, the welfare e ect on individual h is equal to vqh1 dt1 = vRh ch1 dt1 . The total
welfare e ect expressed in terms of the value of public funds is,

                                       1X                     X
                          dU1 =                  v c dt1 =
                                                 h h h
                                                                   g hch1 dt1 :             (1)
                                          h
                                                   R 1
                                                              h

   Last, changing price q1 produces a behavioral labor supply response dzth1 = dt1 @z h =@q1
and therefore changes the amount of taxes collected by the income tax by,

                                                   X 0 h h
                                       dB1 =        T (z )dzt1 :                            (2)
                                                    h

The total welfare e ect of the small commodity tax dt1 is dW=dt1 = dM1 =dt1 + dU1 =dt1 +
dB1 =dt1 . When dW=dt1 is not equal to zero, imposing a small tax (or subsidy) on good
1 is desirable.

   To check whether dW1 =dt1 = 0, I use, as in Christiansen (1984), the fact that any small
income tax reform has no rst order e ect on welfare because the income tax is optimal.
The natural small income tax reform dT that mimics the small commodity tax is such
that dT (z ) = C1 (z )dt1 for every z , where C1 (z ) denotes average consumption of good 1
for individuals earning z . As above, the e ects of this tax change can be decomposed into
mechanical, welfare and behavioral e ects.
                                                                                       P
   The mechanical e ect due to the income tax change is equal to dMT =               dT (z h ) =
                                                                                       h
P
  h C1 (z )dt1 = C1 dt1 . The commodity tax change dt1 and the income tax change dT
         h


induce the same mechanical e ect on tax revenue: dMT = dM1 .
    The welfare e ect for individual h is equal to vRh dT (z h) = vRh C1 (z h )dt1 . The total
welfare e ect due to the income tax change is therefore,

                               1X                             X
                     dUT =                 v C1 (z h )dt1 =
                                           h h
                                                                   g hC1 (z h )dt1 :        (3)
                                  h
                                             R
                                                              h


   I denote by dzTh The behavioral response of earnings due to the income tax change.

                                                    6
Thus the total loss in tax revenue due to the behavioral response to the income tax change
is,

                                               X 0 h h
                                     dBT =      T (z )dzT :                                 (4)
                                                   h

Because the income tax is optimal, the small income tax change has no rst order e ect
on welfare: dMT =dt1 + dUT =dt1 + dBT =dt1 = 0. Therefore, the total welfare e ect dW=dt1
of the small commodity tax can be rewritten as dW1 =dt1 = dU1 =dt1 dUT =dt1 + dB1 =dt1
dBT =dt1 . Using equations (1) to (4),
                                                            "                         #

                 =         g [c1

                                    C1 (z )] + T 0 (z h )
                                        h
                                                                         
                                                                dT (z h ) dt1     dt1
                                                                                        :   (5)
                       h                       h

The total welfare e ect on the commodity tax is decomposed into two terms. The rst
term is the pure welfare e ect and the second term is the behavioral e ect. Commodity
taxation can improve welfare if either of these two terms is non zero.

       Pure Welfare E ect
      As C1 (z ) is average consumption of good 1 for individuals earning z h = z . The pure
welfare term in (5) is zero if conditional on any given z , g h and ch1 are uncorrelated. This
is the case when, conditional on income, the government does not systematically give
higher (or lower) social weights to individuals with higher tastes for good 1.

Assumption 1 Conditional on any income level z , g h and ch1 are uncorrelated.

      Under what conditions can the government not set the same welfare weights on individ-
uals with the same income? First, the government might want to advantage some classes
of individuals over others, such as the young at the expense of the old. If these di erent
groups do not have the same consumption pattern then g h and ch1 might be correlated
conditional on income. However, one might think that, in a liberal society, the government
should not set judgement values on the citizens based on their consumption. Second, if
the good is consumed mostly by a particular class of individuals that are disadvantaged

                                                   7
even conditioning on income, then g h and ch1 might be positively correlated. An example
of such a good could be medical expenses. People with high medical expenses have less
income left for consumption of other goods and thus could be given higher weights than
healthy people with the same total income but with no medical expenses.
   In the model considered by Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and by subsequent studies,
there is only one individual at each income level and thus no heterogeneity within income
levels. As a result, assumption 1 is always satis ed. Note nally that g h and ch are en-
dogenous parameters and thus it would be diÃ†cult to specify general primitive conditions
on intrinsic parameters insuring that Assumption 1 is true at the optimum. Nevertheless,
if we want to model a government that does not want to discriminate between di er-
ent consumption patterns, it seems reasonable to assume that the primitive conditions
on utilities and social weights have been speci ed so that Assumption 1 is true at the
optimum.2

    Behavioral E ect
   The second reason why commodity taxation might be desirable is when the behavioral
term in (5) is non zero. An important result in optimal income taxation states that, under
weak assumptions, the optimal marginal tax rate is non-negative (that is, T 0 (z )  0 for
all z ). Mirrlees (1971) presented this result and Seade (1982) clari ed the conditions
under which it is valid. This result is valid when leisure is a non-inferior good and when
the government has redistributive tastes. We assume here that T 0 (z )  0 for every z .
Therefore, to sign the behavioral term, we must compare the behavioral responses dzth1 and
dzTh induced respectively by the commodity tax dt1 and the small income tax change dT .
Suppose that dt1 > 0, if the reduction of labor supply is smaller with the commodity tax
dt1 than with the mimicking income tax change dT (that is, dzth1 > dzTh ), then commodity

should rather assume that these parameters are chosen so that the social weights at the optimum sat-

consumption patterns as in Assumption 1.

taxation is more eÃ†cient than the income tax and is thus desirable (granted Assumption
1 holds). Note that in this case, desirability of commodity taxation is unrelated to the
redistributive tastes of the government and is uniquely due to the di erence in labor
responses to commodity versus income taxation.
   Let us compute successively the change in earnings induced by dt1 and by dT (z ) =
C1 (z )dt1 . To obtain the change in earnings due to the commodity tax dt1 , let us prove
 rst the following result,

Lemma 1 The change in earnings dzth1 for individual h induced by the small commodity
tax dt1 is equal to the change in earnings induced by a small income tax reform speci c
to individual h equal to dT h(z ) = ch1 (p; z T (z ); z )dt1 .

   Proof: Let us de ne dT h(z ) to be such that for any z , v h(q + dt1 ; z           T (z ); z ) =
v h (q; z T (z ) dT h (z ); z ). Because these two functions are identical for all z , it must be
the case that the value of z maximizing these two functions is identical. By assumption,
z + dzt1 maximizes v h(q + dt1 ; z T (z ); z ). Therefore, it follows that z + dzt1 maximizes
v h (q; z T (z ) dT h (z ); z ). In other words, dzt1 is also the earnings response to the change
dT h (z ).
     Applying a rst order Taylor expansion for each of these two functions around (q; z
T (z ); z ), and using Roy's identity, vqh1 dt1 = vRh ch1 dt1 , one obtains dT h (z ) = ch1 (p; z
T (z ); z )dt1 . Therefore, dt1 has the same e ect labor supply as a small individual h speci c
change in the income tax dT h(z ) = ch1 (p; z T (z ); z )dt1 . Q.E.D.

   In general, the functions of z , C1 (z ) and ch1 (p; z   T (z ); z ) are di erent implying that
the behavioral responses induced by the changes dT (z ) and dT h (z ) (or equivalently dt1
by Lemma 1) are also di erent. I denote by Dz C1 and Dz ch1 the (total) derivatives with
respect to z of the two functions of z , C1 (z ) and ch1 (p; z T (z ); z ).
    A change in the tax schedule a ects earnings z through income and substitution e ects.
For a given individual, I denote by z h (q; 1 ; R) the earnings level he would supply when
facing prices q and a linear budget constraint with tax rate  and virtual income R. I

                                                   ) the income and price e ects. Using the
Slutsky equation, I denote by zch = @z h =@ (1  ) z h @z h =@R the substitution e ect. With
the non-linear income tax in place, we have  = T 0 (z h ) and R = z h T (z h ) z h [1 T 0 (z h )].
    The following result allows us to compare the labor supply responses to dT (z ) and
dT h (z ),

Lemma 2 The response of earnings dz h of individual h due to an arbitrary small change
in the tax schedule P (z )dt is such that,


                                 dz h = zch [P 0(z h )dt + T 00 (z h )dz h ] zRh P (z h )dt:                  (6)

    Proof: An arbitrary small income tax change P (z )dt produces a behavioral response
dz h in earnings due to income and substitution e ects: dz h = z1h  d + zRh dR = zch d +
zRh (dR z h d ). The change in marginal tax rate d is equal to P 0 (z h )dt + T 00 (z h )dz h and
routine computation shows that the income shock dR z h d is equal to P (z h )dt. Hence,
equation (6) is obtained. Q.E.D.

    Applying Lemma 2 to the income tax changes dT h(z ) = ch1 dt1 and dT (z ) = C1 (z )dt1 ,
we obtain the following expressions for dzth1 and dzTh ,


                                  dzth1 = zch [Dz ch1 dt1 + T 00 (z h )dzth1 ] zRh ch1 dt1 ;                  (7)


                                dzTh = zch [Dz C1 dt1 + T 00 (z h )dzTh ] zRh C1 (z )dt1 :                    (8)

We want to sum these two equations over all individuals with income z . Let E [] denote
expectation over all individuals h with income z h = z . Equations (7) and (8) imply,3

being satis ed. That is, the curvature of the indi erence curve at the optimum labor supply choice is
greater than the curvature of the budget constraint. Saez (2000) shows that this assumption is satis ed
everywhere when the optimum income tax schedule is smooth which is the key assumption we made
earlier on.

Granted Assumption 1 holds, commodity taxation is useless if for any z , E [dzth1 ] = E [dzTh ].
Comparing equations (9) and (10), two conditions are enough to obtain this equality,

Assumption 2 Conditional on each income level z , behavioral responses zch and zRh are
independent of consumption patterns ch1 and Dz ch1 .

   This assumption ensures that the expressions ch1 and Dz ch1 in (9) can be averaged and
pulled out of the expectation operator. Intuitively, it is clear that if conditional on income,
labor supply responses are highest for those with no taste for good 1, then taxation of
good 1 does not a ect these highly responsive individuals and is more eÃ†cient than the
indiscriminate income tax change dT (z ).
   Assumption 2 is obviously satis ed in the usual case considered by previous studies
because they consider models with a single individual at each income level. This assump-
tion does not hold in the general heterogeneous case. However, for most goods, there
are no reasons to think that conditional on income, consumption patterns should be re-
lated systematically to substitution or income e ects parameters. In any case, checking
this condition empirically is diÃ†cult and thus it seems reasonable to assume that this
condition holds.

Assumption 3 For any income level z , E [Dz ch1 jz h = z ] = Dz C1 (z ).

   This is the key assumption needed for the Atkinson-Stiglitz result. When Assumption
2 holds and as, by de nition, E [ch1 jz h = z ] = C1 (z ), it is clear that Assumption 3 is enough
to ensure that E [dzth1 ] = E [dzTh ]. In order to understand Assumption 3, it is useful to note
that,


                                                 11
                                           E [ch1 jz h = z + dz ] E [ch1 jz h = z ]
                     Dz C1 (z ) = dzlim                                             :
                                      !0                      dz
That is, Dz C1 (z ) captures the cross-sectional variation in consumption of good 1 when
income increases whereas E [Dz ch1 jz h = z ] capture the individual variation in consumption
of good 1 when earnings supply and disposable income change.
   Thus Assumption 3 can be restated as follows. Consider all individuals h earning
z h = z and call this group A. By de nition, group A consumes on average a quantity C1 (z )
of good 1. Consider then all individuals h with income z h = z dz and call them group
B . Group B has less income than group A and consumes on average dc1 = Dz C1 (z )dz
less good 1 than group A. Suppose you force group A individuals to decrease their labor
supply so that their earnings fall to z dz . I call group A0 these individuals, group A0
has on average the same earnings (namely z dz ) and same disposable income as group
B . Compared to group A. Group A0 individuals reduce on average their consumption of
good 1 by dc01 = E [Dz ch1 jz h = z ]dz .
    Assumption 3 states precisely that group A0 and group B should consume on average
the same quantity of good 1, that is, dc1 = dc01 . In the standard Atkinson-Stiglitz model
that has been studied in the literature, each individual is characterized by a scalar skill
level h. Individual utility is of the form U (v (c1 ; ::; cK ); z; h) where the function v (:) is
common to all individuals. The separability assumption means that, given a level of after
tax income R, individuals maximize v (c) subject to q  c  R. Therefore, consumption of
the goods depends only on after tax income R = z       T (z ) available for consumption and
not on the labor choice per-se. As a result, the functions ch1 (z ) and C1 (z ) are identical.
   Group A0 and group B have the same disposable income but individuals in group A0
have been forced to reduce their labor supply. Consumption of good 1 can di er across
these two groups for two reasons.
   First, group A0 is di erent from group B because they have higher incomes when they
can freely choose their labor supply. If higher income earners individuals have relatively
lower tastes for good 1, independently of disposable income, then group B consumes more

                                                    12
good 1 than group A0 . An example of such a good could be cigarettes because, higher
incomes tend to smoke less4 and this clearly cannot be due to the mechanical fact that
they have higher disposable income.
   Second, group A0 is di erent because it has been forced to reduce earnings and thus
presumably enjoys more leisure than group B.5 As a result, if consumption of good 1
increases when leisure time increases, as could be the case for holiday travels for example,
then group A0 would consume more of this good than group B .
    The rst interpretation has been put forward by Mirrlees (1976) and the second one
by Christiansen (1984). However, these studies used the Atkinson-Stiglitz framework and
did not use the expression in Assumption 3.
    When group A0 consumes more good 1 than group B (i.e. when E [Dz ch1 jz h = z ] <
Dz C1 (z )), then using equations (9) and (10) and the fact that the substitution e ect zch
is positive, we see that for dt1 > 0, E [dzTh ] < E [dzth1 ]. This is the case when high income
earners have a relatively stronger taste for good 1 than lower income earners or when
good 1 consumption increases when leisure time increases. In that case, the \equivalent"
marginal rate e ect of the commodity tax dt1 given by Dz ch1 dt1 is smaller on average than
the marginal e ect of the income tax change dT (z ) given by Dz C1 (z )dt1 . This happens
when the individual consumption demand ch1 (z ) is atter on average than the aggregate
consumption demand C1 (z ) by income level. In that case, the distortionary e ect of the
commodity tax is lower than the income tax change. Commodity taxation then reduces
earnings less and thus is more eÃ†cient than the small income tax change dT (z ). When
assumptions 1 and 2 hold, this implies that taxation of good 1 is desirable.
    The shape of C1 (z ) can be easily measured empirically using a cross-sectional sur-
   4 See   e.g., Evans et al. (1999) for empirical evidence of this fact in the U.S.
   5 This    is of course true in the standard model where individuals di er only through their marginal
productivity of labor. In general, this is expected to be true if earnings are correlated with skills. Note
that this would not be true in a model where all individuals had the same wage rate or skill and di ered
only through their taste for leisure.

vey of household consumption. Measuring the average individual consumption patterns
ch1 (q; R = z T (z ); z ) is more diÃ†cult because one has to disentangle the income e ect
R = z T (z ) from the leisure e ect z . The income e ect might be measured using longi-
tudinal data but it is harder to see how to estimate the leisure e ect. We can now state
the generalized Atkinson-Stiglitz result,

Proposition 1
    If assumptions 1,2 and 3 are satis       ed for good 1, then commodity taxation of good 1
cannot improve welfare.
      If assumptions 2 and 3 are satis ed but not assumption 1, then taxation (resp.
subsidization) of good 1 is desirable if marginal welfare weights g h are negatively (resp.
positively) correlated to consumption ch1 of good 1 at each income level.
     If assumptions 1 and 2 are satis ed but not assumption 3, then taxation of good
1 is desirable if E [Dz ch1 jz h = z ] < Dz C1 (z ) for all z (i.e. when high income earners
have relatively more taste for good 1 or when good 1 consumption increases with leisure).
Subsidization of good 1 is desirable if E [Dz ch1 jz h = z ] > Dz C1 (z ) for all z .


4 Application to the Taxation of Savings
The most fruitful and in uential application of the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem has been
in the case where di erent goods are interpreted as consumption at di erent dates.
When consumption and labor enter the utility function in a separable way, (that is,
uh = u(v (c1 ; ::; cT ); z; h), then there is no need to supplement a non-linear tax on earnings
with a tax on interest income. This point was originally made by Atkinson and Stiglitz
(1976), and developed in Ordover and Phelps (1979). It has been a major theoretical
argument against the use of capital income tax.
   To simplify the discussion, let us consider the standard two period model where indi-
viduals work only in period 1 and live out of their savings in period 2. Utility functions
are de ned by u(c1 ; c2 ; z ). Following the long tradition in macro-economics, it tempting

                                                 14
to specify a separable utility function such as,

                                                          u(c2 )
                             uh(c1 ; c2 ; z ) = u(c1) +            v (z=h);                    (11)
                                                          1+Ã†
where Ã† is the discount rate and v (:) is a function capturing the desutility of e ort. Speci-
 cation (11) implies that commodity taxation (or equivalently interest income taxation) is
useless in the presence of an optimal income tax. However, the key assumption embodied
in speci cation (11) is not so much the separability assumption but rather that Ã† (as well
as u(:) and v (:)) are common to all individuals, that is, savings behavior is the same for
every individual and independent of skills.
   Using the framework of the present paper, in the presence of optimal nonlinear earnings
taxation, the desirability of taxing interest income (or equivalently, taxing consumption
in period 2) hinges of whether Assumption 3 is true.6 However, propensities to save vary
widely across the population and empirical studies have shown that savings rates are
correlated with education even controlling for income (see for example, Lawrance (1991)).
Therefore, there is a strong presumption that higher income individuals save more not
only because they have more income to save but also because they might have a better
 nancial education and be more aware of the need to save for retirement. As a result, it
is plausible to think that if individuals with high earnings z levels are forced to work less
and thus earn z 0 < z would still have a higher taste for savings and thus save more than
individuals with income z 0 . In terms of speci cation (11), the discount rate Ã† is probably
negatively correlated with skills. This suggests that interest income ought to be taxed
even in the presence of a non-linear optimal earnings tax. Trying to quantify the optimal
tax rate on interest income using data on tastes for savings by skill or income levels is an
important but diÃ†cult task left for future research.
  6 There   is no reason to think that Assumptions 1 and 2 should not be approximately true for con-
sumption at each date.




                                                  15
5 Conclusion
The key element to assess the desirability of commodity taxation in the presence of optimal
income taxation is whether a small commodity tax can be replicated by a small income
tax change. When this is not the case, commodity taxation is a tool that allows the
government to expand its taxation power and is therefore desirable. This can happen
either when the government uses social weights correlated with consumption patterns even
conditioning on income or when patterns of consumption are related to intrinsic earning
power or leisure choices. In that latter case, the desirability of commodity taxation hinges
not on whether the commodity is consumed disproportionately by high earners but rather
on whether individual demand for that good is less elastic than the cross-sectional demand
pattern.
    The analysis shows that the separability property might be misleading because what
is central in the Atkinson-Stiglitz assumption is not so much that consumption and labor
enter the individual utilities separately but rather the fact that all individuals share the
same subutility of consumption. In contrast, separability does not intervene in the analysis
of the general heterogenous case and the present analysis shows directly the key economic
assumptions needed. As an important caveat, it should be noted again that the present
analysis is valid only when the optimal income tax schedule is assumed to be smooth.
Singularities in the optimal income tax might change the present conclusions though it is
not clear whether results based on singularities could be of much practical relevance.7
    It would of course be extremely useful to obtain optimal commodity tax formulas
when the assumptions insuring the Atkinson-Stiglitz result are not satis ed. Cremer et
al. (2000) take an important step in that direction in the context of a discrete type
model with a simple structure. Obtaining such formulas expressed in terms of empirically
   7 Cremer   et al. (2000) note in their multi-type discrete model that determining the set of binding
incentive compatibility constraints is diÃ†cult and a ects in a complex and interesting way the economic
interpretation of optimal taxes. Whether this characteristic of discrete models and its relevance for
optimal tax analysis goes away in the continuum case considered here is not yet understood.

estimable magnitudes in the general model considered here is an important task left for
future research.
