                                         ABSTRACT

We explore the impact of COVID-19 on employee's digital communication patterns through an
event study of lockdowns in 16 large metropolitan areas in North America, Europe and the
Middle East. Using de- identified, aggregated meeting and email meta-data from 3,143,270 users,
we find, compared to pre- pandemic levels, increases in the number of meetings per person
(+12.9 percent) and the number of attendees per meeting (+13.5 percent), but decreases in the
average length of meetings (-20.1 percent). Collectively, the net effect is that people spent less
time in meetings per day (-11.5 percent) in the post- lockdown period. We also find significant
and durable increases in length of the average workday (+8.2 percent, or +48.5 minutes), along
with short-term increases in email activity. These findings provide insight from a novel dataset
into how the nature of work has changed for a large sample of knowledge workers. We discuss
these changes in light of the ongoing challenges faced by organizations and workers struggling to
adapt and perform in the face of a global pandemic.

Introduction

The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted the way organizations function, just as it has disrupted life
more generally. As the number of infections increased, governments across the globe closed their borders
and shut down physical work sites in an attempt to reduce the spread of infection caused by the virus. As
of April 7, 2020, 95 percent of Americans were required to shelter-in-place within their homes, similar to
the citizens of many other countries. Organizations have responded by altering their work arrangements to
accommodate these new realities, including a rapid shift to working from home for large segments of
knowledge workers. Given the large scale economic and social upheaval wrought by COVID-19, this abrupt
transition to remote work occurs at a time when organizational coordination, decision-making processes,
and productivity have never been more consequential.

         The global policy response to COVID-19 represents an unprecedented natural experiment in which,
for the first time, many organizations across the world find themselves with a fully physically dispersed
workforce. Moreover, employees had to quickly shift to relying on digital communication technologies to
perform their job regardless of how conducive their home environment or task requirements were to such
arrangements. While most knowledge workers had engaged in some form of remote work prior to the
pandemic, they typically did so with the support of colleagues physically co-located in a centralized office
(Raghuram et al., 2019).

         For all the anecdotes and speculation about working from home during the pandemic, there is still
little systematic evidence about how employees have changed their day-to-day work activities as a
consequence of these unexpected shocks. In particular, how have employees changed their patterns of
digital communication -- e.g., meetings and emails -- to compensate for the lack of face-to-face conversation
that typically occurs in a physical workplace? Have various dimensions of meeting and email activity, such
as their frequency or scope, changed as employees and organizations adapt to a new working environment?
Generalizing from past research on work from home arrangements is challenging, given that most remote
work prior to COVID-19 was voluntary, less widespread, and performed under less dramatic circumstances
(Bloom et al., 2015; Choudhury et al., 2019).

         This paper provides the first large scale analysis of how digital communication patterns have
changed in the early stages of the pandemic. To study this question, we acquired de-identified, aggregated
meta-data from an information technology services provider that licenses digital communications solutions
to organizations around the world. We use aggregated digital meta-data on emails and meetings for
3,143,270 users across 21,478 de-identified firms in 16 large metropolitan areas, aggregated by the provider
to the level of Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and day, across all available firms (see Appendix, Figure
S1 and S2). The meta-data provides information on both email and meeting frequency, as well as other
salient aspects of digital communications and interactions such as meeting size and duration, the number
of email recipients, and the time emails are sent, among other dimensions (see Appendix, Table S1).

         We selected 16 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) that have experienced government-
mandated lockdowns. These lockdowns established a clear breakpoint after which we could infer that
people were working from home. The earliest lockdown in our data occurred on March 8, 2020, in Milan,
Italy, and the latest lockdown occurred on March 25, 2020, in Washington, DC (see Table 1 for more
information). We report data from a window starting eight weeks prior to the lockdown and ending eight
weeks after the lockdown in each MSA to explore how the behavior of workers changed.



                                                                                 DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 2
        In analyzing digital communication patterns across a large number of firms and regions, we build
upon an emerging literature that uses communication meta-data to measure otherwise hidden networks and
patterns of communication (Impink et al., 2020; Polzer et al., 2018). Other studies have used similar meta-
data to reveal the importance of meeting and email patterns for a variety of organizational outcomes
(Kleinbaum et al., 2013; Srivastava et al., 2018).

Results

Our primary objects of investigation are average measures of digital communication patterns built from
collaboration metadata, aggregated at the MSA-day level. We use a regression-based event study to
examine how these measures vary before and after government-mandated lockdowns.1 For the purpose of
our study, we grouped digital communication measures into two categories of interest: meeting and email
activity.

        The total amount of time employees in any firm collectively spend in meetings is a function of
three parameters that can vary independently: average meeting duration, average meeting size, and total
number of meetings. We find an increase in the total count of meetings per person per day (+12.9% [CI:
+11.4% to +14.4%], +0.8 meetings per person per day) 2, an increase in the average number of attendees
per meeting (+13.5% [+10.6% to +16.5%], +2.1 attendees per meeting), and a decrease in the average
duration of meetings (-20.1% [-23.0% to -17.1%], -12.1 minutes per meeting). That is, organizations in the
post-lockdown period appeared to have more frequent meetings with more attendees, and shorter meetings,
compared to the prior period. The net effect of these changes was to significantly reduce the total number
of hours employees spent in meetings during the post-lockdown period (-11.5% [-14.3% to -8.7%], -18.6
minutes per person per day). All of these results are significant at the p < .001 level.


                                                                                DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 3
        For daily email activity, we find that several email measures increased in the post-lockdown period.
Specifically, we find significant increases in the average number of emails sent and received among people
from the same organization, which we refer to as internal emails (+5.2% [+3.0% to 7.6%], +1.4 emails per
person per day). We also find that there was a significant increase in the average number of recipients
included on emails sent in the post-lockdown period (+2.9% [+0.3% to +5.5%], +0.25 recipients per email
sent). However, external emails and distinct emails sent (unique emails counted only once, regardless of
the number of internal or external recipients) did not significantly change in the post-lockdown period.

        Using the span of time defined by the first and last email sent or meeting attended in a 24-hour
period, we also find the average workday span increased by +48.5 minutes (+8.2% [+7.1% to +9.3%]),
partly due to increases in emails sent after business hours (+8.3% [+4.0% to 12.7%], +0.63 emails per
person per day). The results for these post-lockdown changes of meeting and email variables are further
detailed in Appendix, Table S2. Results, except for that of email recipients, are robust to weighting
regressions by the total number of users in each MSA, with an additional positive and significant result for
emails sent distinct under this specification, Appendix Table S3.

         After assessing the overall post-lockdown changes in communication activities, we conducted more
granular tests to understand how these changes unfolded week by week. Again using regression analyses,
we computed the weekly change in digital communication patterns following the enacted lockdown relative
to a base week. Given that communication patterns within a given MSA began to change about a week prior
to the formal lockdown date, we defined our base week as one week prior to the week in which the lockdown
occurred, where the lockdown day occurs at the midpoint of the lockdown week. The coefficients denoting
the changes in communication relative to the base week, and corresponding standard errors, are shown in
Table 2 for meeting variables and Table 3 for email variables, and Figure 1 and Figure 2 visualize these
meeting and email findings respectively.

                                                                                 DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 4
        For meeting variables, we find consistent increases in the size and count of meetings and consistent
decreases in the length of meetings each week after the lockdown date. The cumulative effect of these
changes is to consistently decrease the total amount of hours employees spend in meetings each week after
the lockdown date.

        For email variables, we find a more varied pattern of results. The total number of distinct, internal,
and external emails sent increased sharply the week of the lockdown and then persistently decreased each
week, returning to pre-lockdown levels or below by week four. The average number of recipients per email
demonstrated a similar effect, with a small spike the week of the lockdown followed by a gradual levelling
out. Note, however, that by week eight, the average number of recipients per email remained significantly
higher than the level eight weeks prior to lockdown (See Appendix, S5). The effect of the lockdown on
workday span was more consistent -- the average workday span of an employee was higher in every week
following the lockdown than any week in the eight weeks prior to the lockdown.

                         Figure 2: Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Emails




        Careful inspection of these weekly results reveals that some communication patterns began to
change even earlier than one week before the lockdown. To account for this variation, in Appendix Figure
S4 and Figure S5, we recreate Model 2, but we set the reference category to eight weeks prior to the
lockdown date in order to formally test whether meeting and email trends eight weeks into a lockdown were
different from the trends observed eight weeks prior to the lockdown. We find that, for the meeting


                                                                                  DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 5
variables, the changes that occurred after the lockdown persisted over time. Specifically, compared to
meeting activity eight weeks prior to the lockdown, the decreases in average meeting length and meeting
hours that we observed were maintained throughout the post-lockdown period. At the same time, the
average meeting size and number of meetings remained higher throughout the post-lockdown period.

        Results from Appendix Figure S5 also clarify the long-term trends in email activity. We find that
the overall increase in email activity that characterized the post-lockdown period was most prominent in
the two weeks immediately after the lockdown announcements. By the fourth week after the lockdown, the
number of internal, external, and distinct emails sent returned to the level of the pre-lockdown period.
Changes to the remaining variables were more persistent; the average number of recipients per email
remained higher throughout the post-lockdown period, as did the workday span and the number of emails
received after hours, compared to eight weeks prior to the lockdown.

         We report a number of supplemental results in the Appendix. Two additional meeting variables
representing online and multi-country meetings both exhibited initial increases during and immediately
after the lockdown before trending back toward pre-lockdown levels (See Appendix, Table S4 and Figure
S3). Multi-country meetings in particular exhibited a noteworthy trend, with an initial increase in week one,
followed by a steady decrease every week for the following seven weeks. By week eight, the number of
multi-country meetings was significantly less than the numbers reported both one and eight weeks prior to
the lockdown.

         We also break down our results by MSA to reveal some interesting geographical variation in
meeting and email activity. Meeting length declined in every MSA but exhibited substantial variation in
the slope of the decrease. In many European cities such as Brussels, Oslo, and Zurich, for example, the
decrease in meeting length was sharp and continued to drop for four weeks after the lockdown, while in
U.S. cities like Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C., the decrease in meeting length was
relatively small and stabilized a week after the lockdown. The span of workdays increased in all cities, but
remained high in some (e.g., San Jose, Rome, New York City) while returning to baseline in others. These
and related results broken down by MSA appear in the Appendix, Figures S6-S15. Note that many of the
MSA-specific graphs (e.g. Appendix, Figure S6) show evidence of being influenced by religious holidays
-- specifically, Easter in European cities and Passover in Israel -- which occurs around week four for most
MSAs. The timing of these holidays corresponds with sharp decreases in the level of meeting and email
activity in the MSAs for which Easter and Passover are federal holidays.

Discussion

With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing employees around the world to work from home, the need to
communicate effectively has never been greater. Yet, the ability of employees to communicate has changed
dramatically with the loss of a centralized office and the face-to-face interaction it fosters.

         To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a large-scale event study of COVID-related
lockdowns and found that employees significantly changed their communication activities when working
remotely. In the weeks immediately following the lockdown, employees increased the number of meetings
they attended and the number of emails they sent. We also found increases in the number of attendees per
meeting, on average, and the number of recipients per email. That is, employees expanded both the
frequency and the scope of their communications.




                                                                                  DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 6
         Employees also adjusted their work schedules, extending the range of time they worked, as
indicated by the first and last email or meeting of a day, and sending more emails outside of working hours.
Not all communication activities increased, however. The average length of meetings decreased to such an
extent that the collective amount of time employees spent in meetings decreased, even though the total
number of meetings and the total number of attendees in those meetings increased over the same period.

         These results, taken together, document an increase in employees’ meeting and email activity in
terms of frequency, the number of people included, and the range of time spent engaging in these activities.
These patterns are consistent with the need to use virtual forms of communication to replace the face-to-
face interaction typical in an office setting, while adapting to the extraordinary disruption caused by the
crisis.

         Though an overarching increase in virtual communication is unsurprising, we would not have
predicted all of the ways in which this occurred. For example, despite the potential drawbacks of large
meetings or emails with many recipients, these forms of communication practices may help synchronize
how information is shared (e.g., by holding a team meeting instead of several one-on-ones). Moreover,
expanding the number of email recipients and meeting attendees increases the likelihood that important
information is received by all relevant individuals in an organization. This is an especially important
function in a time when organizational challenges likely cut across the business and are relevant to a greater
set of people. Being more inclusive when everyone is dispersed could also help employees maintain their
identification with the organization (Wiesenfeld et al., 1999).

         At first glance, our finding that meetings have become shorter seems to cut against the broader
pattern described above. However, meeting length is not independent of meeting frequency or size. To
coordinate many calendars, employees may find it necessary to shorten meetings in order to accommodate
more frequent meetings with more attendees. The relationship of these meeting parameters is also relevant
at the organizational level, where the aggregate number of hours people spend in meetings is a function of
three variables: the total count of meetings, the average meeting size, and the average meeting duration.
Because we observe a net decrease in the total number of hours that employees spent in meetings after
lockdowns, it must be the case that the reduction in the duration of meetings dominated the effects of having
larger and more frequent meetings.

        Though speculative, it is possible that employees also find it harder to stay engaged in long virtual
meetings compared to in-person meetings (Wasson, 2004). An employee’s attention span may be
additionally strained by challenges specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as taking care of children
who are not in school. Another possibility is that the function of meetings has changed in the post-lockdown
period. The lockdown introduced a host of new problems requiring unplanned, emergent coordination,
much of which could be addressed through impromptu interaction if everyone were in the same office. With
everyone working at home, however, short meetings could serve to quickly communicate new plans, share
work that has been accomplished, increase accountability, calibrate priorities, provide social support, and
achieve other purposes that are often handled informally in office settings.

        Consistent with the overall pattern of more meetings and more emails, our findings also point to a
spillover of virtual communication beyond normal working hours. After all, one way to achieve more
communication is to work longer days. Even with reduced time spent in meetings, the work demands




                                                                                  DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 7
brought about by the pandemic, coupled with personal demands that are always close at hand, could make
it hard to meet obligations within the bounds of normal working hours.

        It is unclear if this increase in average workday span represents a benefit or drawback to employee
well-being. On one hand, the flexibility to choose one’s working hours to accommodate household demands
may empower employees by affording them some freedom over their own schedule. On the other hand, the
change in work schedule may be a consequence of a blurred distinction between work and personal life, in
which it becomes easy to overwork due to the lack of clear delineation between the office and home.

         Given the unprecedented nature of the changes wrought by COVID-19, it was unclear from the
outset how employees would adapt their communication patterns as they transitioned to working from
outside their offices. Our findings provide strong evidence that employees adjusted their internal
communications in response to COVID-19 lockdowns, even prior to formal policy changes. Indeed, the
fact that patterns of email and meeting activity began to change, on average, about a week prior to formal
lockdown issuances, suggest that organizations can rapidly adjust their communication patterns in
anticipation of formal policy requirements, or in response to local environmental conditions (e.g. the
increasing spread of the virus in workplaces.) It will remain to be seen whether these changes persist as
employees continue to adapt to working from home during a pandemic and, eventually, when the
requirements to do so are lifted.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed a novel sample of aggregated meeting and email meta-data from 3,143,270 users across
21,478 firms in 16 international cities that have been affected by official lockdown orders, reported in
Appendix, Figure S1 and S2. From this meta-data, our provider built measures of the communication
frequency for email (the average count of distinct, internal and external emails and the average count of
recipients) and meetings (the average count of meetings, average meeting duration, and average count of
meeting attendees). Additionally, we measured broader changes to the nature of work, such as the average
length of workday (measured from the first communication to the last communication in a given day) and
the average number of emails sent outside of normal business hours, reported in Appendix, Table S1.

         The provider aggregated meeting and email data to a list of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)
through a probabilistic record linkage algorithm. For each MSA in our data, we included the central business
district of the cities and surrounding suburbs and townships within the MSA with populations greater than
100,000 people. The average population of the MSAs in our sample is around 6.2 million people, ranging
from roughly 1 million (Geneva, Switzerland) to 20 million (New York City, USA) people. All of the cities
in the sample have experienced a government-mandated lockdown. Note that every variable used in this
analysis was computed by our provider and delivered to us pre-aggregated at the MSA-level. At no point
did the research team have access to personally identifiable or user-level data.

         For the main set of results, we used average meeting and email activity aggregated at the MSA-day
level in the post-lockdown period relative to the pre-lockdown period. We used the following specification
for our first set of results, which uses a single dummy variable to test the overall difference between pre-
and post-lockdown periods for each outcome variable.
                          𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡                                  (1)




                                                                                   DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 8
To analyze the change in email and meeting measures over different weeks, we used the following
specification:

                                  −2                          8

              𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽0 + �         𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡𝐿𝐿                      𝐿𝐿
                                                  × 𝐷𝐷𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 × 𝐷𝐷𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝑑𝑑 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡                    (2)
                                𝑟𝑟 =−8                       𝑟𝑟 =0




where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡 are logged email and meeting data at the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 and 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 level, 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is an indicator
variable for the time period after lockdown, 𝐷𝐷𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 is a week indicator variable, relative to the lockdown
week, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 are MSA-level fixed effects, and 𝑑𝑑 𝑡𝑡 are day of the week indicator variables (Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, etc.).

        This design controls for characteristics of MSAs which are time invariant, or MSA fixed effects.
The "lockdown week" is the 7-day period that includes the lockdown date at its center. Every prior and
subsequent week indicator is defined relative to that week. The base week for our regression is defined as
one week prior to the lockdown week since many organizations began making arrangements days in
advance of official lockdowns based on news of impending policy changes. Email and meeting measures
do not display evidence of a pre-trend in the weeks leading up to the base week and lockdown week. All
standard errors are clustered at the MSA level. (See Table 2 and Table 3 for details).

Discussion

While our data establish that employees changed their pattern of email and meeting activity in response to
lockdowns, our findings are not without limitations. First, we do not have access to meta-data concerning
the content of meetings or emails. As such, we cannot corroborate whether the purpose of emails and
meetings has changed in the post-lockdown period. Future research with more granular data could reveal
how firms of different sizes, working in different industries, and with different capacities to shift to
remote work, have adjusted to working from home.

         A second limitation is that we are unable to identify specific firms or organizations from the dataset,
so we cannot fully determine the extent to which the changes in communication patterns are driven by
changes to the supply of work or to changes in the demand for products and services. Related to this, we
treat all government-mandated lockdowns as similar in terms of their influence on organizational
communication. In actuality, the nature and severity of these lockdowns differ by MSA and by type of
business. Future research should classify lockdowns and stages of reopening based on their requirements,
and classify firms by size and industry, to understand better how variations in these policies influence
organizational performance and behavior.

        A third limitation is that because the data consist of aggregated averages, we are unable to identify
individuals or match the data with demographic information. As such, we cannot determine whether the
move to remote work affected certain subsets of people differently than others.

        Finally, it is important to describe how changes in communication are associated with broader
changes in the nature of work. While our findings show that an average employee’s "workday span" has
increased in the post-lockdown period, it is unclear if employees are actually working longer hours, or if



                                                                                          DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 9
they have just adopted a non-standard work schedule. Future research should identify at an individual-level
how employees change their time and attention devoted to organizational work when large proportions of
them work from home.

Appendix
Section 1: Data and Variable Descriptions
Data Description
Our dataset consists of de-identified email and meeting meta-data acquired from an information
technology services provider. The user-level data was aggregated to the MSA-day level, and represents
the activity of 3,143,270 users across 21,478 firms in 16 large metropolitan areas.
Variable Description
Meeting Variables
   1. Meeting Hours- The average daily number of hours an individual spends in meetings. This variable
      is calculated by taking the daily hours each user spends in meetings and calculating the average
      across users for a given MSA.
   2. Meeting Count- The average daily number of meetings an individual attends. This variable is
      calculated by taking the daily number of meetings each user attends and calculating the average
      across users for a given MSA.
   3. Meeting Attendees- The average number of people that attend each meeting. This variable is
      calculated by taking the attendance count for each meeting and calculating the average across
      meetings for a given MSA day.
   4. Meeting Length- The average length of time a meeting runs for. This variable is calculated by taking
      the duration for each meeting and calculating the average across meetings for a given MSA day.
   5. Online Meetings- The average daily number of online meetings an individual attends, where a
      meeting is designated online if it has a virtual meeting link from the provider's service included in
      the meeting invite. This variable is calculated by taking the daily number of online meetings each
      user attends and calculating the average across users for a given MSA.
   6. Multi-Country Meeting Count- The total number of multi-country meetings for a given MSA day,
      where a meeting is designated multi-country if the locations logged for users on the meeting invite
      were from at least two different countries. This variable is calculated by taking the sum of the daily
      number of multi-country meetings across all users in a given MSA.
Email Variables
   1. Internal Emails Sent- The average daily number of emails received by internal recipients from
      internal senders, such that a single email sent to two separate recipients would count as two internal
      emails, rather than one email. The sender and the receiver must have the same email domain (i.e.
      “@company.com”). This variable is calculated by taking the daily number of emails sent to internal
      users and calculating the average across users for a given MSA.
   2. External Emails Sent- The average daily number of emails received by external recipients from
      internal senders, such that a single email sent to two separate recipients would count as two external
      emails, rather than one email. The sender and the receiver must have different email domains (i.e.
      “@company1.com” and “@company2.com”). This variable is calculated by taking the daily
      number of emails sent to external constituents and calculating the average across users for a given
      MSA.
   3. Distinct Emails Sent- The average daily number of emails sent from a single user. A single email
      sent to multiple internal and/or external constituents is only counted once for the distinct email
      variable. This variable is calculated by taking the daily number of emails sent from a single user
      and calculating the average across users for a given MSA.


                                                                               DeFilippis et al. (2020) | 14
4. Email Recipients- The average number of recipients included on email messages. This variable is
   calculated by taking the number of people that were included (whether To, CC’ed or BCC’ed) on
   each email and calculating the average across messages for a given MSA.
5. Workday Span- The average daily number of hours in between the first and last email sent or
   meeting attended by an individual in a 24-hour day block. The 24-hour day block is determined by
   12am-11:59pm in the user’s local time zone. This variable is calculated by taking the number of
   hours in between the first and last meeting or email for each user’s 24-hour block and then
   calculating the average across users for a given MSA.
6. After Hours Emails- The average daily number of emails received outside of the hours of 8am -
   6pm on Monday -Friday or on the weekends by individuals (internal or external) from a single user.
   This variable is calculated by taking the total number of emails received from a single user outside
   of ‘working hours’ and calculating the average across users for a given MSA.
