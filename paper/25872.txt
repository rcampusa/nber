We investigate how communication within banks affects small business lending. Using travel
time between a bank’s headquarters and its branches to proxy for the costs of communicating soft
information, we exploit shocks to these travel times to evaluate the impact of within bank
communication costs on small business loans. Consistent with Stein’s (2002) model of the
transmission of soft information across a bank’s hierarchies, we find that reducing headquarters-
branch travel time boosts small business lending in the branch’s county. Several extensions
suggest that new airline routes facilitate the transmission of soft information, boosting small firm
lending.

1. Introduction
        Small firms play a vital role in the U.S. economy—accounting for over 45% of

private, non-farm gross domestic product (e.g., Kobe, 2012). Research finds that small banks

have a comparative advantage in lending to these small firms and that lending to small

businesses falls markedly when large banks acquirer small ones (e.g., Berger, et al., 1998,

2005, 2017). The rapid reduction in the number of small banks through mergers and

acquisitions has spurred research into understanding the particular frictions impeding large

banks from financing small firms. In this paper, we contribute to this research by focusing on

frictions within large banking organizations. We investigate how communication costs within

banking organizations affect small-business lending.

        Two influential lines of research frame our study of how communication costs within

banks shape lending to small business. First, research emphasizes that small firms lack

quantitative data, audited financial statements, and other types of “hard,” easily transmitted

information (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1994, 1995; Berger and Udell, 1995; Stein, 2003;

Agarwal et al., 2012). Consequently, lending to small firms relies more on “soft” information,

such as subjective assessments of the character of the borrower and the economic prospects

of the community, that are garnered through in-person interactions, so that soft information is

more difficult to verify and communicate than hard information.

        The second line of research stresses that the hierarchical structure of large banks

interferes with the flow of soft information, impeding small-firm lending (e.g., Berger and

Udell, 2002; Stein, 2002). 1 In particular, the model developed by Stein (2002) suggests that
(a) soft information obtained by local loan officers is difficult to transmit to higher-level

banking officials, which discourages the acquisition and impedes the processing of soft

information and (b) the costs of communicating soft information within large banking

organizations hamper lending that depends on soft information, i.e., lending to small firms.

Though these insights on the hierarchical structure of banks have been very influential, we

Hart and Moore, 1990; Radner, 1993; Bolton and Dewatripont, 1994; Hart, 1995; Garicano, 2000).
                                                                                              2



are unaware of previous empirical evidence that directly evaluates the impact of changes in

the costs of transmitting soft information within banking organizations on small-firm lending.

       We evaluate whether reducing communication costs within banking organizations

increases small-firm lending. We use the travel time between a bank’s headquarters and its

branches to proxy for the costs of communicating soft information within a bank. The use of

travel time to proxy for the costs of transmitting information relies on the assumption that in-

person conversations with local loan officers, potential borrowers, and others in the

community are more effective at transferring and processing soft information than other

modes of communication. We assess whether shocks to the travel times between banks’

headquarters and branches affect small-firm lending in communities near those branches.

       For our identification strategy, we follow Giroud (2013) and use the introduction of

new airline routes that reduce the travel time between banks’ headquarters and branches. In

particular, we compute the minimum travel time between a bank’s headquarters and each of

its branches, for all banks and all years. We consider travel by car and plane, where the travel

time by air includes travel between headquarters and the airport, waiting time, transfer times,

and travel between the airport and each branch. We then determine whether the opening of a

new commercial airline route reduces the travel time between banks’ headquarters and its

branches. To the extent that introducing new airline routes that reduce travel times (a)

improves the flow of information between banks’ headquarters and branches and (b) is

orthogonal to lending opportunities at the branch level, we can use the opening of such airline

routes as an exogenous source of variation in communication costs within banking

organizations. A large component of our research design, therefore, is addressing the

orthogonality condition, i.e., addressing concerns that local economic conditions—or other

factors—trigger both the opening of airline routes and changes in small-firm lending

opportunities.

       To conduct our analyses, we match data on the locations of banks’ branches and

headquarters with data on the locations of banks’ small-business loans. The Summary of

Deposits (SOD) provides branch-level data on deposits and the geographic locations of the

headquarters and branches of all FDIC-insured depository institutions on an annual basis.
                                                                                                 3



Data provided under Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) contain information on each

bank’s small-business loans at the county-year level. Thus, we have bank-county-year

information on where each bank is making small business loans and the location of each

bank’s branches. The CRA data on the dollar amount and number of small-business loans are

reported in three categories based on the origination loan amount: (1) $100,000 or less, (2)

more than $100,000 but less than or equal to $250,000, and (3) more than $250,000 but less

than or equal to $1 million.

       We start with a standard difference-in-differences framework. The dependent variable

is either the total dollar amount or the total number of CRA loans that a bank makes in a

county, where we separately examine the three categories of loan origination sizes. The

treatment variable is an indicator variable that equals one if a new airline route has reduced

the travel time between the bank’s headquarters and branches in that county and zero

otherwise. Thus, our treatment is uniquely identified by two locations: the branch county and

the bank’s headquarters. To address concerns that county conditions shape both the opening

of airline routes and small-business lending, we include county-year fixed effects throughout

the analysis. We can include county-year effects because not all branches in a county have

their headquarters located in the same place, which enables us to distinguish the treatment

effects from local economic conditions. Furthermore, the findings are robust to controlling

for the bank’s overall size, capital-asset ratio, and profitability and the size of its branches in

each county. We further control for bank-county fixed effects to condition out within-bank

variations in small business lending across counties. Thus, our difference-in-differences

analysis compares small business loans originated by two (groups of) otherwise similar

branches in the same county, except that one branch is part of banking organization in which

a new airline route has reduced the travel time to its headquarters, and the other branch is not.

       We find that the introduction of a new airline route that reduces travel time between a

bank’s headquarters and a branch leads to a sharp increase in the total dollar amount and

number of small loans ($100,000 or less) that the bank makes in the branch’s county. For

example, the estimates suggest that introducing a new airline route that reduces headquarters-

branch travel times would increase the total dollar amount and number of small loans in the
                                                                                               4



county by 9.6% and 19.5%, respectively. These results are consistent with the view that

reducing headquarters-branch travel times facilitates information flow, boosting the

origination of small-business loans that rely heavily on soft information.

       We next engage in three extensions to address concerns about the link between air

travel times and the transmission of soft information within banking organizations. First, we

examine the connection between the introduction of new airline routes that reduce travel time

on large loans. To the extent that (a) loan size reflects the size of the borrowing business, (b)

loans to large firms rely more on hard, easily transmitted information than loans to small

firms, and (c) reductions in headquarters-branch travel times facilitate the flow of soft

information, then we should find that a reduction in headquarters-branch travel time does not

boost large loans. The results confirm this hypothesis: reducing headquarters-branch travel

times does not induce an increase in the total dollar amount or number of large loans. The

contrasting results between small and large loans is consistent with the view the introduction

of new airline routes facilitates the flow of soft information between branches and

headquarters, enhancing credit supply to small, informationally opaque firms.

       Second, we examine the introduction of cargo flights that reduce travel times between

a bank’s headquarters and its branches. While the opening of such cargo routes might reflect

greater economic connections between the headquarters and branch counties, cargo routes

will not facilitate in-person communications. If our finding that a reduction in headquarters-

branch travel time boosts small-firm lending by facilitating the transmission of soft

information through in-person conversations, then the opening of cargo routes should have no

effect on lending. That is what we find. Reducing cargo transport times between a bank’s

headquarters and its branches in a county does not alter lending by the bank in the county.

       Third, we examine the dynamic effects of introducing new airline routes on small

business lending: If the change in small business lending is attributable to the introduction of

new airline routes, then we should observe a significant effect only after, and not before, the

treatment. The dynamic analyses both confirm this prediction and show that reducing

headquarters-branch travel time has an enduring effect on small-business lending.
                                                                                               5



       To better identify the impact of improved communication of soft information within

banks on small-business lending, we conduct a series of triple-difference-in-differences

analyses. Specifically, we test whether the impact of new airline routes on small firm lending

varies in a theoretically predictable manner across different firms, counties, and banks.

       First, we explore whether the effects of new time-reducing airline routes are more

profound when small businesses are more reliant on soft information. To differentiate small

businesses by the degree to which their access to credit depends on soft information, we

exploit distinctions in age and asset tangibility (e.g., Beck, 2013). For example, to the extent

that there is more hard information about older firms than younger ones, banks will rely more

on soft information when deciding on loans to younger firms. This suggests that reductions in

headquarters-branch travel times that facilitate the flow of soft information will have a bigger

effect on lending to young small firms. Similarly, research suggests that collateral mitigates

moral hazard and adverse selection problems in loan contracting (e.g. Stiglitz and Weiss,

1981; Bester, 1985; Besanko and Thakor, 1987; Aghion and Bolton 1992; Hart, 1995; Berger,

et al., 2011). Thus, we conjecture that the flow of credit to small firms with greater collateral

will be less sensitive to the introduction of new airline routes than firms with less collateral.

Consistent with both predictions, we find that reductions in travel times between a bank’s

headquarters and its branches resulting from new airlines routes have bigger effects on small-

business lending when the branches are in counties with a higher proportion of (a) young

firms and (b) firms with more intangible assets that are a less useful form of collateral. These

findings suggest that the impact of new airline routes on small-business lending works

through facilitating the transmission of soft information within banking organizations.

       Second, we evaluate whether the credit-enhancing effects of new airline routes are

more pronounced among branches facing more intense competition. If greater competition

increases the incentives for bank branches to finance new, small business clients, improving

the flow of soft information about such clients should have a bigger effect in more

competitive markets. Our findings are consistent with this view. The economic size of the

difference is large. The estimates indicate that introducing new airline routes between

branches and headquarters leads to a 19.5% larger increase in the dollar value of small loans
                                                                                            6



in counties with below the median levels of bank concentration, as measured by the

Herfindahl index.

       Finally, we differentiate banks by the degree to which a bank’s headquarters is time

constrained with respect to visiting its branches. Since traveling to branches is time-

consuming and managers have limited time and attention (Berger and Udell 1995), new

timesaving airline routes should have a larger impact on banks whose headquarters are more

time-constrained. We construct two proxies for time-constraints. The first measures the

number of branches and the second measures the total distance between a bank’s

headquarters and its branches. We find that the credit-enhancing effects of introducing new

airline routes are more pronounced for headquarters with tighter time constraints.

       Across different specifications, our work suggests that the costs of communicating

soft information across the hierarchical layers of banking organizations shape small-business

lending. In this way, our research contributes to research on how the organizational features

of large banks influence their financing of small firms and confirms the predictions emerging

from Stein’s (2002) model of the operation of large banking organizations.

       Our work relates to several lines of research. First, extensive research focuses on the

effects of proximity on lending (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 2002; Degryse and Ongena, 2005;

Agarwal and Hauswald, 2010; Granja, Leuz, and Rajan, 2018; Nguyen, 2019). Using

geographic distance as a proxy for the costs of screening and monitoring borrowers, this work

finds that geographic distance is negatively associated with lending to informationally opaque

borrowers. Rather than focusing on the geographic distance between banks and borrowers,

we focus on “proximity” within banks. We find that new airline routes that reduce

headquarters-branch travel times boost lending to small firms. Thus, we provide novel

empirical evidence as to why small-business lending falls dramatically when banks become

larger and more complex (e.g., Berger, et al., 1998, 2005, 2017; Sapienza, 2002). Second,

focusing on information flow within organizations, Liberti and Mian (2009) show that soft

information is more difficult to communicate across hierarchies within a large Argentine

bank than hard information, but they do not examine small-firm lending. We evaluate the

impact of shocks to the costs of transmitting information within a bank on its loans to small
                                                                                                 7



firms. Third, Agarwal and Hauswald (2012) and Canales and Nanda (2012) examine a

different feature of organizational design. Exploiting unique data from a major U.S. bank,

Agarwal and Hauswald (2012) show that the headquarters tends to delegate authority to

branches further away, which in turn produce more soft information. Canales and Nanda

(2012) show that when local loan officers in Mexico have more autonomy, they lend more to

small firms. In turn, we show that the costs of transmitting information within banking

organizations influence the allocation of credit to small firms.

           The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the data and

variables. Section III introduces the empirical methodology. Section IV discusses the

empirical results. Section V concludes.



II. Data and Variable
II.A.      CRA Small Business Loans and Bank Branch Data

           We collect annual data on small business lending from the Community Reinvestment

Act (CRA) dataset provided by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council

(FFIEC). All banking institutions that are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the

Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

(FDIC) and that meet asset size thresholds established annually by the FFIEC must report

information on small business loans. The CRA classifies small business loans as commercial

or industrial loans (or loans secured by non-farm, non-residential real estate) with an original

loan amount that is less than or equal to $1 million.

           Under the CRA, each filing institution reports small business loans at the county level,

so that we have small business lending at the bank-county-year level. 2 Specifically, the CRA
contains information on the aggregate number and dollar value of small business loans that a

bank makes in a county. The CRA reports these loans in three categories: those with

origination amounts of (a) $100,000 or less, (b) more than $100,000 but less than or equal to

$250,000, and (c) more than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million. In our study, we

separately examine small business loans in these three categories. For each bank in each year,

                                                                                               8



we compute Loan amount, which equals the log of one plus the total dollar amount (in

thousands) of small business loans originated by each bank in a given county, and Loan

number, which equals the log of one plus the total number of small businesses loans

originated by each bank in a given county. Our initial sample comprises the universe of bank-

county-year data recorded in the CRA dataset over the period from 2000 through 2016. Our

sample starts in 2000 because the county-level lending data are sparse in earlier years.

       We match the CRA small business loans data with data on the location of all bank

branches, so that we have both county-level information on where each bank is making small

business loans and the location of each bank’s branches. The Summary of Deposits (SOD)

provides branch-level data on deposits and the geographic locations of the headquarters and

branches of all FDIC-insured depository institutions on an annual basis. Given the findings in

Petersen and Rajan (2002), Berger et al. (2005), Agarwal and Hauswald (2010), Berger,

Bouwman, and Kim (2017), and Nguyen (2019) that firms, especially small firms, tend to

borrow from geographically close bank branches, we assume that a bank’s CRA small

business loans in a county are linked to the bank’s branch(es) in that county. We drop CRA

lending filed by banks in counties where the banks do not have a local branch, as these

observations do not allow us to infer the location of the loan issuing branch office. Thus, we

focus on small business loans originated by banks in counties where they have a brick and

mortar presence (i.e., branch-counties). These local loans account for more than 75% of the

total CRA dollar lending volume. To ensure comparability of the physical distance between a

branch and the bank’s headquarters across years, we also exclude bank-year observations for

which the location of a bank’s headquarters is different from the location of the bank’s

headquarters in the previous year. Our final sample consists of 159,911 bank-county-year

observations, including small business loans originated by 2067 banks in 2233 counties over

the 2000 – 2016 period.

       Table 1 provides summary statistics for the CRA loans, differentiating by the three

loan-size categories. As shown, for each bank in a county, the average number of small

business loans in the smallest loan-size category (i.e., $100,000 or less) equals 30 (= exp3.43 –

1), and the total dollar amount equals $887,913 (= exp6.79 – 1). The number and dollar
                                                                                                             9



amounts of loans in the other two loan-size categories, ($100,000, $250,000] and ($250,000,

$1 million], equal 6 and $535,464, and 5.8 and $1,165,776, respectively.



II.B.   Airline Data

        To identify the introduction of new airline routes, we use data from the T-100

Domestic Segment Database, which covers the universe of all domestic flights in the United

States since 1990. 3 The T-100 database contains monthly information reported by U.S. air

carriers on non-stop segments (routes) between airports. The data includes the origins,

destinations, scheduled departures, departures performed, ramp-to-ramp time (flight duration),

available capacity and seats, passengers transported, and aircraft type. As our study focuses

on personal travel time, we exclude cargo airline routes that carry freight or mail only from

our main analyses and use these cargo flights in placebo tests below.



II.C.   Route Design and Travel Time Estimation

        Using an approach similar to Giroud (2013), we design the itinerary that minimizes

the travel time between a bank’s headquarters and each of its branches. We consider car and

plane as the two potential means of transportation. We first compute the driving time by car

between a bank’s headquarters and each of its branches using Google Map API. This driving

time serves as the benchmark and is then compared with the travel time based on the fastest

airline route. Whenever transportation by car takes less time than by plane, we use driving

time as the minimum travel time.

        We determine the fastest airline route between each pair of headquarters-branch

locations by summing the following three components of a plane trip: (1) the driving time

between a bank’s headquarters and the origin airport; (2) the flight duration, including the

average ramp-to-ramp time and estimated time spent at airports; and (3) the driving time

between the arrival airport and the branch. With respect to the estimated time spent at airports,


3
  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) compiles the data, which are provided by the Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (BTS). As required by the US Code Title 49 (Transportation), all airlines must report
their operating or “traffic” information to DOT in Form 41 and are subject to fines for misreporting.
                                                                                                                10



we follow Giroud (2013) and add one hour to account for the time spent at the origin and

destination airports, plus another one hour for each layover time for indirect flights. 4



II.D.    Bank-level Controls

         Our analyses account for time-varying bank-county and bank-specific characteristics.

We use data from the Summary of Deposits and the Reports of Condition and Income (“Call

Reports”). For bank-specific traits, we use the following: Bank size is the log of the book

value of total assets; Capital-asset ratio is the total amount of capital divided by the book

value of assets; and ROA is the net income divided by total assets. We further account for the

size of branches owned by each bank in a county using the branch-level deposit data from

SOD. In particular, Ln(Deposit) equals the log of the total amount of deposits held at a bank’s

branches in a given county. We control for Ln(Deposit) throughout our analyses, but note that

all of the results hold when omitting Ln(Deposit).



III. Empirical Methodology
III.A. Identification Strategy

         We exploit the introduction of new airline routes that reduce travel times between

banks’ headquarters and their branches as an exogenous shock to communication across

hierarchies within banking organizations. This strategy rests on two building blocks. First,

travel time is positively related to the costs of a bank’s headquarters acquiring information

and collaborating with its branch managers about credit allocation decisions. Second, new

timesaving airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its branches facilitate the flow of

soft information within the banking organization. Based on these building blocks, we use the

introduction of airline routes that lower travel times between banks’ headquarters and

branches as an exogenous source of variation in the flow of soft information within banking

  There are four ways in which new airline routes reduce travel times between a bank’s headquarters and a
branch: (1) Indirect to Indirect, where a new indirect flight using a different route replaces a previously optimal
indirect flight; (2) Indirect to Direct, where a new direct flight connecting a branch with its headquarters
replaces a previously optimal indirect flight with stopover(s); (3) Direct to Direct, where a new direct flight
using a different route replaces a previously optimal direct flight. For example, the new route may involve an
airport that is closer to the location of the branch or headquarters; (4) Drive to Flight, where a new direct or
indirect flight replaces driving as the optimal means of transportation.

institutions. This treatment is likely to be especially pertinent to our study of banking and

small business lending, because the information underlying decisions concerning small

business loans often cannot be summarized in a “hard” numeric score. Rather, decisions

about small business loans often involve discussions about the skills and creditworthiness of

the prospective borrower and deliberations about the overall context of the potential loan. To

the extent that in-person discussions facilitate the communication and evaluation of such soft

information, airline travel routes that reduce travel time will facilitate small business lending.

        We construct our key explanatory variable, Treatment, at the bank-county-year level.

This is to accommodate the fact that the small business lending data provided in CRA is

available at the bank-county level, and not the branch level. For each bank that has branches

in a county in a year, Treatment is a dummy variable that equals one if a new airline route

reduces the travel time between the bank’s headquarters and any of its branches in the county.

Otherwise, Treatment for that bank-county-year observation equals zero. If this new route is

terminated in the future, Treatment switches back to zero. 5 Overall, 6,663 bank-counties in
our sample experience a reduction in the travel time between headquarters and counties due

to the introduction of new airline routes, representing 4.2% of the sample.

        This identification strategy allows us to condition out all time-county influences. For

example, one might be concerned that local economic shocks could shape both the
introduction of new airline routes and local lending, leading to spurious findings. To address

this concern, we control for county-year fixed effects, which is feasible because our treatment

is uniquely identified by two locations: the branch county and the address of the bank’s

headquarters. As long as not all branches in a county have their bank headquarters located in

the same place, we can distinguish the treatment from county-year effects.

        Furthermore, we control for a full set of bank-county fixed effects to condition out

any time-invariant factors across the counties in which each bank has branches. For example,

some banks may lend persistently more in some counties. Adding bank-county fixed effects

  As described in Giroud (2013), airlines terminate routes infrequently. We show in robustness checks below
that the results hold if we ignore terminations and focus only on an event window from 5 years before to 5 years
after the treatment.
                                                                                             12



conditions out these differences to focus on within-bank variations in small business lending

across different counties following a shock to airline routes that alters travel times.

       This initial difference-in-differences analysis compares changes in small business

loans originated by two or more distinct sets of otherwise similar branches in the same county.

One set of branches experiences the introduction of new airline routes that reduce travel time

to their headquarters, and the other set of branches does not. The first difference can be

viewed as comparing small business lending in a branch-county before and after the

introduction of a new airline route that reduces the travel time between the branch-county and

the bank’s headquarters. The second difference can be viewed as the difference between

branches in a county that are treated with new airline routes and branches in the same county

that are not treated with the opening of new airline routes that reduce branch-headquarters

travel times (the control group). Given the staggered nature of the introduction of new airline

routes, the control group includes all branch-counties that have not yet been treated.

       We then conduct a series of triple-difference-in-differences evaluations to better

identify the impact of improved communication within banking organizations on small-

business lending. In particular, we test whether the impact of new airline routes on small

business lending varies in a theoretically predictable manner across different firms, counties,

and banks. We describe this triple-difference-in-differences strategy below.



III.B. Baseline Model Specification

       To assess the impact of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between

headquarters and branches on small business lending, we estimate the following regression:


  𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛽 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 𝜸′ 𝑿𝑏𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝑗𝑗 + 𝛼𝑏𝑏 + 𝜀𝑏𝑏𝑏 , (1)



where b indexes banks, j indexes branch-counties (i.e., counties in which bank b has
branches), and t indexes years. The dependent variable, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑏𝑏𝑏 ,

denotes one of the CRA lending measures for bank b in county j during year t. That is, we

separately examine the three loan-size categories: (1) $100,000 or less, (2) greater than
                                                                                            13



$100,000 and less than or equal to $250,000, and (3) greater than $250,000 and less than or
equal to $1 million. The key variable of interest, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑡 , is a dummy variable that

equals one if a new airline route has been introduced that reduces the travel time between

bank b’s headquarters and its branches in county j in year t and those years after t unless the
route is terminated. 𝛼𝑏𝑏 and 𝛼𝑗𝑗 represent a full set of bank-by-county and county-by-year
fixed effects, respectively. 𝑿𝒃𝒃,𝒕−𝟏 denotes a vector of control variables, namely the size of

branches owned by bank b in county j at the beginning of year t, Ln(Deposit), and the time-

varying characteristics of bank b at the beginning of year t, namely Bank size, Capital-asset

ratio, and ROA. The coefficient of focus is 𝛽, which measures the effect of introducing new

airline routes on small business lending. We estimate equation (1) using ordinary least
squares (OLS), with standard errors clustered at the county level to account for any

correlations of the error terms within each county.



IV. Results
IV.A. Main Results

       As shown in Table 2, the introduction of new airline routes that reduces the travel

time between headquarters and branch-counties leads to a sharp increase in small-business

lending within the smallest loan-size category (i.e., $100,000 or less). We do not observe
such effects for larger loans (i.e., loans in two larger loan-size categories $100,000 –

$250,000 and $250,000 – $1 million). As shown in columns 1 – 4 for the smallest loan-size

category, Treatment, enters positively and significantly at the 1% level in the regressions

where the dependent variable is either Loan amount (columns 1 and 2) or Loan number

(columns 3 and 4). In contrast, when examining the larger loan-size categories in columns 5 –

8 and 9 – 12, Treatment enters insignificantly and with an economically small coefficient

estimate in both the loan amount and loan number regressions.

       The estimated economic magnitude of the impact of new timesaving airline routes on

small-business lending is large. For example, using the most conservative coefficient

estimates, the results imply that a new time-reducing airline route between a branch-county

and its headquarters boosts the total amount and number of small business loans in the
                                                                                              14



$100,000 or less loan-size category by 9.6% and 19.5%, respectively. Put differently,

consider two otherwise similar branches located in the same county that are affiliated with

two different banks, which are headquartered in different places. One branch is treated—a

new airline route reduces the travel time to its headquarters—and the other branch is

untreated. The Table 2 estimates imply that the bank with the treated branch would increase

small-business lending in the branch-county (in the $100,000 or less loan-size category) by

$85,239 (= 9.6%*887,913) per annum.

       These findings are consistent with the view that the introduction of airline routes that

reduce headquarters-branch travel times facilitates the communication of soft information

within a bank, leading to a material increase in small business lending in the branch-county.

The effects are statistically and economically significant for loans in the smallest size

category, and insignificant for loans in larger size categories. To the extent that (a) loan size

is positively related to the size of the borrowing firm, and (b) lending to smaller firms

requires greater reliance on soft information, these different findings across the loan-size

categories offer support for the view that enhancing the communication of soft information

within banking organizations facilitates small-business lending. Consequently, we now focus

exclusively on loans in the smallest size category.



IV.B. Dynamics Effects
       To assess the validity of the identification strategy, we examine whether there are pre-

treatment tends in small-business lending. To do this, we employ the specification in

Equation (1), while replacing the Treatment dummy with a set of dummies indicating the
                                                                 −1           0
number of years relative to the treatment year, namely, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 ,
         1                  2+             𝑘
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 , and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 . 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 (where k = -1, 0, 1, or 2+) equals one if

there was a new airline route that reduced travel time between bank b’s headquarters and
                                                                             −1
branch-county j, k years relative to treatment year t. For example, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 equals one

in year t-1 for bank b’s branch-county j if a new airline route reduced the travel time between
                                                                       0
bank b’s headquarters and its branches in county j in year t; 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 equals one in year

t for bank b’s branch-county j if a new airline route reduced the travel time between bank b’s
                                                                                              15


                                                                  2+
headquarters and its branches in county j in year t; and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏 equals one in year t+2

and after for bank b’s branch-county j if a new airline route reduced the travel time between

bank b’s headquarters and its branches in county j in year t. Besides testing whether changes

in local branches’ small business lending happen before the treatment, this approach allows

us to observe whether new airline routes have an enduring effect on small business lending.

       Table 3 shows that (a) neither the dollar amount of small business loans nor the
number of small business loans exhibits pre-treatment trends, and (b) the positive effects of

the treatment on small-firm lending last beyond two years. Whether examining the amount or

number of small-firm lending by bank b in its branch-county j, Treatment-1 enters

insignificantly and with an economically small coefficient, suggesting that there is not a

significant change in small-firm lending in the branch-county before a new airline route

reduces the travel time between the branch-county and its headquarters. The coefficients on

Treatment 0, Treatment 1, and Treatment 2+ are generally positive and statistically significant,
suggesting that increases in small business lending in a treated branch-county lasts for at least

two years.



IV.C. A Placebo Test—Cargo Flights—and Other Robustness Tests

       We next conduct a placebo test and examine the introduction of cargo flights that
reduce travel times between a bank’s headquarters and its branches. While the opening of

such cargo routes might reflect greater economic connections between the headquarters and

branch-counties, cargo routes will not facilitate greater in-person communication between

headquarters and branch officials. If our finding that a reduction in headquarters-branch

travel time boosts small-firm lending reflects the easier transmission of soft information

through in-person conversations, then the opening of cargo routes should have no effect on

lending. We confirm this in Table 4. As shown, the treatment dummy enters insignificantly in

all specifications, suggesting that the opening of airline routes that reduce cargo transport

times between a bank’s headquarters and its branches in a county does not alter lending by

the bank in the county.
                                                                                             16



       We conduct several robustness checks to test the sensitivity of our results, and report

those findings in Table 5. First, we were concerned that single-branch banks, which typically

have their headquarters and branch office located in the same place, might distort our results.

So, we re-did the baseline analyses while excluding single-branch banks from the sample.

This restriction reduces the number of sample banks from 2067 to 1968, and the number of

observations drops slightly from 159,911 to 159,301. As shown in columns 1 – 4, the results

hold. Second, we were concerned that the results could be affected by observations well

before or after the introduction of a timesaving airline route. Following Giroud (2013),

therefore, we use an event window of [t-5, t+5], where t denotes the year of the treatment. In

this robustness test, we set Treatment equal to one after a new airline route reduces the travel

time between a branch-county and its headquarters, and zero otherwise. As shown in columns

5 – 8, the results are robust to this alternative definition of the treatment. Third, we were

concerned that the results might be driven by very small airlines hired by the bank.

Consequently, we repeat our baseline regressions while focusing on airline routes operated by

carriers classified in T-100 as major carriers, national carriers, or regional carriers. As

reported in columns 9 – 12, all of the results hold.



IV.D. Heterogeneity in the Treatment Effect

In this section, we conduct a series of triple-difference-in-differences tests to evaluate

whether the treatment effect differs across different firms, counties, and banks in a

theoretically predictable manner. In particular, we analyze how the effects of new time-

reducing airline routes on small business lending vary by (a) the extent of firm opacity and

collateral, (b) the intensity of market competition within counties, and (c) the degree to which

managers at a bank’s headquarters are time-constrained with respect to visiting the bank’s

branches. Conducting these heterogeneous treatment tests helps in drawing sharper inferences

about whether the observed changes in small business lending following new airline routes

are due to changes in the costs of communicating soft information across the hierarchies of

banking organizations.
                                                                                            17



       IV.D.1. Information Opacity and Collateral

       If the effects of introducing new airline routes on small business lending work

through improving the communication of soft information, we should observe stronger

effects of timesaving airline routes on lending among businesses that depend more on the

ability of banks to obtain and process soft information about their creditworthiness. A

business’s dependence on transmitting soft information to banks in order to obtain credit is a

function of both (a) the availability of hard information on the firm and (b) the firm’s

collateral, which reduces the degree to which information shapes credit availability.

       While small firms are generally thought to rely more on soft information than large

firms (e.g., Petersen and Rajan 1994, Berger, Bouwman, and Kim 2017), small firms differ

with respect to opacity and collateral. To the extent that potential lenders have more

opportunities to collect information about firms over time, older businesses will be less

opaque than otherwise similar younger businesses (Boot, 2000; Bustamante and D’Acunto,

2018). From this perspective, facilitating communication within banks will have a larger

impact on lending to young small businesses that rely more on soft information to obtain

bank loans. Next, consider collateral. Collateral mitigates well-known moral hazard and

adverse selection problems, reducing the effects of informational asymmetries on credit

allocation (e.g. Stiglitz and Weiss 1981; Bester 1985; Besanko and Thakor 1987; Aghion and

Bolton 1992; Hart 1995; Berger, Frame, and Ioannidou 2011). To the extent that tangible

assets, such as property, plant, or equipment, are more effective forms of collateral than

intangible assets, firms with more tangible assets will be less credit constrained than

otherwise similar firms with more intangible assets. As such, an improvement in the

transmission of soft information within a bank will have a bigger effect on firms with less

tangible assets all else equal. Thus, we conjecture that introducing airline routes that reduce

headquarters-branch travel times will have a bigger effect on lending to (a) younger small

firms and (b) low-collateral small firms.

       To test this, we construct proxies for opacity and collateral using the NETS dataset,

which covers the universe of U.S. businesses. In particular, the NETS database provides

time-series information on business name, address, industry classification, estimated sales,
                                                                                                               18



employees, and year in which a business was born, for about 58.8 million U.S. establishments

since 1990. This enables us to construct measures of the characteristics of small businesses

within each county. Following the CRA definition, we focus on businesses with annual

revenues below $1 million.

           First, for each county in each year, %Young business equals the percentage of small

businesses that are less than three years old, where each business is weighted by the number

of employees. Under the assumption that there is less information available about younger

firms relative to older firms, we use %Young business as a proxy for the degree of

informational opacity among small firms in a county. We set High %Young business for a

county equal to one if %Young business is above the sample median level, and zero otherwise.

           Second, we compute a proxy for the asset tangibility of small firms at the county-year

level using the following method: (1) using firm-level data from Compustat over the 1990s

(before the start of our sample period), we calculate the median value of the ratio of tangible

assets (property, plant and equipment) to total assets of all firms within each industry and call

this ratio the industry asset tangibility ratio; and (2) after assigning this industry asset

tangibility ratio to each small firm in the same industry, we compute the weighted asset

tangibility ratio among small business in a county-year, where each small business is

weighted by its number of employees (Asset tangibility). 6 Thus, Asset tangibility varies with
the industrial composition of small businesses in the county. Under the assumption that

greater asset tangibility reduces the impact of informational frictions on credit allocation,

Asset tangibility is negatively associated with the degree to which banks rely on soft

information to make loans to small firms in a county. We define High Asset intangibility as a

dummy variable that equals one if Asset tangibility is below the sample median value across

counties, and zero otherwise.

Where c and t denote county and year. Asset tangibility ratio𝑖,𝑡 is the industry asset tangibility ratio of firm i
(calculated from Compustat and assigned by industry); #𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖,𝑡 is the number of employees owned by
firm i in year t; and #𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐,𝑡 is the total number of employees owned by all small firms in county c in
year t.
                                                                                                 19



       Thus, we employ the following regression specification:


𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛼𝑗𝑗 + 𝛼𝑏𝑏 + 𝜑1 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏 +

                      𝜑2 × 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑗 + 𝜸′ 𝑿𝑏𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑏𝑏𝑏 ,            (2)



where b, j, t denote bank, branch-county, and year, respectively. Building on the baseline
model in Equation (1), we now interact the Treatment dummy with 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑗 ,

which either equals High %Young business or High Asset intangibility in county j. For

both %Young business and Asset tangibility, we use the value in the year prior to a treatment

to mitigate the concern that the introduction of new airline routes alters the industrial
structure of small firms in a county. Other variables are the same as those in Equation (1)

above. The coefficient, 𝜑2 , on the interaction term captures the heterogeneous effect of a new

airline route on small business lending across branch-counties with differing degrees of

young or collateralized small firms. If the introduction of new airline routes indeed enhances

small business lending by facilitating the communication of soft information, we expect the

effects to be stronger among branches in counties (a) with more opaque small firms, as

measured by High %Young business, and (b) with small firms that have less collateralizable

assets, High Asset intangibility.
       The results from estimating Equation (2) confirm these two predictions. As shown in

Tables 6 and 7, the positive effects of introducing new airline routes on lending to small

business are stronger in branch-counties in which there are a higher proportion of (a) young

small firms and (b) small firms in industries with low asset tangibility. From Table 6 columns

1 and 2, the coefficient on the interaction term, Treatment * High %Young business, is

positive and statistically significant at least at the 5% level. The coefficient on the linear term,

Treatment, is statistically insignificant and economically small. This suggests that the loan-

enhancing effects of new airline routes are significant only in High %Young business branch-

counties. The coefficients from column 2 suggest that following the introduction of new

airline routes, the amount of small business loans would increase by 17% more in

High %Young business branch-counties than in Low %Young business branch-counties. We
                                                                                               20



find similar patterns when examining loan number as reported in columns 3 and 4. The

results are similar for asset intangibility. As shown in Table 7, the interaction term, Treatment

* High Asset Intangibility, enters positively and statistically significantly, suggesting that the

loan-increasing effects are more pronounced for branch-counties where local small

businesses have less tangible assets. In terms of economic magnitudes, the estimates indicate

the introduction of a time-saving new airline route will increase the value of small loans by

17.5% more in High Asset intangibility branch-counties relative to Low Asset intangibility

branch-counties. The results in Tables 6 and 7 are consistent with the view that the

introduction of new airline routes leads to a sharp increase in small business lending by

facilitating the transmission of soft information between branches and headquarters.



       IV.D.2. Market Competition

       We next evaluate whether the treatment effect is larger in counties with more intense

bank competition. To the extent that greater competition increases the incentives for bank

branches to finance new, small business clients, we exploit differences in the competitiveness

of banking markets to better identify the impact of reducing the costs of transmitting soft

information on small-firm lending. In particular, we evaluate the hypothesis that improving

the flow of soft information will have a bigger effect on small-firm lending in more

competitive markets.

       To conduct these analyses, we calculate the degree of banking market competition

faced by banks at the branch-county level. In particular, Market competition equals one

minus the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of small business lending in each county,

where HHI equals the sum of squared market share of each bank’s small business lending in a

county. A higher value of Market competition indicates more intense competition. Consistent

with previous analyses, we use the value of Market competition in a branch-county in the

year prior to the treatment to mitigate the concern that the introduction of new airline routes

alters the structure of the banking market. We then define High Market competition as a

dummy variable that equals one if Market competition is above the sample median value, and

zero otherwise. We estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects across markets with varying
                                                                                               21



degrees of competition using a specification similar to Equation (2), except that we replace

the conditional variable with High Market competition.

          As reported in Table 8, the treatment effect is materially larger in counties with more

intense bank competition. That is, the interaction term, Treatment × High Market competition,

enters positively and statistically significantly at the 1% level across all specifications,

indicating that the introduction of new airline routes increases the amount and number of

small loans more in more competitive branch-counties. The estimated impact is economically

large. Introducing an airline route that reduces the branch-headquarters travel time increases

the small loan amount and loan number by about 19% more in High Market competition

branch-counties than in other branch-counties. This corresponds to an increase of $168,703

(= 19%*887,913) in loan amount and 6 (= 19%*30) in loan number in the average branch-

county.

          The results in Table 8 support the view that a reduction in in-person communications

costs between local branches and headquarters facilitates the transmission of soft information,

boosting lending to small and opaque clients. The effects are stronger for branches facing

more intense competition, which is consistent with the view that competition incentivizes

banks to seek new growth opportunities, so that branches in more competitive environments

react more strongly to reductions in the costs of communicating soft information.



          IV.D.3. Monitoring Convenience

          A defining characteristic of soft information is that it is most effectively transmitted

through in-person interactions. In our context, this means managers at headquarters travelling

to branches. The marginal benefit of a reduction in headquarter-branch travel time with

respect to branch lending, therefore, will be increasing the value of the manager’s time. In

this section, we evaluate whether the treatment effects are greater among banks in which

managers are more time-constrained.

          We construct two rough proxies for the degree to which bank managers are time-

constrained that build on Giroud (2013). The first measure, #branches, equals the log number

of branches affiliated with each bank. The second measure, Total distance, equals the log
                                                                                                               22



total geographical distance (in miles) between a bank’s headquarters and all of its affiliated

branches. 7 We interpret higher values of #branches or Total distance as positively related to

the time-constraints on conducting in-person visits to all of a bank’s branches. We categorize

banks as High #branches (High Total distance) banks if the value of #branches (High Total

distance) is above the sample median value. Using Equation (2) regression specification, we

interact the treatment dummy with one of the two measures of monitoring time constraints,

i.e., High #branches or High Total distance.

         As shown in Table 9, the effects of new airline routes on the amount and number of

small business loans are more pronounced among banks with more time-constrained

managers at headquarters. From columns 1 – 4, we observe that the introduction of new

airline routes significantly increases the amount and number of small business loans for

branches whose headquarters have a larger number of affiliated branches. Columns 5 – 8

exhibit similar patterns when measuring headquarter time constraints by Total distance.

Overall, the results in Table 9 are fully consistent with our conjecture that the introduction of

new airline routes effectively improves within-bank communication by reducing managers’

travel time between branches and headquarters.



V. Conclusion
         In this paper, we investigate how communication within banking organizations affects

small business lending. We use travel time between a bank’s headquarters and its branches as

a proxy for the costs of communicating soft information within the bank. We exploit the

introduction of airline routes that reduce the headquarters-branch travel time as an exogenous

source of variation of the costs of communicating soft information across a bank’s hierarchies.

         We discover that the introduction of airline routes that reduce the travel time between

a bank’s headquarters and its branches boosts small business lending by the bank in the

branch’s county. Several extensions suggest that (1) these new airline routes stimulate

7
 To compute physical distance (in miles), we use the great-circle distance formula widely used in physics and
navigation. Specifically, the great-circle distance between any two points equals 𝑟 × arcos(sin 𝜙1 sin 𝜙2 +
cos 𝜙1 cos 𝜙2 cos(𝜆1 − 𝜆2 )), where 𝜙1 , 𝜆1 , and 𝜙2 , 𝜆2 denote the geographical latitude and longitude of points
1 and 2, respectively; and r is approximate radius for the spherical Earth (3963 miles).
                                                                                              23



lending to small firms by facilitating the transmission of soft information within a bank, and

(2) soft information is vital in allocating credit to small firms that tend to lack hard

information. For example, the new airline routes trigger an increase in lending to small firms

but not larger firms, which is consistent with the time-saving airlines routes lowering the

costs of transmitting soft information and smaller firms relying on soft information more than

larger firms. Second, the results hold when examining new passenger airline routes but not

when analyzing new cargo flights that reduce the time it takes to transport cargo from

headquarters to branches. Thus, the relationship between flights and small business loans is

linked to the transportation of people, which is essential for communicating soft information.

Third, the results are stronger among businesses, counties, and banks suggested by theory. In

particular, we find that the introduction of airline routes that reduce the travel time between a

bank’s headquarters and its branches has a bigger effect in branch-counties when (a) local

small businesses are more reliant on soft information and have less collateral, (b) the banking

market is more competitive, and (c) the managers at the bank’s headquarters are more time

constrained. Overall, our findings suggest that the introduction of new airline routes that

reduces the travel time between headquarters and branches makes it easier for headquarters to

acquire soft information, facilitating branch lending to small, informationally-opaque firms.

Table 2 The effect of introducing new airline routes on small business lending, by origination amount
This table reports the effect of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its branch-county on its small business lending in each county, while
differentiating loans into three categories by their origination amount, i.e., less than $100k, between $100k and $250k, and between $250k and $1 million. The
dependent variables are Loan amount and Loan number for each of the three categories. The key explanatory variable, Treatment, is a dummy variable that equals
one if a new airline route has been introduced that reduces the travel time between each branch-county and its bank headquarters. Bank controls include Ln(Deposit),
Bank size, Capital-asset ratio, and ROA. For each bank-county, Ln(Deposit) measures the log total deposits held by each bank’s branches in a given county. Bank
size is the log book value of assets. Capital-asset ratio is the total amount of capital divided by the book value of assets. ROA is the net income divided by total assets.
All control variables are one-year-lagged. P-values are reported in parentheses and calculated using standard errors clustered at the county level. *, **, and ***
represent significant level at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 3 Dynamic effects of introducing new airline routes on small business lending
This table reports the dynamic effects of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and
its branch-county on its small business lending in each county. The dependent variables are Loan amount
(columns 1 and 2), and Loan number (columns 3 and 4) of loans originated to small businesses with loan
amount at origination less than $100k. The key explanatory variables, Treatment k, (where k = -1, 0, 1, or
2+) is a set of dummies indicating the number of years relative to the treatment year. Treatment -1 is an
indicator corresponding to one year before the treatment. Treatment 0 is an indicator corresponding to the
year of the treatment. Treatment 1 is an indicator corresponding to one year after the treatment, and
Treatment 2+ is an indicator corresponding to two years and beyond after the treatment. Bank controls
include Ln(Deposit), Bank size, Capital-asset ratio, and ROA. All control variables are one-year-lagged. P-
values are reported in parentheses and calculated using standard errors clustered at the county level. *, **,
and *** represent significant level at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 5 The effect of introducing new airline routes on small business lending, Robustness tests
This table reports the robustness tests on the effect of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its branch-county on its small business
lending in each county. Columns 1 – 4 exclude single-branch banks, and focus only on those multi-branch banks. Columns 5 – 8 use an event window of [t-5, t+5],
where t denotes the year of the treatment. Columns 9 – 12 use airline routes operated by major types of carriers only. The dependent variables are Loan amount and
Loan number of loans originated to small businesses with loan amount at origination less than $100k. The key explanatory variable in columns 1 – 4 and 9 – 12,
Treatment, is a dummy variable that equals one if a new airline route has been introduced and actively operating that reduces the travel time between each branch-
county and its bank headquarters. The key explanatory variable in columns 5 – 8, Treatment, is a dummy variable that equals one if a new airline route has been
introduced that reduces the travel time between each branch-county and its bank headquarters. Bank controls include Ln(Deposit), Bank size, Capital-asset ratio, and
ROA. All control variables are one-year-lagged. P-values are reported in parentheses and calculated using standard errors clustered at the county level. *, **, and ***
represent significant level at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 6 Heterogeneous effects of introducing new airline routes on small business
lending, by %young business
This table reports the effect of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its
branch-county on its small business lending in each county, while differentiating counties by the extent of
information opacity among its small businesses (with loan amount at origination less than $100k). %young
business equals the percentage of small businesses (with gross annual revenues below $1 million) aged less
than three years in a given county, measured in the year prior to a treatment. High %young business is an
indicator of one if %young business is above the sample median value, and zero otherwise. The dependent
variables are Loan amount (columns 1 and 2), and Loan number (columns 3 and 4) of loans originated to
small businesses. The key explanatory variable is Treatment, a dummy variable that equals one if a new
airline route has been introduced that reduces the travel time between each branch-county and its bank
headquarters, and its interaction with the indicator of High %Young business. Bank controls include
Ln(Deposit), Bank size, Capital-asset ratio, and ROA. All control variables are one-year-lagged. P-values
are reported in parentheses and calculated using standard errors clustered at the county level. *, **, and
*** represent significant level at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 7 Heterogeneous effects of introducing new airline routes on small business
lending, by Asset tangibility
This table reports the effect of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its
branch-county on its small business lending in each county, while differentiating counties by the extent of
tangible assets among its small businesses (with loan amount at origination less than $100k). Asset
tangibility is the weighted average of tangible assets across industries among small businesses in each
county. High Asset intangibility is an indicator of one if Asset tangibility is below the sample median value,
and zero otherwise. The dependent variables are Loan amount (columns 1 and 2), and Loan number
(columns 3 and 4) of loans originated to small businesses. The key explanatory variable is Treatment, a
dummy variable that equals one if a new airline route has been introduced that reduces the travel time
between each branch-county and its bank headquarters, and its interaction with the indicator of High Asset
intangibility. Bank controls include Ln(Deposit), Bank size, Capital-asset ratio, and ROA. All control
variables are one-year-lagged. P-values are reported in parentheses and calculated using standard errors
clustered at the county level. *, **, and *** represent significant level at the 10%, 5%, and 1%,

Table 8 Heterogeneous effects of introducing new airline routes on small business
lending, by Competition
This table reports the effect of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its
branch-county on its small business lending in each county, while differentiating counties by the intensity
of local market competition. The dependent variables are Loan amount (columns 1 and 2), and Loan
number (columns 3 and 4) of loans originated to small businesses (with loan amount at origination less
than $100k). Market Concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of banks’ market share in
each county, measured in the year prior to the treatment. High Market Competition is a dummy variable
that equals one if Market Concentration falls below the sample median value, and zero otherwise. The key
explanatory variable is Treatment, a dummy variable that equals one if a new airline route has been
introduced that reduces the travel time between each branch-county and its bank headquarters, and its
interaction with the indicator of Low Competition. Bank controls include Ln(Deposit), Bank size, Capital-
asset ratio, and ROA. All control variables are one-year-lagged. P-values are reported in parentheses and
calculated using standard errors clustered at the county level. *, **, and *** represent significant level at
the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 9 Heterogeneous effects of introducing new airline routes on small business lending, by headquarters’ monitoring time constraints
This table reports the effect of introducing new airline routes between a bank’s headquarters and its branch-county on its small business lending in each county, while
differentiating banks by their headquarters’ monitoring time constraints. The dependent variables are Loan amount and Loan number of loans originated to small
businesses (with loan amount at origination less than $100k). We measure each bank headquarters’ monitoring time constraints using two variables. #branches equals
the log of the total number of branches owned by a bank. Total distance equals the log total distance between each bank headquarters and its affiliated branches. Both
are measured in the year prior to a treatment. High #branches (High Total distance) is a dummy variable that equals one if #branches (Total distance) is above the
sample median value, and zero otherwise. The key explanatory variable is, Treatment, a dummy variable that equals one if a new airline route has been introduced
that reduces the travel time between each branch-county and its bank headquarters, and its interaction with proxies for monitoring convenience. Bank controls
include Ln(Deposit), Bank size, Capital-asset ratio, and ROA. All control variables are one-year-lagged. P-values are reported in parentheses and calculated using
standard errors clustered at the county level. *, **, and *** represent significant level at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.
