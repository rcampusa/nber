Clean Air as an Experience Good in Urban China

JEL No. Q52,Q53

                                            ABSTRACT

The surprise economic shutdown due to COVID-19 caused a sharp improvement in urban air
quality in many previously heavily polluted Chinese cities. If clean air is a valued experience
good, then this short-term reduction in pollution in spring 2020 could have persistent medium-
term effects on reducing urban pollution levels as cities adopt new “blue sky” regulations to
maintain recent pollution progress. We document that China’s cross-city Environmental Kuznets
Curve shifts as a function of a city’s demand for clean air. We rank 144 cities in China based on
their population’s baseline sensitivity to air pollution and with respect to their recent air pollution
gains due to the COVID shutdown. The largest experience good effect should take place for
cities featuring a high pollution sensitive population and where air quality has sharply improved
during the pandemic. The residents of these cities have increased their online discussions focused
on environmental protection, and local officials are incorporating “green” industrial subsidies into
post-COVID stimulus policies.

I. Introduction

      In recent years, China’s cities have enjoyed economic growth and declining urban
air pollution.        While economic growth rates varied across cities and regions, the
nation’s economy as a whole was growing at a rate of roughly 6% per year over the last
five years.      Over the years 2015 to 2019, air pollution has declined annually by 6.9%
in the average city and by 8.1% in the big cities.
      In early 2020, urban air pollution declined in China due to the COVID-19 induced
economic shutdown (He et al. 2020). 1                   In the first three months of 2020, the PM2.5
concentration in 285 Chinese cities declined by 11.9% (with a standard deviation of
18.1%) relative to the same period in last year.                        These gains were not uniformly
distributed. Some cities such as Baoding and Xingtai in Hebei Province experienced
huge gains – they had a 26% and 29% decline from their initial high pollution levels
(about 80 μg/m3 in this period in previous years).
      In this paper, we study how the early 2020 economic shutdown influences urban
China’s air quality, citizen environmental engagement, and the nation’s regulatory and
industrial policy dynamics. A standard prediction based on a stationary Environmental
Kuznets Curve (EKC) posits that if a developing country economy experiences a “V”
shaped economic recovery that pollution will follow similar dynamics and may even
rise with ongoing economic growth (Grossman and Krueger 1995). 2                                 A local official
in a developing country city might even choose to relax environmental regulations
during an economic slowdown if he believes that such regulations hinder economic
growth (Selden and Song 1995).
      In contrast, if clean air is a valued experience good, then the reduction in pollution
in spring 2020 could have persistent effects on future urban pollution levels even if the
local economies fully recover from the recent recession.                         In China’s polluted cities,
blue skies represent a new good.                 Until they experience persistent air quality gains,

  He et al. (2020) defines “city lockdown” when the following three measures are all enforced: (1) prohibition of
unnecessary commercial activities for people’s daily lives, (2) prohibition of any type of gathering by residents, (3)
restrictions on private (vehicles) and public transportation.
2
  A strict adherent to the view that there is a stable Environmental Kuznets Curve would posit that a city initially
located to the left of the turning point, moves down the hill as per-capita income declines and then moves back up
the hill as the economy recovers.
                                                           2
urban residents may under-estimate their own valuation of this new good.           Research
on experience goods have studied optimal pricing of such goods.            Firms that market
new products have incentives to initially price them at a low level to stimulate demand
and to give consumers “a taste” of the new product (Riordan 1986, Shapiro 1983).
     A “silver lining” of the COVID-19 pandemic is to offer millions of Chinese
urbanites this clean air experience.    While China does not hold direct elections, the
Chinese people now have much more freedom to express their opinions online and in
social media on environmental issues (which are not very sensitive compared to other
political topics).   Urban leaders are also held accountable to their citizens’ voice
because of the rising information transparency.        They are evaluated by the central
government for political promotion.     The criteria for promotion include social stability
and environmental targets as well as local economic growth (Zheng et al. 2014).        Both
online and offline protects are regarded as threats to social stability.   The local official
performance criteria provides ambitious local leaders with career concerns to consider
adopting “green policy”; especially if local residents increasingly desire such policies.
     The clean air as an experience good hypothesis posits that the demand for
increased regulation will take place in those cities that both enjoy increased short run
access to cleaner air and where the population is more sensitive to pollution exposure.
This experience effect can vary by city.    In those cities where people exhibit a stronger
demand for cleaner air, we predict an even greater “experience good” effect as the
COVID shutdown cleans up the air.       In a recent research, we have used the content of
social media “tweets” in China to measure for each city, to what extent local air
pollution lowers residents’ sentiment. Using this city level index to measure the local
population’s pollution sensitivity, we identify those cities whose residents have
revealed that they face the highest marginal sentiment cost due to pollution         (Zheng
et al. 2019).
     In arguing that the COVID-19 induced shutdown may accelerate pollution
reduction progress in China’s most polluted cities, we need to address the counter-
factual of how pollution would have evolved in different Chinese cities if the COVID-
19 shock had not occurred.      We study this by first examining recent urban pollution
                                              3
dynamics over the years 2015 to 2019 across China.                            We explore the key roles of
industrial activity, the transport sector and the home sector in driving these dynamics.
We then build on the work of He et al. (2020) to explore how the recent COVID-19
shock affected pollution dynamics.
      In the last section of the paper, we use several new data sets to explore the nascent
demand for more intense environmental regulations in We rank 144 cities in China
based on their population’s baseline sensitivity to air pollution and with respect to their
recent air pollution gains due to the COVID shutdown.                          The largest experience good
effect should take place for cities featuring a high pollution sensitive population and
where air quality has sharply improved during the pandamic. For these cities, we
document that in mid-2020 the local population has increased the discussion of
environmental protection on the Internet, and local officials are incorporating “green”
industrial subsidies into post-COVID stimulus policies.                             If these regulations are
effective, then this will shift the EKC down and lead to a time series path featuring less
pollution as economic development takes place (Dasgupta et al. 1998).




II. Recent Trends in Urban Air Pollution in China


      We start by presenting recent trends in air pollution across China’s cities over the
years 2015 to 2019. The pollution data reports each city’s PM2.5 concentration level
based on the real time platform managed by the China Environmental Monitoring
Station network3.          The data is released daily.            We calculate each city’s annual mean
value. Cities with larger populations have higher average pollution levels at the start of
the period but have enjoyed greater pollution reductions over time than smaller cities.
Smaller cities have also enjoyed air pollution reductions. During a time of economic
and population growth, China’s pollution levels have declined 15 μg/m3 on a base of

3
  The quality of China’s official air quality data has been improved significantly in the last few years, as documented
by recent studies. For instance, Liang et al. (2016) found that the US PM2.5 monitors show measured values highly
consistent with those measured at China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection PM2.5 monitors located nearby.
Stoerk (2016) compared the air quality data via Benford’s Law which suggests that misreporting of air quality data
for Beijing has likely ended in 2012.
                                                            4
55 μg/m3 (See Figure A1).
      Since big cities are richer, local leaders are likely to enforce more stringent
environmental regulations (Selden and Song 1995, Grossman and Krueger 1995).
When       cities differ with respect to their environmental regulatory enforcement, this
raises the possibility that footloose polluting industries will relocate to poorer cities that
have less stringent regulations, which leads to the “domestic pollution haven” problem
(Zheng et. al. 2014). In Figure A2, we document the decline in the share of local output
from manufacturing in both big and small cities. Big cities have experienced a larger
decline. The transition to services and high tech in China’s major cities is an important
factor that mirrors the transition that occurred in U.S cities (Kahn 1999).                           The nation’s
industrial policy has also contributed to this geographic shift.                      As proposed by the 13th
Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), this contributed to the differential industructure trends
across different types of cities. 4            Given that air pollution has declined in recent years
in both big and small cities and in rich and poor cities indicates this domestic pollution
haven effect is not big, thanks to the overall rise of pollution regulation efforts in
Chinese cities.
      To explore recent changes in the urban population’s exposure to pollution, we
calculate the urban population’s distribution of pollution exposure in 2015 and 2019.
In each year, we tabulate the annual mean pollution data and weight the data by the
city’s population. Figure 1 reports these two cumulative distribution functions (CDF).
Define X80 as the 80th percentile of the CDF in 2015. X80 indicates that 20% of the
total urban population lived in a city whose average pollution level was equal to or
greater than X80.          We find that there have been large reductions in pollution exposure
to the dirtiest air.


                                       // Insert Figure 1 about here //

  According to the plan, large cities and cities in the eastern region focus on the development of high-tech industries,
while middle-sized and small cities and cities in the central and western regions are responsible for the traditional
manufacturing industry. From 2015 to 2018, the average drop in the share of manufacturing in total GDP of Chinese
cities was 3 percentage points (equals to 6.8% of the mean manufacturing share in 2015). 178 cities experienced
decline, and 99 cities experienced increase in this share. More than half of the cities with an increasing manufacturing
share are in the western region.
                                                             5
      In the year 2015, roughly 20% of Chinese urbanites were exposed to less than 40
units of PM2.5.        In the year 2019, this percentage grew to almost 60%. The median
Chinese urbanite was exposed to just over 50 units of pollution in 2015 while the
median person was exposed to 35 units in 2019. 5                     The large distance between the two
cumulative distribution functions highlights the significant pollution gains enjoyed by
those who live in moderately polluted areas (by way of comparison Los Angeles
features a PM2.5 average level of roughly 20).                   The Figure highlights that even at the
high quantiles of the pollution exposure distribution that there has been significant air
pollution exposure progress.


III. Increasing Public Demand for Clean Air Shifts the Environmental Kuznets
Curve


3.1 Measuring Clean Air Demand Using Internet Search Data
      Traditional revealed preference methods rely on annual data such as real estate
prices or survey data asking people to state their quality of life priorities. Scholars have
also studied the demand for self-protective goods such as masks and air filters and
studied how the demand varies across China (Sun et al. 2017, Ito and Zhang 2020,
Barwick et al. 2018).
      Rising access to real time “big data” provides new clues about how local pollution
and climate conditions affect our quality of life.                    In recent research, we have used
billions of social media messages posted on the equivalent of China’s Twitter to explore
how the population’s sentiment (expressed happiness) is affected by pollution and heat
(Zheng et al. 2019). People from different cities in China vary with respect to how
sensitive they are to air pollution.            Zheng et al. 2019 measures this by estimate a city
specific partial derivative of happiness (as revealed by social media content analysis)



5
  It is important to note that these calculations do not incorporate private averting behavior (Sun et al. 2017). We
also do not incorporate within city variation in pollution and the geographic distribution of people within the city.
                                                            6
with respect to that city/day PM2.5 (the “sentiment-pollution” elasticity) 6.
       In that study, the researchers use their 144 city sample to estimate a second stage
regression to understand the correlates of this pollution sensitivity. The relationship
between city income and pollution sensitivity is monotonically positive – people are
more sensitive to pollution in richer cities. At the same time, very dirty and clean cities
have a relatively higher elasticity compared to cities in the intermediate pollution range.
One explanation for this fact is that people who dislike air pollution most move and live
in cleaner cities, and at the same time, people in dirtier cities come to recognize the
health risks associated with the long-term pollution exposure.
       Using these city specific estimates of the sentiment-pollution elasticity, we divide
cities into above median and below median elasticity groups, and test whether the time
trends are equal for the two sets of cities over the years 2015 to 2019.
       We estimate equation (1) using city/year data to test whether cities with above
median sentiment for avoiding pollution have a steeper negative time trend. We test if
δ2<0.



             δ 0 + δ1 ⋅ Trendt + δ 2 ⋅ HSi ⋅ Trendt + δ 3 ⋅ X it + city fixed effects + ε it (1)
POLLUTION it =



       In equation (1), HS is a dummy variable, which equals 1 if the “sentiment-pollution”
elasticity of city i is higher (than the median value), and 0 otherwise. The sample is
restricted to the 144 cities whose “sentiment-pollution” elasticities have been estimated
by Zheng et al. (2019).
       The regression results are presented in Table 1.                       As shown in columns (1) and (2),
PM2.5 declined by 8.0% per year on average in these 144 cities from 2015 to 2019.


6
  In Zheng et al. (2019), they divide the full sample of city-day observations into 144 city subsamples and estimate
the following equation using a fixed effect regression approach for each city i. This procedure generates a marginal
city-specific partial derivative of sentiment with respect to PM2.5 - the “sentiment-pollution” elasticity, α1,i.. It is
expected to be negative – all else equal, people are more likely to be unhappy on days when their city’s pollution
level is higher.

SENTIMENTt,i and POLLUTIONt,i represent the sentiment measure and the pollution level (PM2.5 concentration) of
this city i on day t, respectively. We include other variables Xt,i which represents the city’s weather conditions, and
Tt. is used to control for date fixed effects, where T refers to a set of day indicator variables.
                                                                         7
The decline rate is 7.5% per year in lower sentiment-pollution elasticity cities and 8.8%
in the high elasticity cities.            The results suggest that cities where the population is
more susceptible to pollution have experienced a larger improvement in air quality. The
high anti-pollution sentiment cities tend to be the relatively rich cities.


                                      // Insert Table 1 about here //


      As Chinese urbanites have grown richer and more educated, this group should
increasingly demand “blue skies”. The subset of urbanites who live in the most
pollution sensitive cities should be most responsive and place more pressure on local
leaders (Zheng et al. 2014).
      To explore this hypothesis, we use Internet data to measure the bottom-up push
from the public for environmental protection and how this varies across time by city.
We use “environmental protection” as the keyword to create an environmental attention
index       (Baidu_index)            at      the       city      level       using        Baidu         platform
(http://index.baidu.com/v2/index.html#/). 7                   Specifically, the Baidu_index = total
entries of the key word “environment protection” in the Baidu search engine divided
by the total population.          This variable is measured in the number of entries per million
people.      This index reflects the public attention devoted to environment protection for
each city in a given         year.
      We study the yearly environmental attention index’s dynamics using Equation (2)
(with the same specification as Equation (1)). In column (3) of Table 1, we find that it
increases from 2015 to 2019 after controlling for climate and a city’s inherent
characteristics, and urbanites in cities featuring a higher sentiment-pollution elasticity
are paying more and more attention to environmental protection. In column (4), we
document that in the cities with a larger higher environmental attention index, they have
experience an air quality improvement in the next year.


7
  In China, The central government’s Ministry of Enviromental Protection and local governments’ Environmental
Protection Bueaus play the central role in pollution regulation. People use “environmental protection” on the social
media or all kinds of Internet forums when they discuss the current environmental policies from those government
bureaus or express their desire for such policies.

3.2 The Dynamic Environmental Kuznets Curve
      We test if the cities with a greater environmental awareness have an earlier EKC
turning point. Following the research design in Zheng et al. (2014), we estimate
equation (3) below in order to examine how the shape of the EKC and in particular the
GDP “turning point” varies as a function of the public sentiment-pollution elasticity
and their demand for environmental protection. In equation (3), the unit of analysis is a
city/year.    Following the EKC literature, we include a quadratic in a city’s per-capita
real GDP. 8        These variables proxy for the city’s enforcement of environmental
regulation and the quality of the local capital stock. We expect that in richer cities that
environmental regulations are more stringently enforced and that the capital stock is
newer and more energy efficient.



POLLUTION it = λ0 + λ1 ⋅ ln(GDPPCit ) + λ2 ⋅ ln(GDPPCit ) 2
                                                                                   (3)
                   + λ3 ⋅ ln( POPit ) + β 4 ⋅ X it + year fixed effects + ε it



      In equation (3), we also control for the city’s population level (the scale of activity)
and the weather conditions in that city/year and year fixed effects to control for the
macro conditions of the economy at that time.
      In column (1) of Table 2, results are based on the sample of 285 cities.                     We find
evidence of an inverted-U relationship between the city’s PM2.5 concentration and per-
capita GDP.       The turning point is about 48.8 thousand Yuan (7,839 US dollars, in 2015
constant price. 9      We also calculate the count of cities whose per-capita GDP is such
that they have passed the EKC turning point.                During the years 2015-2018, 47% cities
have passed the EKC turning point.              In columns (2) and (3), we use the median value

8
  We recognize that Hilton and Levinson (1998) recommend using a more flexible functional form for per-capita
income. In Appendix Table A1, we report such additional regressions. Our main findings are robust to such more
flexible specifications.

of the sentiment-pollution elasticity to divide the city sample into two subsamples.
We see that the two subsamples have similar turning point, but in the subsample with a
more pollution sensitive population, a larger proportion of cities pass this turning point.
In columns (4) and (5), we find that cities with stronger bottom-up push for
environmental protection have a much earlier turning point (RMB 37,423 vs. RMB
73,786), and also have a larger proportion of passing the turning point. These results
support the claim that cities with a higher Baidu environmental attention index have an
earlier EKC turning point.

IV. The Impact of the COVID Induced Shutdown on Pollution Dynamics


4.1 Estimating the Air Pollution Decline During the COVID Induced Shutdown in
China
      We use the variation induced by the COVID shutdown to provide new insights
about the distribution of pollution dynamics across China’s cities. Panel A in Figure A3
shows the timeline around the 2020 Chinese New Year (CNY). The traditional CNY
holiday (when almost all production activities pause) would end seven days since the
CNY’s Eve, which is Jan 31st in year 2020.                    However, due to the COVID pandemic,
29 provinces (out of 31 provinces) in China mandated businesses to not resume work
before Feb 10th at the earliest. 10 This unexpected post-CNY holiday shutdown provides
us with the opportunity to identify the determinants of air pollution in China.
      Panel B in Figure A3 presents the trends of air pollution before and after the
Chinese New Year in 2017 through 2020. Air pollution since the CNY’s Eve of 2020
was significantly lower than that of the same periods of 2017-2019. This divergence
becomes much larger after the end of traditional CNY holiday.
      To quantify the reduction in pollution associated with the shutdown, we use

10
   The left two provinces (Qinghai and Tibet) set Feb 3th as the earliest day of resuming work, and the actual first
day depended on the city-specific situation around that time.

city/year/day pollution data and present an event study in a difference-in-differences
setting (Equation (4) and (5)):



POLLUTION it = α 0 + α1 ⋅ Shutdownt + α 2 ⋅ Shutdownt × year 2020 + fixed effects + ε it

    (4)


POLLUTION it = β 0 + β1 ⋅ SF _ holidayt + β 2 ⋅ COVID _ shutdownt + β3 ⋅ year 2020
                + β 4 ⋅ SF _ holidayt × year 2020 + β5 ⋅ COVID _ shutdownt × year 2020
                + fixed effects + ε it

             (5)


     We restrict the sample to twenty days before and sixteen days after the CNY’s Eve
(until Feb. 10th, the first day of re-open). In Equation (4), Shutdown=1 indicates the
seventeen days since the CNY’s Eve. year2020=1 indicates year 2020. We choose 2018
and 2019 as the benchmark years. SF_holiday=1 indicates the eight days since the
CNY’s Eve, also the regular CNY holiday, so this period for all the three years has very
little production activity. COVID_shutdown=1 indicates the 8th to 16th days since the
CNY’s Eve, which are the unexpected shutdown days in 2020 due to COVID, but they
are regular workdays in 2018 and 2019. Therefore, the extra decline of air pollution in
the first period in 2020 was mainly due to the complete pause of holiday activities such
as driving for family reunion, net of the possible increase of home cooking (which
might add pollution); while the extra deline in the second period was attributed to the
shutdown of production activity and the associated travel demand decline, net of the
home cooking effect.
     We assume there is no difference in air pollution between the pre-CNY days in
2020 and 2018/2019 after controlling for city fixed effects, year fixed effects, month
fixed effects, day of month fixed effects, and day of week fixed effects. The regression
results are reported in Table 3. Compared to the years before 2020, air pollution
significantly decreased by 14.9%-16.6% in the        sixteen days after the CNY’s Eve
(Panel A, column (1) and (3)). After we decompose this post-CNY period into the
                                            11
regular CNY holiday (1st to 7th day after CNY eve) and the unexpected COVID
shutdown period (8th to 16th day after CNY eve), the first period a 27.5% larger decline
in pollution relative to 2018 and 2019, and this extra drop in the second period was
7.1%-9.7% (Panel A, column (2) and (4)).


                                        // Insert Table 3 about here //


      By estimating equation (5) for each city, we obtain 285 estimates of β4 and β5.
These measure the changes in air pollution during the CNY holiday and COVID
shutdown days of 2020 relative to 2018 and 2019, respectively.                             Figure A4 present the
changes in PM2.5 concentration during the CNY holiday and COVID shutdown days
across cities in 2020.           Most of Chinese cities (190 out of 285) experienced decreases
in air pollution. 11


4.2 Understanding Why Pollution Declined in Early 2020 in Many Cities


        We focus on three main determinants of air pollution – driving, industrial
activities, and cooking 12 , which were impacted by the COVID shutdown. First, the
majority of the trips were cancelled, which would reduce the emission of air pollutants
from vehicles. Second, factories were forced to close. This led to a significant reduction
in industrial pollutant emissions. 13 Third, the closure of restaurants and the ban on
gatherings greatly reduced people’s dining out activities.                            During this time people
could only cook at home, and this might lead to increased air pollution due to the
decentralized low-efficient use of solid fuels (Chafe et al., 2014).
      To decompose recent pollution dynamics into key urban fundamentals, we

11
   Air pollution in cities in northeast and northwest China increased in CNY holiday of 2020, which might due to
some meteorological factors and the weak impact of the initial COVID outbreak.
12
   We do not include coal consumption in explaining the air pollution changes for duplication problem. Coal is
the raw materials of production and living activities. The three activities – driving, industrial activities, and cooking
focused in our analysis have covered almost all the usage of coal. According to the energy balance sheet of China
in 2017, the industrial production itself consumed 94.8% coal in China. This consumption also includes the coal
used for generate power which is used by industrial sector.
13
   Necessary production activities such as power supply, water supply and heating, and production activities of
medical supplies related to epidemic control didn’t stop.
                                                          12
construct three variables to reflect the driving, industrial activities, and cooking
activities in Chinese cities. They are total number of private cars (in log, Vehicle), GDP
share from industrial sector (Industry), and the employment in the accommodation and
restaurant industry (in logs, Cooking).          We use the pre-COVID levels of the three
variables to reflect the city’s scale in these three activities. We posit that cities featuring
greater levels of transport, industry and cooking before the COVID shutdown would
feature higher levels of air pollution.
     Panel C-D in Figure A3 plots these associations. The y-axis is the estimate of city-
specific α2 by estimating equation (4) for each city. As expected, both the number of
private cars and the industrial sector GDP share is positively correlated with the PM2.5
drop from the COVID.           The number of employees in accommodation and the
restaurant industry is negatively correlated with the PM2.5 drop.
     We further quantify those associations by decomposing the pollution drop due to
COVID into these three factors. We estimate the following equation where region fixed
effects are included.   The unit of analysis is a city.



∆POLLUTION i = γ 0 + γ 1 ⋅Vehiclet + γ 2 ⋅ Industryi + γ 3 ⋅ Cookingi
                                                                            (6)
                  + region fixed effects + ε i


     The results are reported in Panel B in Table 3.         We find that among the three
activities, cooking mainly contributes to the changes in air pollution in the regular CNY
holiday. This result is plausible as most of the production activities stopped during every
year’s CNY holiday. Therefore, the PM2.5 change in this year relative to the previous
years in this regular holiday window was not correlated with the production scale.
However, in the post-CNY COVID shutdown days which only existed in year 2020,
cities with more private cars, larger share of the industrial production in the urban
economy, and less restaurant employment, experienced a larger decrease in air pollution.


V.   Blue Skies as an Experience Good


                                                 13
     In this section, we compare a subset of Chinese cities to the rest of the cities. We
focus our attention on the subset of cities that meet two criteria.          The first criteria is
that the city experienced a 2020 air pollution decline in the COVID pandemic (based
on the city-specific estimate of α2 in equation (4)). The second criteria is that the city’s
anti-pollution sentiment is greater than the median                (based on the estimates from
Zheng et. al (2019)).
      We divide the 144 Chinese cities into four quadrants based on their sentiment-
pollution elasticity and the PM2.5 change during the COVID shutdown.                  As shown
in Panel A in Figure 2,        the 49 cities in quadrant I are those where air pollution
significantly declined and the population is more sensitive to air pollution. These cities
are defined to be the “treated cities”. We examine whether their population exhibits a
high demand for clean air.      We study this using the Baidu data.


                                // Insert Figure 2 about here //


     Here we construct a daily Baidu environmental attention index, and estimate the
following DID model for city/year/day data.



baidu _ indexit = λ0 +λ1 ⋅ Treati ⋅ Postt + fixed effects + ε it       (7)



     In equation (7), the dependent variable is the daily count of the keyword
“environment protection” in the Baidu search engine by                   city i at   date t. The
baidu_index in equation (7) is standardized by dividing it over its mean value. This
makes the number comparable across different keywords. Treat equals 1 for the cities
in quadrant I in Figure 2 Panel A and equals zero for the cities in the other quadrants.
City fixed effects and date fixed effects are included in the regression.
    The trends in Panel B in Figure 2 show that the quantity of Internet discussion
activity mentioning “environmental protection” in Chinese cities in Quadrant I
increased by more than in other cities during the same time period. The regression

                                                14
results confirm that this Baidu index in those cities increased 1.3 times of its mean
higher than the other cities (see Table A2). The local population in the Quadrant I cities
is increasingly interested in environmental protection and they seek more information
about what the local officials are doing to further improve the local environment.


5.2 Local Government Post-COVID Stimulus
        Whether the short-run improvement in air quality persists over time as the local
economy recovers hinges on how such a bottom-up push pressure from the local pople
nudges the local government to enact credible anti-pollution policies.                    In this section
we investigate whether local governments in 2020 are rethinking their environmental
strategies and whether this “green push” is stronger for cities in Quadrant I.
       Since February 2020, both the central and local governments have issued many
different        “stimulus” polices aiming to re-boost the economy and make up the
economic loss due to the COVID shutdown. In China, local governments have a strong
“visible hand” in setting the priorities in local economic growth and allocating
resources to implement their growth strategies.                 They are very good at implementing
those industrial policies in a timely fashion (Zheng et al. 2017).                 Therefore, it is highly
likely that those stimulus policies will be implemented as stated.
         Some of the stimulus policies highlight the “greenness” and “sustainability”,
while others do not.          For instance, on March 4, 2020, the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued a guideline on speeding up the
construction of “new infrastructure” 14, e.g., 5G, IoT, big data center, etc., which are
much greener than the old infrastructure such as highways and power plants. On
February 27, 2020, Guangzhou city government issued the stimulus policy of providing
financial subsidy measures for the promotion and application of new energy buses 15.
While in Yinchuan city, on March 2, 2020, the city government issued a stimulus policy
to boost and stabilize the industrial growth after the COVID pandemic aiming to fulfill

      We collected the policy documents issued by local governments from February
2020 to May 2020 from Bailu ThinkTank (http://www.bailuzhiku.com/policy/adlist),
and extracted the stimulus policies related to industrial development.                        Here we focus
on three types of “green industrial policies” – new energy vehicles, industrial upgrading
(toward low energy intensity) and new IT infrastructure. 17                    Panel C in Figure 2 shows
the statistical results for the four groups of cities presented in Panel A of this figure.
We find that those cities in quadrant I have a larger share of their documents mentioning
the “green industrial policies”.            While those cities in quadrant IV have the very low
share of pro-environment documents.                    This is suggestive evidence that the local
governments for the quadrant I cities are responding to their citizens’ demand for blue
sky and are taking actions to strike a balance between stimulating the economy and
protecting the environment.




VI. Conclusion


      In early 2020, cities all over the world have experienced an economic shutdown
in order to reduce the contagion risk.                   A silver lining of this shutdown is that
previously very dirty cities experienced blue skies.                      We posit that clean air is an
experience good.
      The private sector often produces new goods such as electric vehicles or science
fiction movies.        Before a person experiences such a good, they may under-value it.
Anticipating this issue, sellers of such new products will engage in advertising and offer
initially low prices to attract consumers.                In contrast to a private good, a city’s air
quality is a local public good.              It is produced as a byproduct of the activities of
emissions within the airshed and that blow into the airshed.                      A byproduct of China’s

   The policies we consider are all officially published with clearly Issued Numbers. All subordinate offices will
receive this document and have to carry out the work following the guidance of the policy document.

development fueled by coal and heavy industry production is that there are many cities
where ordinary people have not experienced clean air for decades.               The 2020
shutdown offered a dramatic regime change.
     If the Environmental Kuznets Curve is stable over time, then a “V” shaped
recovery for the macro economy would predict that air pollution will return to its
previous high levels in cities in polluted developing nations such as China.     We have
argued that because clean air is an experience good that a silver lining of the recent blue
sky episode is to stimulate increased demand for this good.     While co-ordination costs
often inhibit collective action, in this case the large pollution reduction helps to co-
ordinate urban pressure as each person in a previously dirty city experiences clean air
and knows that every other local urbanite is also experiencing cleaner air.           Past
research on the “silver lining” of environmental disasters in the United States
demonstrates that more aggressive pro-environment regulation is proposed in the
aftermath of such shocks as Three Mile Island and the Exxon Valdez oil spill (Kahn
2007).
     The most novel part of our empirical work uses recent Internet search data and
policy document text analysis to test the “clean air as an experience good” hypothesis.
We document that Internet discussion intensity related to environmental protection has
increased and this increase has been most pronounced in cities which had both been
polluted and where there is a latent demand for pollution progress (the subset of cities
with the large anti-pollution sentiment elasticity).

Appendix 1: Data Appendix
PM2.5 data.         We collect the data of PM2.5 concentration from the real time release
platform of national urban air quality of China Environmental Monitoring Station.
The data is daily released since May 13th 2014.
      The air pollution data of China in early time was found to be manipulated by local
government and inaccurate (Ghanem and Zhang 2014).                                However, since 2013, the
central government of China has issued a series of policies to ensure the quality of air
monitoring and avoid data manipulation 18.                   More recent studies have documented the
improvement of air pollution data quality of Chinese cities.                        For example, Liang et al.
(2016) found that the US PM2.5 monitors show measured values highly consistent with

18
   On September 10, 2013, the State Council issued the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan”
(APPCAP), emphasizing the government’s objective of establishing a centrally-managed national air quality
monitoring network, which includes the construction of urban stations, background stations, and regional stations.
The Plan aims to enhance the management of the quality of monitoring data, objectively reflect the air quality status,
strengthen the construction of the online monitoring system for primary pollution sources and promote the
application of environmental satellites. By 2015, all cities, at the prefecture-level and above, were equipped with
monitoring stations for fine particulate matter and stations under government supervision. Remote quality control
systems had been set up in 1,436 national control monitoring stations, with the function of data recording and alarm
systems under abnormal circumstances. Fu Deqian, Deputy Head of China National Environmental Monitoring
Center, noted that “there are several monitoring stations in one city and the data from all stations should be similar.
If the data reported in one station is inconsistent with the others’, the alarm will be triggered.” (see
http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2016/12-10/8089501.shtml)
According to the statistics of the Environmental Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment,
in 2015, there were no cases of data falsification. The “Measures for Environmental Monitoring Data Falsification”
issued by the Ministry in December 2015 required local environmental departments to carry out inspection of
environmental data quality and punish data falsifications.
In July 2016, the Chinese Academy of Engineering organized a mid-term assessment of the implementation of
APPCAP and carried out quality control on the monitoring data, especially the PM2.5 data. By integrating the data
from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Meteorological
Administration, and relevant scientific research institutes on long-term ground-based positioning observations,
comprehensive observations of typical processes, and satellite remote sensing inversion, a variety of technical
methods had been used to assess air quality conditions, pollution trends across the country. By comparing the
synchronous data of 28 monitoring stations of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Meteorological
Administration, and other institutions, it is found that the multi-party monitoring data of similar stations indicate
good consistency, reveal that the monitoring data is systematic and comparable, and is suitable for evaluation. (see
http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2016-07/06/content_5088795.htm)
In November 2016, the Ministry issued the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan - Environmental Monitoring Quality
Management Work Plan” and “Work Plan About Strengthening the Quality Management of Ambient Air Automatic
Monitoring”, required 1,436 state-controlled monitoring stations in 338 prefecture-level cities nationwide to transfer
their monitoring rights. Through public bidding, the third party firm which wins the bid, will be responsible for the
project's operation and maintenance. Meanwhile, all stations are required to install video surveillance systems to
plug the loopholes of manipulated data falsification.

those measured at China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection PM2.5 monitors
located nearby.   Stoerk (2016) compared the air quality data via Benford’s Law which
suggests that misreporting of air quality data for Beijing has likely ended in 2012.
COVID information.        The number of death from COVID comes from the Big Data
Analysis Platform of Global COVID Epidemic Situation (https://www.zq-
ai.com/#/fe/xgfybigdata).
Economic and social data.      The data of city-year GDP, population, % of GDP from
industrial sector, number of employment in accommodation and restaurant industry
come from China City Statistical Yearbook.       The data city-year number of private cars
comes from the statistical yearbooks of each province.     The data of city-year mortality
comes from the statistical yearbooks of each city.
Temperature and rainfall.      The city-year average temperature and total rainfall is
calculated based on the hourly monitoring data of automatic ground stations uploaded
by National Meteorological Information Center.
Baidu index.      The Baidu keyword search index is created from the Web tools
(http://index.baidu.com/v2/index.html#/).    It provides the city-day entries of each key
word in https://www.baidu.com/.     The index reflects the public attention on the event
corresponding to the key word.
Industrial policy information.     The policy documents issued by local governments
from February 2020 to May 2020 from are download from Bailu ThinkTank
(http://www.bailuzhiku.com/policy/adlist).       We employ the text analysis tool to
extract the stimulus policies related to industrial development and identify if they are
environmental friendly.

       We present one placebo test to address concerns about omitted variables that
simultaneously affected air pollution and people’s environmental attention might bias
our DID estimations.             To address this endogeneity concern, we further create another
five Baidu search index using keywords that are not related with air pollution: COVID-
19, pneumonia, education, medical treatment, health.                          Column (2) of Table A3 shows
the results of this placebo test.               We find a small and insignificant effect on Baidu
searches for non-environmental words.
