       This paper reviews and interprets the literature on the effect of school resources on students’

eventual earnings and educational attainment. In addition, new evidence is presented on the impact

of the great disparity in school resources between black and white students in North and South

Carolina that existed in the first half of the 20th century, and the subsequent narrowing of these

resource disparities. Following birth cohorts over time, gaps in earnings and educational attainment

for blacks and whites in the Carolinas tend to mirror the gaps in school resources.

       Thirty years after the publication of the Coleman report (1966) marks a

fitting tim    to reassess the connection btween     schml resources and student

achievemt.      Cole~’s     original study and much of the stisequent literature

it spawned me     widely interpreted as showing that higher levels of schml

resources, such as lower class sizes, have no effect on student test scores.

For _le,       Hanushek’s (1986) influential survey of the literature concluded,

“There appars to &       no strong or systemtic relationship htween      schcol

expenditures and student ~rfo~ce.          ”

      The conclusion that schmling inputs like class size and teacher pay

have no ipct      on student achievement has come under rmewed    scrutiny for two

min   reasons. First, several recent meta-analyses -- quantitative s~ies

of the estimtes in the literature -- suggest that greater resources @           in

fact lead to higher test scores. me        authors of these studies argue that the

literature contains tm     my     positive estirratesof the effect of resources on

test scores to have oc~ed         by chance, if resomces truly do not mtter.l

Observe, for _le,         that Hanushek (1996) counts mre   than twice as my

~sitive    than negative estimates of the effect of _ditures        ~r   pupil on

student achievemt,       mng     the 141 “studies” that report their signs.    If each

estimte had a 50-50 chance of king psitive or negative, the odds of

observing so my       psitive estimates by chance is less than one in a
        * ~w    per     of ‘ie
million.                         individual estimtes my   explain why the

preponderance of studies find statistically insignificant effects, while the

c~ined     literatwe pints       in the oqsite   direction. Mets-analysis also

provides rriethb for accounting for the mgnitude of estimted effects in the

literature, as well as their signs. Hedges, et al. (1994) conduct a mta-

analysis of the studies surveyed by Hanushek (1986) and conclude that, “the

data are mre    consistent with a pattern that includes at least s-         psitive
relation htmen       dollars -t    on education and output, than with a pattern of

no effects or negative effects.”

        Second, and more ge~e      to this paper, is a ~          of literature that

shifts attention away fm       test scores and focuses instead on how schml

resources affect students’ educational attainment and e-ings.             Studying the

ipct     of school resowces on long-term outcms          like educational attai~t

ad    e=ings     is critical bcause   test scores are an i~rfect       measure of the

value of schml outputs. For _le,             Murnane, kvy    and Willet (1995) find

that adding a standardized mathematics test score to a wage e~tion              for mle

workers increases the explanatoq power of the tiel          by only &ut     2

prcentage points. Heckman (1995) concludes, “neither g [a measure of

generalized intelligence] nor-          [the Armed Forces ~lifytig       Test] explains

all   that   much of the variance in lcy wages.”      In sharp contrast to the

literature on test scores, a ntir       of studies have found a psitive         and

statistically significant association ~tween education resources and

students’ educatioml atta-         t and earnings.

        Researchers face a number of obstacles in studying the connection

&tween       school resources and econtic outcms.       One difficulty is the need to

wait until students finish schml and join the ltir ~ket.               Consequently,

researchers must have access to data sets that report hth           the current

earnings or cqleted       education of adults @       infomtion    on the resources

available in the schmls they attended. Furthemre,            since differences in the

structure of the ltir market my       affect the reward to skills, and thus the

measured impact of school resources, evaluations of the econtic returns to

schcol resources my      rewire non-trivial identification ass~tions,           or

c~lex        econometric tielling, or hth.       Another problem is that cqared       to


                                             2
test score outcomes, the variance in earnings is lqe,            Wing       it mre

difficult to detect mcdest effects of schcol quality.

        Mtted   miables,    such as parental background or state-level plitical

variables, IMy bias the measured effect of school resources. (Of course, a

parallel problem mises     in non-~rimental       studies of the effect of schcol

resources on test scores.) Stice the children of wealthier parents often

attend SCWIS     with srrallerclass sizes and better-paid teachers, and since

family background is thought to exert an independent effect on children’s

econtic outcms,       there my    be a spurious psitive association &tween           school

resources and measured outcms,       even if schcol resowces have no effect per

se.   On the other hand, students with weaker backgrounds my            &   assigned to

remedial classes with higher resources ~r      student, inducing a spurious

negative comelation &tween        schml resources and student out~s.

        A study of econtic outcms      requires a theoretical framework that

incoqrates      the diverse interactions &tween    family background, schml

inputs, educational attai~t,        and e~tigs.     We therefore @in          this paper

by outlining the key i~lications of such a tiel.            ~s    framework is then

used to interpret estimtes of the effect of school resources on educational

attainment and ea.mings. Our reading of the e~irical literature is that

schml    resources tend to b     psitively associated with e-ings           and

educational attai~t,       but that the relationship is not always robust to

specific features of the data set or errtpirical
                                               ~cification.

        A difficult problem for mst    studies in the literature, including our

own, is the presence of omitted variables that my       k    correlated with schcol

quality. Aptentially       confounding problem is that my        studies rely on

aggregated (i.e. school district or state-level) schml quality data rather


                                           3
than   schml- or classrccm-level data. One way to overcm           these problems is

to follow students who were qsed         to drmtically      different educational

resources for reasons having little to do with their own ability or their

parents’ wealth.       The vastly differat treatment of black and white students

during the segrqation era provides such a setting. Gne of the mst              drmtic
i,mt~al ~ri~ts”            involving schml resources is furnished by North

Carolina and South Carolina. =ly           in the 20th century, the level of

resources devoted to black studats was much lower in %uth           &olina     than in

North ~lina.          Because resources were diverted fm      black schmls to white

schools, the reverse was true for whites: schml resources were greater for

white students in South Carolina than in North Carolina. By mid-century,

scbl     resources had converged to roughly similar levels for blacks and whites

in the Carolinas. The wide disparities in schcol quality for black and white

students in North and %uth       Carolina in the emly part of the century were

caused by different, md      _ly      a~~OUS,        factors than those that generate

vari~ility      in school resources in mst       data sets t-y.   Did these

differences in scbl        resources lead to com~nding        differences in

educational atta=t         and earnings?    Did the econcmic outcms    for succeeding

cohorts converge as schml resources converged? Based on our analysis of

1960, 1970, and 1980 Census micrcdata, the answers to these two questions seem

tobe~and~.



Theoretical     ~rk



       A useful framewrk for interpreting much of the literature on schmling,

emings,       and school quality can ~   ~ized         by four theoretical


                                             4
propositions.3

       Proposition 1: ~qs           rise with educational attainment. If two

individuals are otherwise identical, the one with mre            education tends to e=

mre.     ~s    proposition is based on one of the mst         firmly-established

e~irical regularities in econtics.            Apsitive     association between earnings

and education holds across indivitils even if one controls for other factors,

such as IQ, family background, and work experience (Griliches,1977).               It also

holds across identical twins with different levels of education, and htween

groups who obtained different levels of schcoling bcause of cqulsory

schmling laws or &cause         they grew up near a college (Ashenfelterand

~eger,     1995; Angrist =d     ~eger,       1991; ~n      and Walker, 1996; Kane and

Rouse, 1995; Card, 1995). Although sm              of the observed correlation &twea

earnings and education my       &   due to titted -iAles         -- for _le,       those

with mre      education my   end up with higher earnings kcause of unobserved

Aility or family background factors -- our reading of the literature is that

this cvnent        is relatively -11,    on the order of 10-15 ~rcent      of the total

effect. Further, randm masure~t              errors in self-reprted schmling my

bias down=        the observed slope ktween earnings and education by a similar

mgnitude.

       ~o~sition     2: The -       til mm    ff to additional schmlinq is hiqher for

those who attend hiqher qualitv schcols. ~s              proposition is almst

tautolqical: one wuld        expect students who have access to tigher quality

schmls to Mefit       mre    per year of schcoling than students who have access to

lower ~lity      schmls. 4 Figure 1, which shows the earnings-education profile

rotating counterclockwise from the Y-intercept for those who attend higher

quality schools, illustrates the notion that higher ~ality schmling

Earnings                        Low Quality
increases the slope of the e-            gs-schcoling relationship. Note, however,

that it is an open question whether measured schml remurces                  (such as the

pupil-teacher ratio) are related to the mere abstract concept of “schml

quality.”

         Prm   sition 3: If the mnet~        pavoff to an additional vear of schmlinq

rises, some students will attend schml lonqer. The observed relationship

between schocl ~lity          and e_gs      that emerges fra      a c~lete     tiel   of

schmling and etings           is mre   c~licated     than that depicted in Figure I for

several reasons.      Iprtantly,       as school quality increases, S-         students will

attend schcol longer. ~s          re~nse     my    arise bcause   students react to the

econtic    incentives created by a higher payoff to schcoling, or &cause               school

is mre    pleasant if quality is higher. In either event, a wide class of

econcmic tiels predicts that improved school quality Mefits                  scme students

by inducing them to stay in schcol longer, and this increase in educational

attai~t        leads to higher pay.

         Romsition    4: Am    rtion of the observed association &tween          e~inqs

and education is due to unobsened factors that are iointlv comelated with

hth   variables.     In other words, those who select higher education tend to

have greater earnings ability, imespective of their education. ~reover,

students who attend schml        longer in re~nse      to i~roved schcol plity             (the

i~lication frm       Proposition 3) will tend to k       drawn disproportionately fm

the -l     of mre    able students at lower grade levels. An interesting

i~lication of this pvsition              is that the observed earnings-education

profile will not rotate around the Y-intercept at a zero level of education as

in Figure 1, but at a higher level of education, as illustrated in Figure 2.

To understand why, consider what hap               to the group of workers with the

                                               6
lowest level of education. If school quality i~roves, the mre       able workers

of this group will attend schml    longer, lowering the average e=ings    ability

of those who remin    at a low level of education, and thus lowering the Y-

intercept in Figure 2. AS school ~lity        i~roves, the shrinking group of

students with a low level of education will increasingly consist of less able

individuals, who will ap~ar to eam     less, on average.

      titted   factors such as family kckground or student ability c~licate

the observed relationship ktween eamin gs and masured      schcol quality in

other ways as well.    Suppse, for _le,       that students frm wealthier

families tend to stay in scbl     longer, and that these students would tend to

earn mre   later on &cause   of their family connections, regardless of their

higher education. In addition, suppse that wealthier ftilies demd         -her

class sizes, even though class size has no effect on actual schml     “quality”

(that is, suppse there is no causal effect of scbl       -ding    on education or

earnings). In this case, the data will show a psitive association ktween

school spending and hth   educational attai~t      and earnings, although hth

comelations are spurious, and merely reflect the failure to account for the

independent effect of ftily wealth.

      Nevertheless, the presence of titted ftily background effects will not

necessmily bias the correlation htween rrieasured
                                                school quality and the S1OE

of the eamings-schcoling relationship. To understand why, continue to

suppose that children from wealthier family backgrounds in a given schml or

school district tend to have higher education and higher e-ings,      so that

part of the measured payoff to each additional ye=     of schmling reflects

titted-variables bias. ~der     reaso~le      conditions the mgnitude of this

bias will be similar for students fm      high-quality and low-~ality schcol

system.     Thus, cqing      across schcol systems, the measured retm         to each

additional year of schmling muld      k   biased upward by a simil= munt.          In

this case, differences in the slopes of the earnings-schooling relationship

across higher and lower quality schcol system will reflect true differences

in the ~lity       of schocling.



~irical     Findings



        For a detailed ~ey     of the e~irical literature on the link between

schcol ~ality      and economic outcms,   the interested reader might -in       with

&d     and ~eger     (1996) and Betts (1996). Here, we concentrate on ~izing

the effect of two particular educational inputs -- _ditmes             ~r     pupil and

the pupil-teacher ratio -- on educational atta-         t and earnings. We

e~hasize the pupil-teacher ratio because differaces in class size account

for close to one-half of the variation in _diture          per pupil across schml

districts, and because changes in class size are the object of my

educational reform proposals.

       me   theoretical framework outlined ~ve       suggests tw   e~irical

strategies. In one approach, the structural earnings-schmling relationship

illustrated in Figure 2 can be estimted, along with the effect of schcol

quality, as n-ieasured
                     by _ditures          ~r   pupil or the pupil-teacher ratio, on

educational attainment. Alternatively, one can estimte the reduced form

relationship between earnings and schml resources; that is, a regression of

eegs        on measures of schml quality like expenditmes ~r       pupil or the

pupil-teacher ratio, without holding educational attakt            constant.

        The earliest wave of studies on school resources and economic outcomes,


                                           8
conducted in the late 1960s and 1970s, followed a third approach: rese~chers

si~ly    added measures of schml quality to a standard h~       capital wage

equation. Such tiels   typically used educational attai~t,        mrk   ~rience,

parental education, urban residence, and in s-      cases, IQ as +lanatoq

variables. Earnings were based on individual observations. When a miable

representing schml quality was added, it was usually masured by average

~ditures      per pupil at the state or district level. Ml      of these studies

found that -ding     pr   student was psitively assmiated with students’

subsequent earnings, andmst     of the estimtes were statistically significant

at conventional levels.5 The estimted elasticities fm         this literature

fall in a fairly tight range: a 10 ~rcent     increase in schml     -ding    leads

to but     a 1 to 2 ~rcent   increase in subsequent edngs.

        These specifications i~ly that the earnings-educationprofile has a

fixed slope, and that differences in schml ~ality tie        this relationship

shift up and down in a parallel fashion, as o~sed        to a tilting of the

profile shown in Figure 1. Aptentially       undesi~le     feature of this

~cification     is that it i~lies that mre    school resouces raise (or lower)

earnings by the s-     -Unt,    regardless of the lmgth of time that students

are ~sed      to the greater resources in schml.    Mditionally, &cause      the

studies hold educational attainrrient
                                    constmt, the possibility that i~roved

schml quality tight lead to higher wages by encouraging students to attend

schml    longer is missed.

        A second wave of studies allowed for schml resources to have a

differential effect on the S1OP ~      intercept of the earnings-education

relationship. For _le,         Akin and &finkle    (1980) estimte    several wage

rqessions     using micro data from the Panel Study on Incm     Dynamics (PSID).

attended schml) , expenditures per student times ye=s             of education, and y-s

of education. Their results indicate that greater spending per student is

associated with higher e-gs,           but contrary to the prediction in Five           2,

the effect C-S       but     frm   an u-      shift in the Y-intercept rather than a

stee~ng      of the education gradient. Link, Ratledge and kwis             (1980)

replicate Akin and Garfinkle tiel with the PSID as well as with the National

~ngitudinal Survey (~)         of Young K,        and generally find similar results.b

Interestingly, hth      studies also find that if school resources are constrained

to only affect the earnings-education slope, the e=ings              profile rotates as

in Figure 1.      In a recent pa~r, Altonji and Dunn (1996) use within-family

differences in schml resources to estimte this type of tiel               with data from

the NLS.    By linking within families, they adjust for differaces in omitted

family background factors. Their findings i~ly that a 10 ~rcent               increase in

sPendin9 P=r student is ass~iated with a 1.3 Frcent               increase in e-in9s-

Interestinglyr they find the estimted effect of schcol resources is greater,

not ~ller,       when family kckground characteristics are held constant.

        A ptential problem with these second-wave studies is that the reward to

skills my    v      systematically across ge~aphic        areas   with varying levels of

schml    resources, and mrkers       tend to stay in the =ea where they ~ew          up.

For _le,         in the southern ~ited      States the return to education

historically has ken        relatively high, while wages and schcol spendi-ngper

student were relatively low. ~s            pattern could make it appear that higher

schml    ~ding     depresses the return to education, when the truth is that the


                                             10
south has invested less in education, keeping its return relatively high, and

north-south migration has h=         insufficient to reduce the differential. Thus,

the second-rove estimtes my         confound l~r    ~ket    effects and scdl

resource effects.

        A third wave of estimtes atte~ts to Overcm           problem     caused by

differential lbr    mket      structmes across regions.7 me         conceptual

~ri~t       underlying these estimtes is straightforward. Consider the

workers observed in a particular ltir ~ket,             say Chicago. *      mrkers    in

Chicago were educated in states with higher quality schcol systems and others

were educated in states with lower ~ality schmls.            ~ng     those working in

Chicago, we would ~ct        the earnings-education gradient to be steeper for

workers who were educated in states with higher quality schmls.             A weakness

of this strategy is that there rMy ~         smthing     “unusual” *ut    those who

roved frm   one area to another that confomds the effect of schml resources.

        In &d   and Krueger (1992a)we find that, in a given set of ltir

~kets,     the e-ings-education      slope d=s     tend to increase for students who

were educated in states with fewer pupils ~r           teacher, higher average teacher

pay, or a longer schml year.         In other words, the payoff to each additional

ye=   of education is greater for workers who come fm          areas with mre

resource-intensive schmls, lcoking within a fixed ltir ~ket.                This finding

is strongest when cohorts from given states are c-cd               over tire, which

remves    any effect of pe~ent        state effects (such as unchanging state-level

plitical variables). Identification of schcol-remmce               effects in these

ftied-effects tiels    cms     fm    cqing        successive cohorts of individuals

from states like M*,         which raised their schml spending relative to other

states like New York.   -her        analysis indicates that the e=ings-intercept


                                             11
tends    to decline as resomces ticrease. In short, the earnings relationship

appears to pivot around a mid-level of education, as illustrated in Figure 2.

We found that the cross-over point in Figure 2 occurs around the high schml

graduate level. Our analysis ties        use of the large s~les      afforded by the

1980 Census.

         Heck,    Layne-Fmar   and Tcdd (1996) tiend     this analysis using the

1970, 1980 and 1990 Censuses. when they estimte virtually the S=            n-cdelsas

ours, they find similar effects of schcol resomces in 1980, and scmewhat

larger effects in 1970 and 1990. me        finding of larger effects of schml

resources in 1970 and 1990 is perhaps not surprising, stice the payoff to

education ti general was at a relatively low level in 1980. Heck,            Layne-

F-ar      and Todd also find that the intercept of the earnings-education

relationship declines as school resources increase.

         Hech,    Layne-Farrar and Tdd    (1996) -d      our basic econometric

specification in several iqrtant      directions. When they include regional

aggr~ate supply and de~d       variables, the general pattern of results holds

up.     But when they allow for differential schcol resource effects by level of

education, they find that schml resources have little effect on emings            for

workers who have not attended schcol byond high schml.          me   only education

group for which resources are significantly related to e=ings          =e   those with

a college education or higher. AS schml resources are masured           at the

secon@       or elementary schml   level, this result my    seem perplexing. One

interpretation, however, is that higher school quality induces the mst

ptising      students to go further in school at each grade level, so the s~le

at each level of education beccmes mre         select as school resources changes

Nonetheless, the effects of selective educational attainment are just


                                          12
conjecture at this stage, and the titerpretation of the etings-quality

relationship conditioml on education is still an open question. The reduced

form tiels,     which do not condition on education, provide one way of

sidestepping this issue.

         Another assumption that Hecti,      Layne-Farrar and Tdd   (1996) rel=    is

the restriction that schml quality has the s-         effect on the earnings-

education slope in all regions. Regional differences in supply and demand

conditions my       alter the payoff to skills, and hence schml quality, across

regions. A related issue that they address is non-ranh         migration. Workers

IMy selectively sort across reyions hsed       on their cqative      e=ings

advantage.      (As noted earlier, the identification of schml resource effects

in Card and Kruqer       (1992a) relies on the fact that migrants from states with

different levels of schml quality end up working in a c~n           l~r   ~ket.)

As a ~ial        control for selective migration, Heckrr!an,
                                                           Layne-Farrm and Tdd

control for the distance &tween      the workers’ region of origin and

destination. These =ensions        weaken the effect of schml resources, and

suggest that the return to higher schml quality, as masured by the pupil-

teacher ratio, mies       across regions.9

         The finding that schml quality raises wages is not found in eve~         data

set.     For _le,      using data from the National ~ngitudinal ~ey       of Youth

 (NLSY), Betts (1995) finds a statistically insignificant effect of sctil

resources (measuredby the high schcol’s teacher-pupil ratio, teacher salary,

ti      so on) on the eamin gs of young mrkers    -- on either the slope or the

intercept in Figure 2.      These data have i~rtant     limitations for this

Pqse,       however    The standard errors of the estimates fm      the NLSY are

large, Wing       it difficult to rule out -11    psitive effects with a


                                          13
reasonable degree of confidence.10 In addition, the s~le         has an average

age of just 23, which wans       that my   of the individuals have not yet finished

schml or settled into their careers, so wage effects for those with higher

levels of schmling mybe         difficult to find. Nonetheless, Betts and others

have interpreted his findings as evidence that schml resources do not rotter

when the resources ae       measured at the schcol level, as oppsed   to the state

or district level. We return to this pint        &low.

        Recall that schml resources rr!ay
                                        also influence educational attainment.

Amjority       of the studies of which we =e    a-e   have found psitive   and

statistically significant effects of roller class size on educational

atta-t.            *   of these studies use micro data on individual’s educational

outcomes and schml resources, while others use state- or district-level data.

For ~le,           Sander (1993) relates high schml graduation rates to the pupil-

teacher ratio across 154 Illinois schcol districts, and for a stisqle            of 86

schml       districts in which there is only one high schml   in the district. In

hth   cases he finds that a 10 ~rcent decrease in the pupil-teacher ratio is

associated with but        a 1.5 percentage point increase in the graduation rate.

Hech,        Layne-F=ar    and Tcdd (1996) likewise find that a reduction in a

state’s pupil-teacher ntio       tends to reduce the fraction of high schml

droputs       fm    that state, and to raise fraction of individuals who graduate

frahigh        schcol and (especially)college.

        h    advantage of the reduced form estimtion a~roach     -- which involves a

regression of e-gs          on scbl   quality masures without controlling for

educational attainrrient
                       -- is that it incorporates all the pssible          effects of

school resources: on educational attainment, on the eamin gs-education

profile, and on the intercept of the e=ings-schcoling         relationship. In Card


                                           14
and Krueger (1992a), we estimte a reduced fon-nregression of (leg) weekly

wages on the state’s pupil-teacher ratio, the worker’s age and ~ital             status,

and d-      -iables    for residence in a metropolitan area, the state where the

worker lives, and (in s-       rriodels)
                                       the state where the worker was hm.          These

tiels    are relatively parsimonious, and so are particularly susceptible to

confounding effects fm        titted vari~les.        Nevertheless, the reduced fm

tiels    have the advantage of making less restrictive identifying asmtions,

and =e    pro~ly    the mst    cq~le          ~cifications    estimted across pa~rs     in

the recent literature. Our 1992a reduced form estimtes based on the 1980

C-us     i~ly   that a 10 ~rcent       reduction in the average pupil-teacher ratio is

associated with a 1.1 percent increase in weekly earnings. Betts’s (1995)

estimtes, which are ksed        on W      e-gs       data and high schml-level

schmling data, i~ly that a 10 percmt             reduction in the average teacher-pupil

ratio leads to a 0.4 percmt       increase in etings.ll         Using the High Schml

and Beyond Survey, Grqer’s         (1996) reduced form estimtes i~ly that a 10

~rcent    increase in mean ~di.ng        ~r   student leads to a 0.7 prcent     increase

in wages.

        To ~ize,      mch     of the literature finds evidence of a psitive       and

statistically significant relationship ktween             school resources and earnings.

~   our count, S-     tin-thirds of the tw         doza   studies on the i~ct   of schml

-ding     or class size on e-gs           have found a statically significant,

psitive    effect of schml resources (Card and Krueger, 1996). Positive

effects of class size on educational attainment are also typically found in

the literature.

        But we do not wish to paint an overly optimistic picture. Several

iprtant     studies find statistically insignificant effects of changing schml


                                              15
resources. Hech,        Layne-F-Z      and Tcdd (1996) have shown that the effect

of schml    resources masured   in Card and ~eger       (1992a)break down when scme

of the identifying assumptions (e.g., line= education) are relaxed.

Mreover,    there =e   always questions in observatioml studies as to whether

relemt     mi~les      have been left out. Because wealthier families tend to

invest mre    in their children at hm,      and to live in c~      ities with &tter

endowed schools, titted     ftily background I-My&      a Pa.rtimla problem.

        Betts (1996) and Hanushek (1996) note that biases created by titted

vari~les    are pssibly   larger in studies that mea-e       school resources at a

mre   aggregative level, like the state or schml district level. Hanushek,

Rivkin and Taylor (1996) -e         that state political vari~les are a particular

problem for aggregate studies. Although this is pssible, the fact that the

tiels    reported in &d    and ~eger     (1992a) and Hech,      Iayne-Farrar and Tdd

(1996) that include state-ftied effects tend to show l~er,          rather than

smaller, effects of schcol ~ality suggests to us that titted            state-level

variables IMy lead to the -site        bias.     In any event, the ~t        that

titted vari~les are a bigger problem for studies that use aggregate schml

quality data would be stronger if such fitted variables could k           identified,

and if their inclusion in the regression tiels was shown to attenuate the

effect of aggregate school resource mea-es.

        A related problem concerns the endqeneity of scbl         resources within

schmls     (or within schcol districts). children who perform prly         may k

assigned to -her       classes, for -le.         With individual-level resource

data, this may lead to downward-biased estiwtes of the effects of schml

resources. on the other hand, highly mtivated children rMy &            attracted to

mgnet    schools with higher resources ~r       pupil, leading to upward-biased


                                           16
estimtes.     In either case, the use of aggregated schml ~ality masmes        will

tend to lessen the biases of endcgenous schml resources within schocls or

districts. Finally, ~ame~t         emr      in schml resources should be a cause

for concern. men     the hst   micro data sets tend to have schml resource data

for one year, providing only a snapshot of the student’s educational czeer,

while district- or state-level resource data are mre       likely to “average out”

year-to-year fluctuations in resources. Aggregated data reduce or eliminate

randm measure~t      errors that tie     it difficult to detect school resource

effects using ticro-level schml ~lity          data.

        Ideally, these sources of bias could b     eliminated by a randtized

experirrtent,
            in which students are assigned to classes with differmt pupil-

teacher ratios (or differences in other resources) and then followed over

tim.    We are aware of only one lqe-scale       randtized experi~t    involving

class sizes, which ~rtained to elerrient~ students in Tennessee (~steller,

1995). ~s     experimt    showed a psitive effect of lower class size on test

scores at the lowest grades. We know of no randtized experi~t         that has

ken    used to evaluate econtic outcomes of schmling.       In the *sence of a

true random ~rimt,        it IMy be useful to consider the evidence generated by

“natural ~riments”       -- situations in which large differences in schml

resources were provided to seetigly similar individuals for arbitrq

reasons. Gne interesting _le           of such a situation is the experience of

black and white studats in North and South Carolina, to which we now turn.



A -ison       of North and South -lk



       Racially segregated schooling led to profound differences in the level


                                          17
of school resources available to black and white children in different areas

of the tited    States in the first half of this cent~.       A striking cmison

is provided by two neighring       states: North Carolina and %uth   Carolina.

Five      3 displays the pupil-teacher ratio in black and white schmls      in the

two states over the past century.12 Although the Carolinas =e        sitilar in

S-     respects, they differed drmtically       in terms of the schml resources

they provided for black and white children. Whereas North Carolina was among

the mst    progressive of the non-hrder %uthem       states vis-a-vis black

schooling, South Carolina was -ng      the least prcyressive (Harlan, 1958). For

white students, the pattern was reversed: schcols were ktter       funded in South

Carolina than in North Carolina throughout the first half of the century.          In

1916, for _le,         black schmls had 72 students per teacher in South Carolina

and 47 in North -lina,       while white schmls had 41 students per teacher in

Mrth   Carolina and 37 in South Carolim.        The schml term was also much

shorter for blacks in South Molina      than in North Carolina, while the

oppsite pattern held for whites.       In hth    states, the pupil-teacher ratios in

black and white schmls converged to almst the same level by the late

1960s.13

       What caused the great di~ities       in school resources for black and

white students in North and South Carolina? Researchers from Wnd           (1934) to

-O      (1990) have obse~ed that in =eas where blacks were mre       numerous, a

greater share of schml resources were diverted from the black schools to

white schools, raising the resources in white schmls md        depressing them in

black schmls.     ~    exclusio~   plitical system enabled this discrititory

p=ctice    to ~rsist   until the 1960s (Boozer,~eger      and Wolkon, 1992).

Viewed in this light, the ~lina’s       varying ~riences      largely c-     &ut     by
    ■   O
I
historical accident. South &olina        had a much higher proprtion of blacks in

its ppulation than North Carolina (58 ~rcent of %uth         Carolinians were black

in 1900 versus 33 ~rcent    of North Carolinians), in part &cause of historical

differmces in slave populations driven by different cropping patterns (Fqel

and Enge~,      1974).   In South Carolina, cotton was the mst      important crop,

whereas in North Carolina, tobacco was mre      iprtant.

       The experiences of North and South Carolina provide a ~tentially useful

l~ratory     for evaluating the effect of schml resources. A very different

set of forces led to differences in schml resources for students in these two

states than the factors that detetie      resource decisions in a typical school

district tdy.      If titted variables plague aggregate studies of earnings, we

would not ~ct      to find earnings and educational atta-t          mirroring racial

differences in school resources in %uth       and North Carolina over time, unless

these titted    state wi~les    S*OW     changed along with the allocation of

schcol resources. It is therefore valuable to check whether the convergence

in schcol resomces for whites and blacks from ~rth         and South Carolina led to

a parallel   convergence in the relative levels of educational attainment and

earnings for individuals fm     the tm    states.

       We used micrbta    from the 1960, 1970 and 1980 Censuses to ~e

trends in education and earnings for succeeding generations of men bm         in the

Carolims between 1900 and 1959. We restrict the s~le         to m    &cause   l~r

relative education between the tm        states roughly rnimr      the trends ti

North Carolina had hut         14 fewer pupils pr    student that blacks in South

GOlti     . ~s      gap was associated with 0.65 mre     ye=s   of education, on

average, for blacks km         in North Carolina. For whites in the same cohort,

the situation was reversed. Wtes          in South &olina     had &ut      4 fewer pupils

favor of South Carolina-hm         whites. For hth    blacks and whites, the

education gaps ~owed        over succeeding generations, as the resource gaps

consistent with the view that meager schml resources put black m           frm   South

Carolina at c-titive       disadvantage, while gmerous resources gave white men

frm    South Carolim a leg up in the job ~ket.       Gne trotiltig finding for

this interpretation, however, is that the cross-state wage gaps seerried
                                                                       to

close very quickly for blacks, whereas the schml quality gap was mre

persistent. Given the sqling      vari~ility of the estimtes, however, the

cohort-specific wage gaps should &     viewed cautiously.

        How consistent are the data in Table 1 with the e=lier     literatue on

earnings and schml quality? To ~r            this question, recall that the reduced

form estimtes in the literature suggest that a 10 prcent        reduction in class

size would k    as-iated   with an increase in e-ings      of 0.4 to 1.1 ~rcent.

~us,    the roughly 12 student ~wing        of the gap in the average pupil-teacher

ratio ktween    North and %uth Carolina for blacks hm       in the 1940s relative

to those hm     in the 1900s (a 28 ~rcent     reduction) might have hen   ~cted

to raise earnings by 1-3 ~rcent.15     me    actual ~ing       in the etings     gap

was ~ut     5 prcent   (with a standard emor   of 3 percmt)    -- roughly consistent

with the emlier    literature. The patterns for whites are smwhat         harder to

explain, since the relative change in school quality is @est.         Based on

earlier estimtes, the 3 student reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio gap

&tween North and South Carolina whites hm         in the 1940s relative to those

km     in the 1900s might have been expected to raise e-gsby         0.4-1.1

percent, while the actual earnings convergence was also 5 percent (with a

standard emor    of 2 percent). Gne pssible qlanation         for the larger than

expected wage differences is that other aspects of schml resources, such as

the length of the schml year, differed substantially &tween North and %uth

mlina      early in the century as well, and then converged.


                                        21
       We conclude that the mgnitude of the observed edngs                 convergence for

black n-ien
          in the tm           states is roughly consistent with the earlier literature,

while the mgnitude of convergence for white m                is, if anything, greater than

~cted.         However, despite the strong intuitive a~al          of the North Molina

- South Carolina cqison                 on a priori grounds, and the availability of over

130,000 wage obsemtions             fm    the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses, it is

evident that the per           of the data to yield precise estimates of cross-state

earnings differentials by race and cohort is limited. There is a general

lesson here.        Because e-ings         are so miable,   and schcol resource effects

are at best tiest,           -11    data sets are unlikely to find significant effects

of school resources.

       South Carolina and North Carolina represent just one pssible

c-ison.            What but        the other segregated states? In Card and Krueger

(1992b),we use data frm             all 18 segregated states to relate the level of

schml resources in the black and white schmls to subsequent earnings of

individuals educated in those states. To control for differential l~r

~ket       effects, in much of our analysis we focused on mrkers           who attended

scbl       in the South but later were observed wrking          in a c~n     set of

Northern     l~r    ~kets.         ~s     technique has the advantage of controlling for

l~r    ~ket        differences that may b       comelated with schcol ~ality

differences: for _le,                states that discriminated in terms of schcol

resources my        k   mre    likely to allow discrimination in terms of l~r         ~ket

conditions. The results indicated that the payoff to each year of education

was   greater for individuals (of either racial puP)            who were fr~    states t~t

devoted mre        resouces to education. ~hemre,              reduced form tiels

indicate that the level of e-                gs and educational attain     t were positively


                                                 22
associated with school resources. Thus, the cqison                        of North and South

Carolina     is    not   an isolated       -le.




        ES        the literatme on schml resources, earnings, and educational

attai~t           prove &yond     a reasonable debt          that resources rotter? We do not

&lieve     that the evidence justifies m                 strong a conclusion. me   avail~le

evidence is not _iguous                    or tiiquitous, and.suffers frm      all the standard

criticisms of drawing causal inferences frofnObse=tional                      data.

        To S-        =ent,      interpreting the literature depends on the strength of

one’s prior expectations. If one starts fm                      the psition   that schml

resomces do not tie             a difference, then one can pint          to the bulk of the

evidmce on the lack of a statistically significant connection htween                       schml

resources and test scores, md                     a handful of studies on econtic outcms,      to

su~rt      that view.        On the other hand, if one st~s            frm    the view that

resources do tie           a difference, then the available evidence on schml quality

and econtic outcms              my     &    interpreted as generally supportive. Perhaps the

strongest evidence that resources rotter cms                     fm   an analysis of the vast

differences in resources for blacks and whites who attended schmls                     in the

segregated states. We su~ct                       that further research focussing on particular

episodes of large changes in schml quality -- such as our si~le                       “case study”

of North and %uth           Carolina -- might k           valuable.

        ~rty        years after the Colem              Repcrt, it is unfortunate and frustrating

that mre      is not kown        about schcoling. While mst           of the literature on test

scores pints         to little, if any, effect of school resources, sm

Ecisions ~ut    educational resources and reform have to &   mde   in an

enviro~t    of mch   uncertainty.

       The estimtes in Figure 4 and T*le        1 are based on s~les     drawn fm

the Public Use S~les         of the U.S. Census. ~cifically,      the s~le    is drawn

frm    the 1960 1% public use s~le,      the 1970 1% sample (15% form) and the 1970

I% s~le      (5% form), and the 5% sqle     of the 1980 Census.     In principle, the

Census provides self-weighting sqles        of the population. ~us,      the s~le

contains 1% of the ppulation in 1960, 2% in 1970 and 5% in 1980. We assigned

sqle    weights so that the sqle       each census year received equal weight (that

is, observations from 1960 were assigned a weight of 1.0, observations fm

1970 were assigned a weight of 0.5, and observations frm          1980 were assigned a

weight of 0.2). Gur extract consists of white and black H           km    in North

of the annual and weekly wage reduced the s~le        by an additional 2%.     me

2.        If    ~      the     estimates      with      unknown    signs     are     counted       as
negative,       the   odds     are   still     less    than    one     in 100.     On the     other
hand,      Hanushek     finds      a much weaker         pattern       for   the  teacher-pupil
ratio    .     But    one      must     wonder      whether         some    of   these     studies
controlled        for   both     the   teacher-pupil          ratio      and expenditures        per
student      in their      estimating       equations.

Also see Lang              (1993) for a related model.

4. This   analysis  ignores   any general  equilibrium   effects  of
changing the endowment   of human capital.  This assumption   can be
justified   if the school    system  under consideration   is small
relative to the rest of the economy, so the price of human capital
is set exogenously  in the market.

school resources  is Ribich and Murphy (1975) .

6. School           spending     per    student      in the   NLS data   pertains           to    the
average        secondary       school   in   the   district   where  the worker          lived.

7. A seminal paper of this genre is by Behrman and Birdsall   (1983),
which studies school resources in Brazil.    Because the emphasis in
this paper is on the United States, however, we do not describe
their findings in detail.

8. By analogy,   a high quality undergraduate  economics  program is
likely to have its most beneficial effect on students who continue
on to graduate school.   Would any department chair want his or her
program evaluated on the basis of a sample that explicitly excludes
students who continue on to graduate school?

9. Although Heckman, Layne-Farrar  and Todd (1996) find that school
resources  have a varying effect on the earnings-education     slope
across regions, in most regions, a smaller pupil-teacher   ratio is
associated  with a higher payoff to additional  education.

10.  Betts    (1995) does not adjust         the standard   errors   of his
estimates    for the    fact   that    there    are as many    as 10 wage
observations    per individual   in the NLSY sample.      Betts generously
provided us with his data,     and  we  have  used his sample  to calculate
standard errors that account for the correlation           across earnings
observations  for the same individual               over time.  This adjustment
raises the estimated  standard errors              by up to 100 percent.

11. These     elasticities    are calculated      at the means     of their
respective data sets.      The t-ratio of the Card and Krueger estimate
reported in this paragraph        is 6.2; for the Betts estimate,      it is
1.7.    However,   both t-ratios are probably        overstated  because of
multiple    earnings   observations       per worker   or per state.       In
specifications    that include cumulative work experience       rather than
age, Betts     finds a weaker        effect  of the teacher-pupil     ratio.
Because    work    experience      may    be  influenced    by  educational
attainment,   which in turn may be influenced by school resources, we
chose to hold constant age instead of experience             in the reduced
form models    in our  1992a  article.

12.  The data used to construct   this figure               are taken primarily
from the U.S. Office of Education’s   Biennial              Survev of Education
and from various state education reports.

13. Despite   the  1954 Brown            v. Board   of     Education  decision,
substantial school integration           did not begin     until the mid-1960s.


14. Interestingly,   the data show that South Carolina blacks in the
earliest  birth cohorts were more likely to move to higher wage
urban areas outside the South than North Carolina blacks.    Without
any adjustment    for region of residence,   average wages of South
Carolina blacks   in the earlier cohorts are therefore quite similar
to   averages   for   North   Carolina   blacks.

15. The 12 student reduction in relative class size is roughly a 28
percent reduction;   that is, average class size in North Carolina
for the 1900-09    cohort of blacks was 55.7 and for the 1940-49
cohort was 31)
