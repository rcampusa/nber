1. Introduction

        Japanese financial institutions, in particular banks, experienced large shocks

in the second half of the 1990s. The deterioration of balance sheets forced some banks

to fail or to withdraw from operations abroad. It started with an increase in

nonperforming loans due to bursting of asset bubbles in the first half of the 1990s and

a difficulty compounded by incomplete disclosure of bank balance sheet conditions and

a lack of scheme to deal with near-insolvent banks. Nonperforming loans became an

important policy issue from the mid-1990s, but market participants could not have

enough information to make accurate judgement on how serious the banks’ conditions

were. Since 1995, as some banks actually failed and discussion on dealing with failing

banks took place, investors have changed their evaluation on the Japanese banking

industry in general and individual Japanese banks. In November 1997, two

banks—including one of the top 10 banks—and two securities firms—including one of

Big Four—have failed. Facing with a widespread fear of financial meltdown, the

government decided to strengthen the banking sector. Capital injection—subscription

to preferred shares or purchase of subordinated bonds—into major banks using fiscal

money took place in March 1998 and, again, in March 1999. The last fiscal injection

seems to have put an end to a saga of the 1990s banking crisis in Japan.

        How foreign and domestic market participants evaluate the net worth or

default risk of Japanese bank is reflected in two different indicators, stock prices of

banks in the Tokyo stock exchange and the Japan premium (defined as the difference

between the euro-dollar interbank interest rate for Japanese borrowers and that for

European/American borrowers).

        In order to extract the Japanese banks’ reputation among stock market



                                          2
investors, we constructed the relative stock prices of the banking sector against the

rest of the economy. The banking-sector stock price index (Banking-TOPIX) has been

publicly available. The bank stock index, BINDEX, reflects profitability, growth

potentials, soundness in balance sheets, and other performance indicators of banks,

judged by stock market investors. Of course, these banking performance would partly

reflect strength of the economy in general. In order to control for the economy-wide

factors, the difference between the bank stock index and “other industries stock index.”

We have constructed the index of general stock prices excluding banking index (TOPIX

less the banking sector). The “other industries stock index”, NINDEX, is defined as the

difference between the TOPIX and the market-value-weight-adjusted bank stock index.

Then the difference between NINDEX and BINDEX is called the banking spread in the

stock markets, or SP. This indicator shows how investors regard the health of banking

sector in relative to the economy-wide business conditions. The spread has started to

become large in 1995 and continued to become larger in the second half of the 1990s.

         The relationship between NINDEX and BINDEX has changed over time. In

the long run, the two indices are cointegrated. However, the cointegration relationship

seems to have changed its structure, as the two indices behave differently in the second

half of the 1990s. We employ an econometric test developed by Seo (1998) in order to

determine when a structural change in the cointegration relationship took place.

Although it has been recognized by casual observations that banking stock prices have

deviated from the overall stock prices, our formal test to determine the timing of such a

change is, to our best knowledge, the first in the literature.

          The Japan premium shows fragility, in terms of credit and counterparty risk,

of Japanese banks perceived by foreign banks. The premium was added on to the loan



                                             3
to Japanese banks in the eurodollar interbank market. Since large Japanese banks did

not face any premium in the euro-yen or domestic yen-based interbank market, it was

rather a puzzle why they were charged premium in the particular market. However, it

became a symbol of weakness and vulnerability of Japanese banks. In the second half

of the 1990s, whenever bad news about Japanese banks hit international press, the

Japan premium seemed to have increased. Japan premium started to have increased in

the summer of 1995, and, after some fluctuations, disappeared in April 1999.

         After the behavior of the bank stock prices and the Japan premium is

described and analyzed separately, the relationship between them is examined. One

hypothesis is that these two mirrors of bank soundness are correlated closely. One

indicator shows vulnerability, then the other follows. Another hypothesis is that one

indicator could influence the other, but not vice versa. In order to test these hypotheses,

a vector autoregression is conducted.

         It has been observed by many market observers and policy makers that both

stock prices of banks and Japan premium reflect market participants’ views of

Japanese banks in various stages of banking difficulties. However, changes in these

variables have not been analyzed systematically. This paper is the first to test the

relationship between the Japan premium and the bank stock prices.

         The existing literature is briefly described and related to this paper. Peek and

Rosengren (2000) regressed Japan premium on various dummy variables to find that

changes in credit rating of banks, banking failures, and government announcement on

overhauling weak banking system, among others, have contributed to increasing and

decreasing Japan premium. They also found that policies not differentiating weak and

strong banks contributed to an increase of Japan premium. We extend Peek and



                                            4
Rosengren in two fronts. First, we included the banking stock prices as one of the

explanatory variables of the Japan premium regression. The regression is useful for

separating general information that would be reflected in the domestic stock market

(risk to solvency) and those information that are specific to the euro-dollar market

(liquidity risk in the dollar market). Second, we have identified the Daiwa Bank

incident as one of the major news that contributed an increase in Japan premium,

while Peek and Rosengren failed to find such an effect. The difference in the two

studies depends on constructing a Daiwa incident dummy variable.

         Ito and Harada (2000) presented a detailed analysis of event studies on the

bank failure news. They showed that prominent failures—starting from the failure of

Hyogo Bank (the first listed bank failure) in August 1995—gradually created the

perception of systemic risk in the Japanese financial system. The event studies

presented in the earlier paper will be summarized in next section

         Peek and Rosengren (1997) examined a claim that the large stock prices

declines in Tokyo affected the Japanese banks balance sheets and forced the Japanese

banks to curtail lending at branches in the United States. Shimizu and Ui (1999) used

a game theoretic approach to explain changes in the expectation about bank failures in

Japan. Daigo, Yonetani, and Marumo (1998) found that announcements of various

measures, such as the changes in accounting method, affected bank stock prices.

Brewer, Genay, Hunter, and Kaufman (1997, 2000) analyzed determinants of the

Japanese bank stock prices. Their most recent paper shows that bank failures had

spillover effects on other bank stock prices.1

         The paper analyzes the behaviors of bank stock spreads and Japan premium,

and their relationship in the 1990s. In anticipation, conclusions can be summarized as



                                             5
follows: (1) Japan Premium (JP) has sharply jumped up in three occasions, the Daiwa

Bank incident in 1995, the major failures of financial institutions in November 1997,

and the period of nationalizing two long-term credit banks; (2) Bank stock spreads (SP)

increased in response to several financial institutions failures, in particular those in

November 1997; (3) In some cases, a bank’s failure triggered the decline in banking

stock prices in general, or a sign of systemic crisis, but in some other cases, one bank

failure goes without notice in the stock market; (4) The bank stock index (BINDEX)

and the other stock index (NINDEX) had exhibited a comovement until the mid-1990s;

(5) the structural change occurred in the BINDEX and NINDEX cointegration

relationship sometime in the summer of 1995; and (6) Although SP and JP in general

appears to be influencing each other, the Granger causality tests reveals that SP

Granger-causes JP, but not vice versa.

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will describe the data

and reviews the results of event studies. Section 3 will analyze the behaviors of

BINDEX and NINDEX. Section 4 will investigate determinants of the Japan premium.

Section 5 will present a vector autoregression model analyzing a dynamic relationship

between Japan premium and the bank stock price spread. Section 6 will conclude the

paper.




2. Data and event studies

2.1. Bank stock price index

         We would like to describe the movement of bank stock prices in relative to

other sectors. The bank stock price index is publicly available, but not the index for all

industries except banking. Therefore, we construct the general stock price index



                                            6
excluding banks by subtracting banking weights from TOPIX. Since TOPIX is the

weighted average of 33 different sectoral indices, by removing the banking index from

TOPIX, we can construct general index excluding banking as follows:

(2.1)    TOPIX t = (1 − α t )NINDEX t + α t BINDEX t

                      TOPIX t − α t BINDEX t
(2.2)    NINDEX t =
                              1−α t
               BINDEXMVt
where α t =              , and BINDEXMV(t) is current values of banking market
                TOPIXMVt

capitalization and TOPIXMV is all sector market capitalization.2 All indices, TOPIX,

BINDEX, and NINDEX are adjusted for stock splits. Figure 1 shows the BINDEX and

NINDEX from January 4, 1994 to April 30, 1999 with the number of observation being

1,282.

           Insert Figure1.

           We may observe that deviations between the two indices are minor before

August 1995, but after August 1995, the two indices started to diverge. The deviations

seem to widen over time.3

           The bank stock prices relative to other sectors is defined as the bank stock

price spread, SP:

(2.3)      SPt = ln NINDEX t − ln BINDEX t

           In addition, we will construct a weak banks stock price index. This index will

be used to measure the impact of news events, including the failure of banks, on the

weak banks. First, take Japanese banks with low credit ratings (Baa2 and Baa3 for

long deposit credit ratings in the Moody’s Investment Service, Moody’s Global Ratings

Guide), and define the weighted average of these banks’ stock prices as the Baa bank

stock price index.




                                                 7
2.2. Japan premium

        The Japan premium is the premium imposed on Japanese banks’ borrowing

rate by U.S. and European banks in the eurodollar market. It reflected counterparty

risk based on the western banks’ belief that Japanese banks had higher risk of default.

Since the Japan premium emerged in the eurodollar market, and not in the euroyen

market, it also reflects the liquidity problem with the dollars, rather than solvency or

liquidity in the yen. In this paper, the Japan premium is defined as the difference

between the TIBOR (the Tokyo interbank Offer Rate, or the dollar interbank borrowing

rate in Tokyo) and the LIBOR (the London Interbank Offer Rate, or the dollar

interbank borrowing rate in London). The TIBOR market participants are mostly

Japanese banks. Therefore, the TIBOR reflects Japanese banks’ borrowing rate with

Japan premium. The LIBOR market has many western banks and only a few Japanese

banks.4 With LIBOR calculation eliminates the extreme values, the Japanese banks’

rates are excluded from the LIBOR calculation. Hence, the difference between TIBOR

and LIBOR is defined as the Japan premium (JP).5

(2.4)    JPt = TIBORt − LIBORt −1

        The relationship between SP and JP can be shown in Figure 2. The bank stock

spread data (the difference in the BINDEX and NINDEX, which is normalized as 100

on January 4, 1994) has a trend and is thus considered to have the possibility of

nonstationary. However the data can be assumed to be stationary so that the trend is

not removed by taking first differences in our estimations but a time trend is used

instead. We will discuss this issue in some more detail in subsection 3.3. Note that the

bank stock spread seems to be constant or slightly increasing at the end of the sample



                                           8
period, while the Japan premium has declined dramatically.

                   Insert Figure 2




2.3. Event study

         Ito and Harada (2000) studied how the news of bank failures were received by

the stock market in Tokyo. Table 1 shows the 8 cases of financial institution failures. It

shows the name of failed bank, the announcement date of the failure, and anticipation

(changes in 10, 5, and 3, days prior to the announcement) and reaction (changes in 3, 5,

10 days following the announcement) of various stock price indices (BINDEX, Nikkei

225, the failed bank’s (or securities firm’s) stock price, Baa3, Baa2, and in some cases,

related financial institution’s price index).

                   Insert Table 1

         From the table, we can make the following observations. First, for three banks

that failed in 1995 and 1996, the failed banks stock prices dropped sharply, as expected,

but the other banks’ stock prices, even the weak banks’ stock prices, did not drop after

the announcement of a particular bank failure. Therefore, each of the failures was

regarded in the market as an isolated incident. Second, for the three financial

institutions that failed in November 1997, Baa2 and Baa3 indices, as well as BINDEX,

sharply dropped after the failure announcement. The fall of Baa2 and Baa3 exceeded

the fall of BINDEX. These sharp reactions is consistent with the view that systemic

risk of banking failures was perceived to have increased by these failures. Third,

reactions to the nationalization announcements of the Long-term Credit Bank (LTCB)

and Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) were more muted, except some reactions in Baa3 and

Baa2 index. In the case of LTCB nationalization announcement, it was anticipated for



                                                9
a long time through the Diet debate, so that the reaction in BINDEX and Nikkei225

were rather calm, although Baa2 reacted sharply. In the case of NCB nationalization

announcement, it was not anticipated in the market. However, the reaction of BINDEX

and Nikkei225 were also calmer. Baa3 reacted sharply. The nationalization of LTCB

and NCB was carried out under a new mechanism against systemic failure6 . The

market took these failures without increased fears for systemic risk.

        In sum, bank failures in 1995 and 1996 did not trigger bank stock price

declines of other banks, but those in November 1997 brought down stock prices of other

banks, especially those with low credit rating. Systemic risk of the banking system in

general was feared. By 1998, the mechanism to deal with bank failures was in place,

and nationalization of LTCB and NCB was received without a major impact on other

banks’ stock prices in general, but some weak banks were affected.




3. Bank stock price movements

3.1. Correlation

        From a casual observation of Figure 1, there seem to be three periods in the

relationship between the BINDEX and NINDEX. The first period is from January 1994,

the first date of our sample, to August 29, 1995, the day before the Hyogo Bank failure.

The two indices show comovement. The second period is from August 30, 1995 to

December 18, 1996. The deviation of BINDEX and NINDEX seems to widen gradually

over this period. The third period is from December 19, 1996 to the end of our sample,

April 30, 1999. The two indices in this period maintain the same degree of deviation, or

the regaining the comovement in changes.

        In order to formally show this casual observation, we calculated the



                                           10
correlation coefficient of the two indices. For the first period, the correlation coefficient

was 0.96 (with samples of 414), for the second period, the correlation coefficient

dropped to 0.88 (with samples of 307). The correlation went up again to 0.97 in the

third period with samples of 561.

         We can interpret this as follows. Before the Hyogo Bank failure, the banking

industry was quite a typical industry in the economy. The banking stock movement

tracked the rest of the economy quite well. After the Hyogo Bank failure, the bank

stocks started to do much worse than the rest of the economy. The Hyogo Bank failure

was only the beginning of this deviating trend. By the end of 1996, the deviation

between the two indices reached its maximum. From 1997, the deviation seemed to

remain stable.

         This assessment may appear contradicting the event study conclusion.

According to the event analysis the Hyogo Bank failure did not alarm investors about

other banks. However, that event seems to be the beginning of the deviation between

the BINDEX and NINDEX. Since the event analysis covers only ten days after the

event, it does not capture a possible structural change over time. The failures of the

large financial institutions in November 1997 are most dramatic and the event

analysis shows that it had a large impact on other banking stock prices. It may be

natural to expect that November 1997 is the turning point. However, the correlation of

the BINDEX and NINDEX increase after November 1997. But, the deviation between

the BINDEX and NINDEX had already become large. The stock market must have

anticipated low returns in the banking sector, including some failures. After November

1997, not only the banking sector but also the economy in general headed for a

contraction (e.g., the GDP growth rate became –2.5%), so that the relative positions of



                                             11
BINDEX and NINDEX may not have changed. Thus, just the event analysis or the

correlation analysis does not give us a definite conclusion. It takes a more formal

analysis to determine when the structural change took place.




3.2. Cointegration of BINDEX and NINDEX

         In this subsection, the comovement of BINDEX and NINDEX will be formally

analyzed using the cointegration technique. First, a unit root test is conducted for

BINDEX and NINDEX. Each of the two indices is shown to have a unit root. Then the

cointegration relationship between the two indices with an entire sample period is

tested. Since the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, it suggests that the two

variables are not cointegrated as an entire sample period. This result supports that the

long-run relationship between BINDEX and NINDEX cannot be assessed because of a

structural change. These test results are shown in Table 2.

         Insert Table 2, Unit Root Test and Cointegration Test

         We suspect that the relationship may have experienced a structural change, as

the preceding section indicates. Our interest is to determine when the structural

change took place as well as whether the structural change took place. We apply a

technique developed by Seo (1998). The Seo’s technique will identify the timing of a

structural change, while most of others test the existence of structural break at a pre-

determined time7.

         The sample period is from January 4, 1994 to April 30, 1999 with a sample

size of 1282. It is assumed that the admissible range of a break point is symmetrically

set at [0.15, 0.85].

         Consider a two-dimensional time series, BINDEX and NINDEX, generated by



                                            12
ECM with the 1 lag length what is selected by AIC. The long-run relationship is

estimated as follows:

            ∆NINDEX t             NINDEX t − 2          ∆NINDEX t −1 

             ∆BINDEX t            BINDEX t − 2          ∆BINDEX t −1 
where α is the adjustment vector, β is the cointegrating vector. The tests of a

structural change in joint vector βα and optimal LM test statistics are defined as

follows:


(3.2)      Ave LM ni =
                             1 t
                                 ∑
                           t − t t =t
                                            (
                                      LM ni [t / n] )

                           1 t                              

                                       exp LM ni [t / n] / 2 
                                                             
                                                                ) )

(3.4)      Sup LM ni = Max LM ni [t / n]
                              [ ]
                           t ∈ t ,t
                                        (       )

                                                [ ]
where τ is assumed to lie in τ * = τ , τ , t = [nτ ]、t = [nτ ] , i = β , α , βα . It is allowed

that one time structural change in the cointegrating vector at the break point τ . The

break point τ intersects two sub-samples, t = 1,2, ....,[ nτ ] and t = [ nτ ] + 1, ....., n .

[nτ ] is the integer operator of nτ .

           The test results are shown in Table 3-1 panel B8. The plot of LM statistics is in

Figure3. From the table, Sup LM test rejects the null hypothesis of parameter

stability at the 5% size. In figure4, LM statistics show a spike that exceeds 5% critical

value of Sup LM test around 360. This timing of the spike is approximately in the

beginning of July 1995.

                      Insert Figure 3

           Hence, it can be assumed that the relationship between BINDEX and

NINDEX that used to have comovements, has been broken at around July 1995. Bank



                                                        13
stock spreads in relative to the general stock prices (SP) increased in response to

several financial institutions failures and news of financial troubles, in particular those

in November 1997. That is the result from the event study analysis. On the other hand,

the result in this section shows that the long run relationship between the two indices

has changed earlier than November 1997.

         Next, we consider a direct test for structural change with a known break point.

As figure4 shows, the sample period is divided in two sub-samples: the first half is from

January 1994 to June 31, 1995, the latter half is from July 1, 1995 to April 30, 1999.

         Consider the following DOLS, dynamic OLS estimation. The long run

relationship between two indices is defined as:

(3.5)    NINDEX t = µ + γBINDEX t + z t

which is called SOLS, static OLS. By including not just the current change but also

past and futures changes of the regressor, the OLS estimator of the cointegrating

vectorγ on this regression is referred to as the DOLS. The estimator is distinguished

from the SOLS estimator based on the cointegrating regression without changes.

         When the lag length is picked as 2 for required regularity conditions9, the

DOLS regression is as follows:

         NINDEX t = µ + γBINDEX t + β 0 ∆BINDEX t + β 1 ∆BINDEX t +1 + β 2 ∆BINDEX t + 2
(3.6)
                   + β −1 ∆BINDEX t −1 + β − 2 ∆BINDEX t − 2 + z t

where cointegrating vectorγ is simply the SOLS estimator ofγ. The shortcoming of

SOLS is that the bias of the SOLS estimator can be large and that the asymptotic

distribution of t value depends on nuisance parameters. The rescaled t and Wald

statistics based on DOLS have the asymptotic normal and chi-squared distributions.

Therefore, the estimator is asymptotically equivalent to other efficient estimators.

         Table3-2 reports the parameter estimates by SOLS and DOLS for two



                                                 14
sub-samples. The estimates ofγ based on the first half of the sample and the latter

half very different so that the estimates are not stable over the sample. This finding

suggests that the relationship of BINDEX and NINDEX has been broken around the

end of June 1995.

          The possibility could be easily tested by the Chow test of structural change,

that is

          NINDEX t = µ + γBINDEX t + δ 0 Dt + δ 1 BINDEX t Dt
(3.7)            + β 0 ∆BINDEX t + β 1 ∆BINDEX t +1 + β 2 ∆BINDEX t + 2 + β −1 ∆BINDEX t −1
                 + β − 2 ∆BINDEX t − 2 + z t

where Dt is a dummy variable whose value is 1 after June 30, 1995 and 0 otherwise.

The Wald statistic for the null hypothesis that δ 0 = 0, δ 1 = 0 is asymptotically χ2(2).

The DOLS estimate of (3.7) is shown in Table3-3. Our test can reject the stability of

parameters at the 1% size. The 1% significant Wald statistics support the view that the

structural change occurred in the BINDEX and NINDEX cointegration relationship at

the end of June 1995.

                  Insert Table 3




3.3. Changes in SP

          In this subsection, we will investigate what kinds of news have caused the

deviation between BINDEX and NINDEX. We will take several dummy variables to

explain the changes in SP (the log difference between the two indices).




The list of dummy variables and expected signs are summarized as follows:

D1: the day after the announcement of major bankruptcies (+);

D2: the news on public funds for recapitalization of funds (-);



                                               15
D3: seven days following the failures of financial institutions (+);

D4: from the start of the Diet discussions on LTCB to the announcement of

nationalization (?);

D5: downgrading of any Japanese financial institutions (+);

D6: Any day that had news on the Daiwa incident during one month following its

announcement (September 26, 1995) (+); and

D7: Any day that had news on punishment by the US regulators on the Daiwa Bank

operations in the United States from the announcement to the U.S. decision to have

the Daiwa withdraw from the United States (February 2, 1996). (+)




For D1 and D5, we use a two-day event window that includes the day of the

announcement as well as the day after the announcement, in order to account for the

fact that market participants may not have time to react for the announcement in the

evening. For D1, D2, and D7, the Nihon Keizai Shinbun, newspaper, CD-ROM on news

articles database, was consulted.




The following model is estimated for the above dummy variables:
                                                        7
(3.8)    SPt = β 0 + β 1 SPt −1 + β 2 JPt −1 + β 3T + ∑ α i Di + ε t
                                                      i =1


where SPt is the bank stock price spread, (ln NINDEX t − ln BINDEX t ) on day t, JPt −1

is the Japan premium, (TIBORt −1 − LIBORt − 2 ) , on day t-1, β 0 is the intercept

                                                              7
coefficient, T is the time dummy variable and ∑ Di is dummy variables explained
                                                             i =1


above. Equation (3.8) is estimated by OLS since SPt is shown to be a stationary

variable (the unit root test is shown in Table 2).




                                                   16
         Table 4 presents the results from estimating equation (3.8) over the period

between January 4, 1994, and April 30, 1999. The news on the failures of financial

institutions (D3) is shown to have significant impact on SP. As expected, failures have

made market participants to believe that the health of financial institutions was worse

than previously expected. While not statistically significant, the Diet discussion (D4)

on the LTCB and a new framework for dealing with failing banks, as it dragged on,

made SP to increase instead to decrease. The effect of downgrading (D5) did not have

statistically significant effects, even though the sign was right, either because the

Japanese investors who dominate the Tokyo stock market ignored the Moody’s rating

or because the downgrading was well anticipated in the pricing.

                   Insert Table 4.




4. Determinants of Japan premium

         To determine what kinds of news have caused the increase in Japan Premium,

especially whether the response of Japan Premium was based on the domestic news or

other news from abroad, the following model is estimated:
                                                       7
 (4.1)   JPt = β 0 + β 1 JPt −1 + β 2 SPt −1 + β 3T + ∑ α i Di + ε t
                                                      i =1


where JPt is the Japan premium, (TIBORt − LIBORt −1 ) , on day t, SPt −1 is the bank

stock price spread,     (ln NINDEX t −1 − ln BINDEX t −1 )          on day t-1, β 0 is the intercept

                                                              7
coefficient, T is the time dummy variable and ∑ Di is the dummy variables listed in
                                                             i =1


the previous subsection. The lagged endogenous variables SPt −1 and JPt −1 are

ensured to be predetermined. There is no simultaneity problem in the model because of

the time difference as is described in Table 8. Therefore, it can be investigated whether




                                                    17
SP made JP to increase. JPt is also shown to be a stationary variable (the test result

is in Table 2). Equation (4.1) is estimated by generalized method of moments (GMM)

because the standard errors of the OLS regression based on the equation had serially

correlated10.

         Table 5 presents the results from estimating equation (4.1) over the same

period in the previous subsection. The lagged SP has a significant impact on JP. This

evidence supports the idea that a decline in the bank stock index in relative to the

general stock index has a significant impact on increasing the Japan premium. In other

words, the evaluation of the Japanese banking industry which is determined in the

domestic market has affected the level of the Japan premium.

         The news on the Daiwa bank incident (D6) had a significant positive impact

on the rise of JP, which is consistent with investors being uncertain about the

transparency of Japanese banking information and about the effectiveness of the

supervision system in Japan. Therefore the announcement on the incident increased in

JP. Our result is different from that of Peek and Rosengren (2000), who used a one-day

event window for Daiwa bank incident and didn’t obtain any significant effect on the

Japan premium. Rating downgrading news (D5) has a statistically significant effect on

JP. Downgrading Japanese financial institutions as expected raised the Japan

premium. Foreign banks increased a premium in response to more default risk of

Japanese banks as indicated in the rating change. The news on Diet discussion about

LTCB for temporarily nationalization (D4) did have a significant impact on the

premium, probably because the negotiation took a longer-than-expected period and

foreign banks (investors) were skeptical about effectiveness of the Japanese safety net.

The Diet discussion ended with a new measure introducing effective measures to force



                                          18
banks to quickly re-capitalize. However the long discussion reflected skepticism among

investors and increased the Japan premium.

                  Insert Table 5.

        The regression results presented above and in the preceding subsection show

that the news about vulnerability and stabilization of Japanese financial systems have

tended to widen the spread between the bank stock index and the general stock index.

Although the banking spread in the stock markets, SP, has been affected by domestic

news, the news that affected the Japan premium are sometimes different. The Japan

premium tended to increase in response to the news that made international financial

press, such as Daiwa bank incident in N.Y. and downgrading of Japanese financial

institutions by foreign rating agencies. A dynamic causal relationship between SP and

JP is also analyzed by the same results since the two equations, equation (3.8) and

equation (4.1), are in the same form.

        The lagged endogenous variable SPt −1 in the JP equation (in Table 5) is

statistically significant, and based on simple t test, the bank stock index is said to

Granger-cause the Japan premium. However, the lagged endogenous variable JPt −1 is

not significant in the SP equation (in Table 4). Thus, the decline of the bank stock

index in relative to the general stock index affects on the increase in Japan premium,

but not vice versa. In this analysis, the t test is equivalent to the F test in VAR with

one lag. In general, the number of lags in VAR system may be larger than one. We have

examined the VAR system with two lags. But, the result was very similar to the one

presented here.




5. VAR with 2 lags



                                          19
          In this subsection we present the results of F statistics and impulse response

functions by VAR system with two lags. The two variables, SP and JP, are

contemporaneous intra-day variables, so that they can be treated by a regular time

series model. A vector autoregressive model will be used to test Granger causality. The

VAR model can be written in the following form with 2 lags of the variables:

           JPt  = v1  + π 11,i π 12 ,i   JPt −i  + v1t 
                              2
(5.1)
          SPt  v 2  ∑    π π 22,i   SPt −i  v 2 t 
                            i =1  21,i


        π 11,i π 12 ,i                                                v1t 
where                     is a matrix of VAR coefficients, and          is a vector of white noise
        π 21,i π 22 ,i                                              v 2 t 

process shocks to the model. In the model, SP is said to Granger-cause JP if lagged

values of SP have explanatory power in a regression of JP.

          Only F statistics in the above VAR for the sample period of January 1994 to

April 1999 are shown in Table 6. The “SP lags” in the JP equation is the F statistics,

which is significant, the bank stock index is said to Granger-cause the Japan premium.

However, the “JP lags” is not significant in the SP equation. The causal relationship is

not changed.

          Figures4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 display impulse response functions, with periods

measured on the horizontal axis, and impulse shock on the vertical axis. The response

of SP (JP) to an impulse in the other variable, JP (SP) in the system is investigated. We

trace out the effect of one standard deviation exogenous shock to SP (JP) on JP (SP)11.

Impulse response of JP to JP itself (figure5.1) is strong and persistent. Impulse

response of SP to SP itself (figure5.4) is also strong and persistent. On the other hand,

impulse response of JP to SP (figure5.2) is slightly increasing and persistent. An

unexpected increase in the Japan Premium tends to lower Japanese banks’ stock prices

in relative to other stock prices. Impulse response of SP to JP (figure5.3) is negative but



                                                        20
nearly zero which is consistent with a result that JP doesn’t Granger-cause SP.

        The bank spread in the stock market and the Japan premium both have

contained important information to understand Japanese financial systems. They

explain fragility of the financial systems. The joint analyses of the two indicators show

that announcements which increased the bank stock spread, especially those after July

1995, also increased the Japan premium over time.

6. Concluding remarks

        This paper investigates how financial weakness among Japanese banks were

viewed by the market participants in Japan and abroad. Two indicators, the Japan

premium (premium that Japanese banks had to pay over western banks when they

borrow dollars in the interbank market) and the stock price index of the banking sector

in Tokyo, were examined. How foreign and domestic market participants evaluate the

net worth and default risk of Japanese bank is reflected in the two indicators,

respectively. The relationship between the banking index and the index of general

stock prices excluding banking index has changed is examined.

        The Japan Premium that started to have increased in the summer of 1995

disappeared in April 1999 as western banks have increased credit lines with Japanese

banks.The decline in the Japan Premium most likely reflects slow improvement of

Japanese banks’ credit ratings by two capital injection, and improved new regulatory

system. The other indicator, the bank stock spread remains high even after JP has

disappeared. Therefore it seems that Japanese financial crisis (high default risk) has



                                           21
ended in April 1999,but profitability of Japanese banks (in relative to other sectors in

the Japanese economy) remains low.

         We presented how the news of bank failures were received by the stock market

and found that bank failures in November 1997 brought down stock prices of other

banks. Systemic risk of the banking sector was feared in that period. Stock prices of

banks with low credit rating were especially hard hit. News on bank failure increased

the spread between the bank stock index and the general stock index.

         We also examined what kinds of news have caused the Japan premium and

the deviation of two stock indices. Changes in the spread were influenced by the

domestic news about vulnerability and stabilization of Japanese financial systems.

However, changes in Japan premium were influenced by domestic news as well as news

from abroad.

         In order to formally show the deviation of bank and general stock indices, we

calculated the correlation coefficient of those indices. The correlation coefficient smaller

in the period when the deviation seems to widen gradually, so that we became inferred

to find that structural relationship between the two indices have changed over time.

We employed an econometric test that a structural break occurred at the end of June

1995.

         News that affected Japan premium and the deviation of two stock indices were

not identical. Based on the OLS regression, news on the failures of financial

institutions were shown to have significant impacts on the spread of the two stock

indices. In the same way, we found that the lagged spread of two indices had a

significant impact on the Japan premium. Therefore it is true that the evaluation of

the Japanese banking industry which is determined in the domestic market has



                                            22
affected the level of the Japan premium. News of the Daiwa bank incident and news of

bank downgrading were also shown to have significant impact on the Japan premium.

        A causal relationship between the two indicators have been analyzed by VAR.

The bank stock spread and the Japan premium both have contained important

information with regard to financial system in Japan. The joint analysis has shown

that announcements which have impact on the bank stock index increased the spread,

then increased the Japan premium.

1 Brewer, Genay, Hunter, and Kaufman (2000) came to our attention after we wrote the
first draft of this paper.

2 Monthly market valuations are taken from Statistics Monthly of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The monthly figures are adjusted for daily figures by price index changes,
assuming that the number of issued stocks do not change within that month. Any
problem with this assumption is corrected within the month.

3 One might ask whether divergence may be any way related to a regular business
cycle of a recession or a recovery or a cyclical movement of general stock prices, rather
than a peculiarity of the time. Hence, we will check whether movements of the two
indices in the second half of the 1990s are in any way typical or atypical in the long run
trend. Comparing monthly index of TOPIX and BINDEX from 1985 to 1999, one can
confirm that the relationship has been stable between the two indices until the
mid-1990s, over the business cycles and stock price cycles.

4 The LIBOR is calculated by the British Bankers’ Association as the average of the
dollar interbank offer rate. From the beginning of our sample period until January
1999, there were three Japanese banks, including the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, in the
16 banks that are samples for the LIBOR. Since highest four and lowest four banks
were eliminated from the average calculation of the LIBOR, it can be safely assumed
that the LIBOR is not influenced by the Japan premium. After January 1999, only the
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi is included in the LIBOR calculation samples, hence there is
no contamination of Japan premium in the LIBOR.

5 Alternatively, the Japan premium can be measured as the borrowing rates of
Japanese banks in London vs. the borrowing rates of western banks in London.
However, we do not have access to the data of individual banks’ borrowing costs.
Therefore, we took the TIBOR minus LIBOR. In essence, our approach produces a
premium very similar to that one by the alternative approach.

6Earlier in 1998, a new law was passed to make it possible for the authorities to
nationalize a very weak bank.

7 Perron (1989) was the first to develop a test of structural changes in the
nonstationary series. Andrews (1993) showed a test for a case where the timing of
structural change is unknown. Quintos (1997) showed a similar test in the Error
Correction Model. Seo has extended Andrews and Quintos and made the calculation
easier.

8Empirical work in this section is done in Gauss, our program is based on the one
which is given by Byeongseon Seo.

9 Lag length is made to increase with the sample size T at a rate slower than   T1/ 3 .   The
required conditions are in Saikkonen(1991).

10 The OLS standard errors of equation (4.1) showed serial correlation by White’s test.
The OLS variance of the same equation revealed heteroskedasticity-correlated
standard errors by Breusch-Godfrey test. Since the orthogonality condition between the


                                           27
error term and regressors is rejected, we apply GMM to the equation. For the
weighting matrix, initial values are obtained by 3SLS and the procedure by
Newey-West(1987) weighting scheme is used with assuming 5 period autocorrelation.

11 If the variables have different scales it is useful to consider innovations of one
standard deviation rather than unit shocks.
