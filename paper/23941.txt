                                           ABSTRACT

Cities target police patrols and public services to control crime. What are the direct and spillover
effects of such targeted state services? In 2016 the city of Bogotá, Colombia, experimented on an
unprecedented scale. They randomly assigned 1,919 streets to either 8 months of doubled police
patrols, greater municipal services, both, or neither. We study how crime responds to intensifying
normal state presence in moderate-to high-crime streets, and what this implies about criminal
behavior. Scale also brings challenges. Spatial spillovers in dense networks introduce bias and
complicate variance estimation through “fuzzy clustering.” But a design-based approach and
randomization inference produce valid hypothesis tests in such settings. We find that increasing
state presence has modest direct impacts, even when focusing on the highest-crime “hot spots.”
More intense state presence deters more crime. But in most cases, however, crime appears to
displace to neighboring streets. Property crimes seem most easily displaced, while violent crimes
may not be. One interpretation is that crimes with a more sustained motive are more likely to
displace than crimes of passion, which state presence may more permanently deter.

1       Introduction
This paper takes advantage of two city-wide interventions in Bogotá, Colombia, to show that
large-scale crime experiments are possible and, while they come with special econometric
challenges, solving them not only shapes our views of common crime policies, but also the
theories of criminal behavior that underlie them.
    Police and city services are two of the most common tools of crime control. When crime
rises, cities often respond by intensifying patrols or improving lighting in the affected areas.
For example, more than 90% of United States police agencies use some form of “hot spots
policing” that concentrates police on the highest crime streets. Another common tactic is
to reduce physical and social disorder. Such “place-based” interventions focus on the locales
where crime occurs rather than on the people responsible for them.1
    If crime is closely coupled to particular places, then state presence will at least disperse
the crime, and possibly deter it altogether. This question of displacement versus deterrence
is not only crucial to evaluate the costs and benefits of the policies, it also has implications
for our understanding of criminal incentives and behavior.
    The current consensus is that place-based policies reduce aggregate crime. For example,
increasing the intensity or quality of policing on high-crime hot spots appears to reduce crime
on those corners, streets, or neighborhoods, as does tackling social disorder.2 Moreover, two
systematic reviews of the US literature find more instances of positive spillovers to nearby
streets than negative ones.3 These studies argue that place-based policing not only deter
crimes, but that the benefits also diffuse to nearby streets.
    What would this imply for a theory of criminal behavior? In economic models, criminals
weigh the returns from committing crimes against the risk of capture and expected sanctions
(e.g. Becker, 1968; Ehrlich, 1973; Chalfin and McCrary, 2017b). Place-based interventions
    1
     On hot spots policing see Weisburd and Telep (2016); Police Executive Research Forum, (2008). On
disorder studies see Braga et al. (2015). On place-based theory and policy effectiveness see Weisburd et al.
(2012) and Abt and Winship (2016).
   2
     Chalfin and McCrary (2017b) review the evidence on increased policing and find that more police are
usually associated with falling crime city-wide. Looking at targeted hot spots interventions, a systematic
review of hot spots policing identified 19 eligible studies (including 9 experiments). Among 25 tests of
the core hypothesis, 20 report improvements in crime (Braga et al., 2012). These evaluations are largely
in the U.S. Exceptions include ongoing experimental evaluations in Medellin (Collazos et al., 2018) and
Trinidad and Tobago (Sherman et al., 2014). For tackling social disorder, evaluations of municipal services
are relatively rare. (Braga et al., 2015) review interventions designed to tackle social and physical disorder,
but the majority tend to be a policing strategy rather than attempts at urban renewal. There is some
evidence that street lighting reduces crime (Farrington and Welsh, 2008). Cassidy et al. (2014) review five
studies suggesting there is weak evidence that urban renewal reduces youth violence.
   3
     See Braga et al. (2012); Weisburd and Telep (2016). Two natural experiments that put round-the-clock
police in areas of London and Buenos Aires also found no evidence of spatial displacement (Draca et al.,
2011; Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004).

can increase a criminal’s perceived risk of detection and capture, and so they should be
less likely to commit these purposeful, “motivated” crimes in that place.4 Therefore if
targeted, place-based policies reduce the total number of motivated and material crimes
in a city, it suggests at least one of the following: that criminal rents are highly concentrated
and unequally distributed within cities; that some offenders are resistant to moving crime
locations; or that the supply of crime is elastic to the actual or perceived risk of apprehension
in a small number of areas.5
    Of course, many crimes do not have a sustained motive. Examples include drunken brawls
outside a bar, or a sudden opportunity to mug someone. In these cases, any intervention that
stops the crime from happening at that time or place could prevent it altogether. Therefore,
if place-based interventions do indeed decrease total crime, then it might also point to the
non-motivated, non-economic roots of many offenses.
    Based on the current consensus, more countries are adopting place-based tactics. In
Latin America, arguably the most violent region in the world, governments are especially
eager adopters.6 Colombia’s two largest cities, Bogotá and Medellín, have put place-based
tactics at the center of their security strategies in recent years.
    We see a few reasons for caution, and argue that larger-scale studies are needed to assess
the aggregate effects of place-based policies. First, the studied interventions vary widely
in their nature and intensity. They range from round-the-clock police presence, to drug
house invasions, to changes in the police-community relationship. Second, consistent with
the theory outlined above, and a large literature in criminology, the same intervention may
have different spillover effects on different kinds of crime (Weisburd et al., 2006). Third,
studies vary in when and how they measure spillovers. Altogether, it may not be possible
to draw general conclusions about crime spillovers just yet. Indeed, different interventions,
outcomes, timing, and spillover measures could explain our fourth point: that the evidence
on the direction of spillovers is mixed, with studies pointing both ways.7
   4
     Police presence disrupts this crime or raises the risk of capture, while city services light dark areas or
increase the number of people on the street. State presence may also signal order, telling criminals to stay
away and citizens that the state is present—a version of the famous “broken windows” hypothesis (Wilson
and Kelling, 1982; Apel, 2013). Note that “Broken windows policing” is sometimes used to describe intensive,
zero tolerance policing. But more visible state presence and physical order should send similar signals.
   5
     For articulations of these channels, see Clarke and Weisburd (1994); Weisburd et al. (2006); Chiba and
Leong (2014).

     Latin America has 42 of the 50 most dangerous cities and a third of the world’s homicides (see Consejo
Ciudadano para la Seguridad Pública y Justicia Penal and Global Study on Homicide 2013). Major cities
also have fewer police per person than the U.S. or Europe. Policymakers are interested in the returns to
higher quality or quantity of policing. Muggah et al. (2016) document the adoption of hot spots policing
tactics in different Latin American countries. Also see Abt and Winship (2016) for recommendations to U.S.
international development agencies.
   7
     One very wide review of 102 place-based interventions found indications of positive spillovers in a quarter



                                                       2
    Finally, because of small samples and aggregation challenges, this question of displace-
ment or diffusion is unsettled. The median hot spots policing study has fewer than 30 hot
spots per treatment arm. Thus no one study can rule out large adverse spillovers.8 Collec-
tively, of course, existing studies have greater power, and the balance of evidence points to
spillovers being beneficial. Even so, as we discuss below, there are good reasons to think
the uncertainty around this average includes large negative and positive spillovers.9 Thus
above all, the literature needs more statistical power in more cases to speak to the question
of crime displacement.
    With these theoretical and empirical questions in mind we worked with the city of Bogotá
to design a large-scale, multi-arm security experiment. Bogotá is a large, thriving, relatively
rich and developed city in a middle-income country, now at peace. It has a professionalized
and well-regarded police force. Thus lessons from Bogotá are potentially relevant to a range
of US and global cities. Our intention was to take advantage of the unusual size of the
experiment to identify more subtle spillovers over flexible ranges, and to test whether the
interventions have different effects on different types of crime.
    Scale and spillovers also bring econometric challenges to program evaluation. In partic-
ular, we illustrate how spillovers in dense networks bias treatment effects and complicate
variance estimation through “fuzzy clustering.” Thus we also designed this experiment to il-
lustrate how two tools—study design and randomization inference—can be used to estimate
spillovers flexibly, and produce valid hypothesis tests when standard methods do not.
    Specifically, in January 2016 a new city government in Bogotá decided to experiment
in nearly 2,000 moderate to high-crime streets by intensifying normal police patrolling and
improving municipal services such as lighting and clean-up. This is the first attempt by
a city to experiment at such a scale, especially with more than one intervention at once.
Another advantage is that Bogotá has street-level, geo-referenced crime data on all 136,984
streets in the city, plus the location of every police patrol every 30 seconds for the year.
    Interestingly, we draw similar conclusions whether we look at the full sample of experi-
mental streets, or restrict our attention to the few hundred highest-crime hot spots. We find
that intensifying patrols and municipal services slightly reduced property and violent crime
on the targeted streets. We also find that crime, especially property crime, seems to displace
and adverse spillovers in a quarter Guerette and Bowers (2009). If we limit our analysis to higher-quality
hot spots policing studies, of the 9 experimental and non-experimental studies with more than 15 control
units, evidence of positive spillovers are more common: 3 report evidence of adverse spillovers and 6 report
evidence of diffusion of benefits.
   8
     At this scale, individual experiments are not powered to detect spillovers of 0.4 or 0.5 standard deviations
in size (see Appendix A).
   9
     See Section 8.1. This section explains why current meta-analysis confidence intervals might dramatically
understate the uncertainty around aggregate spillovers.

nearby. We see no evidence of violent crimes displacing, however.10 More state presence, or
more forms of state presence, have the largest direct effects on crime reduction, especially in
higher-crime places. But in aggregate the direct effect on crime is very small, and seems to
be more than outweighed by property crime that spills over nearby.
    This pattern is consistent with the idea that offenders with sustained motives (like theft)
respond strategically to targeted state presence and relocate. Crimes of passion, however,
may be more easily deterred.11 This suggests the decision to use place-based tactics depends
on local crime patterns and what policymakers think are the key crimes to deter.
    The remainder of this introduction summarizes the design and conclusions in more detail.
The experiment itself proceeded in two steps. First, we worked with the police to identify an
experimental sample of 1,919 street segments with security concerns. A segment is a length
of street between two intersections, a common unit of police attention (Weisburd et al.,
2012). The city nearly doubled police patrol time on 756 of the 1,919 segments, giving an
additional 77 minutes of time to streets that otherwise received 92 minutes of patrol time
per day. Second, after intensive policing began, the city targeted 201 segments for municipal
services. We randomized assignment to intensive policing, more municipal services, both,
or neither. At this scale, we were ex-ante powered to detect direct effects of 0.15 standard
deviations. We also monitor impacts onto the 77,848 segments within 250m, and are powered
to detect spillovers as small as 0.02 standard deviations (with 80% power, see Appendix A).
    Both interventions reallocated existing city resources. No new police or city contractors
were added. Rather, within their patrol area (a quadrant), officers were told to double their
time on two streets, in multiple visits. This intensive policing lasted eight months. With 130
segments per quadrant, there is little impact on patrolling on other segments—something
we can confirm with geo-referenced data on patrols. These patrols went about their normal
duties, interacting with citizens, and stopping and frisking suspicious people. Two months
later, the city added a second experimental intervention over the first. To tackle social
disorder, they sent city contractors to repair lights and clean up trash.
    As a result, Bogotá’s interventions are different from hot spots programs that intensely
target drug houses or change the local approach to policing and community engagement.
Rather, we estimate the relationship between security and the intensity of normal state
presence. We do so on streets ranging from moderate to very high crime. The closest
comparisons are a handful of US policing interventions that increased police time by roughly
  10
     Broadly, we refer to property crimes for economically motivated property crimes. In this sense, a violent
robbery is coded here as a property rather than a violent crime event.
  11
     In a recent randomized trial in Bogotá, Nussio and Norza Cespedes (2018) find that information cam-
paigns on the number of arrests at a specific location (i.e. objective information on the probability of
apprehension) decrease reports on motivated crimes but not on crimes of passion (at treated places).



                                                      4
1-3 hours per day on 20–60 high-crime hot spots (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995; Telep et al.,
2014; Taylor et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, however, Bogotá is the first attempt
to evaluate normal service delivery on a wide range of streets, and the first to estimate
aggregate effects on crime city-wide.12
    As we indicate above, one challenge with experimenting at this scale is that spillovers
interfere with clean causal identification. Specifically, treating one street can affect the
outcomes of nearby control streets (for instance, if criminals move to nearby high-profit
segments). We used a design-based approach to account for spatial spillovers flexibly, largely
because we did not want to make strong assumptions about the structure of spillovers.
Following our pre-analysis plan, we partitioned control streets by distance from treated
streets: 0–250 meters (m), 250–500m, and >500m. By comparing outcomes across treatment
and control categories, we can first test for local spillovers in the 0–250m and 250–500m
regions, and then use unaffected regions as a control group for estimating direct treatment
effects. We estimate spillovers into the non-experimental sample the same way. Moreover,
we test whether we draw similar conclusions if we model spillovers with more structure, such
as with continuous decay functions.
    Because crime is not distributed evenly across the city, however, spillovers present fur-
ther estimation challenges. By simulating the experiment many times, we show that the
close proximity of experimental streets leads to hard-to-model patterns of “fuzzy clustering”
(Abadie et al., 2016). In most randomizations, segments close to experimental streets tend
to be assigned to the same spillover status. This biases estimated treatment effects and
understates standard errors. Without a fixed geographic unit of clustering, we cannot use
standard correction procedures. This is a common but under-explored problem with exper-
iments in social or spatial networks. Whether we model spillovers flexibly or with decay
functions, we use randomization inference to estimate exact p-values in these settings.
    Our main outcome is police data on reported crimes, available for every street. But
reported crimes are incomplete and reporting could be correlated with treatment. Thus we
also conducted a survey of about 24,000 citizens, providing measures of unreported crimes,
security perceptions, and attitudes to the state. These data also suggest that treatment does
not affect the likelihood a crime is reported, which allow us to trust the crime data more.
    First, we see only slight evidence that intensifying state presence improved security. Look-
  12
    The closest comes from Essex, UK, where police increased their patrolling by a much smaller mar-
gin—roughly 10 minutes per day—in the 200 meter areas around the site of the prior week’s burglaries.
Blanes I Vidal and Mastrobuoni (2017) compare crime rates in these treated areas to the areas around
previous burglaries and find no apparent effect on crime. Unlike the US studies, Essex is not a hot spots
intervention, since there is no evidence that burglaries were persistent. But the Essex results are consistent
with our own, where we fail to see large and statistically significant direct effects on crime except in the most
intensively treated hot spots.


                                                       5
ing at each intervention individually, crime fell an average of 0.1 standard deviations from
both intensive policing and municipal services. Accounting for spillovers, however, neither
decrease is statistically significant. Nonetheless, when a street received both interventions
reported crimes fell by 57%, statistically significant at the 1% level. It is possible that there
are increasing returns to both police patrols and municipal services.
    Importantly, if we restrict our attention to the highest-crime streets, we can simulate
more targeted “hot spots” interventions. The same patterns hold. In fact, more intensive
policing alone is not associated with decreases in crime in these highest-crime streets.
    In aggregate, the direct effects of both treatments are modest. To understand true city-
wide impacts, we would need a randomized trial across cities. However, we can approximate
general equilibrium impacts by aggregating total direct effects and spatial spillovers over
the eight months. If we consider crimes reported to the police alone, for instance, our
highest estimate is that roughly 100 crimes were prevented in treatment segments with
both interventions. Our main estimate, however, is that not even one crime was prevented
in treatment segments over eight months, city-wide. Obviously none of these aggregate
decreases are statistically significant.
    Meanwhile, we see evidence of adverse spillovers. On a street-by-street basis, these are
small in magnitude. With tens of thousands of nearby streets, however, small effects add
up. Over the eight months of the intervention, our best estimate is that treatment increased
the total number of crimes reported in the city by about 1,000, or 2.6%. A 90% confidence
interval includes zero, and so this should not be taken as strong evidence of adverse effects.
Even so, our results rule out more than a 1–2% improvement in city-wide crime.
    Importantly, in our main specification it is property crime, as opposed to violent crime,
that is displaced. If we add our estimates of crimes directly deterred on treated streets to
crimes displaced, reported property crimes rise by 1,384 over the eight months, significant
at the 90% level. By the same method, violent crimes fall 369, including a 7% decline in
homicides and sexual assaults (86 over eight months), though not statistically significant.
    Displacement of property crime and deterrence of violent crime is consistent with stan-
dard economic models of crime: increasing the risk of detection stops criminals from com-
mitting motivated crimes in that specific place, but most likely the crime is not deterred
and rather committed elsewhere. But crimes of passion, once avoided, may be less likely to
sustain their motive and be displaced.
    As we discussed, the evidence from US cities has tended not to find many adverse
spillovers, at least within a 1–2 block radius. But several recent, large-scale, non-US stud-
ies tell similar stories to Bogotá. For example, a large-scale trial of intensive policing in
another Colombian city, Medellin, draws similar conclusions—small direct effects and no ev-


                                               6
idence of beneficial spillovers, with wide confidence intervals for aggregate effects including
the possibility of adverse spillovers (Collazos et al., 2018). In Mexico, Dell (2015) finds that
drug trafficking, a crime with extremely strong and sustained motives, displaces to nearby
municipalities in response to increased enforcement. Drunk driving is another criminal be-
havior that, once underway, may be impossible to deter. A recent large-scale experiment
of drunk driving checkpoints in India shows displacement as drunk drivers take alternate
routes (Banerjee et al., 2017).
    Finally, this study offers a chance to demonstrate advances in accounting for spatial
spillovers. First, economists have tended to impose a fair degree of structure on spillovers.
Where the nature of spillovers is unknown, however, a more flexible design-based approach is
more appropriate (Gerber and Green, 2012; Aronow and Samii, 2013; Vazquez-Bare, 2017).
Second, standard methods overstate precision when the spillovers lead to fuzzy clusters.
Randomization inference, seldom used in economics, provides valid hypothesis tests.
    As more interventions go to scale in close proximity, these econometric approaches to
place-based program evaluation and hard-to-model spillovers will only grow in importance.
These problems and solutions are applicable to a variety of issues beyond crime. Many
urban programs are both place-based and vulnerable to spillovers. This includes efforts to
improve traffic flow, beautify blighted streets and properties, foster community mobilization,
and rezone land use. The same challenges could arise with experiments in social and family
networks (Abadie et al., 2016; Vazquez-Bare, 2017). Experiments in dense interrelated net-
works present a textbook case of where design-based and randomization inference needs to
enter the econometric program evaluation toolkit.


2      Setting
Crime is one of the most pressing social problems in Bogotá, a middle income city of roughly
8 million people.13 In the 1990s Bogotá was one of the most violent cities in the world, with
81 murders per 100,000 people. By 2016 the figure had fallen to 15.6, comparable to a large
US city such as Chicago.14
   The nature of Bogotá’s crime varies, from pickpocketing and cell phone theft in busy
commercial areas, to burglary of businesses and homes, to drug sales and any resulting
  13
     Bogotá had a 2015 GDP per capita of roughly $22,000 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. 10% of
the population was below the national poverty line for metropolitan areas of PPP$6 a day.
  14
     This is much lower than the most violent cities in the world, such as 120 in Caracas, 65 in Cape Town,
64 in Detroit, and 64 in Cali, Colombia. It is comparable in crime rates to a U.S. city like Chicago, with 15
murders per 100,000 in 2015, but greater than the 7 recorded in Los Angeles or 4 in New York. U.S. figures
come from the FBI Uniform Crime Report and others from the World Atlas.



                                                     7
violence. Most violent crimes appear to be crimes of passion. The Mayor’s office estimates
that 81% of all the homicides in the city in 2015 were a result of fights, 12% were contract
killings, and 5% were violent robberies. Finally, most offenders are individual young people.
There are some semi-organized youth gangs, and some organized crime, but they do not
seem to be responsible for the vast majority of the street crime or violence.
    Like many cities, crime in Bogotá is also fairly concentrated. According to official crime
statistics, from 2012 to 2015 just 2% of the city’s 136,984 street segments accounted for
all murders as well as a quarter of all other reported crimes. These higher-crime streets
are distributed around the city. They include wealthy areas where criminals come to mug
pedestrians, burgle homes, or steal expensive cars, as well as more barren industrial areas
with little traffic, where it is easier to sell drugs or steal. They also include popular nightlife
areas.

Security policy and policing Bogotá has moderate to low levels of police compared to
large US and Latin American cities. Bogotá has about 18,000 police officers in operational
activities, including about 6,200 patrol agents. We estimate about 239 police per 10,000
people. The Colombian average is 350, and most cities are above Bogotá’s ratio. The
national US ratio was 230 in 2013 but it is greater in large cities, including 413 in New York,
444 in Chicago, 611 in Washington, or 257 in Los Angeles.15
    We discreetly observed police patrols and qualitatively interviewed residents on 100 of
the treated streets, as described below. Our assessment is that patrols are reasonably well-
regarded. The broader police force is not without problems, but street patrol officers are
generally regarded as competent and non-corrupt. If anything, residents complained that
officers were not present often enough. A survey of 24,000 residents, also discussed below,
confirms these impressions of police patrols.
    In January 2016 a new mayor came to power, Enrique Peñalosa. Crime reduction and
increasing trust in government were central to his platform. In his first 100 days, the Mayor
pledged to dedicate more municipal services and law enforcement in 750 high-crime street
segments.
    Municipal services included trash collection, tree pruning, graffiti clean-up, and streetlight
maintenance. The performing agencies report directly to the Mayor’s office, but the Mayor’s
power is limited by contracts and difficulties in monitoring and enforcing instructions.
    When it comes to the police, the Mayor’s office can influence tactics, force allocations,
and equipment, but has little say in total force size. City police forces in Colombia are a

Department of Justice Statistics, and other data is from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

branch of the National Police and report up to the Minister of Defense. But the city has
the power of the purse, as it pays for police equipment. The Colombian Constitution also
calls on police to comply with the Mayors’ requests and policies. Changes in force levels are
much more expensive, however, and the national government rejected the Mayor’s request to
increase the number of police. Thus the Mayor’s office focused on increasing police efficiency
and quality, especially street patrols.

Police patrolling The quadrant (cuadrante) is the basic patrolling unit. Bogotá has 19
urban police stations. Stations are divided into CAIs—Comando de Atención Inmediata—a
small local police base that coordinates patrol agents and takes civilian calls. Each CAI has
about 10 quadrants. There are 1,051 quadrants, each with 130 street segments on average.
    Each quadrant has six permanent patrol officers. They patrol in pairs, on motorbike and
foot, in three shifts of eight hours each. In practice, patrols are expected to move about
throughout their shift, by motorbike. They may patrol a street on motorbike or dismount
to speak to shopkeepers, passersby, and suspicious people.
    Patrols carry a handheld computer that allows them to check a person’s identification
number for outstanding warrants. Patrols have daily quotas. They are expected to regularly
stop and frisk any suspicious people, and will seize illegal weapons (usually knives) and
other contraband. Patrols tend to focus interrogations on young men. An arrest means both
patrollers must take the suspect to the station, for hours of paperwork and processing. This
keeps them from meeting performance goals, and so patrols may avoid minor arrests.
    The handheld computer also contains a global positioning system (GPS) chip that records
the patrol’s location roughly every 30 seconds (when operational). The city first piloted and
introduced the system in late 2015, under the previous Mayor. The new system lets station
commanders view patrol positions in real time and get regular performance statistics. Thus
the study period is a period of increased monitoring and measurement of patrol activity.


3    Interventions
In January 2016, a new city government came to power. A key plank of the Mayor’s election
platform was to identify the highest crime streets in the city and target them with a greater
share of normal city services, especially police patrols and municipal services. We can view
both interventions as an intensification of normal service delivery.
    No new funds or personnel were added, and so this is effectively a randomized reallocation
of city services. We are not concerned that control streets received materially fewer services
as a result of the experiment. Treated streets are roughly 1% of all city streets, so increased


                                              9
attention to treated streets has only a tiny effect on control and non-experimental streets,
on average.

Intensive policing Prior to the intervention, from 2012–15, normal police patrols spent
roughly 10% of their time on the 2% highest-crime streets. Thus higher-crime streets already
received a disproportionate amount of police attention. Nonetheless, these same streets
recorded a quarter of all reported crimes in the city. Thus the intervention aimed to increase
police time even further, in proportion to the crime they represented.
    This intensive policing began on February 9, 2016 and ended on October 14, 2016.16
It generally meant almost doubling police patrol time. As we will see below, during the
intervention control streets received roughly 92 minutes of patrol time on average, with
treated streets receiving an additional 77 minutes—an 84% increase.17
    In order not to overextend patrols, the police required us to assign no more than two
segments to treatment per quadrant so as not to distort regular duties too much. A 77-minute
increase on two segments implied that patrol time fell on other segments in the quadrant by
roughly one minute each. Thus we do not expect the reallocation to be a significant source
of differential crime in treated, control, and nonexperimental streets.
    Commanders told patrols to visit treatment segments at least 6 times per day for roughly
15 minutes each, mostly during the day unless near a bar. The police generally did not know
what segments were in the control group, but in principle they could make reliable guesses.
Commanders instructed patrols to continue their normal duties in treated segments: running
criminal record checks; stopping, questioning, and frisking suspicious people; door-to-door
visits to the community; conducting arrests or drug seizures; and so forth.18

Municipal services One city office coordinates street light maintenance and a second
office is in charge of all clean-up activities. Both offices contract private companies to service
  16
     The government, however, did not publicize the eligible high-crime streets, the existence of an experi-
mental design, or which specific streets were being targeted. The Mayor’s office initially planned to run this
intensive policing intervention for at least 4 to 6 months. They extended the intervention in part to permit
the research team enough time to fund and conduct a survey of citizens.
  17
     Before the intervention, 1–2 weeks of GPS data suggested that experimental sample of streets received
at least 38 minutes of patrol time per day. It is doubtful that actual time rose from 38 to 92 minutes.
Rather, the 38 minutes is probably an understatement of average patrolling time per street, as there were
fewer patrols with GPS devices patrolling city streets. The police did not have data on pre-intervention
patrol times, since the GPS devices were piloted November 2015 through January 2016. See Appendix B.1.
  18
     The only exception was in three streets known as “The Bronx.” Early in our intervention period, the
police and city invaded and cleared the three streets. This was a much more intensive, one-time intervention.
Two of the three streets happened to be assigned to treatment and one had been assigned to the control
group. Police cleared the streets and the city demolished the buildings. In this extreme case, it is obvious
that more policing can reduce crime.



                                                     10
the streets. Contractors were expected to perform their usual duties, but the Mayor’s office
gave contractors lists of segments where they were asked to assess issues and deliver the
appropriate services. The municipal services intervention began April 11, 2016 and continued
until the end of the intensive policing intervention.

How do the Bogotá interventions compare to other interventions? Many of the
US studies examine a change in policing approach rather than simply a change in intensity.
These changes in approach vary widely. Some interventions take a “zero tolerance” approach,
enforcing the most minor infractions. Others focus on “problem-oriented policing,” where
officers try to proactively address problems identified jointly with communities. Others place
license plate readers on street corners, or crack down on drug corners and houses. The “hot
spots” literature is, in short, a mixed bag of interventions that may or may not be directly
comparable.
    The Bogotá intervention is similar in style and approach to two US interventions that
intensify patrol time but maintain normal duties, such as a Minneapolis study that raised
patrol time to 3 hours per day on 55 hot spots (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995), a Jacksonville
study where officers surveilled 78 hot spots for an additional 1–2 hours per day (Taylor et al.,
2011). The rotation of 15-minute police patrols mirrors an intervention in Sacramento (Telep
et al., 2014). Another example is an unpublished Medellín hot spots policing program, where
384 crime hot spots were treated with between 50 and 70 minutes of additional daily police
patrolling time during six months in 2015 (Collazos et al., 2018).19


4      Experimental sample and design
4.1     Selecting the experimental sample
Figure 1 maps Bogotá’s 136,984 street segments and indicates the 1,919 segments in our
experimental sample.
    To create this sample, the city started with the 2% highest-crime segments, using an index
of reported crimes from geo-coded official statistics, between January 2012 and September
2015.20 The city then asked each station’s commanders and staff to verify the high-crime
  19
     This Medellín study does not observe direct treatment effects on both property and violent crimes,
although they do find evidence of a decrease in a particular form of crime: car thefts. They also find a
decrease in car thefts in places nearby targeted segments. The context has some differences as well. For
instance, while Medellín has about 60% more police per capita than Bogotá, the city also has highly organized
criminal gang structures throughout the city, and police in these low and middle income neighborhoods may
not be effective in deterring gang-associated crime because of the local power and influence of these groups.
  20
     We constructed a geo-fence of 40m around each segment and assigned a reported crime to that segment

segments. They did this partly because the geo-located crimes data were thought to con-
tain errors (such as crimes assigned to the wrong street). Also, the official crime data are
incomplete, omitting most unreported petty crimes and disorder. Calls or informal reports
to police do not show up in official statistics, for instance, and police do not record crimes
they observe or which people report informally.
    Based on their knowledge, the police eliminated about a third of these segments, adding
others in their stead, leaving 1,919 segments that account for 21% of the city’s reported
crimes.21 As we discuss below, this led to an experimental sample with varying levels of
crime, from low to acute. We will account for this in our analysis by looking at treatment
effects in the highest reported crime streets, and also by attempting to measure smaller
crimes and security perceptions with a citizen survey.


4.2     Design-based approach
We did not know the range of spatial spillovers, and so we pre-specified a flexible design that
tested for spillovers in radii of 250m and 500m around treated streets.22
    Failing to account for spillovers properly will bias treatment effect estimates. If control
segments are close enough to treated segments to experience displacement or diffusion, then
spillovers violate the standard assumption of “no interference between units.” Previous
studies have generally ignored the possibility of interference between treatment and control
segments, and focused instead on the spillovers into nearby non-experimental segments. This
is reasonable in small samples where hot spots are widely dispersed and the spillover regions
do not overlap. But interference between units grows large as we scale up to hundreds of
treated hot spots in a city. The same would be true of any intervention in a spatial or social
network. This is a growing source of experimental work.
    There are many ways to model spillovers. In economics it is common to use a continuous
rate of decay. We will show the results of different continuous functions, but we felt that this
imposed too much structure on the nature of spillovers. After all, crime might more easily
displace to an opportune segment a few hundred meters away rather than the next street
over. The existing literature on hot spots policing has focused mainly on catchment areas
whenever it fell within its geo-fence. Appendix B.1 reports further details. A calculation error meant that
608 segments outside the top 2% were included in this initial sample. These were generally high crime
segments, as 90% of those streets were above the 95th percentile of baseline crime, and all were above the
75th percentile. In retrospect, this error proved useful since it gave us more variation in baseline crime levels,
which we use to study treatment heterogeneity.
  21
     Homicides are recorded by police. For any other crime to be included in the database, victims had to
travel to one of 19 police stations, file a formal report, and include relevant details such as location. Our
endline survey (discussed below) suggests that official statistics record only about a fifth of all crimes.

of about 1–2 blocks or about 100–150m.23 We felt this radius could be too narrow, however,
and opted for something more flexible.
    Our preferred and pre-specified approach partitioned control segments into one of three
experimental conditions according to their distance from the treated segment: <250m,
250–500m, and >500m. Figure 2 illustrates this partition, ignoring municipal services for
simplicity. The segment at the center of the two radii was assigned to the intensive policing
treatment. Nearby segments are classified by their distance to the treated segment.
    This approach makes the estimation of treatment and spillover effects fairly simple: it is
simply a matter of comparing weighted means of crime levels across these different treatment
conditions. For instance, consider the case where we believe that spillovers do not extend
beyond 250m. Then direct treatment effects are simply the difference in crime between
directly treated segments and the subset of control segments more than 250m away from
treated ones. Spillovers within the experimental sample are simply the difference between

crime in segments 0–250m from a treated segment and those more than 250m away. We
calculate spillovers into the non-experimental sample similarly. As we explain below, the
density of treatment introduces some bias and hard-to-model clustering that requires addi-
tional corrections, but the basic principle of comparing means across treatment conditions
is the core of our design.
    Our approach ignores the possibility of spillovers beyond 500m, as well as non-spatial
spillovers. Some crime is undoubtedly displaced in non-Euclidean ways (e.g., to possibly
distant segments where the benefits of crime are high and the risk of detection is low).24
Within the 500m radius, we also need a pre-specified rule for deciding whether to use the
250m or 500m radius for spillovers. We discuss this below.


4.3     Randomization procedures, design, and balance
We used a two-stage randomization procedure to maximize the spread between segments
assigned to each experimental condition. This ensured as many segments as possible had
a high probability of assignment to the 250–500m and >500m conditions. We first blocked
our sample by the 19 police stations, then randomized segments to intensive policing in two
stages: first assigning quadrants to treatment or control, then assigning segments within
treatment quadrants. We assigned no more than two segments per quadrant to intensive
policing. This procedure assigned 756 segments to intensive policing and 1,163 to control.25
    In March 2016, we selected streets for municipal services. We sent enumerators to take
five photographs and rate segments for the presence of disorder.26 Of the 1,534 segments
they were able to safely visit, 70% had at least one maintenance issue. We made these, plus
the 385 segments they could not visit safely, eligible for municipal services assignment. We
blocked on police station and the previous intensive policing assignment, and assigned 201
segments (14% of eligible segments) to municipal services.27
  24
     Ferraz et al. (2016) find evidence of non-spatial spillovers in Rio de Janeiro’s favela pacification. We
expect these non-spatial spillovers could lead us to overstate direct treatment effects and understate total
spillovers.
  25
     Within each station we took all quadrants with at least one segment and randomized quadrants to
treatment with 0.6 probability. We then used complete randomization to assign eligible segments to treatment
within treatment quadrants.
  26
     They looked for graffiti, garbage, and run-down buildings. A limitation is that we measured disorder
after two months of policing treatment. We had no reason to expect the treatment to affect physical disorder,
and there is no statistically significant difference between experimental and non-experimental segment.
  27
     These 201 were the first “batch” to be treated. We also randomized a second batch of 214 segments
for later treatment should the city decide to expand services. Two months into treatment of the first batch,
however, our analysis of compliance records and visual inspection of segments suggested that continued
municipal services were needed to maintain order in the first batch, and so the city did not give contractors
the list of segments in the second batch. Thus the second batch remains in our control group.

are <250m to intensive policing or municipal services segments or not.



    Table 1 summarizes how the 1,919 experimental segments are distributed across 20 treat-
ment conditions and potential outcomes—4◊5 conditions tied to the four conditions for each
intervention (treatment, <250m, 250-500m, and pure control) plus the ineligible category of
streets that we deemed were in no need of municipal services.28
    As described above, we can calculate treatment and spillover effects by comparing crime
across these treatment conditions. Moreover, in the event we do not find any evidence
of spillovers beyond 250m (as expected, and as demonstrated below) this design and pre-
specified rules allow us to combine the 250-500m and >500m conditions into a single “control”
condition, hence reducing the number of comparisons we make.
    Table 2 reports summary statistics for the experimental sample. In October 2016, the
police updated all 2012–16 crime data with more accurate GPS coordinates and additional
crime categories, and we report both the original and updated data.29 Experimental segments
had between 0 and 82 crimes reported in the previous four years (461 with the updated data
as we had information on more crime types), with an average of 5 reported crimes per
segment.30 More than half were property crimes, but violent crimes such as murders and
assaults were also important. 95% of segments had relatively low levels of physical disorder
such as garbage. We will return to crime levels in the following section, when we consider
the survey data on unreported crimes.
    Random assignment produced the expected degree of balance along covariates. Table 2
reports the weighted means for a selection of baseline covariates, by experimental assignment,
for experimental and non-experimental segments. For the most part, background attributes
  28
     Technically there are 3 ◊ 4 “ineligible” conditions, since streets that were diagnosed as having no need
for municipal services could be <250m, 250–500m, or >500m from either treatment.
  29
     Some crimes moved to nearby segments, and the correlation between the old and new data is 0.35 at
the segment level and 0.86 at the quadrant level. These corrections were unrelated to this study.
  30
     Quadrants with at least one segment had an average of 3.5 reported crimes per segment across the whole
quadrant, while the average quadrant in the whole city reported 1.5 crimes.

Notes: Columns 1–4 display the summary statistics for our sample of 1,919 hotspots, weighted by the probability of being in

least squares.

appear balanced across experimental conditions. There are some minor differences between
treatment and control segments (for instance, treated segments are slightly less likely to be
in industrial zones), but overall the imbalance is consistent with chance and is robust to
alternative balance tests.31


4.4     Procedure for determining the relevant spillover radii
To determine the relevant spillover radii, we pre-specified a procedure: if there is no evidence
of a statistically significant difference between the 250–500m and >500m regions using a
p < .1 threshold, then we collapse them into a single control condition and the spillover
condition will include streets <250m from treated segments only. Furthermore, if there is
no statistically significant difference between streets in the <250m and the >250m control
region using a p < .1 threshold, then we ignore spillovers altogether (i.e. ignore the partition
of control streets into various conditions) and estimate the — coefficients alone in a simple
treatment-control comparison.32


4.5     Estimation
With this design, we can estimate any treatment effect by comparing weighted average
crime levels across the experimental conditions in Table 1. We use regression estimators
to control for possible confounders, but the estimated treatment coefficients have the same
interpretation—as mean differences. The regression specification is:

 Ysqp = —1 Psqp +—2 M sqp +—3 (P ◊M )sqp +⁄1 Ssqp
                                              P
                                                  +⁄2 Ssqp
                                                       M
                                                           +⁄3 (S P ◊S M )sqp +“p + Xsqp +‘sqp (1)
  31
      To see whether covariate imbalance lies within the expected range, we test the null hypothesis that
the covariates do not jointly predict experimental assignment. We use multinomial logistic regression with
randomization inference to model the four-category experimental assignments for segments in the experi-
mental sample (treatment, <250m, 250-500m and >500m), or the three-category assignments for streets in
the non-experimental sample (<250m, 250-500m and >500m). To obtain exact p-values, we use random-
ization inference. Using simulated random assignments, we obtain a reference distribution of log-likelihood
statistics under the null hypothesis; we then calculate the p-value by locating the actual log-likelihood value
within this reference distribution. The p-value is non-significant, as expected, for both the experimental and
non-experimental samples: p = 0.681 for segments and p = 0.531 for non-experimental segments. We draw
similar conclusions from tests of treated vs control units >250m away and between control units <250m and
>250 away.
   32
      In retrospect, this pre-specified rule was too permissive. First, it was based on spillovers in the exper-
imental sample rather than the much larger non-experimental sample. Second, this rule could lead us to
ignore imprecisely-estimated spillovers with a p > .1 that are nonetheless large enough to offset any direct
treatment effects. As we will see, this is not an issue in our case. The spillovers within 250m are economically
significant in that they can more than outweigh the direct treatment effects, and some tests suggests they
are significant at almost exactly the p = .1 level. In accordance with the pre-specified rule we account for
these important spillovers. Nonetheless, slight changes could have compelled us to ignore spillovers in our
main specifications. Hence in future, rules for flexible spillovers may want to be more permissive.


                                                      18
where Y is the outcome in segment s, quadrant q and police station p; P is an indicator
for assignment to intensive policing; M is an indicator for assignment to municipal services;
S P and S M are indicators for the relevant spillover region (either <250m or <500m from
treatment, or a vector of both indicators); “ is a vector of police station fixed effects (our ran-
domization strata); and X is a matrix of pre-specified baseline control variables.33 Weights
are the inverse probability weights (IPWs) of assignment to each experimental condition.
    Whereas equation 1 estimates spillovers only within the experimental sample of 1,919,
we can take advantage of the fact that tens of thousands of additional streets neighbor our
treated segments, and estimate spillovers on the full range of streets by pooling the experi-
mental and nonexperimental samples to run the following weighted least squares regression:



  Ysqp = —1P Psqp + —2P Msqp +—3P (P ◊ M )sqp + ⁄P1 Ssqp
                                                     P
                                                         + ⁄P2 Ssqp
                                                                M


                          + ⁄P3 (S P ◊ S M )sqp + · Esqp + “pP +       P
                                                                           Xsqp + ” P (E ◊ X)sqp + ‘Psqp (2)

where Esqp is an indicator variable that takes the value of one for experimental street seg-
ments. For example, 77,848 nonexperimental segments lie within 250m of one of the 1,919
streets in the experimental sample, significantly improving power. Just as we partition
the experimental control group into spillover and pure control conditions, we partition the
nonexperimental sample in the same way. This pooled sample constrains the estimated ⁄
coefficients to be the same for all spillover segments, regardless of whether they are in the
experimental or nonexperimental sample.34 This is our preferred estimation approach in the
paper, with alternatives presented in the appendix.35
    Each of these regressions preserve the comparison of means across treatment conditions.
  33
     We selected these covariates by their ability to predict baseline crime levels. X also includes an indicator
for segments ineligible for municipal services treatment by virtue of their baseline disorder.
  34
     If, however, we do not want to pool the samples, it is possible to calculate nonexperimental spillovers
through the weighted least squares regression on the 62,824 segments alone:

                    Ysqp = ⁄N
                            1 Ssqp + ⁄2 Ssqp + ⁄3 (S ◊ S )sqp + “p +
                               P      N M       N   P   M        N             N
                                                                                   Xsqp + ‘N
                                                                                           sqp

using IPW for assignment to the conditions S P and S M .
  35
     This estimation strategy represents a slight departure from the pre-analysis plan. The plan indicated
that we would first and foremost focus on pairwise comparisons of each intervention separately, dropping from
the regression any segments with a zero probability of assignment to any of the conditions. That approach
generates similar results but, in retrospect, is problematic. Most importantly, a pairwise comparison of
streets that did and did not receive intensive policing (ignoring municipal services treatment) would be
biased since assignment to municipal services is slightly imbalanced across intensive policing experimental
conditions (see Table 2). Hence we must estimate the effects of both interventions jointly. In addition, our
original approach required us to drop an increasing number of segments from the regression, especially when
estimating the interaction, rather than using the full sample. Equations (1) and (2) maintain the spirit of
the original estimation approach but correct for these problems.


                                                       19
In equations 1 and 2, the omitted condition is the control segments beyond a radius of
either 250m or 500m, following the pre-specified rule above. The coefficients on treated and
spillover conditions estimate crime differences relative to the control segments. In particular,
—1 and —2 estimate the marginal intent-to-treat (ITT) effects of each treatment alone and
—3 estimates the marginal effect of receiving both. A negative sign on —3 implies positive
interactions or increasing returns. The effect of receiving both interventions is the sum,
—1 + —2 + —3 .36

Why use inverse probability weights? Spillovers introduce spuriousness that can be
corrected with IPWs. Experimental segments close to other experimental segments, such as
those in the city center or other dense areas, will be assigned to the spillover condition in
most randomizations. These streets may have unobservable characteristics that are associ-
ated with high levels of crime. This could mechanically lead us to conclude that there are
adverse spillovers. Controlling for baseline characteristics and crime histories reduces but
does not eliminate the potential bias. With IPWs, outcomes for the segments assigned to
any given condition are weighted by the inverse of the probability of assignment to that con-
dition.37 These weights ensure that all segments have the same probability of being exposed
to spillovers. As we will see, with baseline controls, the IPW correction does not make a
major difference to our estimates. Nonetheless we include them for propriety’s sake.


4.6     Alternative spillover estimation with continuous decay
Instead of partitioning control segments into bands, we could have assumed that spillovers
follow a continuous, monotonic spatial decay function, and estimate direct and spillover
effects with the following OLS regression:
  36
      Because some streets were not eligible for municipal services, the sum of the three — estimates is not the
exact estimate of receiving both interventions. However, the difference is trivial and we opt for this estimation
of combined effects for simplicity. Since every street is not eligible for all three treatment combinations
(because of the eligibility for the municipal services treatment), when we add up the three — coefficients,
we are pooling effects over different subgroups whose effects could be heterogeneous. This implies we are
effectively constraining the ITTs to be the same for the same treatment condition across eligibility strata.
Since we control for these eligibility strata, we ensure we are not confounding treatments with unobservables.
These controls come in the form of IPWs for the treatments and the dummy for the eligibility strata included
in X. In any case, since we do not find strong evidence of treatment effects, there should be less concern on
the presence of heterogeneous effects over the different subgroups.
   37
      Each segment’s probability of exposure to <250m or 250-500m spillovers can be estimated with high
precision by simulating the randomization procedure a large number of times. Such IPWs have a long history
in survey sampling and have become common in the analysis of randomized trials with varying probabilities
of assignment (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952; Gerber and Green, 2012). Appendix B.2 describes and maps
IPWs in our sample.

where f (dsqp,t ) is a spatial decay function with a standardized distribution. This function is a
weighted sum of distances to all treated segments, where t enumerates treated segments and
TP and TM are the set of all treated segments with intensive policing and municipal services,
respectively. Treated segments receive no spillover from themselves but can receive spillovers
from other treated segments. Applied to the non-experimental sample, the regression omits
direct treatment effects.
    We consider an exponential decay function, f (dsqp,t ) = 1/(edsqp,t ), as well as a simple
inverse linear decay. We can no longer employ IPWs to weight street segments because the
exposure measures are continuous variables. Instead, we include in the control vector the
expected spillover intensities (averaged across 1,000 simulated random assignments) and the
probabilities of being treated by each intervention. We calculate statistical significance using
randomization inference.38


4.7       Why randomization inference?
Randomization inference (RI) gives precise p-values based on the empirical distribution of
all estimated treatment effects that could arise under our design and data under the null
hypothesis of no effect for any unit. RI reassigns treatment randomly thousands of times,
each time estimating the treatment effect that could have arisen by chance from that com-
parison. Figure 3 displays the empirical distributions of estimated direct treatment effects
for intensive policing under three variants of the estimating equation in (1): the simple no-
spillovers case (i.e. SsP = SsM = 0 for all s); the case where S P and S M indicate spillovers
within 250m only; and the case where S P and S M indicate spillovers within 500m.
    Most importantly, the distribution widens when accounting for spillovers. The no-
spillovers case has the narrowest distribution. The distribution widens as we account for
wider spillover regions. That is, we are more likely to get large treatment effects by chance.
    This widening of the sampling distributions follows from two facts. One is that we are
losing data as we pare off rings of spillovers. The second is that the control region shrinks
dramatically and begins to exclude high-crime regions of the city. Experimental segments
that are close to other experimental segments are assigned to the spillover condition in
most randomizations, creating patterns of “fuzzy clustering” (Abadie et al., 2016). These
  38
    For each of 1,000 simulated random assignments we obtain a simulated ATE. The standard deviation
from this empirical distribution of ATEs is the standard error of the estimates.

simulate the randomization procedure 1,000 times and estimate treatment effects for each randomization using post-treatment
data under the sharp null of no treatment effect for any unit. The figures show distributions for three cases of equation (1):
the simple treatment-control comparison with no spillovers (i.e. SsP = SsM = 0 for all s); the case where S P and S M indicate
proximal spillovers within 250m; and the case where S P and S M indicate the larger spillover area within 500m.



clusters are difficult to model because they have to do with distance from other experimental
segments rather than an observed characteristic such as a quadrant.
    We can see the fuzzy clustering in Figure 4, which illustrates for each segment the pro-
portion of segments within 500m that are assigned to the same experimental condition,
including the spillover conditions. For instance, for intensive policing, most segments in the
dense city center (the middle right of the map) have neighbors with the same high probabil-
ity of assignment to the <250m spillover condition. For municipal services, there are large
swathes of the city with a high probability of assignment to the control condition, forming a
cluster that does not conform to administrative boundaries. The figures imply that, instead
of having thousands of independent segments, we actually have dozens of clusters. But there
is no geographic marker for them.
    Finally, the simulations in Figure 3 show that the distributions of simulated treatment
effects with spillovers are not centered at zero. Equations (1) and (2) can lead to a small level
of bias in estimated coefficients, even when using IPWs. Clustered assignment introduces
bias when there are clusters of unequal size, and when cluster size is correlated with potential
outcomes. When we ignore spillovers, we stipulate that there is no such clustering, which

                                                                        22

policing (left) and municipal services (right).

is why that distribution is centered at zero. When we allow for spillovers, we confront the
fact that our exposure to spillovers is clustered. The bias disappears as the number of
clusters increases (and indeed it is negligible when we estimate non-experimental spillovers).
Unfortunately, the spillover effects we estimate will often be subtle, and so the bias is fairly
large in comparison to some of the direct average treatment effects.
    What RI allows us to do is to assign a p-value for a given treatment effect by observing
where that treatment effect falls in the distribution of all possible estimated effects from
the 10,000 randomizations. We use these RI p-values in place of the conventional standard
errors-based p-values whenever we estimate treatment effects in the presence of spillovers.
Additionally, the simulations used in the RI procedure provide an estimate of the bias. All of
our tables report bias-corrected treatment effects. Appendix B.2 reports the specific biases
estimated.


5      Data
We draw on six main sources of data.

    1. Administrative data on police and municipal services compliance. The police shared the
       full database of GPS patrol locations for all 136,984 streets, 2015–17.39 City agencies
       also shared reports on their diagnosis of each street and compliance with treatment for
       all streets assigned to the municipal services treatment.

    2. Officially reported crimes and calls for service. Police shared data on reported crimes
       and operations 2012–17, geolocated to 136,984 streets.40

    3. Crime survey of 24,000 Bogotá residents. We complemented administrative data with
       a survey for three reasons. First, as we will see below, a majority of crime and nuisances
       go unreported. This is one reason that police identified as “hot” many streets that had
  39
     Not all handheld computers were functional at all times, and at times over 2016 the system went offline
for a few days to a few weeks, and so we use data only during those periods when the system was generally
operational in a given police station—on average 33 of the 37 weeks of the intervention.
  40
     Prior to the intervention, we received the 2012–2015 data on the city’s priority crimes: homicides,
assaults, robberies, and car and motorbike theft. 77% of the crimes had exact coordinates and the rest
had the address, which we geolocated ourselves, with about 71% success (or 93% of all reported crimes).
We also received all data on arrests; gun, drugs and merchandise seizures; and stolen cars and motorbikes
recovered. In October 2016 the police provided updated data that corrected for geolocation problems (thus
retrospectively changing pre-intervention data). With the new information we also received data on reported
cases of burglary, shoplifting, sexual assaults, family violence, threats, extortion and kidnapping. Some U.S.
studies use emergency call data. Initially these were not available, and our pre-analysis plan excluded them.
Later, partially complete data became unexpectedly available, and our main results are robust to their
inclusion (not shown).


                                                     24
       no officially reported crimes. Second, we were concerned that treatment could increase
       crime reports, thus inflating our treatment effects, and wanted to be able to test this
       concern. Third, we wanted to measure outcomes such as citizen trust in the state and
       police.
       In October 2016 we surveyed approximately 10 people per street segment on 2,399 seg-
       ments—the 1,919 in the experimental sample, plus a representative sample of 480 non-
       experimental segments. We interviewed a convenience sample and average responses
       over each segment. The survey collected outcomes such as: perceptions of security
       risks; perceived incidence of crimes; crimes personally experienced; crime reporting;
       and trust in and perceived legitimacy of the police and the Mayor’s office.

   4. Survey of street disorder. To measure levels of street disorder before and after treat-
      ment, we sent enumerators to take photographs and rate the presence of graffiti,
      garbage, and boarded-up buildings on a 0–5 scale.41

   5. Administrative data on pre-treatment street characteristics. The city also shared data
      on pre-treatment street characteristics: urban density, income level (high, medium,
      low), economic use (housing, services, industry), presence of public surveillance cam-
      eras, and distance to the closest police station, commercial area, school, religious center,
      health center, transport station, or other public services as justice.

   6. Qualitative interviews. We began with informal qualitative interviews with dozens of
      police officers and citizens about their experiences with the intervention and police
      tactics in general. We also hired observers to discreetly visit 100 streets in the experi-
      mental sample for a day and passively observe police behavior. They also interviewed
      citizens in each segment about police behavior and attitudes.


5.1     Outcomes
To simplify our analysis and deal with the problem of multiple comparisons, our pre-analysis
plan distinguished primary from secondary outcomes, and pooled like measures into summary
  41
     We visited 1,534 of a total of 1,919 scheduled streets in March (three months before the municipal
services intervention began) in order to narrow down the number of eligible experimental segments. We did
not collect data in the remaining 385 streets because of security concerns from the enumerators. (Note that
there was no association between intensive policing treatment and these security concerns.) As we discuss
in section 4.3, 1,459 were eligible for the municipal services interventions and 414 of them were assigned to
treatment. Those streets were split in two batches of 201 and 213 streets respectively in order to randomize
timing, but only the first batch was effectively treated. Then, in order to assess the levels of compliance,
we sent enumerators to the 414 streets in the first and second batches in June (one to two weeks after
municipal services started to be delivered) and December (two months after the end of the intervention).
Again, because of security concerns of the enumerators, we visited 409 in June and 410 in December.


                                                     25
indices to reduce the number of hypotheses tested (following Kling et al. 2007).
    Our primary outcome is crime. To measure aggregate and spillover effects, there is
only one measure available for all streets: officially reported crimes on the segment. But
to measure direct effects, we prespecified two insecurity measures (one of which includes
officially reported crimes):

   1. Perceived risk of crime and violence on the segment. Our citizen survey asked respon-
      dents to rate perceived risk on a 4-point scale from “very unsafe” to “very safe” in
      five situations, such as: for a young woman to walk alone after dark on this street; for
      someone to talk on their smartphone on this street; for a young man to walk alone after
      dark on this street; and simply the perceived risk of crime during the day and at dusk.
      We construct an index of perceived risk that takes the average across all respondents
      in the segment. All indexes in the paper are standardized to have mean zero and unit
      standard deviation.

   2. Crime incidence on the segment. We construct a standardized index of crime that
      equally weight: (i) survey respondents’ opinion of the incidence of crime on that seg-
      ment, as well as personal victimization on that segment since the beginning of the
      year;42 and, (ii) officially-reported crime incidents on that segment since the beginning
      of the intervention. We can subdivide all measures into property and violent crimes,
      although our main measure pools all crimes into one index.

We discuss secondary outcomes, particularly the perceived legitimacy of the police and local
government, in Section 7.6 below.


5.2     Insecurity in the experimental and non-experimental samples
Our experimental sample includes a range of segments from moderate to very high levels of
crime. For instance, Figure 5 displays cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for officially
reported crimes in the pre-intervention period 2012–15 (Panel a), and during the 8 months of
the intervention (Panel b). We plot three CDFs per panel: (i) the 135,065 non-experimental
segments; (ii) the 248 experimental segments nominated by the police; and (iii) the 1,671
that were in the top 2% of reported crime.
  42
     The survey measured perceived incidence and personal victimization by walking respondents through a
list of 11 criminal activities. After finding out whether any of these activities happened on the street since
the beginning of the year, we asked respondents about each crime to establish perceived frequency (ranging
from “everyday” to “never” on a 0-6 scale), and whether it happened to the respondent him or herself on
that segment. We show results for the two individual components in order to give a sense of the absolute
impacts and differences between survey and administrative data.

    Table 3 reports means and mean differences between the three samples. By construction,
reported crimes are greatest in the “top 2%” sample and next highest in the police-selected
sample. Reported crimes are lowest in the non-experimental sample, as expected. On
average, streets in the top 2% have about 5 times as many reported crimes as those in
the non-experimental sample.43
    Nonetheless, we can see from the CDFs that a number of police-nominated and even some
top 2% streets have just 0–2 crimes in the pre-intervention period. Also, a small number of
the non-experimental streets have a sizable number of crimes. Why is this so? High-crime
non-experimental streets are simple to explain: the police limited the number of treated
streets to two per quadrant. In high-crime quadrants, this means many relatively high-crime
segments are in the non-experimental sample. To explain the low-crime “top 2%” streets,
above we noted that in 2016 the police issued a more complete and correct version of their
2012–15 geo-located crime data. Some “top 2%” segments had some crimes reclassified away
from them but remain in the sample nonetheless.44
    Remember, however, that none of the experimental streets should be truly “low-crime”,
even if there is no officially reported crime. Local police stations reviewed every candidate for
the experimental sample and threw out those that were low in crime or nuisances. Those with
low levels of reported crime presumably have high levels of unreported crime and nuisances.
    Figure 6 illustrates the difference between actual and officially-reported crimes. For 11
crimes, the survey asked whether or not people had experienced a crime since the beginning
of the year, whether they had attempted to report it, and if they were successful. Homicides
are reported by police if individuals did not report them, so administrative data probably
capture most or even all murders. But for the other 10 crimes, about 27% of the people say
they reported the crime, and an additional 9% of people say they attempted to report the
crime but were unsuccessful. Reporting rates are highest for vehicle theft, because insurance
claims require a report. Otherwise the vast majority of crimes are never reported.45
  43
     Appendix Table C.1 reports summary statistics on a standardized index of each outcome for each of the
4 ◊ 5 experimental conditions, using inverse probability weights for assignment into each of the treatment
conditions.
  44
     Other reasons include the fact that less serious crimes were given less weight in the sample selection,
so that a street with one murder was more likely to enter the experimental sample than one with several
muggings. Finally, a small miscalculation in the sample selection admitted a small number of moderate
crime streets into the “top 2%” sample.
  45
     These survey data also provide an opportunity to test whether people were more likely to report crimes
to the police on treated segments. If so, this would call into question any treatment effects based on reported
crime data. We see no difference in the survey-based likelihood of crime reporting on treated streets. The
survey asked respondents their likelihood of reporting a future crime to the police, on a scale of 0 to 3. The
average response in control segments was 2.0, with a treatment effect [standard error] of 0.016 [.029] from
policing and 0.035 [.032] from municipal services. This suggests that administrative data are suitable for
outcome assessment even while the treatment is being delivered.

                  Figure 6: Proportion of crime reported, by crime (survey-based)




Notes: The figure includes data on all street segments surveyed. Each observation is a survey. The white diamonds denote the
proportion of people that effectively reported a crime out of all victims. The black triangles denote the proportion of people
that tried to report a crime out of all victims.



    Panels c and d of Figure 5 display CDFs for two composite survey measures: an index
of 10 crimes (excluding homicide), where respondents were asked for each crime to rank
their perceived frequency of the crimes on that segment on a 0-6 scale; and for the same
10 crimes an additive index of the number of times each of the 10 respondents personally
experienced one of these crimes in the previous eight months (the treatment period). Because
these are post-treatment measures, we have to take the difference between the samples with
caution. Treatment and spillover effects would likely bias the three samples to be closer to
one another.
    By these metrics, our experimental sample has moderate levels of crime on average. For
instance, 3 in 10 of the people stopped on each of the experimental streets reported a personal
experience of crime on that segment in the previous 8 months. This is a relatively high rate
of victimization. Perceived risk is 10 of 60 on average, stretching as high as 20 or 30 in the
highest crime streets.
    What this means is that only a fraction of our experimental sample is comparable to
what the U.S. literature calls a “hot spot.” This is an unavoidable consequence of scale. As
a result, we should compare effectiveness to other hot spot interventions with caution. An
advantage of the larger and broader sample, however, is that we can estimate the effect of
increased state presence on crime in a mostly normal set of streets. We can then “simulate”

                                                             30
a hot spots intervention by looking at impacts on the subsample of highest crime streets.


6      Program implementation and compliance
The police and municipal services agencies largely complied with treatment assignment.
Police did so for the full eight months, while municipal services agencies likely complied for
a shorter period. Table 4 reports the effects of assignment to each program on various first-
stage outcomes. We estimate equation (1) ignoring interactions between the two treatments
and spillovers, since we have no expectation of either in this first stage.

Patrol time Our main measure of policing is average patrol minutes per day on each
segment. We estimate control streets received 92 minutes of patrolling time per day, on
average. Treated streets received an extra 77 minutes, an 84% increase. By comparison,
non-experimental received an average of 33 minutes of patrolling time per day.46
    Our best assessment is that the increase in patrol time on treated streets did not take
a material amount of time away from control segments, for two reasons. First, there are
130 segments in the average quadrant, and so the 77 minute rise on two segments means
just a minute less time for all other segments. Second, the introduction of the patrol geo-
locators was designed to increase the efficiency and time on the street of patrols, and our
best assessment is that all segments received at least 10–20% more patrol time than the
pre-intervention period.47

Police actions We see no effect of increased policing on arrests or police actions such
as drug seizures. This implies any direct effect of the policing comes from deterring or
displacing criminals rather than incapacitating them. Incapacitation, of course, would reduce
the chance that crimes are displaced.

Services The evidence on service delivery compliance is more mixed. Table 5 summarizes
municipal services compliance. After assigning 201 segments to municipal services, city agen-
cies diagnosed each one in March. They identified 123 segments needing clean-up services,
and 47 needing lighting improvements. They performed the services June through August.
Tree pruning and graffiti cleaning were one-time treatments; rubbish collection was expected
  46
      Naturally, the devices that track patrol locations every 30 seconds periodically malfunction, and occa-
sionally the system has an outage. Thus any estimate of minutes is probably an underestimate, one that is
unlikely to be correlated with treatment.
   47
      The survey asked whether citizens noticed an increase in patrols in the previous 6 months. On control
segments, 13% reported an increase, compared to 21% on treatment segments.

Notes: This table reports intent to treat (ITT) estimates of the effects of the two interventions, via a WLS regression of each
outcome on treatment indicators, police station (block) fixed effects, and baseline covariates (see equation 1, where we have
constrained the coefficient on the interaction term to be zero and ignored spillovers). The regression ignores spillover effects.
Standard errors are clustered using the following rules: (i) for all treated segments except with cluster size 2, each segment is a
cluster; (ii) for all other untreated segments, each segment gets its own cluster identifier; (iii) for entirely untreated quadrants,
they form a cluster; and (iv) for quadrants with exactly 2 units assigned to treatment, those units form a cluster. The proportion
of people reporting increased state presence comes from our citizen survey, the enumerator assessments were collected by the
research team, and the remainder of the outcomes come from police administrative data. * significant at the 10 percent, **
significant at the 5 percent, *** significant at the 1 percent.

to be semi-regular. Based on city data, 74 of the 123 streets (60%) were cleaned up, and in
41 of the 47 streets (87%) they repaired broken lights and replaced poor lights with better
ones. No graffiti was cleaned-up.
    The impacts were not obvious to residents. About 14% of survey respondents on control
segments noticed an improvement in service delivery in the past six months, and this was
only 1.6 percentage points greater in treatment streets (not statistically significant, see Table
4). We also visited segments in daytime in June and December 2016 to photograph and rate
the streets. The before and after photos generally display relatively tidy streets and before-
after differences are imperceptible. It is possible that lights repairs were more evident, but
it was unsafe to visit segments at night. We see no effect of treatment in Table 4. One
possibility is that the extensive margin is the wrong margin to evaluate, and another is that
the disorder in cleaned up segments could have re-accumulated over days or weeks.


7     Program impacts
To assess direct, spillover, and aggregate impacts, we start by estimating program impacts
on officially reported crime using all city streets. We then look more deeply at direct program
effects using the survey and administrative measures of insecurity using only the streets with
survey data.
    In all these analyses, we estimate equation (2) above. Unless otherwise noted, our
spillover condition is limited to streets within 250m of treated segments only. This follows
from our pre-specified rule, as we do not see a statistically significant difference in crime
between streets in the 250–500m and >500m regions, but we do see a difference between
those <250m and >250 away. Appendix C.2 reports this spillover analysis.




                                                              33
7.1     Program impacts on officially reported crime
Table 6 reports estimates of treatment and spillover effects on officially reported crimes. The
table reports impacts with and without the the interaction term between intensive policing
and municipal services.48

Direct treatment effects We see only weak evidence that increases in police patrols and
municipal services reduce crime. If we ignore the interaction between police and municipal
services (columns 1–4 of Table 6), both intensive policing and municipal services reduce
officially reported crimes slightly, but the coefficients are not statistically significant. Control
segments report 0.743 crimes on average over eight months of intervention. Intensive policing
reduced this by -0.099, a 13% improvement.49 Municipal services reduced this by -0.133
crimes, an 18% improvement.
    Once we include the interaction term in our estimating equation (columns 5–8) we see
the largest and most statistically significant impacts in the segments that were assigned to
both interventions. The coefficients on policing and municipal services alone actually switch
signs to point to a slight increase in crime, although both are highly imprecise.
    As a result, we see no evidence that either intervention on its own reduced crime. Rather,
the decreases in crime appear to be concentrated in the segments that received both inter-
ventions. The coefficient on the interaction is -0.53, with an RI p-value of 0.010. The sum
of the three coefficients is -0.423 with a p-value of 0.008 (not reported in the table). This
sum corresponds to a 57% decrease in reported crimes on the 75 streets that received both
interventions.50
  48
     We omit the 57,695 streets with zero probability of assignment to the spillover condition. There are
51,390 non-experimental segments and 705 control segments for the policing intervention and 20,740 non-
experimental segments and 546 control segments for municipal services. Thus even small estimated spillovers
can have a large effect on the total crime estimates.
   We pre-specified a one-tailed test since we had strong priors about the direction of the effect. But signif-
icance levels in the table reflect a two-tailed test to be conservative and consistent throughout. As noted
above (footnote 35) we also pre-specified a pairwise analysis for treatment effects. While this proved to be
an erroneous choice, Appendix B.3 reports those pre-specified pairwise results.
   Appendix C.3 estimates the “unpooled” results on the experimental and non-experimental samples sepa-
rately.
  49
     We can see that these results are not driven by a decrease in patrolling time in control streets by
estimating the marginal effect of one additional hour of patrolling time. The marginal effect of an additional
hour of police patrols is a decrease of about 0.1 crimes. This is similar to the average effect of -0.099, as the
average treatment street received 76 minutes of additional patrolling time. See Appendix C.8 for these IV
estimates.
  50
     Strictly speaking, we cannot simply add the three coefficients because not every street was eligible for
municipal services. Because the estimated impacts of municipal services and both interventions are based on
a subpopulation, it is technically incorrect to add the coefficient on intensive policing from the full sample.
The estimated treatment effect of policing is almost identical whether we look at the full sample or the
sample of municipal services eligible. And so we use the sum of the three listed coefficients for simplicity.

     Notes: Columns 1–4 refer to the non-interacted results (equation 2 under the constraint that —3 = 0 and ⁄3 = 0) while columns 5–8 refer to the interacted results (equation 2
     with no constraints). Columns 1 and 5 display the bias-adjusted treatment effect while columns 2 and 6 display RI p-values. Columns 3 and 7 display the number of units in
     each group. Columns 4 and 8 display the product of the bias-adjusted treatment effect and the number of units in each group. The confidence interval on the bottom of the
     table is constructed using randomization inference. First we create a fake schedule of potential outcomes for each observation by adding or subtracting RI-adjusted treatment
     or spillover effects. This process gives us a potential outcome for each unit depending on its treatment assignment. Second, we simulate a randomization and take the potential
     outcome associated with the treatment assignment of the new randomization. Third we estimate treatment and spillover effects using this new outcome and apply the RI
     bias adjustment from our main set of results. Fourth, we multiply these bias-adjusted treatment effects by the number of segments in each group, and sum across both the
     experimental and non-experimental samples to get the aggregate effect. We repeat steps two through four 1,000 times to get the distribution of the test statistic, which is
     roughly centered on the actual number of deterred crimes. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of this distribution give us the 95% confidence interval. p < .1 in bold.
    The fact that the coefficient on the interaction is large, negative, and statistically signif-
icant (implying a relatively large reduction in crime) could imply that there are increasing
returns to policing and municipal services, either because any increase in state presence has
increasing returns, or because the combination of policing and services is somehow important.
    We can multiply each estimated treatment effect by the number of treated streets to
estimate the total direct effects of the two interventions. The total amount of crime directly
deterred is small. Reallocating police and municipal services to higher-crime streets directly
deterred just 101.6 crimes over eight months ignoring the interaction term. They did not
deter any crime when we account for the interaction term. Neither total is statistically
significant, however.

Spillover effects The evidence also suggests that any crime deterred may have been dis-
placed to nearby segments. For intensive policing, all spillover coefficients in Table 6 are
positive (including the sum of the three coefficients in Column 5), implying an increase
in nearby crime. The p-values on the adverse spillovers from intensive policing are 0.112
without the interaction and 0.108 with the interaction.
   There are so many segments (from the nonexperimental sample in particular) that these
small spillover coefficients add up to high levels of displaced crime—1,007 when we allow for
the interaction and 928 when we do not.

Aggregate effects We use these estimates to roughly assess the aggregate effect on crime
city-wide. We estimate the total number of deterred crimes as the product of (i) the estimated
coefficients and (ii) the number of treatment and spillover segments in the city. We then
total all direct and spillover effects at the base of the table, and calculate RI confidence
intervals for these totals.
    These aggregate direct and spillover estimates suggest the treatments increased crimes
by about 827 to 1,008 city-wide, or 2–3% relative to the total number of reported crimes.
We have to take this increase with caution, as the estimates are not statistically significant
at the 10% level. Moreover, this estimate would not capture general equilibrium effects if
they exist (e.g. if the intervention is disrupting city-wide criminal networks).
    While we cannot exclude zero spillovers, it is incorrect to view these aggregate estimates
as imprecise. First, using the 90% confidence intervals we can rule out a decrease in city-wide
crime of more than 1–2%. Second, recall that we were ex ante powered to detect spillovers
of roughly 0.02 standard deviations–an order of magnitude more power than prior studies.
Most of these spillover coefficients are just below that threshold. This is one reason why the
confidence intervals on spillovers and aggregate effects include zero.


                                               36
    How does this compare to the spillover effects estimated in the systematic reviews? In a
recent meta-analysis, the average point estimate for intensive policing was -0.104 standard
deviations.51 Our 90% confidence interval for the spillover effects of intensive policing on
our insecurity index ranges from -0.110 to 0.124, meaning that the US mean is within but
at the extreme tail end of our range.
    Finally, as a thought experiment, we can use the coefficients in Table 6 to crudely estimate
the aggregate effects of the program had the government delivered both interventions to all
882 treated streets (instead of just 75). We do so in Appendix C.4. We estimate this
would have led to a fall of 373 crimes on directly treated streets, but this would have
been outweighed by spillovers into experimental and non-experimental segments, for a net
aggregate increase of 664 crimes.

Disentangling municipal services Our qualitative work and compliance data hinted
that the lighting intervention may have been more compliant, effective, and persistent than
the street clean-up. But the data do not support this conclusion. Both lighting and cleanup
services appear to have been important. For example, we see no evidence that municipal
services treatment effects were concentrated in the segments diagnosed as needing improved
lights. Furthermore, we do not see larger treatment effects at nighttime (tables not shown).


7.2     Program impacts using the combined survey and administra-
        tive measures
The survey data tell a similar story as the administrative data on reported crimes. Table 7
reports impacts on our broader security measures for 1,916 experimental streets and 480 non-
experimental streets with survey data. These measures include: the perceived risk index,
based on surveys; and the index of crime, which averages survey- and officially-reported
crime (with components displayed). (Note that the reported crime data is only for the 2,396
segments where we have survey data, and so differs from the previous table.) We also consider
an average of the two measures, called the “insecurity index.” Treatment effects can be
interpreted as average standard deviation changes in the outcome, unless specified otherwise.
The table includes the interaction between policing and municipal services (and omitting this
interaction term does not materially change our conclusions, as shown in Appendix C.5).
    Alone, each intervention is associated with a roughly 0.1 standard deviation security
improvement on directly treated streets, not statistically significant. As with administrative
  51
    See Braga et al. (2014). They report a positive coefficient, which in our context implies a negative sign
(a reduction in crime). We switch the sign for convenience.

crime, we see the largest and most statistically significant impacts of state presence in the
segments that received both interventions. Those 75 segments reported a 0.329 standard
deviation decrease in the insecurity index, significant at the 10% level (column 5).52 The
coefficients on perceived risk and crime indexes are similar, though the combined effect of
the two treatments is statistically significant only for perceived security.
    Again, there is suggestive evidence of increasing returns to state presence, although it is
less robust than with reported crimes alone. The coefficient on the interaction term (column
4) is statistically significant for officially reported crimes only.
    The broader security measure also indicates that crime displaces to nearby control seg-
ments. Columns 6 to 9 of Table 7 report spillover effects. Intensive policing alone and
municipal services alone are associated with increases in crimes on nearby segments of 0.5
to 0.13 standard deviations. Only the municipal services spillovers are statistically signifi-
cant. The interaction terms are generally negative (see column 8) and generally statistically
significant. Thus adverse spillovers appear to be strongest in the streets that received one
intervention or the other.


7.3     Heterogeneity by type of crime
Police tend to prioritize violent crimes such as assault, rape and murder over property crimes
such as burglary or theft. Table 8 takes the aggregate impacts on officially-reported crime
from Table 6 and disaggregates these total effects into violent and property crimes.
    The interventions have opposing effects on property and violent crime. Our best esti-
mate is that aggregate violent crimes fell by 369 crimes in total (3% relative to the total
number of violent crimes) when we account for the interaction between treatments. The
two most socially costly crimes, homicides and sexual assaults, fall by 86. This represents a
large proportion of very serious crimes—7% relative to the total number of homicides and
sexual assaults citywide—even if the result is statistically not significant. Neither decline is
statistically significant at the 10% level, though it is almost so. Given the gravity of these
crimes, we should not dismiss these decreases, however imprecise.
    Property crimes rose by 1384 in aggregate (5% relative to the total number of property
crimes). This increase is statistically significant at the 10% level when we include the in-
teraction. The difference between aggregate effects in property and violent crimes is also
  52
    After completion of the experiment, we also received calls-for-service data from police. We did not pre-
specify that we would use these administrative data. Also, we are concerned that direct treatment would
directly affect calls for service, especially the more frequent presence of police. Hence we omit these data from
the final analysis. The average experimental segment received 17.5 calls over the eight months. Intensive
policing alone reduced this by 3.9 calls (p=0.30), municipal services increased calls by 1.7 (p=0.44), and the
cumulative effect of both interventions was to reduce calls by 2.3 (p=0.71).

statistically significant at the <1% level with the interaction between treatments.
    Table 9 details the direct, spillover and aggregate impacts for violent crimes only. (Ap-
pendix C.6 reports more detailed impacts for property crime). We should take these subgroup
estimates with some caution, as we have not adjusted the p-values for multiple hypothesis
testing. Nonetheless, note that intensive policing has a statistically significant direct impact
on violent crime when not considering the interaction. The estimates generally suggest there
are beneficial spillovers on violent crime.


7.4         Heterogeneity by level of initial crime
Heterogeneity in direct effects We pre-specified one major form of heterogeneity anal-
ysis, by baseline levels of crime. This helps us to compare our experimental results to the
U.S. hot spot policing literature. Broadly speaking, we observe substantially larger treat-
ment effects on the 10–20% highest crime streets, but below that the treatment effects are
relatively similar.
    Figure 7 reports estimated direct treatment effects on the insecurity index for the n%
highest-crime hot spots. Specifically, we estimate equation 2 nine additional times. Each
time, we interact each treatment indicator with an indicator for whether a segment is above
the nth percentile of baseline crime levels among our experimental sample of hot spots, for
n = 0, 10, 20, ..., 90. The figure plots the coefficients on these higher crime streets, with the
n% “hottest spots” on the right.
    The direct treatment effect is fairly constant up until the point we reach the street
segments in the 70th percentile and above. After this point the impact of receiving both
interventions climbs first to 1 fewer crime and then to 2.5 fewer crimes, on average, during

     Notes: This table presents the aggregate effect calculation for both interventions assuming spillovers <250m. Columns 1–4 refer to the non-interacted results (equation 1 under
     the constraint that —3 = 0 and ⁄3 = 0) while columns 5–8 refer to the interacted results (equation 1 with no constraints). Columns 1 and 5 display the bias-adjusted treatment
     effect while columns 2 and 6 display RI p-values. Columns 3 and 7 display the number of units in each group. Columns 4 and 8 display the product of the bias-adjusted
     treatment effect and the number of units in each group. The confidence interval on the bottom of the table is constructed using randomization inference. First we create a
     fake schedule of potential outcomes for each observation by adding or subtracting RI-adjusted treatment or spillover effects. This process gives us a potential outcome for
     each unit depending on its treatment assignment. Second, we simulate a randomization and take the potential outcome associated with the treatment assignment of the new
     randomization. Third we estimate treatment and spillover effects using this new outcome and apply the RI bias adjustment from our main set of results. Fourth, we multiply
     these bias-adjusted treatment effects by the number of segments in each group, and sum across both the experimental and non-experimental samples to get the aggregate effect.
     We repeat steps two through four 1,000 times to get the distribution of the test statistic, which is roughly centered on the actual number of deterred crimes. The 2.5 and 97.5
     percentiles of this distribution give us the 95% confidence interval. p < .1 in bold.
           Figure 7: Program impacts in nth percentile highest-crime street segments




Notes: We estimate equation 2 ten times, each time interacting each treatment indicator with an indicator for whether a
segment is above the nth percentile of baseline crime levels among our experimental sample of segments, for n = 0, 10, 20,
... , 90. The coefficients on the treatment indicators indicate the effect on the higher crime segments above that percentile
(hence the left side of the figure represents the highest crime “hot spots”). The figure graphs the direct treatment coefficients
on intensive policing, municipal services, and the interaction, as well as the sum of these three coefficients.



the intervention period. The effect is imprecise, as the sample size drops dramatically. But
these results are consistent with direct effects being roughly proportional to the levels of
crime.
    Note that in the two highest crime deciles, intensive policing alone is not associated with
decreases in crime.53 Any decrease is driven by municipal services (itself not statistically sig-
nificant) or the combination of both (imprecise though the estimates may be). We conclude
that our results are not being diluted by the inclusion of less hot segments.

Heterogeneity in spillover effects Above we estimated large adverse spillovers on av-
erage. Since many of the experimental streets have low to moderate levels of crime, logically
the large adverse spillovers must come from the highest crime treated streets. Some of our
results bear this expectation out. Estimating this heterogeneity in spillovers is complicated
and noisy, however.
    One reason is that the direct effects of policing and services alone are fairly small, and
there is little heterogeneity in their direct treatment effects. Thus we expect the spillovers
to be small and noisy too. A second reason is that the correct heterogeneity measure is not
obvious. We prefer to use indicators for whether, for each spillover street, the maximum
level of crime for any treated streets within 250 meters is in 0-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th,
  53




                                                              42
or 75th-100th quartiles of baseline crime level for the experimental sample, while controlling
for the expected value of that heterogeneity measure across all 1,000 randomizations.
    We estimate heterogeneity in spillovers in Appendix C.7. We only see one large direct
treatment effect, that from receiving both treatments. These treatment effects are largest
for the both-treated segments that are also high crime. As expected, we estimate adverse
spillovers from these highest-crime, both-treated streets. However, there are just 75 both-
treated streets, and the highest crime ones are less than a quarter of these. So we are
beginning to estimate spillover heterogeneity on impossibly small samples. Hence the noisi-
ness of the estimates. The fact that we do not see large direct effects of policing or services
alone makes it very difficult to say anything meaningful about spillover heterogeneity.


7.5    Robustness
Here we depart from the pre-specified models to consider other models and estimation meth-
ods. Qualitatively, our conclusions remain intact: there is weak evidence of a decrease in
crime on directly treated streets, while signs continue to point to adverse (albeit imprecise)
spillovers to nearby streets, especially for property crime.

Robustness to alternative spillover functions Table 10 reports the results of four
alternative methods of spillover estimation. The first, in Panel A, replicates our earlier
results from estimating equation (2). In Panel B, instead of an indicator S P or S M for any
treated street within 250m, S P and S M are counts of the number of treated streets <250m.
In Panel C, we estimate equation 3 using an exponential rate of decay rather than our fixed
radii. Finally Panel D estimates the same equation with an inverse linear rate of decay.
The coefficients on the two decay functions represent the expected increase in crimes as a
segment moves a standard deviation closer to a treated segment.
    Broadly speaking, we draw the same conclusions regardless of estimation methods. In
terms of direct treatment effects, the results are similar to what we observed in Table 6
above: both intensive policing and municipal services have a negative but not statistically
significant effect on crime when we ignore the interaction between treatments (not shown)
but with the interaction term the reductions in crime are concentrated in the streets that
received both treatments. There is no evidence of any crime reduction in streets that received
just one intervention.
    Turning to spillovers, in all cases intensive policing or the combination of both treatments
(the sum of the three marginal effects) is associated with adverse spillovers on total crime,
though these are not statistically significant . In all four cases, we also see the same difference
between property and violent crimes as we did in the prespecified analysis. Intensive policing

2 for panels A and B, and equation 3 for panels C and D. For panels A and B we estimate using both the experimental and
nonexperimental streets. For panel B, in place of an indicator for any treated segment within a 250 radius, we use a count
variable for the number of treated segments within 250m. In panels C and D, the weighted distance measures have been
standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.

tends to have larger adverse spillovers on property crimes than violent crimes. In panels A
and C, the adverse spillover of intensive policing on property crime is statistically significant.

Robustness to ignoring different probabilities of treatment and the unusual pat-
terns of clustering To see the effect of our design and estimation choices, in Appendix
C.9 we estimate “naïve” treatment effects ignoring IPWs and randomization inference. Di-
rect treatment effects are slightly smaller than in Table 7, but the patterns remain similar.
The estimated spillover effects in this “naïve” case, however, are much larger and highly sta-
tistically significant compared to Table 7. Hence failing to account for interference between
units and clustering of treatment conditions would have led us to severely exaggerate the
degree to which policing pushes crime elsewhere.


7.6     Program impacts on state trust and legitimacy
We pre-specified three secondary outcomes capturing impacts on trust in and legitimacy
of the state. First, an opinion of police index averaging 4 attitudes towards police: trust,;
quality of work, overall satisfaction, and likelihood they would give information to police.
Second, an opinion of mayor index that asks the same 4 questions for city government.
Third, a crime reporting measure that captures the likelihood that people reported a crime
to the police. This helps us understand whether administrative crime reporting changes with
treatment, but is also a measure of collaboration and hence legitimacy.54
    Overall, we see little evidence that the interventions increased trust in or legitimacy of the
state. Table 11 reports ITT effects using equation 2. We see an unexpected pattern: intensive
policing and municipal services alone are associated with increases in the opinion of police
and Mayor, but this is effectively cancelled out (or even changes to a deterioration of the
Mayor’s opinion) when both treatments are received. This pattern is generally statistically
significant at conventional levels. This heterogeneity across arms is hard to interpret and
could reflect noise, so we are cautious and avoid drawing conclusions.


8     Discussion and conclusions
Police patrols and municipal services are the most elementary tools of city government. This
study asks: what are the effects of these street-level bureaucrats on order and legitimacy in
normal and high crime streets? Theoretically, both should increase the expected risk and
  54
     In the state building and especially the counter insurgency literatures such civilian information, tips,
and collaboration are among the chief indicators of state legitimacy.

cost of committing crimes on the street segment, and so both interventions could be powerful
tools of crime control. Bogotá offered an opportunity to evaluate these interventions on an
unprecedented scale. And when we confine our analysis to the higher-crime streets, the
results also speak to a larger literature on place-based interventions, including hot spots
policing.
     We show that crime in Bogotá was only moderately responsive to a street-level inten-
sification of patrol time and intensified municipal services. These direct effects were large
and significant only when they were jointly applied, but even then the total direct impacts
were small. Moreover, the majority of this crime appears to shift to streets within 250m,
especially property crime. The effects are proportionally larger in the highest crime streets,
and so logically are the adverse spillovers. There is some indication that violent crimes are
deterred more than property crimes, perhaps because they are more immediately oppor-
tunistic and do not have a sustained motive. Thus these findings bolster theories of crime
deterrence that emphasize the importance of criminal motive.
     Cost-effectiveness in this case is in the eye of the beholder. The city views the interven-
tions as having little or no marginal cost, since they simply reallocated existing resources
from some streets to others without raising their budgets or personnel. If so, then the main
policy question is whether a moderately high probability of reducing murders and rapes by
8% is worth what seems to be a rise in property crime. This is a trade off that many police
chiefs and mayors may reasonably make.
     On the other hand, reallocating street-level bureaucrats had some unmeasured costs.
There was a logistical cost of coordinating patrols, especially management time. It also
made police patrols spend more time in unpleasant places. Officers told us they disliked
the loss of autonomy and flexibility. There are also opportunity costs to consider. Intensive
policing was a major reform, and like any bureaucracy, the police can only undertake so many
reforms in a year. The Mayor’s office used scarce social and political capital to implement
it. We believe one should measure this reform against the others it supplanted.


8.1    How do our results line up with existing evidence and meta-
       analyses?
At first glance, it might seem that the displacement of total crime to nearby streets runs
against the U.S. literature. We have to compare with caution for several reasons. First,
Bogotá and the US are different contexts. While Bogotá is a relatively rich and democratic
society with a professionalized and relatively trusted police force, it is conceivable that
poverty and inequality in Bogotá lead to more sustained motives for property crime (though


                                              47
this is highly speculative, especially when many US cities are also poor and unequal).
    Second, as noted above, hot spots policing interventions vary in terms of intensity, con-
centration, crimes targeted, duration, and quality of approach. In Bogotá we study a much
more routine increase in the intensity of normal services on a wider range of street segments.
    A third difference is that our intervention focuses on direct effects and spillovers during
the course of the intervention, and we look at spillovers over a larger-than-usual range of 250
meters. To the extent that spillovers are highest during the active phase of the interventions,
or displace over larger spatial areas, there may be mechanical reasons for us to observe
higher rates of displacement than studies that focus on a 2–block radius or post-intervention
spillovers. Alternatively, past spillover bounds may have been too small and underestimated
spillovers.
    Finally, there are also reasons to question the consensus view that, on average, place-
based interventions have positive spillovers (a diffusion of benefits). Two recent reviews argue
that, on average, instances of positive spillovers outweigh negative ones across studies (Braga
et al., 2012; Weisburd and Telep, 2016). Rather than question this aggregate mean, we think
it is important to consider the confidence interval. Meta-analysis is extremely challenging
here, since many of the component papers (especially early ones) do not report sufficient
or comparable information. Also, only recently has it become more common for papers to
move beyond simple t-tests of means to adjust standard errors for clustering of treatment
assignment, or account for small sample distributions. Hence any aggregation involves either
taking potentially problematic standard errors at face value, guesswork, or both.
    But to use one meta-analysis as an example, of the 13 individual spillover estimates
documented in Braga et al. (2014), 8 have a p-value smaller than 0.001.55 Even in a study
the size of Bogotá’s, levels of precision were never nearly this high. Yet of these 8 p < 0.001
studies, the median number of target units including all treatment arms was below 30.
    We have not redone the meta-analysis formally, and so we do not wish to make strong
claims about what the aggregate confidence interval might be. Our point, rather, is that
we we may want to regard the direction of spillovers as uncertain or unsettled. In addition,
this illustrates the importance for future studies of data transparency, replicable evaluations,
and ease of comparison across studies. And most of all it suggests that future meta-analysis
should try to critically examine the confidence intervals in past studies.

8.2    Methodological lessons
As more urban policy experiments go to scale, we need practical tools and methods for dealing
with the challenges that come from spillovers in dense interconnected networks. This isn’t
just important in cities, it is important for experiments in social networks and other settings
where we worry about interference between units, and cannot experiment in separate and
independent clusters.
    Design-based approaches help in at least two ways. First, we show how multi-level
randomization can be used to reduce the differential probabilities of assignment to spillover
and control conditions that are so problematic for estimation. If nothing else, the design can
ensure that the experiment has at least some proportion of control streets with a reasonable
probability of assignment to all experimental conditions. Second, we show how design can
estimate spillovers in a flexible way, with a minimum of ex ante assumptions. This flexibility
is especially important when we don’t have a strong sense of the structure of spillovers in
advance. In Bogotá, we found evidence of spillovers in a catchment area considerably wider
than the usual catchment area of 1–2 blocks. If true this could mean that the total spatial
displacement is considerably greater than some papers estimate.
    Besides illustrating the uses of design, this paper is also a rare practical example of the
uses of randomization inference. RI has yet to gain currency in randomized control trials,
in part because most times RI provides more or less the same conclusions as the usual
clustered standard errors. Textbook cases for randomization inference, however, are when
units of varying size have widely different probabilities of assignment to different experimental
conditions, and when spillovers lead to fuzzy, difficult-to-model clustering. Large-scale urban
interventions suffer from both problems, and we show how RI is a practical solution requiring
relatively few assumptions. We expect RI to become an increasingly common approach to
hypothesis testing in economics and criminology.


8.3    Lessons for place-based security interventions
Successful place-based interventions have two main characteristics. First, they have to im-
prove security in the directly targeted areas. Second, they must minimize the chances of
adverse spillovers. The first requirement is easier to satisfy than the second. However, our
results point to strategies that could be more effective. One is that more intensive state pres-
ence, of both police and municipal services, seems to have had the largest direct effects on
crime. It suggests there may be increasing returns to state presence. This combination de-
serves to be tested at scale, perhaps with additional or complementary strategies designed to



                                               49
prevent crime displacement.56 But caution is warranted, since our estimates of displacement
rose in tandem with direct treatment effects.
    The Bogotá evidence also suggests that different kinds of crime might respond differently
to interventions. Normal patrolling seems to have been most effective when targeted at
segments with the most violent crime, or other crimes without sustained motives. This
could include areas known for drunken brawls, confrontations between angry groups, or
sexual assaults. Should the police want to avoid property crime displacement, it could mean
a change in tactic, such as increasing arrests or seizures (which they did not do).
    Similarly, it is possible that expanding targets beyond street segments could reduce dis-
placement. A large literature has pushed attention to the level of street segments, corners
and even addresses. But to the extent that hot spots cluster on nearby or adjacent streets,
we may invite easy displacement by intervening and evaluating at the street segment level.
It is possible that intervening in clusters would have larger direct effects and lower displace-
ment of motivated crimes. This deserves testing. Clustering street segments can reduce
statistical power, but there are ways to increase it back: by re-randomizing treatment at
regular intervals, by increasing the intensity of treatment, or by experimenting in more than
one municipality at once.
    It is also worth noting that the broader policing literature has consistently found that
more police are associated with lower crime (Levitt and Miles, 2006; Chalfin and McCrary,
2017b). Recent work by Chalfin and McCrary (2017a) suggests an especially large effect
of aggregate police on violent crimes. One possibility is that a general increase in police
per capita raises the probability of detection on every street and deters or captures even
motivated criminals. This could be the key difference between intensive policing and greater
manpower (though the latter is far more expensive). However, there may be ways to design
place-based policing to minimize adverse spillovers. Treating hot spots at the level of a
cluster or neighborhood rather than a street segment, as we mention above, is one such
possibility.
    In the end, our results bolster a view in criminology that the right question is not “do
place-based policies deter crime?” but rather “what types of crime tend to be more responsive
to state presence?” and “what tactics are suitable for deterring specific forms of crime?”
Large-scale experiments offer an opportunity to test theories of crime, and the assumptions
underlying interventions, rather than simply evaluate interventions themselves.
  56
    Qualitatively, our interactions with the government and police patrols suggest other ways to increase
direct impacts. One is less predictable policing, such as changing hot spots month to month. This has
the advantage of increasing statistical power in an evaluation. Another is organizing hot spots in a more
sophisticated manner, e.g. according to their risk at particular times of day or days of the week (such as
schools at the start and end of the school day, or nightclubs in the evening).

A      Statistical power analysis
Figure A.1 takes studies from recent systematic reviews and plot sample size and effect sizes
for both direct and spillover effects.57 One major takeaway is that most studies are not ex
ante powered to detect the average direct effect across studies, of 0.17 standard deviations.
The figure displays statistical power curves, representing the minimum effect size that we
would expect to be able to detect with 80% confidence. While covariate adjustment and
blocking strategies could improve statistical power slightly, these would produce at best
marginal gains in precision.58 Note that even the largest studies do not exceed 50 or 100
treated hot spots, with a similarly modest number of spillover segments.59 The average effect
  57
     This is one reason why most studies were designed to address direct treatment effects, and spillovers are
a secondary outcome. One exception is Weisburd et al. (2006), who study drug and prostitution hot spots.
Their findings suggest the benefits from the intervention diffuse to nearby areas.
  58
     We generate the power curves assuming simple randomization and treatment assignment for half of the
experimental sample. Some randomization procedures as blocking on pre-treatment characteristics could in-
crease power (see for instance Gerber and Green, 2012; Weisburd and Gill, 2014), though the improvements
may not be significant with small samples. The equations for the power curves are expected to be lower
bounds of the actual power, as it could be increased using different randomization techniques as blocking
by some specific characteristic of the units of analysis. Hence, some studies might have more power, given
their sample size, than the corresponding value using the simple power formula. To make our study com-
parable to others, we also estimate our power using the formula rather than relying on our randomization
approach. Another source of incomparability between studies could be the variation in outcomes within each
experimental unit. As shown in Braga et al. (2014), some studies have units of analysis larger than a street
segment as police beats. Some others have units of analysis smaller as specific addresses. In some cases, the
main outcomes are calls for service, which might have more variation than crime reports in some contexts.
Nonetheless, most of the studies focus on relatively small hot spots and we rely not only in crime reports
but in an original survey of about 24,000 respondents. Hence, this source of incomparability should not be
relevant.

     Randomized controlled trials of intensive policing have sample sizes of 110 hot spots (55 treated) in
Minneapolis (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995), 56 hot spots (28 treated) in Jersey City Weisburd and Green

if statistically significant. We only report MDEs for studies for which it was possible to do
so with the information in published papers, however. In Bogotá, the city tested two place-
based security interventions on a scale large enough to identify direct treatment effects of
0.15 standard deviations, and spillovers as small as 0.02 standard deviations. We plot these
in Figure A.1. For fairness in the comparison, we plot the power of our study measured also
on the basis of sample size and the number of treated units.

(104 treated) in Kansas City (Sherman and Rogan, 1995), 100 hot spots (50 treated) in Oakland (Mazerolle
et al., 2000), 34 hot spots (17 treated) in Lowell (Braga and Bond, 2008), 83 hot spots (21 treated with
police patrols and 22 with problem oriented policing) in Jacksonville (Taylor et al., 2011), 120 hot spots (60
treated) in Philadelphia (Ratcliffe et al., 2011), and 42 hot spots (21 treated) in Sacramento (Telep et al.,
2014). Interestingly, the first hot spots study was conducted in Minneapolis in 1989 and had a larger sample
size with 250 residential addresses of which 125 were assigned to treatment and 250 commercial addressees
of which also 125 were assigned to treatment Sherman et al. (1989). One of the only other large studies,
by a subset of this paper’s author’s, is in the Colombian city of Medellín, with 384 of 967 hot spots treated
Collazos et al. (2018). Even non-experimental sample sizes have been fairly small. Di Tella and Schargrodsky
(2004), for instance, examined the effects of 37 police-protected religious institutions in Buenos Aires.

B      Additional data and design details
B.1      Patrolling time
Figure B.1 presents the evolution of average daily patrolling time for the pre-treatment
and treatment periods, as well as different groups of streets: treatment, controls (all) and
non-experimental.
    Our estimates of average daily patrolling time are lower in the pre-treatment period
because of data quality. During the pre-treatment period not all police patrols had GPS
devices and some were working irregularly as the equipment was being piloted. During the
treatment period there were also windows of intermittence. These malfunctioning periods,
however, affected all streets equally.60 Even though we cannot compare average daily pa-
trolling time between the pre-treatment and treatment periods directly, the figures show that
average patrolling time in control streets is between two and three times as much as that
for non-experimental streets. This is true for both periods and especially for time windows
where the GPS devices seemed to be working better.61


B.2      Inverse probability weighting
Our randomization procedure gives segments variable probabilities of being in each of the
treatment conditions. This is especially true for segments in our non-experimental sample.
For example, non-experimental segments in relatively safer areas of Bogota have a zero
percent chance of being a spillover for either treatment since there are no experimental units
in those neighborhoods.
    Figure B.2 compares two maps. The first map displays the number of baseline adminis-
trative crimes between 2012 and 2015 for each segment, while the second one displays each
segment’s probability of being within 250m of hotspots receiving hotspot policing and munic-
ipal services (based on 1,000 randomizations). In areas with lots of crime, non-experimental
  60
      We estimated patrolling time using the time stamp of the GPS pings sent by every device. In the easiest
cases, several sequential pings were received from the area of 40m surrounding a segment. In this case, we
took the first ping as the entry time and the last as the exit time, and computed the patrolling time for an
entry. Then, we aggregated entries to measure daily patrolling times. However, because of malfunctioning
units, there were several cases in which irregular and largely separated pings were sent by a device. To
account for these situations, we top-coded each entry up to the duration of the shift (starting with the entry
time). We also drop days with missing data, as it was more likely that the device was not working than the
street was not patrolled at all during the day. We discussed these adjustments with the police to ensure we
were making a correct approximation of daily patrolling times. The police reported that most cases were
due to software updates in all devices. For instance, to update the operating system or the software for
background checks.
   61
      For our estimates, we follow each GPS device chronologically, thus we track the moment at which the
device enters a street and when does it leave. We made two assumptions to estimate patrolling time: (i)
If we see only one GPS ping in a street and then the device moves to other streets, we impute 1 minute of
patrolling time (assuming the patrol just traversed the street). (ii) If we see a device entering a street and
the next ping from the same device is many hours ahead in the same street, we count until the end of the
shift (assuming the device was maybe left there, but in any case the maximum patrolling time should go as
much as the end of the shift).

Figure B.2: Maps of baseline crime and probability of being spillover <250m to both inter-
ventions




Notes: This figure displays two maps of Bogota. In the first map, we display baseline administrative crime from 2012 to 2015 at
the street-segment level. In the second map, we display each segment’s probability of being within 250m of segments assigned
to receive both interventions.


units have a higher probability of being a <250m spillover because they are located in areas
with more hotspots (experimental units). In areas like the south of Bogota, however, many
segments have no a zero probability of being a <250 spillover because there are no hotspots
present. Thus a simple spillover vs. control comparison will lead to biased estimates on
the effect of crime because the outcome (crime) is correlated with treatment assignment. In
order to deal with this issue, we must use inverse probability weights and (in the case of the
non-experimental units) omit units with a zero probability of being a spillover (so they are
always controls) or being a control (so they are always spillovers).
   In table B.2 we display the average bias associated with the use of inverse probability
weights for our design. The top half shows the bias for the experimental sample while the
bottom half shows the bias for the non-experimental sample. There are 1,916 units in the
experimental sample, so the asymptotic requirement is unlikely to be met, leading to large
biases associated with the design. By contrast, we have many more non-experimental units,
which gives us much smaller biases.

B.3         Departures from the pre-analysis plan
The estimation procedure used in this paper is slightly different from the ones we described
in our pre-analysis plan (PAP).62 In this section, we document the reasons why it was
appropriate to switch estimation strategies.
   Our pre-specified estimation strategy (see page 17 of the PAP) would use pairwise re-
gressions to estimate the direct and spillover effects of the intervention. Let us assume we
wanted to estimate the effects of the hot spot policing treatment given one level of spillovers,
so our possible experimental conditions are: treated by hotspot policing TH , <250m of a
unit treated with hotspot policing SH , and >250m away from a unit receiving hotspot polic-
ing (CH , the control group). Our pre-analysis plan says we would run the following WLS
regression:

                                Ysqp = —0 + ◊H ú T H + ÿ ú Xsqp + “p + Ásqp                     (4)
Our weights are determined by the probability of being either in TH , SH , or CH (for example,
if a street is in SH , its weight is Pr(S1 H ) ). Furthermore, we restrict the regressions to (i)
segments only in TH or CH , and (ii) segments with a non-zero probabilities of being in TH
                                   t
and CH (i.e. 0 < Pr(TH ) < 1 0 < Pr(CH ) < 1). The coefficient of interest is ◊H , which
represents the ITT estimate of receiving the hot spot policing treatment on outcome Y
relative to segments greater than 250m away from any treated hotspot.
    This pairwise regression is incorrect because it fails to recognize the complexity of our
design. We test both hot spot policing and municipal services in a factorial design, so
probability weights need to be determined by the joint probability of hot spot policing
and municipal service assignment, not just assignment to one of the treatments. Failure
to account for the joint probability can mix up effects between each of the interventions.
For example, if segments treated by hot spot policing have a higher chance than hot spot
policing control segments to be inner spillovers for municipal services, then ◊H in equation 4
will conflate the direct effect of hot spot policing and the spillover effect of municipal services.
    This is exactly what we see in our design. In Table B.3.1, we show the distribution of
treatment assignments for each intervention. Panel A shows that while segments in each hot
spot policing block all have a similar proportion (~11%) of their segments receiving municipal
services, segments treated with policing are more likely than segments >250m from treated
policing segments to be spillover units for municipal services. In the case that there are
spillover effects from municipal services, it will not be possible to use the pairwise regression
detailed above to estimate just the effect of hot spot policing.
    There are two changes we can make to the regressions outlined in the pre-analysis plan
so that our empirical strategy is compatible with the realities of our factorial design. First,
we can base our probability weights on the joint probability of assignment. Second, we can
insert dummies for municipal service assignment into equation 4. Making these changes gives
us the following regression:

                  Ysqp = —0 + ◊H ú T H + ◊M ú T M + ◊H ú S M + ÿ ú Xsqp + “p + Ásqp             (5)

Notes: This table displays the distribution of treatment assignments for each intervention. Panel A de-
picts the proportion of streets assigned to the different treatment status on municipal services, within each
treatment block for hot spot policing. Panel B depicts the proportion of streets assigned to the different
treatment status on hot spots policing, within each treatment block for municipal services.



    Including an additional indicator for being a hot spot policing spillover in this regres-
sion allows us to estimate all four effects (direct effect of hot spot policing, direct effect of
municipal services, spillover effect of hotspot policing, spillover effect of municipal services)
in one regression. This corresponds to the constrained version of equation (1) in the main
paper where —3 = 0. Thus the regressions used in this paper correctly estimate the effects of
our factorial design by using the correct inverse probability weights and estimating all the
effects in the same regression.
    Nevertheless, we display the pairwise regressions pre-specified for clarity purposes. Table
B.3.2 displays the hot spots policing effect while table displays the municipal services ef-
fects. Meanwhile, table B.3.4 displays the interaction effects. Most of the differences for the
treatment effects are coming from the use of different weights. In Table B.3.4 (where we use
the same weights as in the main analysis), the results are very similar—the only difference
is that we drop observations that are within 250m of either treatment, giving us less power.

C     Additional results and robustness analysis
C.1     Summary statistics
Our primary outcomes are two insecurity measures: perceived risk and crime incidence.
Table C.1 reports summary statistics on a standardized index of each outcome for each of
the 4 ◊ 5 experimental conditions, using inverse probability weights for assignment into each
of the treatment conditions.


C.2     Tests of spillovers
Table C.2 reports the p-values from our preferred, general test of spillovers. It takes the
means for the 4 ◊ 5 experimental conditions in Table 2 in the paper and tests for differences
between pairs of columns (for municipal services) and pairs of rows (for intensive policing).
Using our pre-specified threshold of p<0.1, we observe statistically significant spillovers with
250m for municipal services, but not in the 250-500m region. For intensive policing, however,
none of the p-values are below 0.1. We see some indication of <250m spillovers from munic-
ipal services in one of the two outcomes (crime incidence), but spillovers are not statistically
significant in the large non-experimental sample.
    This is one reason why we see more statistically significant spillovers in Table 6. We
should also have addressed how we would treat economically large spillovers around or below
p = 0.1. Because the spillovers in Table C.2 are weak, there is a reasonable argument for
calculating treatment effects ignoring spillovers.


C.3     Program impacts on officially reported crime, un-pooling the
        experimental and experimental samples
Table C.3 replicates Table 6 in the main paper, except it estimates equation (1) on the
experimental sample alone instead of equation (2) on the pooled sample of experimental
and nonexperimental units. The nonexperimental spillovers are then esitmated separately.
Conclusions do not change materially.


C.4     Back-of-the-envelope calculation of the effects of scaling the
        dual treatment and no treatment
In Table C.4 we calculate the direct and indirect effects assuming that the 882 street segments
that received either the intensive policing or the municipal services treatment received both
treatments. In order to obtain the direct treatment effect, we add the intensive policing
and the municipal services effects, and subtract the interaction effect. The estimated impact
is the result of the direct treatment effect times the number of units that received either
the intensive policing, the municipal services, or both treatments. Similarly, to calculate
the indirect treatment effect for the experimental and non-experimental sample, we add the

                Notes: We report weighted means for each experimental condition, where weights
                are the inverse of the probability of falling in the corresponding treatment condi-
                tion. We estimate that probability with repeated simulations of the randomization
                procedure. The ineligible condition in Column 5 reflects those streets that did not
                exhibit any disorder at baseline. Technically there are 3 ◊ 4 ineligible conditions
                for each dependent variable, one for each relative distance from municipal services
                treated streets, but we pool those columns here for simplicity.

Notes: There are 4◊7 experimental conditions, with means reported in Table (2). This table tests for mean differences iteratively,
first between the >500 meter and 250–500 meter conditions, then between the <250 meter and >250 meter conditions. It does
so for each intervention. For instance, to test for spillovers in the 250-500m spillover region from from municipal services, we
calculate the mean differences between the four cells in column 3 of Table (2) and the adjoining cells in column 4. This table
reports the p-value from the F-test of those four mean differences.



treatment coefficients and subtract the interaction coefficient. Then, we multiply each of
these effects by the number of street segments that were within <250m spillover region of a
treated unit by any or both treatments.


C.5        Program impacts including survey-based insecurity measures,
           no interaction term
When examining officially reported crimes, the main paper reported estimates of treatment
and spillover effects with and without the interaction between intwensive policing and mu-
nicipal services. However, the paper only reported results with the interaction terms when
considering our broader measures of insecurity weith survey data. Table C.5 reports these
results. There is no material difference in conclusions without the interaciton term.

In Tables C.6.1 and C.6.2, we display the aggregate effects on additional crime subgroups:
property crime, as well as homicides and rapes only.

     Notes: Columns 1–4 refer to the non-interacted results (Equation (1) under the constraint that —3 = 0 and ⁄3 = 0) while columns 5–8 refer to the interacted results (Equation
     (1) with no constraints). Columns 1 and 5 display the bias-adjusted treatment effect while columns 2 and 6 display RI p-values. Columns 3 and 7 display the number of units
     in each group. Columns 4 and 8 display the product of the bias-adjusted treatment effect and the number of units in each group. The confidence interval on the bottom of the
     table is constructed using randomization inference. First we create a fake schedule of potential outcomes for each observation by adding or subtracting RI-adjusted treatment
     or spillover effects. This process gives us a potential outcome for each unit depending on its treatment assignment. Second, we simulate a randomization and take the potential
     outcome associated with the treatment assignment of the new randomization. Third we estimate treatment and spillover effects using this new outcome and apply the RI
     bias adjustment from our main set of results. Fourth, we multiply these bias-adjusted treatment effects by the number of segments in each group, and sum across both the
     experimental and non-experimental samples to get the aggregate effect. We repeat steps two through four 1,000 times to get the distribution of the test statistic, which is
     roughly centered on the actual number of deterred crimes. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of this distribution give us the 95% confidence interval. p < .1 in bold.

     Notes: This table presents the aggregate effect calculation for both interventions assuming spillovers <250m. Columns 1–4 refer to the non-interacted results (equation 1 under
     the constraint that —3 = 0 and ⁄3 = 0) while columns 5–8 refer to the interacted results (equation 1 with no constraints). Columns 1 and 5 display the bias-adjusted treatment
     effect while columns 2 and 6 display RI p-values. Columns 3 and 7 display the number of units in each group. Columns 4 and 8 display the product of the bias-adjusted
     treatment effect and the number of units in each group. The confidence interval on the bottom of the table is constructed using randomization inference. First we create a
     fake schedule of potential outcomes for each observation by adding or subtracting RI-adjusted treatment or spillover effects. This process gives us a potential outcome for
     each unit depending on its treatment assignment. Second, we simulate a randomization and take the potential outcome associated with the treatment assignment of the new
     randomization. Third we estimate treatment and spillover effects using this new outcome and apply the RI bias adjustment from our main set of results. Fourth, we multiply
     these bias-adjusted treatment effects by the number of segments in each group, and sum across both the experimental and non-experimental samples to get the aggregate effect.
     We repeat steps two through four 1,000 times to get the distribution of the test statistic, which is roughly centered on the actual number of deterred crimes. The 2.5 and 97.5
     percentiles of this distribution give us the 95% confidence interval. p < .1 in bold.

C.7     Spillover heterogeneity by baseline crime
Table C.7 shows the results of a specification similar to Equation (2) where the each treatment
and spillover effect is replaced with 4 effects, one for each quartile of baseline crime level.
For the treated streets, estimating differing effect is done through simple interaction terms.
We found the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile of baseline crime level in experimental streets.
Then, we constructed 4 dummy variables for all streets in the city based on whether their
crime level fell into the 1st, 2nd 3rd, or 4th quartile. That is to say, the mean of each quartile
dummy variable was .25 within the experimental sample of 1919 streets, but not for the entire
regression sample of 79,000 streets. To construct spillover dummies from these quartiles, we
grouped each spillover street based on the maximum crime level of treated streets nearby. If a
spillover street had all their nearby treated streets in the first quartile, then they received a 1
for their first-quartile spillover dummy, and zero for the others. However if one those treated
streets within 250 meters fell into the second quartile, they would receive only a 1 for the
second-quartile spillover dummy, and zero for the others. Note that though the experimental
sample was by definition evenly divided into 4 quartiles, treatment assignment was actually
biased towards lower crime streets. This is due to the restriction of only selecting two streets
from each police quadrent into the treatment.
    Results are noisy, but consistent with both the main analysis and those in Figure 7 in the
main paper. In particular, the combined effect for the combination of both direct treatments
is highest in streets with high levels of baseline crime. However any conclusions must be
tempered by the fact that estimates for the effect of combined treatment at the top quartile
are derived from a treated sample of only 14 steets.


C.8     Marginal effects of extra patrolling time
We estimate the results instrumenting patrolling time (measured in hours) with treatment
assignment to intensive policing. We also explore if the marginal effects of additional pa-
trolling time differ over varying levels of baseline crime. Table C.8 reports these results.
Standard errors are clustered at the unit of randomization. For estimating instrumental
variables results, we cannot use randomization inference to estimate exact p-values, as we
would need to know how would the compliance levels be under each possible randomization.
This implies we are over-stating precision in these analyses. Additionally, because we are
unable to use randomization inference to correct for clustering of spillovers, columns (4)-(7)
report a regression where we exclude streets in the experimental sample that are withing
250m of a treated street.
    Results from both tables are similar, hence we focus on the no-spillovers case (Table
C.8). Column (1) presents the OLS results. Note that, since patrolling time is endogenous
to crime levels, the coefficient is positive. Column (2) presents the instrumental variables
estimates. In this case, the sign of the coefficient of patrolling time is reversed, as expected,
and suggests a negative relationship between patrolling time and the number of reported
crimes. Column (3) includes an interaction of patrolling time and baseline crime. Note the
marginal effect of one additional hour of patrolling time is of about 0.13 fewer crimes, but
this effect is decreasing as the baseline crime levels are larger (see the positive sign of the

Notes: This table reports average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) estimates of the effects of intensive policing, via
a weighted instrumental variables regressions of reported crimes on patrolling time (in hours) instrumented with treatment
assignment (or the interactions instrumented accordingly). Regressions also include police station (block) fixed effects, and
baseline covariates (and the relevant exogenous regressions accordingly). The regression ignores spillover effects. Standard
errors are clustered using the following rules: (i) for all treated segments except with cluster size 2, each segment is a cluster;
(ii) for all other untreated segments, each segment gets its own cluster identifier; (iii) for entirely untreated quadrants, they
form a cluster; and (iv) for quadrants with exactly 2 units assigned to treatment, those units form a cluster. * significant at

C.9     Impacts without re-weighting and randomization inference
Table C.9 reproduces Table from the paper, but without IPWs and randomization inference.
The direct treatment effects are generally smaller but the patterns are still similar. However,
the spillover effects in these results are huge (.18 standard deviations for hot spots policing,
0.31 standard deviations for municipal services). This shows that IPW’s are crucial for
getting the spillover effects right– the point estimates on the direct effects do not change as
much because most segments have similar probabilities of being treated.
   Thus estimating unbiased treatment and spillover effects in the presence of the geo-
graphic clustering of high crime areas requires the use of inverse probability weights and
randomization inference.

     (block) fixed effects, and baseline covariates (see equation (1). Column 5 reports the sum of the three treatment coefficients. Standard errors are clustered using the following
     rules: For all treated segments except with cluster size 2, each segment is a cluster. For all other untreated segments, each segment gets its own cluster ID. For entirely untreated
     quadrants, they form a cluster. For quadrants with exactly 2 units assigned to treatment, those units form a cluster.
