Decentralization and Environmental Quality: An International Analysis of Water Pollution

JEL No. H77,Q5

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper explores the empirical effects of decentralization on environmental quality by studying
water pollution in rivers around the world. It examines the level of pollution and variation in pollution
across jurisdictions within a country, for both a local and a regional pollutant. Federal countries exhibit
greater interjurisdictional variation in pollution, supporting the traditional view that decentralization
allows policies more tailored to local conditions. However, the analysis does not point to a “race to
the bottom” in pollution levels.

    Many countries are actively considering the appropriate level of government to conduct en-
vironmental policy. In the U.S., recent Supreme Court decisions limit the federal government’s
authority to undertake environmental regulation. In the European Union, the trend has been the
reverse, with increased reliance on common or harmonized environmental policies. An extensive
literature discusses the desirability of decentralization in provision of public goods and environ-
mental quality.
    Several arguments from this literature would suggest an effect of decentralization on the level
of pollution and on the amount of variation in pollution across jurisdictions within a country. The
traditional model of Oates (1972) suggests increased interjurisdictional variation with decentral-
ization because it allows jurisdictions to control their own pollution levels. Destructive regulatory
competition, in the form of a “race to the bottom,” would lower environmental quality with decen-
tralization, but probably not increase variation across regions. Interjurisdictional free riding might
give rise to higher levels of transboundary pollutants with greater decentralization, but not higher
levels of local pollutants. Models with distributive and interest group politics also may have im-
plications for the effects of decentralization. Thus, the net effects of decentralization are uncertain
and provide an opportunity to evaluate the empirical importance of various concerns.
    Effects of decentralization on environmental policy and outcomes have begun to be docu-
mented in the empirical literature. List and Gerking (2000) and Millimet (2003) look at the net
effect of changes over time in decentralization in the U.S. on policy outcomes; they find limited
effects of the Reagan-era decentralization on air pollution and pollution abatement spending.1 At
a subnational level, Cutter and DeShazo (2007) examine an environmental policy that allows local
governments to request control from the California government. They conclude that heterogeneity
across the localities plays a large role in the apparent effects of devolution on stringency under this
    1 List and Gerking (2000) conclude that neither spending nor air pollution (nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emis-

sions) changed after 1980, whereas Millimet (2003) finds that spending (but not air pollution) rose by the mid-1980s.
Both papers discuss their results in terms of destructive competition, but their results might be interpreted in terms of
the broader set of hypotheses discussed here.

program. Unlike earlier work, the current paper incorporates international experience with decen-
tralization and examines both a local and a regional pollutant. In addition, this paper is the first to
examine interjurisdictional variation in levels of the public good, which allows a fairly direct test
of the traditional model.2
    For this study, data on water pollution in rivers derives from the U.N.’s Global Environment
Monitoring System (GEMS) Water Quality Monitoring Programme. The pollutants studied are
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is transported far downstream, and fecal coliform,
which has local effects and is thus less of a candidate for interjurisdictional free riding. The esti-
mated equations model pollution levels and interjurisdictional variation in pollution as depending
on a country’s decentralization, other country characteristics, and characteristics of the monitoring
location.
    The results suggest higher interjurisdictional variation in pollution levels in federal countries
for both pollutants. Such variation supports the traditional view of Oates (1972) that decentral-
ization allows better tailoring of policies to local conditions. The results do not support higher
average levels of pollution with greater decentralization, as would occur with destructive regula-
tory competition.
    The outline of the paper is as follows. The next section outlines hypotheses about the associ-
ation between decentralization and environmental quality. Section 2 describes the GEMS/Water
data and variables matched from other sources. Section 3 presents the estimates of equations for
the levels of the two pollutants, with and without monitoring station fixed effects. Section 4 ana-
lyzes interjurisdictional variation in pollution levels within countries. Section 5 estimates models
that allow endogenous participation of countries in GEMS/Water, but does not find much evidence
that such selection affects earlier results. A final section concludes.
   2 In
      a similar spirit, Faguet (2004) finds that decentralization in Bolivia resulted better “tailoring” of spending, for
example increasing sewerage spending in places where access to sewers was lower. My approach does not evaluate
where environmental quality yields higher net welfare; it just looks for evidence of heterogeneity.

1      Effects of decentralization

An extensive theoretical literature describes conditions under which decentralization of public
goods provision improves welfare. This section discusses this literature with the goal of deriv-
ing predictions about the empirical effect of decentralization on environmental quality.
     In a foundational study, Oates (1972) posits that central governments find it difficult to gen-
erate optimal local variation in policy stringency. The central government may be unable to vary
stringency because it finds variation costly for political reasons or because it lacks the information
about local conditions to chose regionally-varying optimal responses. This model does not have
clear implications for the typical level of pollution; whether average pollution levels rise or fall with
decentralization will depend on how the central government aggregates preferences (Fredriksson
et al., 2010).
     The Oates model does suggest a positive association between decentralization and within-
country interjurisdictional variation in environmental quality. If the central government allows
insufficient variation in standards, decentralization will yield a higher variance in these levels as
local governments choose standards that reflect their heterogeneous preferences. Thus, an increase
in variation is a likely outcome and can be tested in practice.3
     However, destructive competition between jurisdictions might cause an association between
decentralization and pollution levels. Welfare-maximizing subnational governments will make ef-
ficient choices for local pollutants in the absence of market imperfections and redistributive policies
(Oates and Schwab, 1988; Wilson, 1996). But these conditions are unlikely in practice, raising the
possibility of destructive competition (Oates, 2002; Kunce and Shogren, 2005). Such competition
    3 Fora case in which decentralization might reduce variation, suppose preferences for in-stream water quality are
identical across regions, but consequences of different levels of emissions for in-stream water quality vary because
of hydrological or climate conditions. Since the government usually regulates (or taxes) emissions rather than in-
stream pollution, a local government may use its information to achieve an environmental outcome closer to the
optimum than the outcome the national government could achieve. My empirical analysis looks at interjurisdictional
variation conditional on some characteristics of the location, but probably not all the conditions that an optimizing
local government could consider.

may take the form of a “race to the bottom,” in which countries lower environmental standards
to compete for capital. In other situations, it may be a “race to the top” or Not in My Backyard
(NIMBY) syndrome, in which local governments raise standards to shift environmental damages
to other jurisdictions. Empirical evidence supports the view that environmental competition arises
within the U.S. federal system (Levinson, 2003; Fredriksson and Millimet, 2002).
   Interjurisdictional environmental spillovers might also create an association between decentral-
ization and pollution levels. Failing to consider the welfare of neighbors, subnational governments
may choose higher levels of pollutants that cross state borders than the national government would
choose (Silva and Caplan, 1997). Studies report empirical evidence of such free riding within
the United States (Helland and Whitford, 2003; Sigman, 2005; Gray and Shadbegian, 2004) and
within Brazil (Lipscomb and Mobarak, 2011), although some research does not support free riding
(Konisky and Woods, 2010). Free riding would increase the level of pollution with decentralization
for regional pollutants, such as BOD, but not for local pollutants, such as fecal coliform.
   Strategic decision-making in the central government may also create effects. Besley and Coate
(2003) conclude that the central government may provide too much of local public goods when
regional spillovers arise, as a result of strategic voting for representatives to the central legislature.
Thus, they would predict that pollution would rise with decentralization; in contrast to the effects
of destructive competition and spillover, however, this increase would improve welfare.
   Finally, a few authors have advanced hypotheses about interest group influence and regula-
tory capture at different levels of government. Bardhan and Mookherjee (2000) argue that local
governments may be more or less subject to capture, depending on factors such as within- and
across-district heterogeneity in voters and relative voter awareness of local and national politics.
In the environmental policy literature, some argue that industry groups can better afford to have
informed staff in many places and thus are more influential at the subnational level (Esty, 1996).
Others have argued that interest groups must overcome a spending threshold to be heard at a na-
tional level. Such a threshold would imply that centralization works in favor of industry, whereas

national politics (Revesz, 2001).



2      Data

2.1      Data on water quality

The U.N.’s GEMS/Water provides data on various water quality measures in rivers, lakes, and
groundwater (United Nations, 2009). This study focuses specifically on the data for rivers, which
account for most of the observations. GEMS/Water reports triennial average pollution levels from
1979 through 1999. Figure 1 shows the location of the river monitoring stations (in 47 countries)
that report the pollutants studied here.4 The possibility of endogenous participation by countries in
GEMS/Water is addressed later in the paper. Most stations do not report pollution in every triennial
period: the mean number of observations per station is 4.1 out of a possible 7.
     Two pollutants are used in the analysis, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal col-
iform. These pollutants are very common; both arise mostly from release of human and agricul-
tural wastes into rivers. They are also commonly reported in the GEMS data, providing a relatively
large number of observations for analysis.5 The two pollutants differ greatly in their potential for
downstream transport. BOD has much slower natural attenuation and may affect the rivers tens
of kilometers downstream of its source, whereas fecal coliform affects at most several kilometers
of the river. Thus, BOD may give rise to substantial interjurisdictional spillovers, whereas fecal
coliform will spill over only very near borders.
    4 Stationslocated on rivers when they form an international border have been excluded because it is difficult to as-
sign country characteristics (including decentralization) to these stations. For each pollutant, this restriction eliminated
15 stations, mostly in Europe.
   5 Other commonly available measures in GEMS/Water are either related to BOD (dissolved oxygen, chemical oxy-

gen demand) or from more types of specific source (e.g., nitrates) and thus less general characterizations of pollution.
A companion database, GEMS/Air, provides data for air pollution, but only for major cities, so the geographic spread
within countries is insufficient to provide the interjurisdictional variation measures studied here. In Sigman (2008), I
analyzed the cross-country association between the level of air pollution and decentralization using these GEMS/Air
data and did not find a statistically significant association.

                         Figure 1: GEMS river monitoring stations used in the analysis

       Table 1 reports the statistics for the two pollutants. The average concentrations for both pollu-
tants are very high.6 The average concentrations are 5.4 mg/l of BOD and over 10,000 colonies/100
ml of fecal coliform. For comparison, rivers with BOD higher than 4 mg/l or fecal coliform higher
than 2,000 colonies/100 ml would not be acceptable for any recreational use according to the Re-
sources for the Future Water Quality Ladder (Vaughan, 1986). Medians are not as bad: 2.2 mg/l
for BOD (acceptable for swimming) and 920 colonies/100 ml for fecal coliform (acceptable for
fishing).
       GEMS reports a mean pollution level for measurements taken at different times during the
three-year period, with little information about the timing of these measurements. The third row
in Table 1 reports that the observations are based on an average of 31 measurements in nonfederal
country and 26 in federal countries, or about 8 to 10 a year.7 However, the number of measure-
      6 Fecal
            coliform has some exceedingly high values, with concentrations in the millions of colonies per 100 ml,
concentrations that would characterize raw sewage and probably represent data entry errors. Concentrations above the
95th percentile (200,000 colonies/100 ml) have been discarded for the rest of the analyses; including these observations
did not change any of the substantive results below.
    7 Stations may report one pollutant but not the other in a given period, so the samples are somewhat different for

the two pollutants. For simplicity, the two samples are pooled in Table 1 because the differences in sample statistics
were very small.

estimated equations use the number of measurements as weights to address the heteroskedasticity
from this variation.


2.2    Explanatory variables

Decentralization measures.        An ideal measure of decentralization in environmental policy is
difficult to construct for both practical and conceptual reasons. First, countries use very differ-
ent regulatory structures, so a single metric of the extent of environmental decentralization is not
available. Second, statutory rules may be a poor guide for true power. For example, in the U.S.,
the federal government sets most environmental standards, but states implement and enforce these
standards (Sigman, 2003). States exercise substantial discretion in setting allowable water pollu-
tion permits, despite what would appear to be clear federal standards (GAO, 1996). Third, envi-
ronmental regulation may not be the only government function to affect pollution. Pollution also
depends on decisions about land use and spending on sewage treatment, which may not be in the
portfolio of an environmental agency or ministry.
   For these reasons, this paper uses two general definitions of decentralization, both common
in previous literature. One measure is a categorization of countries into federal and nonfederal
systems from the established political science literature on federalism (see, e.g., Treisman, 2002).
This measure has the advantage of being exhaustive in coverage and of characterizing a broad
range of government functions, including policies such as command-and-control regulation that
may have limited fiscal impact.
   A second measure is expenditure decentralization: the ratio of subnational (state, provincial,
and local) government spending to total governmental spending, netting out intergovernmental
transfers. Expenditure decentralization has the advantage of varying over time, allowing analyses
with fixed effects. However, expenditure decentralization is not consistently available, with much
sparser coverage in lower income and non-federal countries.

                                                 8
    The World Bank (2001) provides an expenditure decentralization measure, based on data from
the International Monetary Fund’s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) (International Monetary
Fund, 2005).8 Using GFS, I calculated an additional version of expenditure decentralization that
excludes national defense spending because defense is a large and exclusively national category
of spending. The additional information requirements for the defense-free measure decrease the
number of available observations. The overall correlation between the two measures is very high,
so this modified measure is used only in fixed effects equations where time-series variation in de-
fense spending might be a concern.9 Both expenditure decentralization measures may reflect high
frequency budgetary shocks that are irrelevant to the relative power of national and subnational
authorities. The data set partially addresses this concern by using three-year averages, which also
match the GEMS reporting periods.
    Table 1 divides the observations according to the qualitative federalism measure. GEMS sta-
tions are found in both federal and nonfederal countries, with the later only somewhat more com-
mon. Federalism and expenditure decentralization are closely related; subnational expenditure
shares average 38% in federal countries, compared to 18% in other countries.10 Data on expendi-
ture decentralization is also much more common in federal countries, with 22% missing in federal
countries and 40% missing in other countries. As Table 1 reports, average pollution levels are
higher for both pollutants in the federal countries.
    Figure 2 provides summary information on expenditure decentralization by country to illustrate
the range of values across countries and over time. The ranges are presented for those countries
   8 When   I recalculated these values directly from GFS, a few values differed from the World Bank and more ob-
servations were missing. The difference probably stems from different versions of the GFS. Because the World Bank
has greater coverage, the equations primarily use the World Bank values, with my calculations filled in for a few
observations that were otherwise missing.
    9 Since 1990, environmental protection is a category of GFS expenditures, which presents the prospect of a more

specific expenditure decentralization measure. However, this variable is only present from 1998 onward, too late to be
useful here, and even then for very few countries.
   10 Treisman (2002) reports that expenditure decentralization measure is also highly correlated with other qualitative

measures of decentralization from countries’ constitutions and moderately correlated with the frequency of elected
subnational governments.

that are the basis of the fixed effects equations below. The values appear to be fairly stable in
most countries. The countries experiencing the greatest changes over time are in Latin America.
Argentina experienced the greatest change, an increase followed by stabilization in the later part of
the period. Mexico saw the second largest change, also with generally increasing decentralization.
The expenditure decentralization data are thus consistent with other accounts of declining central
government power in Latin American countries in the 1970s and 1980s (Gibson, 2004). The
limited number of countries exhibiting large changes in decentralization means that results of fixed
effects equations should be interpreted with caution.


                                                                                             10
Other explanatory variables.           Several other characteristics of countries are included. First, na-
tional per capita income may affect the costs of pollution control and the benefits of water quality.
The Penn World Table provides annual income levels standardized for cross-country comparisons
(Heston et al., 2011). As Table 1 reports, countries that participate in GEMS/Water have high in-
come on average; European countries in particular are overrepresented. The relatively high-income
population may be desirable because countries must have binding environmental restrictions for
any effect of decentralization to be detected.
    Second, earlier research has suggested that more democratic governments choose lower pollu-
tion than autocratic regimes (Congleton, 1992; Barrett and Graddy, 2000; Deacon and Saha, 2006).
Because more authoritarian governments may also tend to be more centralized, it is important to
consider this factor in the estimated equations. The equations include the score from the Polity
IV project (Marshall et al., 2011). The polity score ranges from -10 (hereditary monarchy) to +10
(consolidated democracy).
    Third, studies have found that corruption plays an important role in environmental outcomes
(Welsh, 2004; Damania et al., 2003) and that decentralization or federalism is a source of corrup-
tion (Fisman and Gatti, 2002; Treisman, 2000). The International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)
provides annual corruption scores for countries, based on surveys of professionals (PRS Group,
2007).11 Higher scores indicate lower perceived corruption. Consistent with earlier literature, Ta-
ble 1 reports that federal countries in our data are somewhat more corrupt, with an average ICRG
score of 3.6 compared to 4.1 for nonfederal countries.
    Population may also affect water quality, principally by determining uncontrolled pollution
levels. I used a Geographic Information System to calculate population within 20 kilometers of
each GEMS station, using the the station’s latitude and longitude and the Gridded Population of the
World 3 (CIESIN, 2005). Population grids are available for 1990, 1995, and 2000. For other years,
  11 ICRG does not provide data for three countries in the GEMS data (Fiji, Laos, and Cambodia), which are therefore

dropped. Corruption scores are available from 1984 onward; the value for the country in 1984 was used for earlier
years.



                                                        11
local population variables are linearly interpolated or extrapolated. To provide better time-series
population information, the equations also include annual country population density.
     Three river characteristics are also included in the equations. The river flow determines dilu-
tion and thus the effect of a given amount of waste on in-stream pollution concentrations. Rivers
also vary in the rate of natural attenuation of pollutants; water temperature is an important deter-
minant of this rate. GEMS provides time-varying measures of both flow and temperature. A final
non-time-varying river characteristic is the river basin area upstream of the station; although this
variable is closely related to flow, it may help capture the total waste inputs affecting the river at
the monitoring station.



3      Results for pollution levels

The first set of estimated equations examine the effect of decentralization on pollution levels and
have the form:


    log pict = f (Dct , GDPct , GOVct , DENSct , LOCALPOPict , Rict ,UPCHARict ) + αt + µic + εict , (1)


where pict is the mean pollution concentration at station i in country c in three-year period t; Dct
is the measure of decentralization; GDPct is annual per capita GDP; GOVct is the quality of gov-
ernment (political rights and corruption); DENSct is country population density; LOCALPOPict is
local population; and Rict are river characteristics (flow, temperature, and upstream basin area).
One equation for each pollutant also includes UPCHARict , which includes a dummy variable for
whether the station is within 100 km downstream of a different country and, if so, the character-
istics of the upstream country. These variables are intended to reflect the upstream country’s con-
tributions to pollution that has flowed downstream to this spot. Effects for the three-year period,
αt , are included to capture changes over time in pollution control technologies and environmental



                                                   12
preferences. In Table 4, the equations also include station fixed effects, µic .
    A log-log functional form was chosen for equation (1) because factors that affect the uncon-
trolled pollution levels, such as population and river flow, should have effects that are multiplica-
tive. However, GDP variables enter the equations with a cubic in levels to allow the nonlinearities
found by the “environmental Kuznets curve” literature. The two scores (democracy and corrup-
tion) are also entered linearly because there seems no basis for rescaling them; results for the
coefficients on the decentralization variables are not sensitive to this choice.


3.1      Pooled equations for pollution levels

For BOD and coliform respectively, Tables 2 and 3 present the results of equations without fixed
effects, taking advantage of both cross-section and time-series variation. Errors are clustered by
country to address the potential correlation in errors within a country at a given time and over time
at the same station.12
    In the first column of Table 2, the qualitative federalism measure has a positive and statistically
significant coefficient, suggesting higher BOD levels in federal countries. In the second column,
the expenditure decentralization variable has a small and statistically insignificant coefficient. This
coefficient is not much changed by the inclusion of upstream country characteristics in column 3,
although the characteristics themselves are jointly statistically significant.
    Column 4 in Table 2 presents instrumental variables (IV) estimates to address possible en-
dogeneity of expenditure decentralization. Following a study of decentralization by Fisman and
Gatti (2002), the instruments for expenditure decentralization are the categories for the origin of a
country’s legal system from La Porta et al. (1999). This approach provides identification only of
cross-sectional differences; it cannot be used in the fixed effects analyses that follow. The point
  12 I use least squares estimates with corrected standard errors rather than random effects models to avoid the
need to assume that country-specific unobserved factors are uncorrelated with the decentralization measures. A
heteroskedacity-robust version of the Hausman test strongly rejects random effects in favor of fixed effects for both
pollutants.

estimate on decentralization is higher in the IV equation, but is not statistically significant. A
Hausman test fails to reject exogeneity of expenditure decentralization (p = .13).
    Table 3 repeats the same equations for fecal coliform. The point estimates on both the qualita-
tive federalism variable and the decentralization variable are negative, but not statistically signifi-
cant in any equation. As with the earlier estimates, inclusion of the upstream country characteris-
tics in column (3) does not much affect the results, although the upstream country characteristics
are jointly statistically significant. In column (4), the IV coefficient on decentralization is even
more negative than the weighted least squares estimates, but still not statistically significant. The
Hausman test again fails to reject the exogeneity of decentralization (p = .39) in the equations for
this pollutant. Thus, the results for coliform do not provide any support for a race to the bottom,
which would give rise to a positive relationship between pollution and decentralization.
    The equations in Tables 2 and 3 include several other country characteristics. For both BOD
and fecal coliform, the GDP coefficients have an inverted U-shape in the relevant range, with peak
pollution around $10,000 per capita (in 2005 dollars) for both pollutants. The GDP coefficients are
not jointly statistically significant for BOD but are for fecal coliform.13 The corruption score has
a statistically significant positive coefficient in some equations for each pollutant, which suggests
that more corrupt countries provide poorer environmental quality and is consistent with the earlier
literature (Welsh, 2004; Damania et al., 2003).
    By contrast, the estimates do not support an important role for political freedom. The coeffi-
cient on the democracy score is not statistically significant in any equation. Earlier studies have
similarly found that water pollution may not be as responsive to political rights as some other en-
vironmental variables; for example, Barrett and Graddy (2000) do not find statistically significant
effects of scores for political rights and civil freedoms on many water pollutants.
   13 The failure to find statistically significant coefficients for BOD is not consistent with Grossman and Krueger

(1995) or with Bradford et al. (2005); the latter conclude that BOD is more likely to have an inverted U-shape than
fecal coliform is. However, the current specification includes many variables absent from environmental Kuznets
curve equations and the relationship is known to be very sensitive to specification (Harbaugh et al., 2002).

    The local population variable has the expected positive coefficients and is statistically signifi-
cant in some equations in Tables 2 and 3. The point estimate, however, is substantially less than
one, suggesting that pollution does not increase in proportion to population. Some of the river
characteristics also show the expected effects. Higher river flow reduces BOD levels, consistent
with the hypothesis that it tends to dilute pollution, but is not statistically significant for coliform.
Higher temperature is associated with statistically significantly higher fecal coliform, but not BOD.
Upstream basin area enters with statistically significant positive coefficients for BOD, but not for
fecal coliform; this difference may reflect the regional nature of BOD and local nature of fecal
coliform.


3.2     Station fixed effects equations for pollution levels

In Table 4, the equations include monitoring-station fixed effects to check the robustness of the
estimated coefficients. The fixed effects may help address concerns about the selection of moni-
toring locations by removing unobserved heterogeneity in characteristics of the chosen locations.
They also subsume unobserved heterogeneity across countries. The fixed effect equations identify
the coefficients only from time series variation and restrict the analysis to the expenditure decen-
tralization measure.
    When station fixed effects are added in Table 4, the results support an effect of expenditure
decentralization on BOD, but not fecal coliform. For BOD, the coefficient is statistically signif-
icant and positive, with an elasticity of BOD levels to expenditure decentralization of .188.14 A
somewhat higher point estimate emerges when the decentralization measure excludes national de-
fense spending in column (2), which is consistent with expenditure decentralization containing
measurement error when defense is included. In the fecal coliform equations, the coefficients are
not statistically significant for either measure of decentralization. The coliform estimates are also
  14 The  coefficient on decentralization is both larger in absolute value and more precisely estimated with the station
fixed effects than without them. The increase in the coefficient may indicate that unobserved heterogeneity in pollution
is negatively correlated with decentralization. The expansion in the sample does not explain the change.

very unstable across the equations. Interjurisdictional spillovers might explain the presence of an
effect for BOD, but not for coliform: free riding would lead to higher levels of the regional pollu-
tant, but not the local one. However, only a few countries exhibit significant time-series variation
in expenditure decentralization, so these results are at best suggestive.15
    The coefficients on other covariates also differ between the pooled and fixed effects equations.
The GDP coefficients are not jointly statistically significant in any of the fixed effects equations,
consistent with earlier studies that find that fixed effects greatly reduce the evidence for an in-
verse U-shape pollution-income relationship (e.g., Harbaugh et al., 2002; Bradford et al., 2005).
In the fixed effects equations for BOD in Table 4, control of corruption has a counterintuitive pos-
itive coefficient that is statistically significant. Rapidly improving conditions in Eastern European
countries are the largest change in corruption over time in these data; the coefficient may reflect
worsening of (reported) pollution in this region.16
    The monitoring station characteristics, many of which had statistically significant coefficients
in the pooled equations, are no longer statistically significant with the station fixed effects. Typical
geographic characteristics, such as the usual temperature and flow, may matter more to pollution
than fluctuations in these values do. In addition, the local population variable is based on only
three snapshots and may not adequately capture time series changes in the true value.



4     Interjurisdictional variation in pollution

Decentralization may affect not just the level of pollution but also the variance in these levels
across jurisdictions. GEMS/Water provides an opportunity to explore interjurisdictional variation
   15 However, the country with the highest time series variation, Argentina (see Figure 2) does not drive the results;

dropping Argentina yields point estimates for the BOD that are slightly higher and still statistically significant.
   16 In equations not shown in Table 4, the log of government spending per capita (based on Penn World Table data)

was added as an explanatory variable. The coefficient on this new variable was negative, but statistically insignificant,
in the equations for both pollutants. With this variable included, the coefficients on all the decentralization variables
are slightly lower in absolute value, but remain statistically significant at the 5% level for BOD. Since government
spending is one of the mechanisms through which decentralization may affect pollution, this variable is potentially
endogenous and thus is not included in the central specification.


                                                          19
in pollution levels because it has multiple monitoring stations within a country. To create a measure
of interjurisdictional variation, I assigned each GEMS station to a sub-national jurisdiction, using
the station’s latitude and longitude and the highest level of administrative regions in the country
from the UN’s Global Administrative Unit Layers spatial database.
    A two-step approach was used to calculate variation across regions. In the first step, log pollu-
tion levels are regressed on station-level characteristics and a fixed effect, γct , for the country and
period of the observation:


                             log pict = g(LOCALPOPict , Rict ) + γct + εict .                       (2)


where local population, LOCALPOPict , and river characteristics (flow and temperature), Rict , en-
tered in cubics for flexibility. The errors εict were then averaged for each subnational region. The
interjurisdictional variation was calculated as the standard deviation for these regional values for
country c in period t, sdct (ε).
    The second stage, which is reported in Table 5, uses this variation as the dependent variable.


                         sdct (ε) = h(Dct ,CountryCharct ) + αtsd + νcsd + ηct .                    (3)


The equation includes decentralization, Dct , and other country characteristics, CountryCharct .
Time and country effects (now αtsd and νcsd ) can still be included.
    The equations in Table 5 include either federalism or expenditure decentralization as the ex-
planatory variable of interest. The equations in columns (1) and (4) start with only two other
country characteristics, country population, POPct , and country area, AREAc . Both variables are
associated with greater decentralization (see Table 1), probably because larger countries are more
difficult to run centrally. At the same time, these variables may affect interjurisdictional variation.
In particular, countries with larger areas may have more diverse physical environments and thus
greater variation in pollution levels. Other equations include the full set of country characteristics

                                                   20
used above, although it is unclear what association to expect with most of these variables.
   The mean number of jurisdictions represented for a country-period observation is only 5.9 for
BOD and 5.2 for fecal coliform. As a result, the standard deviation estimates contain a large
amount of noise. Observations are weighted by the number of jurisdictions to address resulting
heteroskadacity. However, the hypothesis tests may lack power because of the limited available
information. Thus, a definitive study of interjurisdictional variation may await a more extensive
international data collection effort.
   The equations in Table 5 suggest a relationship between decentralization and interjurisdictional
variation, but only through the qualitative federalism measure. The point estimates of this coeffi-
cient are positive and statistically significant for both pollutants.
   Expenditure decentralization has coefficients that are positive but not statistically significant
for either pollutant. Equations with country fixed effects (not shown in Table 5) also did not yield
statistically significant coefficients on expenditure decentralization. The point estimates on expen-
diture decentralization in the fixed effects equations are negative and thus should be viewed as
weakening the suggestion of a positive relationship with expenditure decentralization with varia-
tion in columns (3) and (6) of Table 5. To address concerns about possible endogeneity of expen-
diture decentralization, the equations in columns (3) and (6) were also estimated using the legal
origin instruments used in Tables 2 and 3. Hausman tests fail to reject exogeneity of expenditure
decentralization (p-value of .45 for BOD and .30 for coliform). These estimates also do not yield
consistently positive coefficients on expenditure decentralization.
   A positive effect of federalism on interjurisdictional variation is consistent with the traditional
view of decentralization: when localities have more power, they choose environmental quality lev-
els to correspond to local tastes and costs, resulting in greater heterogeneity than under central
authority. Several explanations might be offered for the finding that the qualitative federalism vari-
able has a statistically significant coefficient whereas expenditure decentralization does not. One
possibility is that this reflects data limitations. The loss of observations due to lack of expenditure

decentralization data may pose an obstacle to estimating this coefficient.17 However, it is also
possible that the federalism variable more accurately measures the powers necessary for localities
to differentiate their provision of the good. Expenditure decentralization may not extend local
government power into the relevant regulatory sphere.
     In the equations in Table 5, a few country characteristics beyond federalism are associated
with interjurisdictional variation. Country population has the expected positive coefficient, which
is statistically significant in all equations for coliform. Country area has a negative coefficient,
but this unexpected coefficient is statistically significant at the 5 percent level only in column (5).
The variation in BOD has a statistically significant relationship with per capita GDP in column
(3); the point estimates suggest an everywhere positive relationship within the sample range. The
relationship appears in only one set of estimates and does not have any evident conceptual basis.
Interestingly, control of corruption has a negative and statistically significant negative coefficient
in column (3). A negative relationship might arise if more corrupt countries enforce environmen-
tal laws less consistently. However, this effect is not at all robust, with positive point estimates
appearing in several other equations.



5      Selection of countries

This section addresses the possibility of nonrandom selection of countries into the GEMS/Water
data. It reports models that endogenize participation in a country-year, using the Penn World Table
as the universe of possible participants. A selection model is estimated with two equations —
one for pollution level or interjurisdictional variation in pollution and one for participation — with
possibly correlated errors.
     The participation equation includes all of the covariates in the main equation. To avoid iden-
    17 Running the equation with the federal variable on the sample with non-missing expenditure decentralization yields

coefficients on federalism of similar magnitude to columns (1) and (4); the federalism coefficient is statistically sig-
nificant for coliform, but not BOD.

For the coefficients, the standard errors in parenthesis are adjusted for clustering at the country level.
All equations also include time period and UN region effects.
Equations for levels also include a cubic in per capita GDP, political rights, corruption, and population
density. Equations for variation also include country area and country population.


tification by functional form alone, the selection equation also includes a variable that is excluded
from the main equation: whether or not the country sits on the 40 member Governing Council
of the UN Environment Program, the program responsible for GEMS. Membership in the Gov-
erning Council was collected biannually and changes substantially over time. This variable does
have statistically-significant positive effects on the probability of participation in GEMS/Water in
the estimated models. The two equations are jointly estimated using maximum likelihood estima-
tion (MLE), assuming the errors are normally distributed, and errors are clustered as before at the
country level.
   Table 6 presents estimates of the coefficient on the federal country dummies with and without
the selection equation. The first column presents WLS estimates for comparison to the estimates

with selection.18 The results do not suggest much selection bias in the earlier estimates. Wald tests,
reported in the third column of Table 6, fail to reject the hypothesis that the correlation between the
main equation and the participation equation, ρ, equals zero for most equations. The one exception
is the equation for variation in the BOD level across provinces, where the hypothesis that ρ = 0
can be rejected at the 5% level. For all equations, however, the selection-corrected model does
not yield materially differently coefficients on the federalism variables. Thus, the results presented
earlier appear robust to possible concerns about selection in country participation in GEMS/Water.



6       Conclusion

A substantial literature addresses the question of optimal decentralization in public goods provi-
sion. This paper empirically tests some of the most basic hypotheses from this literature. It looks
specifically at two public bads, a pollutant with interjurisdictional spillovers and a pollutant with
local effects.
     The empirical evidence does not suggest higher overall pollution levels with greater decen-
tralization. Thus, the results do not support destructive regulatory competition in the form of a
“race to the bottom.” A few equations do suggest the possibility of higher levels of the regional
pollutant; if this effect does exist, it could result from interjurisdictional free riding. In addition,
the empirical analysis suggests higher interjurisdictional variation in pollution in countries with
federal systems. Such variation supports the traditional view of Oates (1972) that decentralization
allows better tailoring of policies to local conditions and thus improves in economic efficiency.




    18 The equations for pollution levels in column 1 differ from those previously presented in Tables 2 and 3; the
equations for the variation are the same as in Table 5. For the pollution levels equations, the country-period fixed
effects, γct from equation 2 are now the dependent variables; the first stage allows a more flexible functional form for
the station characteristics. The coefficient on federalism is no longer statistically significant for BOD with the revised
specification.
