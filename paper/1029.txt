                 Labor   Force Entry and Exit of Older Men:
                             A Longitudinal Study


                                  ABSTRACT



    The labor force participation rate of older men under age 65 has shown
a significant recent decline. Cross—sectional studies linking early re-

tirement to increased Social Security income have also made explicit or

implicit temporal projections of changes in participation in response to

changes in benefits. However, use of cross—sectional estimates for projec-

tion purposes may run into several problems, including temporal dependence

of the participation decision. This paper uses 2—year longitudinal data

for men aged 58—62 in 1969 in order to trace changes in labor force beha-

vior near retirement age. Results indicate significant effects of poor

health, initial assets, and initial pension eligibility on the probabili-

ties of exit and entry from the labor force. Social Security benefits are

found to have insignificant or unexpected effects. The results also indi-

cate evidence of temporal dependence of participation, suggesting caution

in interpreting projections of cross—section estimates.

        Introduction
     There has been a significant recent decrease in the labor force par—
 ticipation rates of older mcii   under   age 65.    In the   55—64   age group the
 participation rate was 75.8 per cent in 1975 as opposed to 86.8 per cent in
 1960. On the other hand, there has been rapid concurrent growth in two
 major sources of early retirement income ——        Social   Security and non—Social

 Security pensions. The two major sources of Social Security growth have

 been Disability Insurance (DI) benefit payments, which increased in real

terms from $.8 billion in 1960 to $6.7 billion in 1975, and Old Age (OA)

benefits, which increased in real terms from $11.4 billion to $34.1 billion

over the same period. In addition non—Social Security pension benefits

increased in real terms from $6.3 billion to $25.9 billion.

    Most previous survey research dealing with self—reported causes for

retirement had found poor health to be dominant.' For example, Schwab

(1974) found that 65 per cent of men aged 58—63 who left the labor

force in 1969 mentioned health as the reason for withdrawal. However,

recent research regarding actual work decisions have found economic

variables such as Social Security or other pension benefits to be important

determinants of retirement among the elderly.

    Most studies of the effect of Social Security and pensions on labor

force   participation have focused on the effect of the Old—Age system and

pensions on retirement,2 while other studies have examined the effect




    'For an exhaustive list of references, see Boskin (1977). Self—
reported responses may be misleading since it may be socially acceptable to
state poor health as a reason for retirement.

oI Disability Insurance on labor force participation.3 These studies have

primarily utilized cross—section data, and almost all, have found Social

Security and pensions to have significant negative effects on par-

ticipation. Many of these studies have then used these estimates to pre-

dict the effect of (temporal) changes in Social Security benefits and tax

rates on the participation probability.4'5

   However, use of cross—section estimates to predict time—oriented beha-

vior may have several drawbacks. First, the variables in a cross section

represent equilibrium values, and therefore lags in the individual par-

ticipation decision are not allowed for as would be the case with longitu-

dinal or panel data.                                 -




    Secondly, cross—section estimates do not capture the effect of struc-
tural changes over time in Social Security and other pension programs on

individual behavior.

    Thirdly, in looking at an individual's sequential participation deci-

sion, there may   be   dependence among the decisions at different points in

time. That is, an individual may be more likely to work (not work) in

period t 11 they worked (didn't work) in period t—l. ThIs problem of

temporal dependence is discussed in more detail in the next section.

If temporal dependence is present, cross—section data may    be   inadequate




    3See Berkowitz, et al (1976), Parsons (1980a,b). Most of these studies
use samples of middle aged men or men aged 18—64.

    4Parsoris (1980a) used cross—section estimates to predict trends in non-
participation from 1948—1966 for males aged 48—62. Other predictions have
been implicitly temporal, since changes in Social Security parameters are
legislated over time.

    5The primary tax rate examined has been the so—called "earnings test,
whereby there Is an implicit tax consisting of a 50—cent reduction in
retirement benefits for every dollar earned above an exempt amount.

in ptedicting the sequential participation probability of an individual, as
well as    the participation rate of a given age group of individuals.

       In order to   attempt to address and examine these problems, this paper
uses    a longitudinal sample of older men extracted from the Longitudinal

Retirement Study (LRHS). Although these men are traced over only a two-

year period, the effect of changes in Social Security benefits, pension

coverage, and other variables on labor force entry and exit at or near

retirement age can be examined.

    Section II examines more closely the issue of temporal dependence,

while Section III presents the empirical Implementation and results.


II. Temporal Dependence of Labor Force Participation

   The problem of temporal dependence of the labor force participation

decision has been discussed by authors such as Heckman and Willis (1977),

Ben—Porath (1973), Long and Jones (1980), and Taubman and Rosen (1982).

   An example of temporal dependence is shown in Figure 1.

    The two parallel lines show the relationship between labor force par—

ticipation   (LFP)   and time (t), for two values of the independent variable
(X1 and X2). A cross—section estimate of X would measure the distance D

between the two lines for some point in time (tj). A regression using

longitudinal data would be measuring the effect of a change in X on the

change in participation over time, dLFP. In Figure 1, we would then
                                   dt

be comparing the slopes of the two lines for different values of X.

Since the lines are parallel, dLFP would be the same for both X because
                               dt

of temporal dependence in the participation decisicin. Therefore, the

cross—section estimate could not be used to predict individual labor force

participation over time.

    Several sources of temporal dependence have been noted in the litera-

ture, two of which are discussed here.6 The first source is known as

"true"   dependence (Heckman and Willis (1976), Ben—Porath (1973)). This
occurs if there are transactions costs of working. This would include

fixed costs of working, employee search costs, costs of not working, or

employer hiring costs. For example, if there are fixed costs of working

and the individual is out of the labor force, the condition that the wage

exceed the shadow price of time may not be sufficient to induce participation,




    6One source of dependence not discussed here is known as "apparent"
state dependence (Heckman and Willis, 1977). This is caused by permanent
unobserved differences among observationally identical individuals which
may persist over time. Heckman and Willis show that cross—section estima-
tes may be used to predict the sequential participation behavior of an
average Individual within a group; however, this estimate will differ from
the average behavior of the group itself.
                                            —5—

     since a gap is induced between the shadow price of time and the reservation

     wage.7 An example of costs of not working is found with       the   Disability

     Insurance (DI) program. The DI program requires an applicant for benefits

     to have been disabled for at least five months (six months prior to 1972)

     before they can receive benefits. This time cost of this "waiting period"

     (in addition to any delays in the processing of the application) will be

     valued at the individualts pre—application earnings. As a result, an

     increase in DI benefits for a worker may cause the shadow price of time to

     rise above the market wage; however, application costs may prevent the

    individual from dropping out of the labor force an4 applying for

    benefits.8                                             -



          A    second major source of temporal dependence are variables which are
-   time—varying.      Examples of this are changes in   residence, changes in
    health,     or changes in non—labor income (such as Social Security benefits).

    For   example, we might expect an initial deterioration in health to strongly
    affect the sequential participation probability of an individual, but would
    expect     the effect of any subsequent worsening to "die off" over time.

          As   a result of these two sources of temporal dependence, we may be
    unable     to predict individual sequential participation behavior using




        7The concept of fixed costs of working is discussed by Cogan (1981) and
    Hausman (1980).

    8Although there is no direct evidence linking the decision to apply for
DI benefits and the decision not to work, the presence of the aforeinen—
tioned "waiting period," as well as the decision to apply as a result of a
past or present disability, point to equivalence of the two decisions.
This equivalence is assumed by authors such as Parsons (1980a,b)

LIII. Data     and Empirical tmplementatiori

    We will attempt here to examine the effect of Social Security and other

variables on changes in labor force participation over time, as well as to

test for the presence of temporal dependence in the participation decision.

The empirical framework Involves the estimation of separate equations

measuring the probability of exit from and entry Into the labor force.

    The micro data used for estimation are taken from the 1969 original

sample and the 1971 reinterview sample of the Longitudinal Retirement

History Study (LRHS). The final sample extracted consisted of 2991 males

aged 58—62 in 1969 who were insured by the Social Security system based on

their past earnings and employment.9''0
    The labor force behavior of these men was determined for 1968 and 1970,

the year previous to each Interview. This was to minimize the effect of

transitory factors on labor force behavior. The labor force activity for

these men between 1968 and 1970 was given by the following totals (where

NLF =   not   in labor force):




    91n order to be insured for both DI and retirement (OASI) benefits, the
Individual must have had at least 20 quarters of coverage during the
40—quarter period ending with the quarter in which a disability may have
begun (Disability Insured status). This is In addition to having the suf-
ficient quarters of coverage for OASI benefits.
   10The original 1969 LRHS sample was aged 58—63. However, we eliminated
those aged 63 in 1969 (age 65 in 1971) in order to distinguish between
disability benefits and early retirement benefits. At age 65, disability
benefits become regular retirement benefits under Social Security.

 Total:          2991

     Using   the above classifications, the dependent variable representing

 entry into the labor force is defined as:

                  )     0 if NLF in 1968 and NLF in 1970
     ENTRY. =
                        1   if NLF in 1968 and WORKING in 1970

     The variable representing exit from the labor force is defined as:

                  ) 0 if WORKING in 1968 and WORKING in 1970
    EXIT     =
                   (1       if WORKING in 1968 and NLF in 1970

    Table 1 defines the independent variables to be used in the EXIT and

ENTRY equations. Because of the timing of the LRHS survey, certain

variables such as marital status, assets, and age were based on current

responses given at the time of the surveys in 1969 and 1971. We will

assume here that these variables also pertain to the previous year (1968

and 1970).

    Variables measuring the individual's assets (ASSETS and ASSETS)

include the value of stocks, bonds, savings accounts, and life insurance,

as well as the net value of property or business. Increases in asset

income would be expected to increase the exit probability through the

income effect, if liesure is a normal good. In addition, if the individual

chooses to exit the labor force in order to apply for DI benefits, an

increase in assets would better enable the individual to "finance" the

application Costs involved (waiting period, delays in processing)

     The variables WAGE and WAGE measure the individuaL's initial hourly
 wage rate   and change from 1968 to 1970. There may he sample selectivity

 bias if usual missing data procedures are used for assigning wages to non—

 participants (such as the sample mean). This is because the relationship

 between selection into the working sample (participation) and the availabi-

 lity of wage data Is ignored (see Hausman (1980), Heckman (1976)). In

 order to correct for possible selectivity bias, wages were imputed for non—

workers in 1968 and 1970. The imputed wages were based on the following

log—wage regression estimated on the 1968 working subsample:

    LNWAGE       —.391 + .055 ED + .013 AGE —                .,010 RACE

where LANDA is the selectivity correction factor (inverse of Mill's

ratio)."

    The variables DIBEN and DIBEN measure the individual's potential

monthly benefits under Social Security Disability Insurance. Calculations

were based on the 1968 and 1970 benefit formulas, using past covered ear—

flings from the individual's Social Security employment record (this record

had been merged with their LRHS data). The calculated benefits were then

deflated using implicit price deflators for consumer expenditures. Note

that since potential (as opposed to actual) benefits are used, there is no

simultaneity problem In the sense of benefits depending upon labor force

participation.




    ''The imputed wages for nonworkers were based on the particular values
of the Independent variables in equation (1) for the year in question.
Unfortunately, comparable information on place of residence was not
available in the 1969 and 1971 surveys; this omission may partly explain
the low R—squared value of the wage equation.

      The   variables REDBEN and REDBEN measure potenttai Social Security
reduced retirement beneFits for 1968 and 1970, aga in calculated I ruin the
individual's    Social   Security record. These benefits were also deflated.

For individuals    aged 62—64, reduced retirement benefits represent an alter-
native early retirement source to Disability Insurance.'2
      The variable MOVE is a dummy indicating a change in address during the

2—year interval. This variable may in part reflect changing labor market

conditions. However, for this sample of older men, MOVE may largely

reflect movement to a warmer climate suitable for retirement years.

Distinguishing between the two possibilities is an 'empirical question.

      The variable ELIG is a dummy Indicating current eligibility in 1969 for

benefits from a non Social Security (private and public) pension plan. The

eligible individual is entitled to a stream of pension benefits from date

of retirement until his death. We would therefore expect the individual to

retire in order to maximize his expected benefit stream (see Taubman (1981)).13

      The variables LIMIT and GOTLIM are dummy variables indicating presence

of a self—reported health limitation in 1969 and development of a limitation




    '2At age 65, Disability Insurance benefits revert to old—age retirement
benefits under Social Security. Even though DI benefits exceed reduced
retirement benefits at a given age (since there is no reduction for DI),
persons may still choose to apply for reduced retirement benefits for such
reasons as "stigma" attached to receiving DI.

    '3There is evidence that ELIG may be endogenous. Taubman (1981) found
expected receipt of a pension to be significantly related to education,
marital status, occupation, industry, and assets. However, because ELIG
does refer to job related pensions (and because of statistical complica-
tions resulting from self—selection into pension plans) we treat ELIG as
exogenous.
    The analysis also suggests including a dummy variable for having become
eligible for a pension between 1968 and 1970. However, this variable was
not Included since length of service requirements for pension eligibility
would make this virtually identical to having worked in both 1968 and 1970.

 to apply for benefits.
    RACE is a dummy variable denoting the individual's race, and allows us

to test for black—white differences in labor force attachment among older

men. MARIT is a dummy variable representing marital status.

    ED and AGE indicate the individual's years of schooling completed and

age in 1969, respectively. These variables might he expected to affect

entry and exit by altering the individual's preference between liesure and

consumption goods over the life cycle, through their effect on personal

tasçes or home productivity (see Becker (1965), Hanoch (1976), Grossman

(1972)). For example, if schooling has the effect over time of raising the

cost of time producing household commodities (relative to the cost of

market good inputs), we would expect schooling to be negatively related to

the probability of exit from the labor force.

    In addition to more closely examining changes in participation,

separate estimation of entry and exit equations allow us to test for the

extent of temporal dependence in individual participation decisions.

    If there is no temporal dependence, then relationships normally found

in cross section relationships can be applied to longitudinal rela-

tionships. For example, if an increase in assets decreases the probability

of working in a cross—section, then an increase in assets between 1968 and

1970 would increase the probability of exiting the labor force over this

interval. Symmetrically, a decrease in assets between 1968 and 1970 would

increase the probability of entering the labor force. If the relationships

dependence.
      Additional evidence     of temporal dependence is revealed by the effect of

"initial variables" (e.g. WAGE, DIBEN, ASSETS) on the probability of entry
and exit from the labor force. Initial variables          will affect cumulative
labor force participation over time. However, only if           there is temporal

dependence would we also expect these variables to affect changes in the

participation probability (probability of entry and exit). For example, an

initial increase in the wage rate may reduce the exit probability, possibly

because of fixed costs of reentering the labor force if the individual

stops working. Therefore, significance of these initial variables in the

EXIT or ENTRY equations would imply temporal dependence.

      Table 2 shows preliminary maximum likelihood probit estimates of the

ENTRY and EXIT equations. Column (1) of each equation used the full sample

the variable COTLIM, which Included men who either had no self—reported

health limitation in the two interview dates, or developed a limitation

between the two dates. Although columns (1) and (2) of the ENTRY and EXIT

equations differed somewhat in the magnitude of the coefficient estimates,

the significance levels of the standard errors were largely unchanged.

      The Individuals' initial level of assets (ASSETS) had a significant

positive effect on the exit probability and a significant negative effect

on the entry probability. However, changes in asset income (iASSETS) had

significant effects in both equations.

      The race dummy variable (RACE) had negative coefficients in both the

ENTRY and EXIT equations, though the coefficient was significant in the

EXIT equation only. This suggests a greater labor force attachment for

 older black men; lioweve r, the nega tive   of Ccci ol RACE    in   the ENTRY equa C   [on
 suggests caution in interpreting the results.
         The presence of a self—reported limiting health condition in the ini-
 tial year (LIMIT) had significant coefficients in both equations, mdi-
 cating a positive effect of initial poor health on       the   probability of labor
 force    exit, and a negative effect on the probability of entry. Development

 of a limiting health condition (COTLIM) had the expected signs, although

 its coefficient was significant only in the ENTRY equation. Change in

address (MOVE) had a positive and significant effect in the EXIT equation,

 but an insignificant effect in the ENTRY equation. The results suggest

 that this variable is measuring movement to a warmer climate for retirement

purposes, as opposed to a labor market response.

     Present eligibility for non—Social Security pension benefits in 1969

(ELIG) was highly significant in both ENTRY and EXIT equations. Pension

eligibility was positively related to the exit probability and negatively

related to the entry probability. Though expected, this result also indi-

cates a somewhat delayed retirement response to current pension eligibi—

II ty.


    Looking at the Social Security variable, potential reduced retirement

benefits (REDBEN and LREDBEN) were insignificant in both the ENTRY and EXIT

equations. Initial potential Disability Insurance benefits (DIBEN) also

had insignificant effects. Change in DI benefits (DIBEN) had significant

coefficients in both equations, but the signs were opposite to the expected

ones (negative for EXIT and positive for ENTRY). One possible explanation

for this is that DI benefits are a positive function of past covered wages.

Therefore, DIBEN may have been picking up a permanent wage effect as

opposed to the intended income effect, whereas WAGE and M1AGE may have

actually been measures of transitory wages.

    The   other variables in Table 2 were Lnstgn[fhant:. Schooling (ED) was
positive and significant in column (I) of the EXIT   equation   hut Insignifi-
cant elsewhere.
    The empirical results also indicated a high   degree   of temporal depen-
dence   in the labor force participation decision. Partial evidence of this

was the significance of "initial" variables (ASSETS, LIMIT, ELIG) in the

exit and entry equations. Additional evidence was found in the insignifi-

cance of "change" variables (tASSETS, WAGE, 1REDBEN) which would have been

expected (in the absence of temporal dependence) to have significant

effects based on previous cross—section results. This implies the need for

caution in interpreting projections of temporal changes in participation

based on cross—section estimates, although the disappointing results here

for the Social Security variables do not allow us to make meaningful alter-

native projections.


Conclusion

    This paper has examined determinants of the declining labor force par-

ticipation rates of older men under age 65. Previous attempts to use

cross—sectional estimates to predict temporal effects of changes in Social

Security and other variables on retirement may have several potential

problems including temporal dependence of labor force participation there-

fore suggesting use of longitudinal data.

    The empirical implementation involved separate estimation of equations

measuring the probability of exit from and entry into the labor force over

a 2—year period. The sample used consisted of men aged 58—62 in 1969

extracted from the 1.969 and 1971 waves of the Longitudinal Retirement

History Study (LRRS). Among noneconomic variables, maximum likelihood pro—

bit estimates indicated significant effects of poor health (both initial

and acquired) on the probabilities of entry and exit. Anong the economic
                                   — 16 —




variables,   initial eligibility for non—Social Security pension bcneftts and

initial asset income had stgnl.ficant negative (posittve) effects   on the entry

(exit) probabilities. Social Security (retirement and Dl) benefits had

either insignificant or unexpected effects. Overall, the results indicated

temporal dependence in the participation decision, suggesting caution in

interpreting projections of cross—section estimates.

    The result obtained here pertain to a fairly short time horizon.

Examination of retirement over a longer period would, first, allow the

effects of short—term changes in Social Security benefits (as well as

"initial" changes) to be examined in a life—cycle retirement framework, and

secondly, would more fully allow for response lags in the retirement deci-

sion. Analysis of further LRHS reinterview waves from 1973 through 1979

will be of use in this matter.
