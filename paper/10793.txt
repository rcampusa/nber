New Goods and the Transition to a New Economy

                                          ABSTRACT

The U.S. went through a remarkable structural transformation between 1800 and 2000. In 1800 the

majority of people worked in agriculture. Barely anyone did by 2000. What caused the rapid demise

of agriculture in the economy? The analysis here concentrates on the development of new consumer

goods associated with technological progress. The introduction of new goods into the framework

lessens the need to rely on satiation points, subsistence levels of consumption, and the like. The

analysis suggests that between 1800 and 2000 economic welfare grew by at least 1.5 percent a year,

and maybe as much as 10 percent annually, the exact number depending upon the metric preferred.

A.          Facts

          In 1800 agriculture accounted for 46 percent of U.S. output, while 74 percent of
the U.S. population worked in agriculture. By 2000 agriculture made up 1.4 percent
of output. Less than 2.5 percent of the populace worked in agriculture. Figure 1
tells the story about the decline in agriculture.1 What could have accounted for
agriculture’s precipitous fall? The idea here is that along with economic development
many new goods are introduced. As incomes rise, expenditure gets directed toward
new products. That is consumption moves in large measure along the extensive
margin, so to speak, and not the intensive one.
          New Goods: The number of goods produced has increased dramatically since the
Second Industrial Revolution. The increase in the number of consumption goods is
hard to document. Historically, home production accounted for a large amount of
consumption. For instance, 92 percent of baked goods were made at home in 1900.2
This had dropped to 22 percent by 1965. Similarly, 98 percent of vegetables consumed
were unprocessed, as opposed to 30 percent in 1970.3 Per-capita consumption of
canned fruits rose from 3.6 pounds in 1910 to 21.6 pounds in 1950.4 In the early
1970s there were 140 vehicle models available.5 This had risen to 260 by the late
     1
         The data for agriculture’s share of income derives from four sources: (i) 1800-1830, Weiss (1994,
Tables 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4); (ii) 1840-1900, Gallman (2000, Table 1.14); (iii) 1910-1970, Historical Sta-
tistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (Series F 251); 1980-2000, Bureau of Economic
Analysis, US Department of Commerce. The numbers from Weiss (1994) were obtained by mul-
tiplying his series on output per worker by the size of the labor force (prorated by his labor-force
participation rate). The data on agriculture’s share of employment comes from three sources: (i)
1800 to 1900, Margo (2000, Table 5.3); (ii) 1910 to 1960, Lebergott (1964, Tables A1 and A2); (iii)
1970-1999, U.S. Census Bureau, US Department of Commerce.

1990s. Likewise, there were 2,000 packaged food products available in 1980 compared
with about 10,800 today.6
        Trademarks and the Number of Firms: Another measure of the rise in new goods
might be trademarks. A trademark is a symbol used by a manufacturer to distinguish
his product from others. Figure 2 shows the registration of trademarks since 1870.
This is a flow measure. It can be thought of as a proxy for the number of new
goods introduced each year. The stock of outstanding trademarks at a point in time
will be much larger. It can be estimated using data on trademark registrations and
renewals.7 Likewise, one might expect that as the number of goods and services

       For period 1891 to 1970 the data on registered trademarks and renewels was taken from Historical
Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (Series W 107 and 108). These series
were updated using data from the United States Patent and Trademark Oﬃce, US Department of
Commerce, Annual Reports. The stock of trademarks was computed as follows: Let the time-t stock
be denoted by tt . The stock of trademarks is assumed to evolve in line with

                                                                     tt+1 = δtt + [it + rt ],

in the U.S. economy increases so will the number of firms. There is some evidence
suggesting that this is the case. Figure 3 plots the number of firms per capita in the
U.S. economy.8 As can be seen, it rises.
         Consumer Expenditure Patterns: Figure 4 traces some major categories of Per-
sonal Consumption Expenditure taken from the National Income and Product Ac-
counts.9 At the turn of the last century spending on food accounted for 44 percent
of the household budget. Today it is 15 percent. The decline in food’s share of total
expenditure was matched by a rise in spending in other categories. The only other
category showing a secular decline similar to food is clothing. Until recently most
other expenditure categories were small relative to food. Spending on medical care,
which shows a rapid increase, now exceeds spending on food. Clearly the rise in
where it represents new registrations at time t, rt is renewals, and δ is the depreciation factor on
trademarks. Trademarks need to be renewed roughly every 20 years. Most of them aren’t. Now,
represent the mean of rt /(rt−20 + it−20 ) by rt /(rt−20 + it−20 ). This measures the survival rate on
trademarks. The depreciation factor on trademarks is then taken to be given by

                                         δ = [rt /(rt−20 + it−20 )]1/20 .

        This evidence is based on income tax receipts: Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial
Times to 1970 (Series V1) and the corresponding updated data taken from Internal Revenue Service,
U.S. Department of the Treasury. This data encompasses virtually all business in the U.S. and
includes corporations, partnerships, and non-farm sole proprietorships. Evidence based on data
taken from Dun & Bradshaw, Inc shows that the number of firms per capita has remained constant
— Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (Series V20). The latter series
is probably the least preferable and is biased toward large firms. It is based on financial market
dealings and excludes many types of business — those engaged in amusements, farming, finance,
insurance, one-man services, professions, and real estate. The series for the number of firms was
deflated by size of the population as recorded in the Statistical Abstract of the United States (2001,
Table 1).

medical spending was associated with the development of new goods. Figure 5 makes
this point clear with a chronology of medical innovations. Likewise, Figure 6 plots
expenditure on electricity, a component of the near stationary household operations
category shown in Figure 4. While electricity is a relatively small fraction of the
household budget, it shows a strong upward trend over the last hundred years, linked
with the development of many new electrical goods. Last, over the last century total
recreation has increased its share in the household budget. Figure 7 shows spending
on toys, a component of this category.

B.    The Analysis

     Kuznets (1957) was an early researcher to report some facts about agriculture,
both across time and space. He documented the secular decline in agriculture’s shares
of output and employment for a number of countries (see his Tables 7 and 14). He
also noted that agriculture declined with economic development in a cross section of
countries (see his Tables 3 and 10).
     Given these facts some models have been developed that connect structural trans-
formation with economic development. Two first-rate examples are Echevarria (1997)
and Laitner (2000). Laitner (2000) develops a model of the decline in agriculture and
the rise in manufacturing that occurs with economic progress. His analysis relies
on a satiation level for agricultural consumption. At a certain point an increase in
agricultural consumption provides no more utility. At this stage individuals start
consuming manufacturing goods. Echevarria’s (1997) model is quite similar. In her
setting the utility function for primary goods (read agricultural goods for the current


                                                                                                                                                                                                8
purpose) is more concave at low levels of income than are the utility functions for
manufacturing and services. Therefore, at low levels of income an individual prefers
to spend most of his income on primary goods. A subsistence level for primary goods
consumption would work in a similar way. Along these lines, restrictions on tastes and
technology that allow for tractable solutions to growth models have been developed
by Kongsamut et al. (2001). Last, Gollin et al. (2002) argue that the release of labor
from agriculture, due to gains in productivity, is an important spur in the economic
development process.
        There is nothing wrong with modelling structural change in this fashion. In fact,
it can be viewed as a shorthand for the model built here. The idea here is that at
higher levels of economic development it pays to bring new goods on line. This notion
is contained in a classic paper by Romer (1987). The application and formulation
here are diﬀerent though: the current analysis focuses on structural change and the
analysis is done within the context of a multisector model with perfect competition
and decreasing returns to scale.10 With additively separable concave utility, the
benefit from bringing a new good on line will exceed the benefit from consuming
more of an old good. Thus, the need to rely on satiation and subsistence points
in utility can be lessened (or even avoided if desired). Plus, the consumption of a
greater array of goods seems to be part and parcel of economic development. The
model developed here matches quite well the pattern of structural change observed in
  10
       In interesting work Yorukoglu (2000) connects the development of new goods with business
cycles. In his model firms must decide each period whether or not to attempt to introduce a new
product. Once a product is introduced it goes through “process innovation” over time whereby it
can be manufactured at lower and lower cost. His setup has interesting implications for economic
fluctuations. Suppose the number of products out on the market is small relative to the size of
the economy. It will be profitable for firms to attempt to introduce new products. This will lead
to a burst of product innovation and a boom. Eventually, the market may become flooded with
products. It then no longer pays to introduce a new product. So, product innovation stalls. Worse
still, process innovation implies that the existing products can be produced at lower and lower cost.
This may lead to a decline in employment. Hence, a recession ensues.

the U.S. data. An interesting question to ask is: By how much has economic welfare
increased over the last 200 years? It is easy to address this question through the eyes
of the model. The answer obtained is compared with some conventional model-free
measures of the rise in living standards.


II.      The Model

A.       Tastes and Technology

      The world is described by a three-sector overlapping-generations model. An
individual lives for two periods. The first sector in the economy produces agricultural
goods. The second manufactures a generic good, and the last sector produces new
goods.
      Tastes: Represent the momentary utility function for a person by



                          RN
  α ln(a) + ψ ln(c) + σ         ln(max(si , s))di,
                          i=0

                                                0 < α, ψ, σ < 1 and α + ψ + σ = 1.   (1)

Here a is the quantity consumed of agricultural goods. Each person also consumes a
generic manufacturing good, c, that is produced by the urban sector. The quantity
consumed of new good i is denoted by si . The term s represents a lower bound on
new goods consumption. For whatever reason, in the real world there does seem to be
some lumpiness in the consumption of goods. This would arise endogenously if there
are fixed costs associated with purchasing or consuming a good (or for that matter
producing each unit). Without this assumption an individual would unrealistically
desire to consume some amount of all goods, so long as prices are finite, albeit perhaps
in infinitesimal quantities. With this assumption an individual will want to consume
a determinate number of new goods, given a particular set of prices. Additionally,



                                                 10
this assumption permits utility to be defined when some goods aren’t consumed.11
The variable N represents the upper bound on the number of new goods that can
ever be produced.
        Sources and Uses of Income: All individuals supply one unit of labor. They
work only when young and earn the wage w. An individual can use his income for
consumption or savings. Savings is done using bonds, b, which pay gross interest at
rate r. These bonds are backed by capital. Agricultural goods and new goods can be
purchased at the prices pa and pi .
        Production: The output of agricultural goods, ya , is governed by a standard
Cobb-Douglas production function,

                                          ya = za kaλ la1−λ ,

where ka and la are the quantities of capital and labor hired in agriculture. Likewise
yc units of the generic manufacturing good can be produced using kc units of capital
  11
       Any properly specified new-goods model must define utility when some new goods aren’t
consumed.    To illustrate the issue, consider a utility function over new goods of the form
            R N ρ 1/ρ
σN ln[(1/N ) i=0 si di] , for ρ ≤ 1.This utility function is often adopted in Romer-style new-goods
models. Observe that when ρ = 0 one gets a logarithmic utility function of the form employed in
(1), ignoring the presence of the lower bound; i.e., when max(si , s) is replaced by si . While this
setup may appear to be more general than the one used here, note that for the purposes at hand,
this utility function will not be suitable for use when ρ ≤ 0 — when degree of curvature is greater
than or equal to the ln case. In this situation utility is not well defined when si = 0 for some i.
This is typically finessed by ignoring the zero terms in the utility function. That is, by defining the
                                    R
utility function to be σN ln[(1/N ) N sρi di]1/ρ , for ρ ≤ 1,where N = {i : si > 0}. In the logarithmic
case this amounts to saying that zero consumption of good si yields zero utility. Now, if this is
strictly true then no one would consume less than one unit of si , since this yields negative utility;
i.e., ln(si ) < 0 when si < 1. Therefore, this implicitly sets a lower bound on consumption of s= 1.
Hence, when this assumption is explicitly taken into account the analysis proceeds along the lines
                                                         RN
developed here. Even when 0 < ρ < 1, limsi →0 d ln[(1/N ) i=0 sρi di]1/ρ /dsi = ∞. This has the unre-
alistic feature that an individual will consume all goods so long as prices are finite, albeit perhaps
some in infinitesimal quantities.

                                           yc = zc kcω lc1−ω .

Output from this sector is used for both consumption and capital accumulation.
       Finally, a type-i new good is produced in line with

                                            yi = zi kiκ liτ .                        (2)

There is a fixed cost, φ, associated with the production of each new good i. This cost
is in terms of labor. The idea is that this fixed cost will slow down the introduction of
new goods into the economy.12 To cover the fixed cost, firms must earn profits after
meeting their variable costs. To this end, assume that there are decreasing returns to
scale in production. There is free entry into all production activity. The number of
specialized firms will be determined by a zero-profit condition. Denote the number
of firms that produce the new good i by ni . Assume that total factor productivity is
common across all types of new goods so that zi = zs for all i, s ∈ [0, N].
       Capital Accumulation: At a point in time the aggregate stock of capital will be
represented by k. The law of motion for capital is described by

                                            k0 = δk + i,

where δ is the factor of depreciation and i represents gross investment (in terms of
the generic manufacturing good). There is free mobility of capital across sectors.
       Technological Progress: Technological progress will be captured by growth in za ,
zc , and zi . As zi rises it becomes easier to recover the fixed costs associated with
producing new goods. As za and zc also rise so does consumer income, and hence
the demand for a greater number of new goods. Therefore, the number of new goods
produced will increase over time. This leads to a natural decline in agriculture’s share
of the economy.
 12
      This assumption isn’t needed for the theory.

B.     A Young Worker’s Optimization Problem

      How will a young worker choose his consumption plan? Given the form of pref-
erences (1), it’s clear that if a young worker consumes new good i then he will set
si ≥ s. Without loss of generality, order the new goods from the lowest to the highest
price and assume that a young worker chooses to consume the first I new goods when
young, and the first I o0 when old. A young worker’s optimization problem can then
be written as

                      max                    {α ln(a) + ψ ln(c) + βα ln(ao0 ) + βψ ln(co0 )            (3)

Here the superscript “o” denotes an allocation when old while the “0 ” signifies that a

with one twist: the determination of the number of new goods to consume.
      The Consumption of Each Good: Given logarithmic structure for preferences, it
is easy to solve for the quantity consumed of each good. The solution for c is given
by
                                                     ψ

                          i > s. In the equilibrium being developed all new goods

will sell at the same price, ps , so that pi = ps for all i. Hence, si = ss for all i such
that si > s; likewise, so0   o0                     o0
                        i = ss for all i such that si > s.

        The Number of New Goods: The first-order conditions for the number of new
goods consumed each period, I and I o0 , are given by

                                              ψ
                      σ[ln(sI ) − ln(s)] ≤      pI sI (with equality if I > 0),                     (8)

                  βσ[ln(so0
                         I o0 ) − ln(s)] ≤     pI o0 I 0 (with equality if I o0 > 0).               (9)
                                             c       r
Take expression (8). The value of an extra good is σ[ln(sI ) − ln(s)], the lefthand side.
This good costs pI sI . To convert this cost into utility terms multiply by the marginal
utility of first-period consumption or ψ/c to get ψpI sI /c, the righthand side. Using
(5), (6) and (7) it conveniently follows that13

                                             sI = so0
                                                   I o0 = es.                                      (10)

        Now, when will (8) and (9) hold with strict equality? It is easy to deduce that
both equations can hold tightly only when pI = p0I o0 /(r0 β). If pI < p0I o0 /(r0 β) then
  13
       Observe that as the lower bound s approaches zero the quantity of new good I consumed, sI ,
becomes infinitesimal. That is, as s falls the individual would like to consume more new goods by
consuming less of each new good. Without a lower bound on consumption, s, the individual would
like to consume the whole spectrum of new goods, albeit in infinitesimal quantities as N becomes
large. This is true in a Romer-style model, too. In the current setting with perfect competition,
as s declines the number of firms producing each new good will decline. In Romer (1987) this is
precluded by the monopoly assumption that restricts the number of firms producing each good to
be one. This limits the total number of goods that can be produced.
  The feature that a consumer would like to consume all goods when prices are finite, although
perhaps in infinitesimal quantities, is unrealistic. The lower bound on consumption, s, avoids this
problem. Another way to proceed, might be to use a utility function over new goods of the form
RN
 i=0
     U (si )di, with −M < U (0), U1 (0) < M for some M > 0. Here utility is well defined when a new
good isn’t consumed. And, at a high enough price the individual will choose not to consume a good.
This is not in the class of utility functions typically used in applied work, though. Note that parts of
the current analysis will still carry through. For instance, the equation (8) determining the number
of new goods will appear as U (sI ) − U (0) = (ψ/c)pI sI (with equality if I > 0). The intuition for
this equation is identical to (8).



                                                   14
only (8) can hold. In this situation it is optimal to consume new goods just when
young so that I o0 = 0. To summarize:

                            I ≥ 0 and I o0 = 0,        if pI < p0I o0 /(r0 β),
                            I ≥ 0 and I o0 ≥ 0,        if pI = p0I o0 /(r0 β),              (11)
                            I = 0 and I o0 ≥ 0,        if pI > p0I o0 /(r0 β).

In the subsequent analysis only the first two cases transpire. These two cases will be
referred to as Zone 1 and Zone 2.
        Discussion: Some intuition for the solution to the consumer’s problem (3) can
be gleaned from Figure 8.14 For expositional purposes, assume that the economy is
in Zone 1 and let all new goods sell at the same price pi — again, an assumption that
will be met in equilibrium under study. Now, consider the decision to consume the
marginal new good, I. How much of new good I should the agent purchase: sI = 0,
which amounts to not consuming, or some quantity sI ≥ s? The utility that an
agent derives from consuming more of new good I is shown on the diagram. If the
consumer doesn’t buy I he realizes the utility level ln(s), indicated by the rectangle.
Alternatively, if he buys the good then he will purchase more than s and experience
the utility level ln(sI ). Utility then rises in the fashion shown by the concave utility
function UU 0 . The cost of consuming new good I is shown by the straight line CC 0 .
First, by consuming I the agent loses the automatic utility level ln(s), so to speak,
associated with not consuming it — cf. (3). Second, by buying more of new good
I the agent diverts expenditure away from consuming more of the other new goods.
These goods cost the same as I and have a marginal utility of 1/si = 1/(es), the
slope of the line CC 0 . The individual will pick the consumption quantity, sI , that
equates marginal benefit and marginal cost. This will be the level associated with the
point of tangency between the two lines (as shown by the inverted triangle). Here,
ln(sI ) = ln(s) + sI /(es), which implies sI = es — c.f. (8) in conjunction with (5) and
(6).15

(1988). There is a nonconvex region in preferences, as Figure 8 clearly shows. The individual
convexifies this by moving along extensive margin. He consumes some new goods, and not others.
In the equilibrium under study, for each new good i ∈ [0, N ] the individual can be thought of
choosing the quantity si from the two-point set {0, es}. He randomly picks some new goods on the
[0, N ]-spectrum to maximize his utility. Let him choose to consume the fraction I/N of new goods
when young, and the fraction I o0 /N when old. His decision problem can be formulated as

C.        The Firms’ Problems

        First consider the firm in the generic manufacturing sector. Its problem is

                              π c = max[zc kcω lc1−ω − wlc − (r − δ)kc ].               (12)
                                      lc ,kc


Next, the problem facing a firm in the agricultural sector can be written as

                            π a = max[pa za kaλ la1−λ − wla − (r − δ)ka ].              (13)
                                    la ,ka


Perfect competition implies that factors will be paid their marginal products. Euler’s
theorem then guarantees that π c = π a = 0. From the solution to problem (12), it
is easy to deduce that the wage rate can be expressed as a function of the return
on capital and the level of TFP in the generic manufacturing sector. The solution
to problem (13) then implies that the price of agricultural goods can be expressed
as a function of the return on capital, and the levels of TFP in the agricultural and
manufacturing goods sector. Hence, write w = W (r−δ; zc ) and pa = Pa (r−δ; za , zc ).16
        Finally, turn to the production of new goods. The problem here is

                           πi = max[pi zi kiκ liτ − wli − wφ − (r − δ)ki ].             (14)
                                  li ,ki


Now, free entry into the production of new goods guarantees that profits will be zero.
Therefore,
                                                π i = 0.                                (15)

The zero-profit condition in conjunction with the solution to the firm’s problem allows
for the price of new goods to be expressed as a function of the return on capital, the
real wage rate, and the level of TFP. One can therefore write pi = Pi (r − δ; zc , zi ).17
Since zi = zs for all i, s ∈ [0, N] and Pi is not a function of i, it transpires that pi = ps
for all i and s that are produced. Note that there is really just one price to worry
about, r.

       The interested reader is referred to equations (21) and (28) in the Appendix.

       For more detail, see equation (22) in the Appendix.



                                                   17
D.        Market-Clearing Conditions

        The markets for goods and factors must clear each period. Take the goods
markets first. The market-clearing condition for generic manufacturing is

                                      c + co + k0 − δk = yc ,                                     (16)

while the one for agriculture appears as

                                            a + ao = ya .

The market for each new good requires that

                                        µi si + µoi soi = ni yi ,

where µi denotes the fraction of a generation that will consume good i. Note that
in order to have a symmetric equilibrium, the demand must be same for each new
good produced. Now, the total number of new goods produced in a period is given
by max(I, I o ). The young generation consumes the fraction 0 ≤ I/ max(I, I o ) ≤ 1 of
these goods. If each young worker randomly picks his I goods from the max(I, I o )
being oﬀered then µi = I/ max(I, I o ).18 Similarly, µoi = I o / max(I, I o ). Now, suppose
that pi < p0i /(r0 β); i.e., that the economy is in Zone 1. Then, µi = 1 and µo0
                                                                              i = 0.

Alternatively, if pi = p0i /(r0 β) it may transpire that 0 < µi , µo0
                                                                   i < 1.

        The factor market conditions appear as

                                 ka + kc + max(I, I o )ni ki = k,

and
                         la + lc + max(I, I o )ni li + max(I, I o )ni φ = 1.                      (17)
  18
       In other words think about the index i in (3) as representing each young worker’s personal
numbering scheme over the new goods available in the first and second periods of his life. That is,
out of the max(I, I o ) new goods available in the first period of his life he can choose to order them
as he wishes on the interval [0, max(I, I o )]. The same is true for the second period.

III.        Results

        Can the above framework explain the rise of manufacturing and the decline of
agriculture that occurred over the last two hundred years? The engine of change in
the model is technological progress. Hence, to answer this question, some discussion
on the extent of technological progress in agriculture and manufacturing over the
1800-to-2000 period of interest is in order.


A.        Technological Progress in Agriculture and Non-Agriculture

        Take agriculture first. Total factor productivity (TFP) grew at 0.48 percent per
year between 1800 and 1900.19 Its annual growth rate fell to 0.26 percent in the
  19
       The estimates for the growth rates of agricultural productivity from 1800 to 1900 come from
Atack et al. (2000, Table 6.1).


                                                            19
interval 1900 to 1929 and then rose to 2.24 percent over the 1929-to-1960 period.20
Between 1960 and 1996 it grew at an annual rate of 2.18 percent.21 Hence, by chaining
these estimates together, it is easy to calculate that TFP increased by a factor of 7.61
between 1800 and 1996. TFP in the non-agricultural sector — labelled manufacturing
— rose at a faster clip. It grew at an annual rate of 0.75 percent over the period 1800
to 1900.22 Its growth rate then picked up to 1.63 percent across 1899 to 1929 and to
2.01 percent from 1929 to 1966.23 Last, manufacturing TFP grew at an annual rate
of 0.70 percent from 1966 to 2000.24 Over the period 1800 to 2000 non-agricultural
TFP grew by a factor of 9.25. Figure 9 shows the series obtained for agricultural and
non-agricultural TFP.


B.        Analysis of Comparative Steady States

        Choice of Parameter Values: In order to simulate the model values must be
assigned to various parameters. These are listed in Table 1. Almost nothing is known
about the appropriate values for some parameters, such as the lower bound on new
goods consumption, s, or the fixed cost associated with running a firm producing
new goods, φ. So, the parameter values are picked to generate two steady-state
  20
       The estimates for the growth in agricultural TFP for the 1900-to-1929 and 1929-to-1960 periods
are computed from data in Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (Series
W7).

     The estimates for technological progress in the nonagricultural sector prior to 1900 are backed
out using economy-wide TFP and sectoral share data taken from Weiss (1994, Tables 1.2 -1.4) and
Gallman (2000, Tables 1.7 and 1.14) in conjunction with the Atack et al (2000, Table 6.1) agricultural
estimates.

equilibriums that mimic some key features of the U.S. data for the years 1800 and
2000. A guide to the informal selection procedure adopted will now be given. Before
proceeding, assume that a model period is 20 years and that the (annualized) rate of
physical depreciation on capital is 8 percent.
    U.S. Economy, circa 1800 :                                          In 1800 agriculture accounted for 46 percent of
U.S. output and 74 percent of employment. A steady state will be constructed that
matches these two features. To this end, normalize the initial levels of total factor
productivity so that za = zc = zi = 1. Next, assume that no new goods were produced
in 1800. This can be achieved by picking high values for s and φ. By doing this output
will be comprised by just agricultural and generic manufacturing goods. While it’s
hard to know what are reasonable values for labor’s share of income in agriculture,
1 − λ, and generic manufacturing, 1 − ω, it is known that for the aggregate economy
it should be about 70 percent. This implies that

                                                              χ(1 − λ) + (1 − χ)(1 − ω) = 0.70,


                                                                             21
where χ is agriculture’s share of output. This restriction can be used to pin down
a value for capital’s share in agriculture, λ, given a value for capital’s share in the
generic manufacturing, ω. In other words, let

                       λ = 1.0 + [(1 − χ1800 )/χ1800 ](1 − ω) − 0.70/χ1800 .

The choice of ω will be discussed shortly.
        U.S. Economy, circa 2000 : Two hundred years later agricultural’s share of output
and employment had dropped to just 1.4 and 2.5 percent, respectively. Output had
increased by 36.7 times.25 Can a steady state be constructed that replicates these two
facts? Over this time period total factor productivity in agriculture rose 7.61 fold.
So, set za = 7.61. Similarly, total factor productivity in non-agriculture increased
9.25 times. Thus, let zc = zi = 9.25. The responsiveness of output to changes in
TFP is sensitive to capital’s share of income. The larger capital’s share of income is
the bigger will be the response. This transpires because capital is the reproducible
factor in the model. The observed 36.7-fold increase in output can be obtained by
setting capital’s share in the generic goods sector, ω, to 0.46. New goods are produced
competitively. Therefore, any profits earned in this sector are absorbed completely by
the fixed costs of production. Recall that the fixed cost of producing new goods are
borne entirely in terms of labor. Thus, labor’s share of income in the new goods sector
is given by (1 − κ). Assuming that new goods weigh heavily in the 2000 economy,
this dictates setting κ at about 30 percent; let κ = 0.28. To choose the exponent
on labor, τ , assume that profits, and hence fixed costs, amount to 10 percent of new
goods production so that τ = 1.0 − κ − 0.10.
        Last, three taste parameters need to be picked: α, ψ, and β. In the adopted
parameterization the circa-2000 steady state lies in Zone 2. Hence, r = 1/β.26 An
annual interest rate of about 7.5 percent can be achieved by setting β = 0.9320 . The
weights on the various categories of consumption in utility are chosen to obtain the

NIPA accounts.

     This normally wouldn’t be the case for an overlapping generations model.

      pi represents the vector of new goods prices for the current period. The solution
to this problem will be once again characterized by the first-order conditions (5) to
(9), but now the choice variables must also satisfy the utility constraint (19) rather
than the budget constraint (4).
       Consider comparing welfare across two steady states, labeled old and new. Let
the subscript 0 denote a variable’s value in the old steady state and the subscript
T represent the variable’s value in the new steady state. In the new steady state a
young agent will earn wT , face the prices pa,T , −

young agent would be indiﬀerent between living in the new steady state or staying in
the old steady one with the wage rate, w0 . Any extra income improves the agent’s
lot. Hence, a measure of the proportionate change in welfare across these two steady
states, analogous to a compensating variation, is given by27

                              ln(wT ) − ln[E(pa,T , pa,T , −

       Wages increase from w0 to wT across the two steady states. This doesn’t take
into account the fact that the cost of living may have also shifted due to a change in
prices. The conventional way to control for this would be to deflate wages in the new
steady state by a price index. The Laspeyres price index, LT , is given by
                                  (c0 + co0 ) + pa,T (a0 + ao0 ) + pi,T (I0 + I0o )es

It measures the rise in the cost of purchasing the initial basket of goods. The growth
in real income based on the Laspeyres price index is

                             ln(wT /LT ) − ln(w0 ) = ln(wT ) − ln(LT w0 ).

       Of course agents wouldn’t buy the initial basket of goods in the new steady state.
They would substitute toward those goods whose prices have fallen. The Paasche price

    A problem with the Paasche price index is that many of the goods purchased in
the new steady state were not available in the old steady one. For example, assume
that no new goods were produced in the old steady state. The price pi,0 would not
exist then. For this reason, the Laspeyres index is used in practice — the price pi,0
won’t appear in the denominator of this index since I0 = I0o = 0 when new goods
aren’t consumed. Hicks (1940) suggested constructing a "virtual price" to overcome
this problem with new goods. The virtual price is the lowest price for the new good
at which the consumer would choose zero units, given the prices for the other goods
and his income. It is easy to construct such virtual prices in the model. To see this,
assume that no new goods are consumed in the old steady state. Also suppose that
r0 < 1/β, or that the old steady state lies in Zone 1 (implying in general that I0 ≥ 0
and I0o = 0). Recall that if some new goods are consumed then equation (8) will hold
with equality so that si = es. Therefore, using (6) it will transpire that
                                                σ           w0

                                                 25
This equation gives the inverse demand curve for new goods. To compute the virtual
price, pvi,0 , set I0 = 0 in this demand relationship to obtain

                                                    σ        w0
                                   pvi,0 =                      .
                                             α + ψ + βα + βψ es

       Some intuition for the diﬀerences between the various welfare measures is pro-
vided in Figure 10. The diagram portrays a static setting with just two types of goods,
generic and new. Tastes are once again represented by (3), but now set α = β = 0.
Equation (10) will once again give the quantity consumed of each new good, or si = es.
Given this, Figure 10 shows indiﬀerence curves over the quantity of generic goods, c,
and the number of new goods, I, consumed. The slope of one of these indiﬀerence
curves is −ψ/(σc). Now, imagine a situation where there are no new goods produced.
Here c = w. This situation is portrayed by the point A. Suppose that new goods
become available. Point B shows this situation. Recall that in equilibrium each new
good that is produced will sell at the same price, pi . The slope of the budget con-
straint is given by −1/(pi es) — the cost of consuming es units of a new good is pi es.29
Clearly the consumer is better oﬀ. He is on a higher indiﬀerence curve. At the new
prices, you could take away from the consumer CV units of income and he would
remain on his old indiﬀerence curve at the point D. This shows the compensating
variation. The Laspeyres price index shows no change in real income. Why? At the
new set of prices the cost of the old consumption bundle is still w since no new goods
were consumed. Hick’s (1940) virtual price is given by slope of the indiﬀerence going
through the point A. According to the Paasche index real income increases by the
amount P . By giving the consumer this amount he can aﬀord to buy the new bundle
of goods, represented by point B, at the old set of (virtual) prices. Last, the distance
EV measures the equivalent variation. It asks how much income would consumer
have to be given in order to get his new level of utility without any new goods — see
point E.

                                      Figure 10: Welfare Measures.

welfare gain due to technological progress and the introduction of new goods is large
by any measure. The utility-based estimate based upon the compensating varia-
tion suggests that welfare rose by 300 percent, when measured in terms of generic
consumption. This is a (continuously compounded) gain of about 1.5 percent a year.
The traditional index number measures report gains very similar to the compensating
variation criteria. These numbers are strikingly similar to an estimated 300 percent
increase in the U.S. real wage over the 1800 to 2000 period.30 The other utility-based
estimate based upon equivalent variation concept reports a much larger welfare gain
of 2,000 percent. This translates into a welfare gain of about 10 percent a year. This
measure asks by how much would income have to increase in 1800, when there were
no new goods, in order to provide today’s level of utility. Providing a modern utility
level using just yesteryear’s goods is an expensive proposition. The traditional index
  30
       This estimate is based on real wage data contained in Williamson (1995, Table A1) for the period
1830 to 1988. The Williamson (1995) series was updated to 2000 using data from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. The resulting series was then extrapolated back to 1800.



                                                               27
number concepts miss this point. Theoretically speaking, there is no good reason
to prefer the compensating over the equivalent variation, or vice versa. Taking an
average of the two utility-based measures suggests that welfare increased by 1,151
percent or grew at about 6 percent a year. Perhaps the safest thing to say, though,
is that welfare increased by at least 300 percent.

C.        Transitional Dynamics

        The Computational Experiment: Now, imagine starting the model oﬀ in a steady
state that resembles the U.S. in 1800 and letting it converge to a new steady state
that resembles the U.S. in 2000. To undertake this experiment the time path for
TFP shown in Figure 9 will be inputted into the simulation. The circles on the series
indicate the values at 20 year intervals that will be used when simulating the model’s
transitional dynamics. What will the economy’s behavior over this time period look
like? From the earlier results it can be surmised that economy will initially be in
Zone 1 and then transit into Zone 2. So before proceeding, a comment will be made
about the model’s local dynamics in Zone 2.31
        Local Dynamics: The dynamics approaching the Zone 2 steady state can be
characterized analytically. Recall that the price of the new good can be written as
  31
       The discussion below on the model’s Zone-2 local dynamics can be omitted without loss of
continuity.



                                               28
pi = Pi (r −δ; zc , zi ). Now, assume that the economy is in Zone 2. Equation (11) holds
tightly in this Zone. It gives the following diﬀerence equation for the interest rate

                        r0 βPi (r − δ; zc , zi ) = Pi (r0 − δ; zc0 , zi0 ).        (20)

To have a steady state, technological progress must abate. Hence, suppose that
zc0 = zc , and zi0 = zi . What can be said about the solution to this diﬀerence equation
in this situation? The lemma below provides the answer. The cases described by the
lemma are portrayed in Figure 11.
Lemma The diﬀerence equation (20) has two rest points, viz r = 1/β and r = δ. Its
local dynamics are as follows:

  1. When κ − ω < 0 the system converges monotonically to the rest point given by
     r = 1/β. The rest point r = δ is unstable.

  2. When κ − ω > 0 two modes of behavior can happen:

      (a) If (κ − ω)/(1 − ω) < 1 − βδ then the system converges monotonically to
           the rest point r = δ. The system exhibits oscillations around the r = 1/β
           rest point. These cycles converge when (κ − ω)/(1 − ω) < (1 − βδ)/2 and
           diverge otherwise.

      (b) Alternatively, if (κ − ω)/(1 − ω) > 1 − βδ the system converges monoton-
           ically towards the rest point r = δ. The rest point r = 1/β is unstable.

Proof. See Appendix
Remark The calibrated version of model is described by Case 1. Suppose instead
that κ − ω > 0. Then, as a practical matter, any reasonable calibration will result in
(κ − ω)/(1 − ω) < (1 − βδ)/2 . This will transpire because the diﬀerences in capital
shares across industries are small. Hence, for all empirically relevant equilibrium the
rest point r = 1/β will be stable.
    Sectoral Shifts: The transitional dynamics for the model are shown in Figure
12. Given the parameterization adopted, convergence to the new steady state (where

r = 1/β) is monotone. (I.e., the economy is described by Case 1 in the lemma.) The
model economy transits out of Zone 1 into Zone 2 in 1880. Observe that agriculture’s
shares of GDP and employment decline along with technological progress. The time
paths predicted by the model match the data very well, with one blemish that will
be discussed now.
    Note that in the U.S. data, agriculture’s share of employment, ϑ, significantly
exceeded its share of output, χ, in 1800. This is a bit of task to achieve with a
Cobb-Douglas production structure, at least when new goods aren’t produced. To
see why, note that the eﬃciency conditions for employment in agriculture and generic
manufacturing imply that the following relationship between relative employment and
outputs must hold

 Figure 13: The Rise in the Number of New Goods and Firms, 1800-2000 — Model.

Hence, if agriculture is to constitute a higher fraction of employment vis a vis output
then labor’s share of income must be disproportionately higher in this sector; i.e.,
(1 − λ)/(1 − ω) must be bigger than one since [ϑ/(1 − ϑ)]/[χ/(1 − χ)] is. This could be
done by picking a high value for ω, or capital’s share of income in the generic sector.
The required value is 0.74. This value is unrealistic and implies that small changes
in non-agricultural TFP will have enormous eﬀects on output.
    Coinciding with the fall in agriculture is the rise in new goods, as Figure 13
illustrates. As can be seen, at low levels of economic development no new goods
are produced. As the state of technology progresses income rises. Workers begin to
demand new goods. Both the number of new goods produced, and the number of
firms producing them, rise. On some other dimensions the predictions for the model
are reasonable. The interest rate is trapped between 4.6 and 8.2 percent. Labor’s
share of income hovers around 70 percent.

IV.     Conclusions

      So, what is the connection between technological progress, the introduction of
new goods, and the structure of production? A simple story is told here. As incomes
rise, it pays for producers to introduce new goods and services. Consumers demand
new goods as incomes rise because the benefit from consuming a new good is higher
than the benefit from consuming more of an old good. The appealing aspect of this
explanation is that in the data the importance of agriculture seems to fall unabated as
economies develop, and the model developed here is consistent with that prediction.
(More precisely, so long as TFP increases, agriculture’s share of GDP keeps declining.
It does not asymptote to a positive constant.)
      The model developed here also provides a framework, albeit crude, with which
to analyze the impact that new goods have on economic welfare. The impact of
technological progress on economic welfare is sizable. The exact magnitude depends
on the welfare criteria used. The analysis suggests that economic welfare grew by
at least 1.5 percent a year, and by perhaps as much as 10 percent a year. More
elaborate versions of the model could undoubtedly do a better job. For instance,
process innovation could be incorporated into the framework to capture the decline
in a product’s price after its introduction. At a point in time, each vintage of new
goods would then be consumed in diﬀering amounts. Over time the consumption
of a new product would follow a diﬀusion curve. This may create more powerful
substitution eﬀects that could create some divergence among the various indices of
welfare. A model provides an ideal laboratory to evaluate the performance of the
various indices.

V.      Appendix

A.       The Lemma

      By using the first-order conditions to problem (14), it can be deduced that the
profits earned by a firm in the new goods sector will be given by


  π i = (1 − κ − τ )κκ/(1−κ−τ ) τ τ /(1−κ−τ ) (pi zi )1/(1−κ−τ ) (r − δ)−κ/(1−κ−τ ) w−τ /(1−κ−τ )

                                                                                        − wφ = 0.

Next, the first-order conditions to problem (12) imply that

                                                                r − δ ω/(ω−1)
                        w = W (r − δ; zc ) ≡ (1 − ω)zc (             )        .                     (21)
                                                                 ωzc

Using the above two equations in conjunction with (15) allows the price for new goods
to be written as

                                                     φ
              pi = Pi (r − δ; zc , zi ) ≡ zi−1 [            ](1−κ−τ ) κ−κ τ −τ                      (22)
                                             (1 − κ − τ )
                       ×(1 − ω)1−κ ω(1−κ)ω/(1−ω) zc(1−κ)/(1−ω) (r − δ)[κ−ω]/(1−ω) .

It is then straightforward to calculate that

                                                  1 κ−ω
                      Pi1 (r − δ; zc , zi ) =                 Pi (r − δ; zc , zi ).                 (23)
                                                r − δ (1 − ω)

With (22) in hand, it is easy to see that the diﬀerence equation (20) can be rewritten
as
                          r0 β(r − δ)[κ−ω]/(1−ω) = (r0 − δ)[κ−ω]/(1−ω) ,                            (24)

when zc0 = zc and zi0 = zi . What can be said about the solutions to this equation?
Lemma The diﬀerence equation (20) has two rest points, viz r = 1/β and r = δ. Its
local dynamics are as follows:

     1. When κ − ω < 0 the system converges monotonically to the rest point given by
       r = 1/β. The rest point r = δ is unstable.

                                                    34
   2. When κ − ω > 0 two modes of behavior can happen:

       (a) If (κ − ω)/(1 − ω) < 1 − βδ then the system converges monotonically to
            the rest point r = δ. The system exhibits oscillations around the r = 1/β
            rest point. These cycles converge when (κ − ω)/(1 − ω) < (1 − βδ)/2 and
            diverge otherwise.

       (b) Alternatively, if (κ − ω)/(1 − ω) > 1 − βδ the system converges monoton-
            ically towards the rest point r = δ. The rest point r = 1/β is unstable.

Proof. Rewrite the mapping given by (20) as

                                          r0 = D(r; zc , zi ).                                (25)

(Recall that in a steady state, zc0 = zc and zi0 = zi .) It’s clear from (24) that r0 = r =
1/β and r0 = r = δ are both rest points to this equation. By the implicit function
theorem D is a C 1 function with

                dr0                                r0 βPi1 (r − δ; zc , zi )
                    = D1 (r; zc , zi ) =                                                .     (26)
                dr                       Pi1 (r0 − δ; zc , zi ) − βPi (r − δ; zc , zi )

Using (22), (23), and (20) in (26) it can be calculated that

               dr0                      [(κ − ω)/(1 − ω)]r0 (r0 β)(1−ω)/(κ−ω)
                   = D1 (r; zc , zi ) =                                                       (27)
               dr                          [(κ − ω)/(1 − ω)]r0 − (r0 − δ)
                     [(κ − ω)/(1 − ω)]r0 (r0 β)(1−ω)/(κ−ω)
                   =                                         .
                                        ∆(r0 )

     First, if κ − ω < 0 then Pi1 (r − δ; zc , zi ) and Pi1 (r0 − δ; zc , zi ) < 0. From (26) it is
easy to see that dr0 /dr = D1 (r; zc , zi ) > 0 for all r and r0 combinations. Therefore, the
law of motion D rises continuously from the point r0 = r = δ and converges asymp-
totically to limr→∞ D(r; zc , zi ) = ∞. It is also easy to deduce that dr0 /dr|r0 =r=1/β =
D1 (1/β; zc , zi ) < 1; in fact, D1 (r; zc , zi ) < 1 whenever r > 1/β. Furthermore, from
(27) it can be seen that dr0 /dr|r0 =r=δ = D1 (δ; zc , zi ) = (δβ)(1−ω)/(κ−ω) > 1. Hence, the
system converges monotonically to the rest point r0 = r = 1/β from any r 6= δ.



                                                  35
     Second, suppose that κ − ω > 0. From (27) it is apparent that
                                 dr0
                                     T 0 as ∆(r0 ) T 0.
                                 dr
In turn it is easy to compute that
                                                      1−ω
                              ∆(r0 ) T 0 as r0 S δ(       ).
                                                      1−κ
[Note that (1 − ω)/(1 − κ) > 1 when κ − ω > 0.] Consequently, the law of motion D
approaches the point r0 = δ( 1−ω
                             1−κ
                                 ) ≡ ξ and r = (ξ−δ)/(ξβ)(1−ω)/(κ−ω) +δ from two ways:
(i) upwards from below, and (ii) downwards from above. That is, it starts oﬀ from
r0 = r = δ and rises upwards to r0 = δ( 1−ω
                                        1−κ
                                            ) ≡ ξ and r = (ξ − δ)/(ξβ)(1−ω)/(κ−ω) + δ.
It then bends backwards, and as r returns to δ, the law of motion D asymptotes
to limr→δ D(r; zc , zi ) = ∞. Now, from (27) it is obvious that 0 < dr0 /dr|r0 =r=δ =
D1 (δ; zc , zi ) = (δβ)(1−ω)/(κ−ω) < 1. Therefore, the rest point r0 = r = δ is locally
stable.
     What about the other rest point, r0 = r = 1/β? Two subcases occur depending
on whether ∆(1/β) T 0. First, note that
                                             κ−ω
                           ∆(1/β) T 0 as         T 1 − βδ.
                                             1−ω
Now assume that ∆(1/β) > 0. It follows from (27) that dr0 /dr|r0 =r=1/β > 1. In this
case the rest point r0 = r = 1/β is unstable. Alternatively, suppose that ∆(1/β) < 0.
Here, the system oscillates around the rest point r0 = r = 1/β. Are these oscillations
locally stable? Equation (27) implies that
                                                κ−ω
                    dr0 /dr|r0 =r=1/β T −1 as       S (1 − βδ)/2.

B.    Transitional Dynamics

     Pick a T large enough so that convergence takes place within T + 1 periods.
That is, so that all variables in the model will take their steady state values by period

T + 1. Start iteration j with a guess for the interest rate path, {rt }Tt=0 , and the
time path for the number of new goods consumed by the young, {It }Tt=0 , denoted by
{rtj }Tt=0 and {Itj }Tt=0 respectively. Now, with a little bit of work, it can be shown that

                                                             (r − δ)λ w1−λ
                            pa = Pa (r − δ; za , zc ) ≡                       .                            (28)

Hence, a guess can be obtained, using (28), (22) and (21), for the price and wage paths
{pa,t }Tt=0 ,{pi,t }Tt=0 , and{wt }Tt=0 . Represent this by {pja,t }Tt=0 ,{pji,t }Tt=0 , and{wtj }Tt=0 .
     Time period t: In time period t the state variables will be kt , bt , and rt . Given
            j
the guess {rx+1 }Tx=t+1 and {Ixj }Tx=t+1 , a solution for either rt+1 or It must be found,
depending on whether the model is in Zone 1 or Zone 2. This is done using the capital
market-clearing condition.
                                               kt+1 = bt+1 .

The supply of capital, bt+1 , derives from the optimization problem (3) for the period-t
young. It is equal to their savings so that

                                  bt+1 = wt − ct − pa,t at − It pi,t es.

The demand for capital, kt+1 , reads

                                                           o
                      kt+1 = ka,t+1 + kc,t+1 + max{It+1 , It+1 }ni,t+1 ki,t+1 .

In the above equation the superscript o denotes an allocation by an old agent. Fur-
                                                                     o
thermore It+1 is determined by the time-(t+1) solution to (3) while It+1 is determined
by the time−t solution to (3) — the solutions will depend upon what zone the model
is in. The period-(t + 1) number of firms in the new goods sector i, ni,t+1 , is given by
                                                  0                  0

     The demand for capital in the agricultural sector is given by

                                                         at+1
                                  ka,t+1 =                                ,

where
                                       at+1 = at+1 + aot+1 .

Note that at+1 will be determined by the time-(t + 1) solution to (3) while aot+1 will
obtain from the time-t solution to this problem. In the model all period-(t+1) capital-
labor ratios, such as ka,t+1 /la,t+1 , can be expressed as functions of the period-(t + 1)
interest rate, rt+1 — recall that wt+1 is a function of rt+1 . In a similar vein the capital
stock employed in the new goods sector is

                                                 si,t+1

                                max{It+1 , It+1 }      max{It+1 , It+1 }
Again, note that ki,t+1 /li,t+1 can be written as a function of rt+1 .
    The period-(t + 1) market-clearing condition for generic manufacturing goods is

                   ct+1 + kt+2 − δkt+1 = zc,t+1 kc,t+1 (kc,t+1 /lc,t+1 )ω−1 ,

which implies that

                                                                 o
           kc,t+1 = {ct+1 + kt+2 − δ[ka,t+1 + ni,t+1 max{It+1 , It+1 }ki,t+1 ]}

                       /[zc,t+1 (kc,t+1 /lc,t+1 )ω−1 + δ].

Here aggregate manufacturing consumption, ct+1 , is

                                       ct+1 = ct+1 + cot+1 ,

where ct+1 and cot+1 are given by the time-(t + 1) and time-t solutions to (3). Note
that kt+2 can readily be computed from time-(t + 1) aggregate savings.
    By tracing through the above equations, it can be seen that, given a guess for
  j
{rx+1 }Tx=t+1 and {Ixj }Tx=t+1 , everything can be solved out for in terms of just either
rt+1 or It depending upon whether the model is in Zone 1 or Zone 2. When the model
is in Zone 2 then rt+1 is pinned down by the diﬀerence equation pi,t+1 /rt+1 = βpi,t .

        Initial Period 0: At time zero there is an unanticipated wealth redistribution
given the unexpected shift in technology. Hence, the initial interest rate, r0 , that
clears the capital market must also be computed. There are now two variables that
need to be solved for: r0 , and either r1 or I0 . That is, the initial interest rate is not
a state variable that has been determined in the previous period. The solution for
either r1 or I0 obtains in the manner described above. The solution for r0 is achieved
by adding the time-0 capital market-clearing condition

       It is easy to calculate that in Zone 2

                          o
                         It+1 = wt /(βpi,t es) − (α + ψ + βα + βψ)/(σβ) − It /β.

       In line with (11), when pi,t < pi,t+1 /(rt+1 β) it transpires that It+1 = 0.   When pi,t >
pi,t+1 /(rt+1 β) then

                            o
                           It+1 = wt rt+1 /(pi,t+1 es) − (α + ψ + βα + βψ)/(βσ).

      In a similar vein the capital stock employed in the new goods sector is

                                                                       (r0 − δ)
             max{I0 , I0o }ni,0 ki,0 = max{I0 , I0o }ni,0 (                                )1/(κ+τ −1) .
                                                                κpi,0 zi,0 (ki,0 /li,0 )−τ

In the above two equations I0 is determined by the time-0 solution to (3) while I0o
will be specified by
                                                      r0 k0     α+ψ
                                       I0o = max{             −     , 0}.

      The market-clearing condition for generic manufacturing goods is

                                  c0 + k1 − δk0 = zc,0 kc,0 (kc,0 /lc,0 )ω−1 ,

which implies that

                               kc,0 = {c0 + k1 − δk0 }/[zc,0 (kc,0 /lc,0 )ω−1 ].

Here aggregate manufacturing consumption, c0 , is given by

                                                    c0 = c0 + co0 ,

where c0 derives from (3) while co0 is determined by

                                                         ψ
                                            co0 =                r0 k0 .
                                                    α + ψ + σI0o

      The algorithm: The algorithm proceeds by iterating down the time path starting
at time 0 and moving on to time period T . The solution {rt , It }Tt=0 obtained at each
iteration j is used as a revised guess for iteration j + 1. The algorithm continues until
{rtj , Itj }Tt=0 → {rtj+1 , Itj+1 }Tt=0 .
