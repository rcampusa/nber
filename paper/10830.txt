                                            ABSTRACT

This paper provides evidence on monopolistic competition models with endogenous technology by
studying the effects of sectoral export variety on country productivity. The effects are estimated in
a translog GDP function system based on data for 34 countries from 1982 to 1997. Country
productivity is constructed and export variety is shown to be significant. Instruments such as tariffs,
transport costs, and distance are shown to affect country productivity through export variety, and
only through this channel. Overall, while export variety accounts for only 2% of cross-country
productivity differences, it explains 13% of within-country productivity growth. A 10% increase in
the export variety of all industries leads to a 1.3% increase in country productivity, while a 10
percentage point increase in tariffs facing an exporting country leads to a 2% fall in country
productivity.

1. Introduction

       Recent models of monopolistic competition and trade have emphasized that productivity

levels are endogenous. For example, Eaton and Kortum (2002) allow for stochastic differences in

technologies across countries, with the lowest cost country becoming the exporter of a product

variety to each location. In that case, the technologies utilized in a country will depend on its

distance and trade barriers with other countries. Melitz (2003) allows for stochastic draws of

technology for each firm, and only those firms with productivities above a certain cutoff level

will operate. A subset of these firms – the most productive – also become exporters. Melitz

shows how the average productivity in a country is determined by the cutoff productivity level,

which in turn depends on trade barriers faced by the exporters and other features of the world

market. In Melitz’s model and that of Eaton and Kortum, trade volume and variety are

endogenous and are jointly determined with average productivity.

       Empirical testing of this class of models can proceed by utilizing firm-level data and

inferring the productivity levels of firms. That approach is taken by Bernard et al (2003) for

U.S. firms; Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2003, 2004) for French firms; and Helpman, Melitz and

Yeaple (2004) for U.S. multinationals operating abroad. When firm level data are available, it is

highly desirable to make use of them like these authors do. But for many countries such data are

not available, and in those cases, we are still interested in estimating the joint relationship

between the productivity of countries and their trade volume and variety. The objective of this

paper is to examine the effects of export variety on productivity at the country level, using a

broad cross-section of advanced and developing nations and disaggregating across sectors.

       Rather than modeling heterogeneity across firms, as in above-cited papers, we rely

instead on product differentiation across firms to generate productivity gains. This idea is
                                                        2


familiar from the earlier, endogenous growth models (e.g. Romer 1990, Grossman and Helpman,

1991) where greater variety of inputs leads to higher productivity. Similarly, we argue that a

greater variety of outputs also leads to higher productivity, provided the outputs are

differentiated from each other in production (i.e. use different factor intensities). Like many

monopolistic competition models we will rely on a constant elasticity of substitution (CES)

framework, but applied to the outputs of a country rather than its inputs. Empirically, we

measure output variety by the export variety of each country. Our goal is to see how export

variety (which is endogenous) affects aggregate productivity across countries.

        Our work is complementary to other research estimating the gains from new varieties in a

CES framework. Feenstra (1994) showed how the gains from new product varieties could be

measured, and applied it to a handful of U.S. import goods. Broda and Weinstein (2003) have

recently extended this to all U.S. imports, and find that increased import variety contributes to a

1.2% per year fall in the “true” import price index. On the output side, a direct link between

export variety and productivity has been found by Feenstra et al (1999) for South Korea and

Taiwan, and by Funke and Ruhwedel (2001a,b, 2002) for the OECD and East Asian countries.1

Finally, Hummels and Klenow (2002) investigate the extent to which increased trade between

countries consists a larger set of goods, or higher quantity of existing goods – what they call the

“extensive” versus “intensive” margin.

        We begin by constructing export variety indexes at the sectoral level in sections 2 and 3,

as in Feenstra and Kee (2004). The variety indexes are incorporated into a translog GDP

function for the economy in section 4. The effects of export variety on country productivity are

shown to depend on the elasticities of substitution in production of different varieties in each

sector. Analogous to Harrigan (1997), the differences in export variety across countries play the

role of “price differences” in the GDP function, and therefore influence the shares of value added

devoted to each sector. An empirical specification based on the translog GDP function is

developed in section 5. The export variety indexes are regressors in the share equations, which

are estimated along with a productivity equation for each country. The estimates are then used to

construct country productivity based on data for 34 countries from 1982 to 1997.

       In section 6, we report estimates of the system of the share equations and the productivity

equation. Export variety is treated as an endogenous variable, and the instrumental variables

used to determine export variety are those suggested by the work of Eaton and Kortum (2002)

and Melitz (2003): tariffs, transport costs and distance. There is also an important exclusion

restriction suggested by these models: tariffs and transport costs should not have an impact on

aggregate productivity except through export (and import) variety. This exclusion restriction

amounts to a test for overidentification in our system, as we describe. We formally test this

overidentifying restriction in section 7, as well as hypothesis tests based on other restrictions

imposed on the system of equations. Most importantly, the over-identifying restriction test is not

rejected and confirms the importance of export variety as the mechanism (Hallak and Levinsohn,

2004) by which trade affects productivity.

       We discuss the empirical importance of tariffs, transport costs, and distance on export

variety in section 8. The results also show that a 10 percentage point increase in U.S. tariffs

would lead to a 2% fall in exporting countries’ productivity, which indicates that tariffs are

statistically and economically important in affecting productivity via export variety. Increases in

distance and transport costs are also significant in reducing export variety of the industries. In

section 9, we decompose productivity differences across countries into that part explained by
                                                                       4


export variety and the remaining explained by other determinants, such as fixed effects and

regression errors. We find that while export variety only accounts for 2% of the variation in

country productivity differences in level (though if country fixed effects are not included in

productivity differences, then export variety accounts for 60% of the variation), it can explain

more than 13% of within-country productivity growth. Overall, at the sample mean, a 10%

increase in export varieties of all industries leads to a 1.3% increase in country productivity.

Additional conclusions are given in section 10.


2. Effect of New Varieties

        Consider a world economy with many c=1,…,C countries, each of which produce many

types of goods. For simplicity in this section we aggregate these goods into a single sector, but

the extension to multiple sectors will be immediate. For each period t, let the set of goods

produced in country c be denoted by I ct ⊂ {1,2,3,....}. Then the quantity vector of each type of

good produced in country c in period t is denoted by q ct > 0 . The aggregate output of each

country c, Qct , is characterized by a CES function of the output of each good in the country, q itc :

                                                                                       σ / (σ −1)
                                                      ⎛                            ⎞
                      Q ct   =   f (q ct , I ct )
                                                      ⎜ i∈Ic
                                                               ( )
                                                    = ⎜ ∑ a i q itc
                                                                      ( σ−1) / σ
                                                                                   ⎟
                                                                                   ⎟
                                                                                                    , a i > 0, c = 1,..., C ,   (1)

where the elasticity of substitution between goods is σ. We assume that total output obtained

from the economy is constrained by the transformation curve:


                                                         F[f (q ct , I ct ), Vtc ] = 0,                                         (2)

              (                      )
where Vtc = v 1ct , v c2 t ,..., v cMt > 0 is the endowment vector for country c in year t.
                                                  5


       For outputs, we suppose that σ < 0 in (1), which means that the set of feasible varieties

q itc in any country will lie along a strictly concave transformation curve defined by (2). This is

shown in Figure 1, where we draw the transformation frontier between two product varieties q1t

and q2t, within a country. For a given transformation curve, and given prices, an increase in the

number of output varieties will raise revenue. For example, if only output variety 1 is available,

then the economy would be producing at the corner A, with output revenue shown by the line

AB. Then if variety 2 becomes available, the new equilibrium will be at point C, with an

increase in revenue. This illustrates the benefits of output variety.

       For inputs, we would instead use that σ > 1 in (1), which is then the formula for a CES

production function. Given output Q ct = Q tc , the inputs would lie along an iso-quant like that

illustrated in Figure 2. If only input 1 is available, then the costs of producing Q tc would be

minimized at point A, with the budget line AB. But if input 2 is also available, then the costs are

instead minimized at point C, with a fall in costs. This illustrates the benefits of input variety.

We will use the output case to illustrate the effects of export variety, whereas the input case

would apply to import variety (as in Feenstra, 1994, and Broda and Weinstein, 2003).


3. Measuring Output Variety

       Considering maximizing the value of output obtained in each industry, as in Figure 1.

Under the assumption of perfect competition, and given equation (1), the value of output

obtained in each country will be Ptc Q ct , where Ptc is a CES function of the prices of all output

varieties produced in the country:

                                                                               1 / (1− σ )
                                                   ⎛                     1− σ ⎞
                    Ptc   ≡   c( p ct , I ct )
                                                   ⎜ i∈I c
                                                               ( )
                                                 = ⎜ ∑ b i p cit               ⎟
                                                                               ⎟
                                                                                             , b i = a σi > 0, c = 1,..., C,   (3)
                                                   ⎝ t                         ⎠

and p ct > 0 is the domestic price vector for each country.

       The right-hand side of expression (3) is a CES cost function, with potentially differing

sets of product varieties across countries and over time. These cannot be evaluated with

knowledge of the parameters bi. But a standard result from index number theory is that the ratio

of cost function can be evaluated, using data on price and quantities in the two periods or two

countries. Feenstra (1994) shows how this result applies even when the number of goods is

changing. In particular, the ratio of the CES cost functions over two countries a and b, equals to

the product of the Sato-Vartia price index of goods that are common, I ≡ I at ∩ I bt ≠ ∅ ,                          (    )
multiplied by terms reflecting the revenue share of “unique” goods:

                                                            w i (I )                1 / (σ−1)

where the weights wi(I) are constructed from the revenue shares in the two countries:

                                 s cit (I ) ≡ p cit q cit / ∑ pcit q cit , for c = a,b,                                        (6)

Notice that the output shares in (6), for each country, are measured relative to the common set of

goods I. Then the weights in (5) are the logarithmic mean of the shares s ait ( I) and s itb ( I) , and

sum to unity over the set of goods i ∈ I .2

          To interpret (7), notice that λct (I) ≤ 1 due to the differing summations in the numerator

and denominator. This term will be strictly less than one if there are goods in the set I ct that are

not found in the common set I. In other words, if country a is selling some goods in period t that

are not sold by country b, this will make λat ( I) < 1 .

          We can re-express equation (4) in logs as:


                              Pta               ⎛ p ait ⎞ ⎛ 1 ⎞ ⎛ λat (I ) ⎞
                         ln       = ∑ i
                                      w (I ) ln ⎜ b ⎟+⎜            ⎜         ⎟

The first term on the right of (8) is the Sato (1976)-Vartia (1976) price index, which is simply a

weighted average of the price ratios, using the values wi(I) as weights. What is new about

equation (8) is the second term on the right, which reflect changes in product variety. If country

a in period t has new, unique outputs (not in the common set I), we will have λat < 1 . From (8),

when σ < 0 this will raise the price index of outputs, Pta / Ptb . In other words, the introduction of

new output varieties will act in the same way as an increase in prices in a sector: it will draw

resources towards that sector.3

    More precisely, the numerator of (5) is the logarithmic mean of the output shares of the two countries, and lies in-

   If instead we consider the case of input variety, then σ > 1 in (8). Then the introduction of new inputs will lower
their price index. Thus, new input varieties would have the same positive efficiency effect as would a drop in input
prices.
                                                                       8


         In practice, we will measure the ratio λat / λbt using exports of countries to the United

States. While it would be preferable to use their worldwide exports, our data for the U.S. are

more disaggregate, and allows for a finer measurement of “unique” products sold by one country

and not another. Specifically, for 1972 – 1988 we will use the 7-digit Tariff Schedule of the U.S.

Annotated (TSUSA) classification of U.S. imports, and for 1989 – 1997 we shall use the 10-digit

Harmonized System (HS) classification of imports.

         To measure the ratio λat / λbt , we need to decide on a consistent “comparison country.”

For this purpose, we shall use the worldwide exports from all countries to the U.S. as the

comparison. Denote this comparison country by *, so that the set I *t = UCc=1 I ct is the complete

set of varieties imported by the United States in year t, and p*it q *it is the total value of imports for

good i. Then comparing country c to country * in year t, it is immediate that the common set of

goods exported is I ct ∩ I *t = I ct , or simply the set of goods exported by country c. Therefore, from

(7) we have that λct ( I ct ) = 1 , and:

                                                         ∑c p*it q *it                  ∑
                                                                                        *
                                                                                          p*it q *it
                                                                                           c
                                                         i∈I t                      i∈I t ,i∉I t
                                 λct* ≡ λ*t ( I ct ) =                        =1−                        .         (9)
                                                         ∑*      p*it q *it           ∑     p*it q *it
                                                         i∈I t                       i∈I*t




         Noting from (8) that product variety in country c relative to the comparison is measured

as λct ( I ct ) / λ*t ( I ct ) , but this has a negative coefficient when σ < 0, let us instead invert it and

measure product variety of country c relative to the world by λ*t ( I ct ) / λct ( I ct ) = λ*t ( I ct ) , which

enters (8) with a positive coefficient 1/(1– σ). For brevity we denote this by λct* in (9). It is

interpreted as the share of total U.S. imports from products that are exported by country c.
                                                             9

Equivalently, it is one minus the share of total U.S. imports from products that are not exported

by country c. Note that this measure depends on the set of exports by country c, I ct , but not on its

value of exports, except insofar as they affect the value of worldwide exports.


4. GDP Function with Export Variety

          To study the effects of export variety on productivity, we need to model the allocation of

factors among the production of goods in all industries. The effects of export varieties on

productivity depend on the elasticities of substitution in production between different variety

within the industries – for a two good case, the elasticity of substitution in production captures

the curvature of the PPF of an economy given fixed endowments, as in Figure 1. In this section,

we develop a general equilibrium based GDP function approach which links export variety to

country productivity. Such a model will allow us to develop an empirical model for the

estimation of the elasticities of substitution in production of various industries, and will also

allow us to infer the contribution of export variety in explaining country productivity.

          Suppose there are M kinds of factor endowments in the economy, denoted by the

endowment vector Vtc = ( v1ct ,..., v cMt ) > 0. There are N differentiated traded good sectors in the

economy, with output denoted by (Q1ct ,..., Q cNt ) , each of which is a CES aggregate as in (1) with

σn < 0.4 In addition to the N traded goods, each country has one homogeneous nontraded good

sector produces output Q cN +1t . The aggregate output vector of the economy is denoted by

Q ct = (Q1ct ,..., Q cNt , Q cN +1t ) > 0 . Likewise, the aggregate price vector is Ptc = (P1ct ,..., PNtc , PNc +1t ) > 0 ,

which consists of N traded good prices as defined by the CES unit-costs in (3) , and one

4                                                                                                    c
    In the case that some of these sectors are imported rather than exported, we would denote Q nt < 0 as the negative
of the CES aggregate (1), with σn > 1.

nontraded good price, PNc +1t . Given the assumption of perfect competition, total revenue or GDP

of the economy in period t is:


                               (           )               {
                       G ct Ptc , Vtc ≡ max Ptc ⋅ Q ct : Ftc Q ct , Vtc = 0 ,             (            ) }                    (10)


where Ftc (Q ct , Vtc ) = 0 is the transformation curve in period t that generalizes (2) when there are

                       (               )
many sectors. G ct Ptc , Vtc is homogeneous of degree one with respect to prices and, with the

assumption that F is homogeneous of degree one, then G ct Ptc , Vtc is also homogeneous of               (                )
degree one with respect to endowments. As usual, the derivative of the GDP function with

respect to Ptc equals the sectoral outputs Q ct , and the derivative with respect to endowments Vtc

can be interpreted as the factor prices w ct .

        To implement the above GDP function empirically, we will assume that it follows a

translog functional form:

Notice that we allow this function to differ across countries based on the constant α c0 and also

the exogenous time trend β c0 t . To satisfy the properties of homogeneity in prices and

The share of factor k in the GDP of the economy in period t equals to the derivative of

          To introduce export variety into the GDP function, we assume that the prices of goods

sold by each country are the same across countries, but that they differ in the variety of products

sold by each. Denote the set of varieties produced by industry n as I cnt , so the aggregate price

Pntk is a CES function of the prices of these varieties:

Using the union of all exporting countries as the comparison country, then from (8) and (9),

where the latter equality comes from assuming that p cit = p*it for every tradable good. Thus, the

ratio of CES price indexes depends only on the relative export variety of country c. A similar

approach was used by Harrigan (1997) to model the effective price differences across countries
                                                             12

as reflecting total factor productivity in the exporting sectors, whereas we are modeling the price

differences as reflecting product variety of exports.

        If we difference (14) with respect to the share equation of the comparison country, we

obtain an expression that relates the industry share in country c in period t to λcnt* :



                              (                )                                        (                       )

where the last term captures the effect of a nontraded good on the industry shares. We measure

the endowments of the hypothetical country by the sum of endowments of all sample countries,

v *kt = ∑c=1 v ckt , while the nontraded goods price for the comparison country is a weighted

average of the country nontraded good price indexes.5

        Equation (16) allows us to estimate 1 /(1 − σ m ) , which depends on σm, the elasticity of

substitution between output varieties in industry m. However, given that 1 /(1 − σ m ) and γmn enter

multiplicatively, it is not possible to separately identify the parameters based on (16). Thus, in

addition to the share equations (16), a country productivity equation is derived from the GDP

function is added to the estimation system. This will also allow us to estimate how the expansion

of product varieties contributes to GDP and therefore to country productivity.

        To derive the country productivity equation, we assume that the hypothetical country also

has the translog function shown in (11), where without loss of generality we can normalize

α*0 = β*0 = 0. Then using the share equations in (13)-(14), it can be confirmed that the difference

between GDP of country c and the comparison country is:

  The nontraded good price indexes of the sample countries are obtained by netting the prices of traded goods, both
export and import, from the country GDP deflators.

The right-hand side of (17) equals a time trend, plus a Törnqvist index of relative prices, plus a

Törnqvist index of relative endowments. These indexes provide a decomposition of relative

GDP into its price and factor-endowment components.6

        In our case, the price differences of the traded goods industries are due entirely to export

variety, so using (15) we can re-express (17) initially as:

                                                                                                                             ,   (17')

where the differences in factor endowments between country c and the hypothetical country are

moved to the left-hand side. Also listed as the last term on the left is the difference in the

nontraded good’s price between the countries. Thus, the left-hand side of this equation is

interpreted as the country productivity differences between country c and the hypothetical

country – it is the GDP of country c relative to that of the hypothetical country, net of the

differences in factor endowments and prices due to nontraded goods. The remaining difference

between the two countries GDP is the productivity differences due to export variety, on the right.

        Equation (17’) is not immediately useful since the GDP level of the hypothetical country,

and its factor shares, are not observable. For the unobserved factor shares, given that we use the

sum of sampled countries endowments to proxy for the endowments of the hypothetical country,


6
  The decomposition in (17) is a special case of results in Diewert and Morrison (1986), which are summarized by
Feenstra (2004, Appendix A, Theorem 5).
                                                                                    14

it is reasonable to assume that its factor shares are the average of the sampled countries factor

shares. As for the unobserved GDP level, given that it is common across all countries in any

year, it is possible to be controlled by year fixed-effects in a panel regression setting, i.e.

good’s prices on the right-hand side, and therefore test for the violation of homogeneity

constraint in prices (due to measurement error in the nontraded price, for example).

        Notice that the year fixed-effects completely absorb the explanatory power of time trend

appearing in (17’), which makes the latter redundant. In addition, a classical error term ε ct is

introduced in (18) to capture the productivity difference between country c and the hypothetical

country. Equation (18) shows that the difference in country c productivity relative the

hypothetical country can be estimated by a year fixed effect, a country fixed effect, its relative

export variety, and the relative nontraded good price index.


5. Data and Estimating Equations

        With data on GDP, factor endowments, nontraded good prices, and industry shares, we

can estimate (18) with the sample data set together with the system of share equations. Most

importantly, such a system of equations enables us to estimate the elasticity of substitution
                                                 15


between different output varieties within an industry, σ n , which is not sufficiently identified by

the share equations alone. The output shares of the hypothetical country, appearing as s*nt , are

measured using sample averages in (18), but will be fully absorbed by year fixed effects, δnt in

the share equations (16). Then the equality of σn can be imposed between (16) and (18) to

identify these elasticities.

        Our data set covers 34 countries from 1982 to 1997, a total of 342 observations. GDP is

measured in constant 1995 U.S. dollars to make cross country and time series comparisons

appropriate. We will use (9) to measure export variety from country c to the U.S. in every years

1972 – 1988 (using the TSUSA data), and 1989 – 1997 (using the HS data). This gives a

consistent comparison of export variety in each country relative to the hypothetical country

producing all varieties.

        There are three kind of primary factor endowments: labor, capital and agriculture land.

Labor is defined as the number of persons in the labor force of each country. Capital is

constructed using perpetual inventory method using real investment of the countries. Real

investment is obtained by deflating the gross domestic capital formation of the countries with the

respective GDP deflator on domestic capital formation. In addition, we construct the base year

capital stock using an infinite sum series of investment prior to the first year, assuming that the

growth rate of investment of the first five years are good proxy for investment prior to the first

year. All these data, together with price deflators of GDP, exports and imports are available in

World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2003).

        We aggregate up all export goods into N = 7 sectors: agriculture, textiles & garments,

woods & papers, petroleum & plastics, mining & basic metals, machinery & transport

equipment, and the electronics. The value added of these sectors are available in the UNIDO
                                                          16

data set, which we compare to the GDP values to construct the value added share of each sector

in GDP. We also need information on factor shares in national income for the estimation. A

United Nations national account data set is obtained which has information on labor share in

GDP.7 One minus the labor share gives us the sum of capital share and land share, which we are

not be able to separately identify. To overcome this shortcoming, we chose to estimate the land

share in the productivity equation as follows. It can be shown from (18) that the log of GDP is

the sum of the log of overall prices (denoted Pt for brevity), productivity (At), and the weighted

log of endowments:

          ln(GDPt ) = ln A t + ln Pt + s Lt ln L t + s Kt ln K t + (1 − s Lt − s Kt ) ln Tt .

Then we can estimate the share of land (Tt) by moving those terms for which we have data to the

left-hand side:

          ln(GDPt ) − s Lt (ln L t − ln Tt ) − (1 − s Lt )(ln K t − ln Tt ) − ln Tt =
                                                                                                 (19)
                            ln A t + ln Pt − (1 − s Lt − s Kt )(ln K t − ln Tt ).


Thus, when we use the labor share and one minus the labor share to weight ln l t ≡ ln(L t / Tt )

and ln(K t / Tt ), respectively, we should also include capital per unit of land ln k t ≡ ln(K t / Tt )

on the right-hand side of the equation, as shown in (19). The estimated coefficient associated

with capital per unit of land is interpreted as the negative value of the average share of land in

GDP.

          We proceed with a system of eight equations, consists of the seven sectoral share (16)

equations and the country productivity equation. According to (18) and (19), let the dependent

variable of the country productivity equation be TFP adjusted for capital-land ratio and prices of

nontraded goods:

If the homogeneity constraint in prices are not violated we expect β8 to equal to one, whereas βK

represents the negative value of the share of land in GDP. The constraints will be tested in the

regressions. With the estimated parameters, we will be able to construct country productivity

differences according (22):

       Due to cross equation restrictions on 1 /(1 − σ m ) and γmn, and the multiplicative nature of

these parameters, we need to use nonlinear system estimation to estimate equations (21a) and

(21b). This involves minimizing the criterion function of the full system with a consistently

estimated variance-covariance matrix. In addition, endogeneity and measurement errors of some

right-hand side variables need to be addressed. First, export variety could be endogenous.
                                                  18

Countries that have higher productivity may be able to produce more export varieties, which

leads to correlation between export variety and the regression errors. To correct for such

endogeneity, appropriate instrumental variables that are correlated to export variety but not

country productivity would be necessary. Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Melitz (2003) provide

us with such variables. In their models, export variety depends on various trade costs variables

such as tariffs, transport costs and distance. More importantly these trade costs variables only

affect country productivity through export variety. Thus, by using these variables as instruments

we can obtain estimates that are consistent. A subsequent over-identifying restrictions test will

then allow us to test for the validity of these instruments.

       Second, due to the lack of available data, prices of nontraded goods are constructed using

the GDP deflator net of price of tradable goods. This may introduce serious measurement errors

and cloud correlation between the variables. In this case we can also treat the price of nontraded

goods as correlated with the error, and IV estimation would allow us to have more precise

estimates.

       In the next section, we proceed by first estimating the system of equations without

correcting for endogeneity of export variety and measurement errors of nontraded good prices.

A full nonlinear 3SLS estimation with trade cost variables as instruments will then be presented.

Based on the nonlinear 3SLS estimation, a series of specification tests are performed: on the

homogeneity constraints on prices and endowments, symmetry constraints on cross price effects,

as well as the over-identifying restrictions of the instruments will be implemented. Finally, since

the first-stage regression of the nonlinear 3SLS system involves regressing the derivatives of the

criterion function with respect to all parameters on all instruments and exogenous variables, we

present some descriptive linear estimation linking export variety to all the instruments.

6. Estimation Results

         Table 1 presents the result of the nonlinear system of share equations (21a) with the

country TFP equation (21b), estimated using iterative seemingly-unrelated regressions (ISUR).

All the homogeneity constraints on prices and endowments, as well as the symmetric constraints

are imposed in the share equations. Columns (1) to (7) of the table show the estimated

coefficients of each of the industry share equations, and the last column shows the estimated

coefficients of the country productivity equation.

         In the top part of Table 1 in columns (1) to (7) we report γmn, which are the partial price

effects due to export variety changes of the industry in the rows on the share of industries in the

columns. All the own-price effects γnn are estimated to be positive and most are highly

significant.8 In other words, the underlying supply curves of these industries are positively

sloped. The bottom part of Table 1 in columns (1) to (7) presents the Rybczynksi effects of

endowments on the share of each industry. Positive point estimates indicate industry expansions

due to the increases in certain endowments. For example, an increase in the labor endowment

relative to that of land hurts agriculture, wood & paper, and the machinery & transport industry.

On the other hand, an increase in the labor endowment relative to land benefits textiles &

garments, petroleum & plastics, mining & metals, and the electronics industry. Similarly, while

an increase in capital relative to land hurts textiles & garments, petroleum & plastics, and mining

& metals, such an increase benefits woods & paper, machinery & transport, and the electronics

industry. These finding are reasonable and broadly similar to those of Harrigan (1997).




8
  Due to convergence problem, the γnn coefficient of the petroleum & plastics industry (industry 4), is estimated
separately, by fixing all the rest of the parameters in the optimal values. We repeated the process a few rounds, and
the estimation results are very stable, as presented in Table 1.
                                                20


       The top half of column (8) in Table 1 presents the ISUR estimates of 1 /(1 − σ n ) for each

industry in the row. All the point estimates are positive, and most are smaller than one. This

implies that the underlying elasticities of substitution are negative, as suggested by theory. The

industry that is the most heterogeneous in production is electronics, for which an increase in

export variety contributes the most to country productivity. Furthermore, from the coefficient of

capital-land ratio in the lower part of column (8) in Table 1, we can infer that the average

estimated land share in GDP is about 10 percent. Finally, the coefficient on the price of

nontraded goods is significantly less than one, which violates the homogeneity constraint on

prices when we do not use instruments.

       Table 2 presents the estimated coefficients using nonlinear 3SLS with a set of

instruments consisting of U.S. tariffs by industry, exporting country and year (seven industry

effective tariffs), indicator variables for various trade agreements between the U.S. and the

exporting countries (CANFTA, NAFTA, CBI, ANDEAN), distance between exporting countries

and US (in kilometers), average transport costs interact with two distance dummies, and relative

endowments. The nonlinear 3SLS estimates of the own-price effects reported in Table 2 are

significantly larger than the ISUR estimates from Table 1. This is not surprising since apart from

endogeneity problems, the export variety indexes and relative price of the nontraded sector may

have measurement errors which bias the estimates toward zero. Point estimates of the own price

effects range from 0.004 in machinery & transport to 0.133 in the wood & paper industry. The

Rybczynski effects of endowments presented in the bottom of this table are very similar to that

of the ISUR estimates, both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance.

       The nonlinear 3SLS estimates of 1 /(1 − σ n ) presented in column (8) of Table 2 are larger

than the ISUR estimates in general. They range from 0.324 in the agriculture industry to 0.977
                                                 21

in the electronics industry. Thus agriculture industry is revealed to be most homogeneous in

production while the electronics is the least homogeneous: an increase in export variety in the

electronics industry would contribute most to country productivity, while export variety in

agriculture contributes the least. The ranking of industries according to their implied elasticities

of substitution are: electronics (-0.024), machinery & transport (-0.575), mining & basic metals

(-0.637), woods & paper (-0.669), textiles & garments (-0.698), the petroleum & plastics

industry (-1.976), and agriculture (-2.086).

       The lower part of Table 2 presents the control variables in the country TFP equation. As

mentioned above, the estimated coefficient associated with the log capital-land ratio has the

interpretation of the negative of the average share of land in GDP. However, while this land

share is about 10 percent in the previous ISUR estimation, it is not precisely estimated in the

current nonlinear 3SLS estimation. The estimated coefficient on the log-difference in the

nontraded goods price is about 0.26. Similar to the previous ISUR finding, this estimate is

significantly less than one which indicates that the price of nontraded goods is poorly measured.

However, with the country and year fixed effects, and the inclusion of these two variables as

controls, as long as the measurement error in nontraded goods is not systematically related to the

country productivity or the export variety indexes, our estimation results should remain robust.

Overall, the results presented in Table 2 show that export variety is significant in determining

industry shares in GDP and aggregate country productivity.


7. Specification Tests

       Given that the above nonlinear 3SLS estimation involves minimizing the criterion

function, the minimized value provides a test statistic for hypothesis testing. The difference

between the values of the criterion functions of the restricted and unrestricted models is
                                                    22

asymptotically chi-squared distributed with degree of freedom equal to the number of

restrictions. According to Davidson and MacKinnon (1993, p. 665), it is important that the same

estimate of variance-covariance matrix be used for both the restricted and unrestricted

estimations, in order to ensure that the test statistic is positive.

        The nonlinear 3SLS estimation has the following restrictions. For each of the share

equation, the homogeneity constraints on prices and endowments are imposed. The homogeneity

constraint on endowments is imposed in the GDP function but not the homogeneity constraint on

prices due to the possible measurement errors in nontraded good prices. The twenty-one

symmetry constraints on the cross-price effects are also imposed on the whole system of

equations, as well as the over-identifying restrictions due to the extra instruments. We first test

for all the homogeneity constraints one at a time. In each case, we constrain the variance-

covariance matrix to be that of the unrestricted model. We further test for the overall

specification of the system by jointly testing the symmetry constraints (12) and over-identifying

restrictions, conditional on all the accepted homogeneity constraints. This is done by comparing

the value of criterion function of the restricted model to a just-identified model with no

symmetry constraints and no extra instruments.

        Table 3 presents the test statistics and the associated p-values of all the hypothesis tests.

None of the homogeneity constraints for endowments are rejected, and all industry share

equations satisfy the homogeneity constraints in prices. The only violation of homogeneity

constraint in prices is for the TFP equation, which we did not impose in the previous estimation.

Thus, the results supported our previous specification in terms of the imposed homogeneity

constraints.
                                                 23

        Conditional on all the satisfied homogeneity constraints, the total number of parameters

estimated (excluding country fixed effects) is 178 and the total number of instruments is 264 (33

per each equation). This implies that the number of over-identifying restrictions is 86. This

jointly tests the 21 symmetry constraints, as well as 65 over-identifying constraints if the system

was just-identified. The minimized value of criterion function of the restricted system with the

fixed variance-covariance matrix is 89.4, and given that the value of criterion function of a just-

identified system is 0 (see Davidson and MacKinnon, 1993, p. 234), the overall specification of

the model is not rejected. The p-value of the test statistics is 0.38. Thus the data support the

joint hypotheses of symmetry constraints and over-identifying restrictions. Table 4 also provide

separate test statistics for the 21 symmetry constraints and the 65 over-identifying restrictions.

In both cases, the individual hypotheses are not rejected.

        In summary, not only is the overall specification of the nonlinear 3SLS model not

rejected by the data, all the instruments included are also shown to be not related with the

regression errors (given that they jointly passed the over-identifying restriction test). Thus, the

results presented in Table 2 provide evidence that trade cost variables such as tariffs, distance

and transport costs affect country productivity only through export variety, so that variety is the

mechanism (Hallak and Levinsohn, 2004) through which trade affects country productivity. In

the next section, we will further present some direct evidence linking these trade costs variables

to export varieties of the industries.


8. Effects of Tariffs and Transport Costs on Export Variety

        Table 4 presents least squares (LS) estimation linking export variety to all instruments

and exogenous variables of the nonlinear 3SLS system presented in Table 2. This is similar but

not identical to the first-stage estimation of the nonlinear system, which involves regressing the
                                                          24

derivatives of each equation with respect to the parameters of the system on all the instruments

and exogenous variables. For example, differentiating (21b) with respect to 1 /(1 − σ n ) we obtain

1
2
    (s   c
         nt        )
              + s*nt ln λcnt* , which is the export variety index for country c and sector n, times the average

share of that industry. In comparison, the regressions we present in Table 4 just use the export

variety index ln λcnt* as a dependent variable, which allows us to see the partial relationships

between export variety and the trade cost variables.

               The top part of Table 4 shows the effects of a one percentage point increase in the U.S.

tariff on the export variety of the industry in the columns. Tariffs are constructed from detailed

U.S. custom data by taking the ratio of duties paid over imports. They vary by industries,

countries and years. We expect industry export variety to decrease with the own tariff of the

industry, while there may exist some positive effects due to reallocation of resources among

industries when there is a tariff increase in other industries.

               All industry export variety indexes are negatively correlated with own tariffs except for

the textiles & garments and the electronics industry. For textiles & garments, MFA quotas are

known to be more restrictive and binding than tariffs, which may explain the insignificant effect

of tariffs on export variety. For the electronics industry, it could be the case that non-tariff

barriers, transport costs and skilled labor endowments are more important in explaining

expansion in export variety than tariffs. For the rest of the industries, the own tariff effects are

all negative and statistically significant. A one percentage point increase in U.S. tariffs lowers

export variety by 16.7 percent in the petroleum & plastics industry, at the highest, and 3.7

percent in the mining & basic metals industry, at the lowest. Finally, most industries benefit

from tariffs imposed on other industries due to reallocation of productive resources. For

example, the textiles & garments industry expands its export variety due to tariffs imposed on
                                                        25

agriculture industry and basic metals industry. Tariffs imposed on the basic metals industry also

benefits the machinery & transport industry, and the electronics industry. Using these tariff

impact estimates, along with the estimates of 1 /(1 − σ n ) in Table 2 and the sample average

industry shares, we calculate that a 10 percentage point increase in all U.S. tariffs would reduce

the exporting country productivity by 2 percent due to the decreases in export variety of the

industries. This implies that tariffs are both statistical and economically important in explaining

export variety and country productivity.

        The next section of Table 4 shows the marginal effects of four trade agreement dummies

(CANFTA, NAFTA, CBI and ANDEAN) on export variety. Given that we already control for

tariffs, these variables capture the effect of the reduction in non-tariff barriers due to the signing

of such agreements on export variety. CANFTA is shown to have positive and significant

impact on export variety in textiles & garments, wood & paper, machinery & transport and the

electronics industry, while NAFTA is shown to have no significant additional effects on variety.

On the other hand, the CBI increases the export variety in agriculture, textiles & garments,

machinery & transport, and the electronics industry, while ANDEAN provides for variety

expansion in textiles & garments and the petroleum & plastics industry.

        The third section of Table 4 focuses on the effects of geography related trade costs

variables such as distance (in log of kilometers) and transport costs.9 In order to allow for

transport costs to have different effects on countries that are in different location, we interact

transport costs with nearby and far-away country dummies, defined as countries that are less or

more than median distance (7,037km) to the U.S. An increase in distance between an export

country and the U.S. diminishes the export variety in agriculture, petroleum & plastics and the

9
 Distance from US is the geographical distance in kilometers between the capitol cities, as obtained from Nicita and
Olarreaga (2004).
                                                         26

mining & basic metals industry, while distance does not seem to matter to the export variety in

the electronics industry. On the other hand, increases in transport costs reduce export variety in

all industries except agriculture. Transport costs are particularly important for the nearby

countries exporting textiles & garments, and far-away countries exporting petroleum & plastics

products. Transport costs are significant in reducing export variety in the machinery & transport

and electronics industries for countries in all locations.

       The last section of Table 4 presents the effects of endowment differences in explaining

export variety in different industries. These variables are the exogenous variables from the

system of share equations and the country productivity equations. All the endowment variables
                                                 2
are positive and highly significant. The R values of these regressions range from 0.62 in the

agriculture industry to 0.83 in the mining & basic metals industry. Overall, the results presented

in Table 4 suggest that all the trade costs variables are important in explaining export variety of

the various industries, as well as the endowment variables. This provide empirical support to

models such as Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Melitz (2003), where trade costs are shown to

determine export variety.


9. Productivity Decomposition

       To gain additional insight into the links between export variety and country productivity,

we performed a post-regression decomposition of estimated productivity based on the results in

Table 2. Using (22), we compute the variance of estimated country TFP as:

                                                  ⎡7 1 c            ln λcnt* ⎤
       var(Estimated   TFPtc                 0                 (
                               ) = var(αˆ ) + var ⎢∑ 2 s nt + s nt

                                                                           )   ⎥
                                                                   (1 − σˆ n ) ⎦
                                                  ⎣ n =1
                                         ⎡                            ln λcnt* ⎤
                                                        (           )
                                                   7
                                 + 2 cov ⎢αˆ c0 , ∑ 12 s cnt + s *nt                         t
                                                                                  ⎥ + var(εˆ c ) .   (23)
                                         ⎢⎣       n =1               (1 − σˆ n ) ⎥⎦
                                                         27

The first term on the right is the variance of country fixed effects, the second is the contribution

of export variety constructed as a weighted average across industries, the third is the covariance

between these, and the fourth is the error variance. If we remove the country fixed effects and

the regression error, then the “variety-induced” country TFP is defined as:

                                                                N
                                                                                    ln λcnt*
                           Variety-induced TFPtc ≡ ∑ 12 (s cnt + s *nt )                       ,                          (24)
                                                               n =1                (1 − σˆ n )

       Taking the first difference of (23) within a country across two years, we can derive the

growth decomposition of country productivity into two terms, which is the growth of variety

induced country TFP and the change in regression errors:

                                 N
                                     ⎛1 c            ln λcnt*                           ln λcnt* −1 ⎞

                                                    (1 − σˆ n )
                                                                      (
                                                                      c          *

                                                                                      )(1 − σˆ n ) ⎠
                                                                                                        (            )
                                                                                                    ⎟⎟ + εˆ ct − εˆ ct −1 . (26)
                                n =1 ⎝



The variance in the growth rate of country TFP is therefore the sum of the variance of the growth

rate of variety-induced country TFP, and the variance of the difference in error terms, along with

the covariance between the two terms.

       Table 5 shows the variance decomposition of country TFP in levels and growth rates.

Not surprisingly, most of the cross-country differences in the TFP levels are explained by

country fixed effects which is not unusual for this type of cross-country study. Controlling for

country fixed effects, variety-induced country TFP can only account for about 2% of the country

productivity levels. However, variety-induced TFP and country fixed effects are correlated,

which jointly contribute nearly 14% of the cross-country variation in TFP levels. If we set aside

country fixed effects, and only focus on variety-induced TFP and regression error terms, then

variety-induced TFP can explain 60% of country productivity in levels.

       The second column of Table 5 shows the growth decomposition of country productivity.

About 13% of the within-country growth in TFP can be explained by the year-to-year growth in
                                                                       28

export variety, while the remaining part is explained by the change in regression errors and the

correlation between the two terms.10 This suggests that while the overall productivity differences

across countries are mainly explained by country fixed effects, export variety nonetheless is

important in explaining within country productivity differences in levels and growth rates.

               To further illustrate the effects of export variety on country productivity, according to

(24) a 1% increase in the export variety of each industry n would increase country productivity

by   1

                                                 percent. Thus, we can compute that at the sample mean, a 10% increase
                                         n


in export varieties of all industries could lead to 1.3% increase in country productivity. This

effect is significant both statistically and economically.

               Figures 3 and 4 plot the partial scatter graph of the country TFP against the export variety

in level and in growth respectively (conditional on country fixed effects and regression errors).

It is evident that holding all else constant, export variety has significant explanatory power for

the variation of the country productivity differences, both in level across countries and in growth

within countries.

               Figure 5 presents a cross country scatter plot of the country TFP against export variety in

1991. Both variables are shown in deviation from their sample means. There is a clear positive

relationship between the export variety of a country and its productivity, which is highlighted by

the positive sloping regression line. Canada has the most export variety which is twice as much

as the sample mean. In terms of the productivity differences, Canada is 42% higher than the

sample mean. Japan has the highest productivity which is 77% higher than the sample mean. In

  Similar results are obtained when we express the productivity growth decomposition using Tornqvist
approximation, rather than first different as in (26). Contribution of variety growth to the growth country TFP is
around 10%.
                                                  29

terms of export variety, an industry in Japan produces 83% more export products than the sample

mean.

          Other countries that have higher than productivity and export variety in Figure 5 include

South Korea, Singapore, and some other OECD countries such as Britain, France, Italy and

Australia. These countries appear on the first quadrant. Countries that perform poorly in terms

of the country productivity and export variety are in the third quadrant. They include Uruguay,

Kenya, Turkey, and the Philippines. For example, export industries in Uruguay produces 179%

less variety than the sample mean, and its productivity is 84% lower. We can also compare

country pairs from the figure. For instance, in 1991, Singapore produces 60% more export

products than the Philippines, and the productivity of Singapore is about twice as high as that of

the Philippines.

          We further explore the movement of export variety and productivity within a country

over time. Figure 6 compares Canada to the sample mean in terms of productivity, variety-

induced productivity differences, and the weighted-average export variety, from 1985 to 1997.

The two productivity series are presented in bars relative to the left-hand scale. The export

variety index is shown as a line in the figure, measured relative to the vertical right-hand scale.

In 1985, Canada’s productivity is 14% higher than the sample mean, while it produces 93% more

export products relative to the sample mean. In 1997, the productivity gap reduces to 7% while

the export variety difference is about 62%. Thus over the years, we see a gradual decline of

export variety in Canada relative to the rest of the world and this is reflected in the productivity

series.

          Figure 7 compares Japan to South Korea. Similar to the previous figure, the two

productivity series are presented in bars relative to on left-hand scale. The export variety index
                                                  30

is shown as a line in the figure, relative to the right-hand scale. The line series shows that, in

1982, industries in Japan produced 50% more export variety than South Korea. The Japanese

advantage over Korea deteriorates over time such that in 1995, an industry in Japan produced

only 20% more variety than Korea. On the other hand, the first bar series shows that, over the

same period of time, the underlying TFP advantage of Japan declines from 20% to near zero.

Thus, with Korea catching up in export variety, the underlying productivity gap between Korea

and Japan is also narrowing.

       A similar comparison can be done for Israel and Greece, as shown in Figure 8. In 1985,

Israel produced 30% more export variety than in Greece, and by 1995, the advantage of Israel

over Greece widens to nearly 90%. On the other hand, with a negative 4% TFP difference, in

1982 Israel was less productive than Greece, but by 1995, Israel had became about 10% more

productive than Greece. Thus, there is a positive correlation between the observed export variety

difference and the country productivity difference, as predicted by the variety-induced

productivity difference, the second bar series in the figure.


10. Conclusions

       Existing analyses of export variety and growth have been restricted to a limited range of

countries (e.g. Feenstra et al, 1999), or a single aggregate measure of export variety correlated

with GDP (Funke and Ruhwedel, 2001a,b, 2002). In this paper we have attempted to improve

the estimation of product variety on country productivity by allowing for multiple sectors, and

introducing export varieties into the GDP function. In exploiting the translog GDP function we

are following Harrigan (1997), who hypothesized that export prices would differ across countries

due to total factor productivity in exports. We have used the industry CES price indexes that

differ across countries due to export variety, and enter as “price effects” into the GDP function
                                                 31

and sectoral share equations. Estimating the share equations simultaneously with the GDP

equation (transformed to become relative country productivity) allows us to identify and estimate

the elasticity of substitution σn between export varieties in each sector, and then infer the

contribution of export variety to country productivity.

       The resulting elasticity estimates range from a low of -0.02 in the electronics industry, to

a high of –2 in the agriculture industry and the petroleum & plastics industry. Because these are

the elasticity of substitution between outputs (measuring the curvature of the concave production

possibilities frontier), we have less intuition about the magnitude of the expected estimates than

for inputs. But the ranking we have obtained seems reasonable, since there is the least

substitution between export varieties in electronics, and the greatest substitution between

varieties within agriculture and petroleum & plastics. In electronics, the estimate of -0.02

indicates that a 10% expansion of product varieties has the same effect as a 10/1.02 = 9.8%

increase in prices, in terms of drawing resources into that sector. For agriculture and petroleum,

however, a 10% increase in product variety has the same effect as a 10/3 = 3.3% rise in prices,

since these products are more highly substitutable in terms of production.

       We have treated export variety as an endogenous variable, and as instruments use those

suggested by the work of Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Melitz (2003): tariffs, transport costs

and distance. By using an over-identifying restriction test on the nonlinear system estimation,

we have also been able to test the important exclusion restriction suggested by these models, that

tariffs and transport costs should not have an impact on productivity except through export

variety. This restriction cannot be rejected, and confirms the importance of export variety as the

mechanism (Hallak and Levinsohn, 2004) by which trade affects productivity. Our results also

show that a 10 percentage point increase in U.S. tariffs would lead to a 2% fall in exporting
                                                 32

countries’ productivity, which indicates that tariffs are statistically and economically important

in affecting productivity via export variety.

       Finally, we have also calculated the impact of export variety differences across countries

on their respective productivities. Not surprisingly, country fixed effects in a panel regression

still account for the vast majority of country productivity differences, so that export variety

explains only 2% of the total variation in country productivity. But setting aside country fixed

effects, export variety can explain 60% of the residual productivity differences, as well as 13%

of the within-country productivity growth. Moreover, at the sample mean, a 10% increase in

export varieties of all industries leads to a 1.3% increase in country productivity. By considering

specific pairs of countries over time, we have also traced out quite plausible patterns between

changes in export varieties and changes in country productivities. These patterns confirm the

importance of export variety in explaining county productivity.
