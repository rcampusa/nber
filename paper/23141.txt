                                         ABSTRACT

On December 1933, John Maynard Keyes published an open letter to President Roosevelt, where
he wrote: “The recent gyrations of the dollar have looked to me more like a gold standard on the
booze than the ideal managed currency of my dreams.” In this paper I use high frequency data to
investigate whether the gyrations of the dollar were unusually high throughout this period. My
results show that although volatility was pronounced, it was not higher than during October 1931-
July 1933. I analyze Keynes writings on the international monetary system in an effort to
understand what he meant in his letter. I compare Keynes’s “The means to prosperity” with
James P. Warburg’s plan for a “modified international standard.”

    1. Introduction

On December 31 1933, The New York Times published an open letter from John Maynard
Keynes to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The note contained the sentence that many people
remember today: “The recent gyrations of the dollar have looked to me more like a gold standard
on the booze than the ideal managed currency of my dreams.”1

This was a direct reference to the Administration’s “gold buying program,” launched on October
25 1933.2 According to this plan, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was allowed to
purchase gold at prices determined periodically by the Secretary of the Treasury and the
President. As Roosevelt explained in his Fourth Fireside Chat, the purpose of this policy was to
raise the international price of gold and, in that way, generate a dollar devaluation and,
ultimately, higher commodity prices. The rationale behind the program was given by the theories
of George F. Warren, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell, who after analyzing large
volumes of data for over two centuries concluded that there was a close relation between the
price of gold and commodity prices.3

Most analysts interpreted Keynes words as asserting that during the gold buying program the
dollar exchange rate was excessively volatile, and that this volatility was harmful for the
recovery.4 Keynes told the President that it was time to make policy changes. He wrote (see
Appendix B):

                  “In the field of gold-devaluation and exchange policy the time has come when
                  uncertainty should be ended. This game of blind man’s buff with exchange
                  speculators serves no useful purpose and is extremely undignified. It upsets
                  confidence, hinders business decisions, occupies the public attention in a measure
                  far exceeding its real importance, and is responsible both for the irritation and for
                  a certain lack of respect which exists abroad.”

In this paper I use high frequency data to analyze the behavior of the dollar in the 1920s and
1930s. I am particularly interested in establishing whether volatility was higher in the last nine
weeks of 1933 – the time of operation of the gold buying program –, than during the rest of the

  As explained below, there were two phases for the gold buying program. Generally, the second phase, which
started in late October, is singled out as “the gold buying program.”

period. In the analysis I use weekly data for 1921 through 1936, a time of vast changes in the
international monetary system. During this time the U.K. and France returned to the gold
standard – in 1925 and 1926 respectively –, the U.K. went off gold (1931), the U.S. imposed a
gold embargo and abandoned the gold standard (1933), the London World Conference failed to
achieve stabilization (1933), the U.S. devalued the dollar and adopted a new system with a fixed
exchange rate relative to gold (1934), and France got off gold (1936). I estimate Markov-
switching regressions with regime-dependent variances to identify periods with different
exchange rate volatility. For 1921-1936 it is possible to identify three regimes. I find that when
the gold buying program was launched the exchange rate moved to the “high volatility” regime,
as suggested by Keynes. The extent of turbulence, however, was not higher than in late 1931,
immediately after the U.K. got off gold. Moreover, towards the end of the gold buying program,
the probability of being in the high volatility regime declined significantly; the exchange rate
moved to the “intermediate” regime.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 I provide some historical background.
I describe the gold buying program and I discuss the theories of George F. Warren and his co-
author Frank A. Pearson. In Section 3 I present the basic data, and I provide some preliminary
analysis. In Section 4 I use Markov switching regressions with regime-dependent variances to
analyze whether the extent of volatility during the gold buying program was higher than during
other times within the 1926-1936 period. Section 5 deals with Keynes views on the international
monetary system in 1933, in light of the empirical findings in this paper. I argue that Keynes’s
plan at the time was similar to a plan developed by James P. Warburg, a close adviser of
President Roosevelt. Finally, Section 6 contains conclusions and closing remarks. There are also
two appendixes.

       2. The gold buying program of 1933

During his first year in office, President Roosevelt repeatedly stated that one of the most
important goals of his administration was to raise commodity prices, which had declined
precipitously since 1920. For example, on April 19 1933, after announcing that the U.S. was
abandoning the gold standard, he said: 5

                    “The whole problem before us is to raise commodity prices. For the last year, the
                    dollar has been shooting up [this was a reference to the depreciating pound
                    sterling] and we decided to quit competition. The general effect probably will be
                    an increase in commodity prices. It might well be called the next step in the
                    general program.”

In mid-July commodity prices were much higher than what they had been a month earlier. In
four weeks the price of cotton increased by 22%, from 9.4 to 11.5 cents a pound; the price of
corn by 42%, wheat by 38%, and rye by a remarkable 55%. In addition, the dollar depreciated
very significantly with respect to the pound; the exchange rate went from 4.18 dollars per pound
on June 12, to 4.75 on July 12, a depreciation of 12%. In relation to March 3, the day before
Inauguration, the dollar had weakened by 30% relative to sterling. There were reasons for the
President to be confident and satisfied.

A few days later he suffered a reality check. Suddenly things started to move in reverse. The
dollar strengthened swiftly and commodity prices began to fall at a surprisingly rapid clip.
Between July 17 and July 31 the price of corn declined by 28%, that of cotton by 15%, and the
price of wheat dropped by 24%. During the same period the dollar strengthened by 11% with
respect to the pound. It appeared that everything had been an illusion, and that the improvements
of the last few weeks were just the handiwork of speculators.

The agricultural lobby reacted with fury to the collapse in prices. FDR was painfully aware of
the situation. He feared that if prices didn’t increase again soon there would be political riots,
with hundreds of thousands of farmers marching on Washington. On July 22, he told one of his
aides that he was increasingly concerned about the news of farmers “stopping milk trucks and
pouring their contents in the gutters.”6

During the first half of August 1933 the president met several times with George F. Warren, a
professor of agricultural economics at Cornell, to discuss commodity markets. In 1931 Warren
and his colleague Frank I. Pearson had published a book, Prices, where they had analyzed price
behavior for a score of products and countries during more than one hundred years. Their
conclusion was that individual commodity prices went up and down because the world’s stock of
monetary gold increased and decreased through time. This meant that the solution for the
deflation was rather simple: the value of monetary gold had to increase dramatically. The easiest
ways of doing this, declared Warren, was by increasing the dollar price of gold. Warren and
Pearson emphasized that their approach had nothing to do with traditional monetary theory.7 For
them, what the Federal Reserve did was rather irrelevant, as were the quantity theory of money
and the equation of exchange. After explaining their basic equation, Warren and Pearson wrote
that their analysis “has no relationship to the formula          … No one of [our]… factors
                                          8
correspond to any factor in             .”

In mid-August President Roosevelt decided to put Warren’s theories to work, and asked Dean
Acheson, the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, to “try his hand at a draft (for discussion only) of

  In that sense, in spite of some superficial similarities, the Warren view differed significantly from Irving Fisher’s
“compensated dollar” proposal.

an Executive Order offering to buy newly minted gold for 30 days at a fixed price say $28 an
ounce and an offer to sell gold to the arts and dentists et at the same price.”9 At the time the
official price of gold was $20.67.

Two weeks later, on August 29, Executive Order No. 6261 was issued. It invoked the economy’s
state of emergency, and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to accept newly minted gold for
sale on consignment. The metal could be sold to individuals authorized to acquire gold – artists
and dentists –, and to foreigners. The purchase price would be “equal to the best price obtainable
in the free market of the world after taking into consideration any incidental expenses such as
shipping costs and insurance.”10

By September 29, commodity markets continued to be depressed. The price of corn was 28%
lower than on July 15; the prices of cotton, rye and wheat had declined by 13%, 30%, and 21%
relative to that date. The plan was not working as George F. Warren had anticipated, and the
President decided to make some adjustments and to expand the gold-buying program.

On Sunday October 22, FDR delivered his Fourth Fireside Chat. He opened by summarizing his
Administration’s accomplishments, and told the American public that things were improving. He
asserted that since he had become president 4 million people had found work. He reiterated that
the definitive goal of the government was to “restore commodity price levels, [and] to make
possible the payment of public and private debts more nearly at the price level at which they
were incurred.”11

Towards the end of the presentation the President said that in order to accomplish the goal of
raising commodity prices he was establishing a market for gold in the United States. The
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) would buy newly minted gold at prices determined
from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury and the President. If needed, the RFC would
also buy and sell gold in the world market at these prices. After reviewing the President speech,
analysts determined that the most important difference between this gold-buying program and
the one established on August 29 was that under the original plan gold purchases were at

   A rough summary of gold-related policies during this period is this: On March 6 a gold embargo was declared; on
April 5 people were ordered to sell all their gold holdings to the Federal Reserve at the official price of $20.67 per
ounce; on April 19 the President forbade all gold exports and announced that the country was off the gold
standard; on June 5 gold clauses on debt contracts were annulled retroactively; on July 3 FDR announced that the
U.S. was not going to negotiate with the U.K. and France the “stabilization of the exchanges” within the context of
the London Economic Conference. Executive Order No. 6261 may be found in Acheson (1965), p. 258-259.

ongoing world prices, while the new initiative permitted the government to set any price it
wanted and to alter it as frequently as it desired.12

On October 25, the first day of the program, the RFC paid $31.36 per ounce of gold, 27 cents
above the world price. During the next 45 days or so, FDR, with George F. Warren’s assistance,
determined every morning the price at which the RFC would buy gold during that day; almost
always at a premium over the world price. In Figure 1 I present the daily RFC and world prices
for gold during October 25 December 31, 1933.

The RFC made its first international purchase on November 1, when it bought a small batch of
gold in France at $32.36 an ounce. According to The New York Times the size of the deal was not
known exactly.13 As days went by bankers and reporters began to wonder about the scale of the
program. The Administration, however, was secretive regarding international transactions. 14 On
November 9, Jesse Jones, the Chairman of the RFC, informed the press that since the launching
of the program the Corporation had bought 213,000 ounces of newly minted gold domestically.
He stated that the amount of gold bought in global markets was modest, but refused to divulge
the exact amount.15 That day the price offered was $33.15 per ounce, 10 cents higher than the
international market price. On November 15, an informed source who did not want to be
identified stated that to that date purchases abroad had amounted to only $6 million. By late
December the RFC was paying $32.61 per ounce of gold.

At the end of 1933, almost coincidentally with the publication of Keynes open letter to the
President, the program was effectively ended.16 On January 30, 1934, and after an intense debate
in Congress, the Gold Act of 1934 was signed into law. The next day the President set the new
official price of gold at $35 an ounce. The Treasury announced that it was willing to buy and sell
any amount of metal at that price, internationally. U.S. residents, however, were not allowed to
hold gold. The Gold Acts also created the Exchange Stabilization Fund, originally funded with
$2 billion from the governments “profits” from the devaluation of the dollar. This official price
of $35 an ounce was in effect until August 1971, when Richard Nixon closed the Treasury’s
“gold window.”




12
   In order to get around the fact that the official price of gold was still $20.67 an ounce, the RFC paid with its own
discounted debentures, which were immediately bought by the Treasury at par. See Acheson (1965).

   Formally, the program continued through January 1934, but there was only one price change, on January 16
from $34.06 to $34.45 per ounce. As I point out below, if I extend the period considered under the program, the
results are virtually identical.

   3. Dollar gyrations in the 1920s and 1930s: Preliminary Analysis

Figure 2.1 and 2.2 present weekly data for the British pound-dollar and French franc-dollar
exchange rates for 1921-1936 (see the Appendix A for data sources). These data are measured as
dollars per unit of foreign currency; higher values, then, represent dollar depreciation. Much of
the history of the international financial system during this period is captured by these two
figures. In Figure 2.1 it is possible to see the U.K. return to the gold standard in May 1925 at the
historical parity of $4.87 per pound, and the subsequent abandonment of gold in September
1931. In both figures it is possible to see the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in April 1933. Figure
2.2 for the franc shows the return of France to the gold standard in December 1926 at a much
weaker parity than the pre-World War I level, as well as the abandonment of gold by France in
March 1936. Figure 2.2 also show the adoption by the U.S. of a new official price of gold – $35
per ounce – on the last day of January 1934.

In the analysis that follows I concentrate on the dollar-pound exchange rate, the variable Keynes
referred to in his open New York Times letter. The results for the franc yield similar results and
are available on request.

Figure 3 presents the weekly percentage change of the pound-dollar exchange rate. Simple visual
inspection suggests four chronological phases. (1) A volatile period before the return of the U.K.
to gold. This phase goes from January 1921 to April 1925. (2) A (very) tranquil period
corresponding to the time when the two countries were on the gold standard, from May 1925 to
September 1931. During this phase exchange rate changes were minimal and stayed within the
“gold points.” (3) A turbulent period following the abandonment of gold by the U.K. in
September 1931. This volatile period continued after the abandonment of gold by the U.S. in
April 1933, and lasted until late January 1934. Notice that the “gold buying” program takes place
towards the end of this phase, and is highlighted by a shade area in Figure 3 (October 25-
December 31 1933). And (4), a period of limited variability which took place after the Gold Act
was passed by the U.S. Congress on January 30, 1934.

In Table 1 I present descriptive statistics for these four chronological phases, and for the
complete period. Two things stand up from these figures: First, the mean weekly change for the
dollar-pound rate was highest during the gold-buying program, at just over 1% per week. This
captures the fact that one of the goals of the program was, indeed, to raise the exchange rate (i.e.
depreciate the USD). Second, during this period the degree of volatility, measured by the
standard deviation of percentage changes, was the second highest. It was slightly lower than that
in the period immediately following the U.K.’s abandonment of the gold standard (9/21/31 to
10/21/33).

In Table 2 I present a battery of tests for the equality of variances between the gold buying
program (October 25-December 31, 1933) and the two phases with market determined rates in
                                                           7


1921-25 and 1931-1933. The results in Panel A indicate that the null hypothesis of equality of
variances is rejected under all tests for the comparison of the gold buying program and the period
before the U.K. returned to gold (1921-1925). On the other hand, as may be seen in Panel B, the
null of equality of variance during the gold buying program and the post-United Kingdom gold
period (September 1931 through October 1933) cannot be rejected in three of the four tests.17

These results confirm that dollar volatility was high during the gold buying program signaled out
by Keynes in his letter. However, they also suggest that it was not higher than during the period
comprised between September 1931 and September 1933. That is, according to these preliminary
results the system may have been “on the booze” for much longer than Keynes suggested. The
purpose of the Section that follows is to analyze these data in greater detail and to investigate
whether this preliminary chronological volatility classification is supported by formal analyses.

     4. Markov Switching Regressions: Weekly Data, 1921-1936

In this Section I present the results from the estimation of Markov switching regressions with
regime-dependent variances to identify periods of different degrees of exchange rate volatility.
As noted, I use weekly data for 1921-1936. The aim of this analysis is to determine whether
volatility was higher during the gold buying program than during the rest of the off-gold period.
The basic Markov-switching model with regime dependent variances has the following form:18



     (1)



Where             is the weekly percentage change of the pound-dollar rate,    is a linear
regression function that may depend on the k regimes, is an iid normally distributed error
term, with a standard deviation that is also regime dependent and may exhibit some form of
autocorrelation. This type of switching volatility model was developed by Hamilton and Susmel
(1994), and has been used by Edwards and Susmel (2001), among others, to analyze exchange
rate volatility around turbulent periods. In Markov models the regime probabilities       are
assumed to depend on the previous state (Hamilton, 1989):




17
   Notice that in this comparison the devaluation of the pound on September 21 1931 – which resulted in a
negative spike equal to -0.27 –, is part of the post-gold sample. If this specific observation is removed from the
sample, and the analysis is started on September 28, the standard deviation for the post-gold period becomes
0.02170, slightly lower than that of the gold-buying program. In this case it is not possible to reject, with any of the
four tests, the null hypothesis of equality of variance across these two periods.
18
   See Hamilton (1989), Hamilton and Susmel (1994).

       (2)                                                      .



We anticipate that in the case at hand there will be, at least, two regimes: one corresponding to
the period when both the U.S. and the U.K. were on the gold standard, with very low volatility
(from May 1925 through September 1931), and a different state when one of the two nations (or
both of them) was off gold. The key question in this analysis is whether it is possible to identify
more than one turbulent regime. If this is the case, we are interested in understanding to which of
these volatile regimes the gold-buying program belongs to. More specifically, the question is
whether the gold buying period corresponds, as Keynes suggests in his letter, to the regime with
the highest volatility or whether, on the contrary, it falls in the regime with intermediate
volatility.

       4.1 Base case results

In the base case estimates I allow for a regime-dependent intercept, a lagged dependent variable
and regime-dependent variance. The error is assumed to have a common AR(1) term. Hansen
likelihood tests indicate that the best characterization of the period under study corresponds to
three regimes.19 The results for the Markov regressions are in Table 3: Regime 1 corresponds to
intermediate volatility; Regime 2 to low volatility, and Regime 3 to high volatility. All estimates
of the regime-dependent variance, log (sigma), are significant at conventional levels, as are the
coefficients for the lagged dependent variables and the common AR(1) term. When slightly
different specifications were used, three regimes were still identified and the relative values of
the three regimes was maintained (more on this below).

As may be seen in Table 3, the differences in the extent of volatility across the three regimes are
significant: the estimated variance during the high volatility regime is 7.3 times higher than the
estimated variance for the intermediate volatility regime. The latter is, in turn, 8.4 times higher
than the estimated variance during the tranquil period.

Table 4 provides a summary of the transitional probabilities and the regimes’ duration. As may
be seen, the diagonal probabilities are very high, indicating that there is significant regime
persistence. This Table also shows that there is a 17.5% probability that if the system is in the
high volatility regime, the following week it will be in the intermediate volatility one. The
probabilities of moving from some degree of volatility (either intermediate or high) to
tranquility, or vice versa, are very low. As anticipated, the low volatility regime has the longest
expected duration, at 139 weeks. The expected duration of high volatility regimes is 18.2 weeks,
and that of intermediate volatility is only 5.7 weeks.

Figure 4 contains the smoothed regime probabilities corresponding to the base-case estimates. As
expected, the low volatility regime (Regime 2) is correctly identified as the period when both
nations were on the gold standard and the exchange rate moved within the gold points. Also, as
expected, the post-Gold Act of 1934 period – when a new official price of gold in the U.S. was
set at $35 an ounce – corresponds to intermediate volatility; during this period the pound was
still off gold and fluctuated according to market forces (although the British intervened from
time to time through their Exchange Equalization Account, established in mid-1932). As may be
seen, the period between September 1931 and January 1934, shifts, several times, from
intermediate to high volatility, and back to intermediate. In addition, and as is shown in greater
detail below, the system moves into high volatility at the beginning of the gold buying period,
but towards the end of it, it switches back to intermediate volatility.

In order to analyze in greater detail regime switches during the latter part of 1933, in Figure 5 I
zoom on the probabilities for the intermediate and high volatility regimes between August 1 and
December 31, 1933. For expository reasons I have excluded the low volatility probabilities; they
are mostly zero during these 24 weeks. This Figure shows that the system moved into the high
volatility regime during the last week of August, at the time the original gold buying program,
which purchased metal at ongoing world prices, was announced and launched (Executive Order
No. 6261). It stayed on the high volatility regime until the last week of November, when it
switched to intermediate volatility. That is, Keynes was right in pointing out that the gold buying
program generated high dollar “gyrations,” but what he failed to notice (or to mention) is that
towards the end of the period this volatility had abated, and that the pound-dollar rate was back
to an intermediate volatility regime. Keynes also failed to mention that although the gold buying
program was characterized by high volatility, this was not higher than during other periods
around that time. Indeed, as may be seen in Figure 4, the system was also in a high volatility
regime during several weeks after the U.K. abandoned gold in September 1931. According to
this analysis it is not possible to identify a different regime (with even higher volatility) during
the gold buying program.

An interesting question is why volatility declined towards the end of November. The most
plausible explanation is that at that time the administration – and possibly FDR himself –
realized that the discretionary way in which the RFC purchase prices were determined was
generating heightened uncertainty. It was around that time when Jacob Viner wrote a longish
memorandum to Henry Morgenthau, Jr. (then the Acting Secretary of the Treasury) where he
explained that the gold-buying program was not working as promised. A serious problem, Viner
asserted, was that the purchases abroad were too small, and did not really change the
international price of gold. In addition, the discretionary changes in the price of gold and the
absence of a clear program geared at stabilization were encouraging speculation, and negatively
affecting investment decisions.20 A regression – admittedly with very few observations – of the

probability of being in a high volatility regime on the weekly percentage change of the RFC gold
price provides some support to this view. The coefficient of the log differential of the weekly
prices for newly minted gold is positive (point estimate 0.182), and marginally significant
(t=1.98).

   4.2 Robustness and extensions

In order to test for the robustness of the results, I estimated a number of Markov-switching
regressions with alternative specifications. In particular, I introduced additional regressors,
including the one month forward premium in the exchange rate market (see Appendix A for data
sources). As may be seen from Table 5, the coefficient for this variable is significantly positive.
More important, the results regarding the number of regimes and the relative sizes of the
variance in each of them are very similar from those reported in the base case estimates and
discussed above, and provide support to the main conclusions of the analysis. The estimated
regime probabilities also confirm the conclusions discussed above.

Notice that in Table 5 the forward premium was introduced as a regressor that is not regime-
dependent. However, if it is included as depending on the regime, the results are very similar,
and don’t affect the conclusions in any significant way (results available on request).

Markov switching regressions with regime-dependent variances are not the only method to
analyze changing volatility through time; a number of other techniques may be used. An
alternative, for example, is to estimate EGARCH models. When this is done – results available
upon request – the main conclusions of this analysis are maintained: volatility was high during
the earlier part of the gold buying program, but it was not higher than after the U.K. abandoned
the gold standard in 1931; in fact, it was somewhat smaller. In addition, the EGARCH analysis
also confirms that during the last month of the gold buying program, exchange rate volatility
tended to decline significantly.

The analysis presented above may be extended in several ways. For instance, the estimated
regime probabilities may be used to analyze the way in which other political and financial
developments during these 16 years affected currency markets. For example, it is possible to
inquire how the inauguration, and eventual failure, of the London Economic Conference of June-
July 1933 impacted on exchange rate instability. Another interesting episode is the end of the
intergovernmental wars moratorium in November 1932, and the 1932 Ottawa Conference on
imperial preferences. Yet another one is the way in which the creation of the British Exchange
Equalization Account in mid-1932 affected exchange rate behavior. All of these are questions for
future research.

   5. The Keynes and Warburg plans

When Keynes wrote his New York Times letter he already had a clear idea of the type of
international monetary system that he wanted to see in place. He had discussed the problem in a
                                                        11


number of his writings, including A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) and A Treatise on Money
(1930). But for the purpose of this paper the most relevant exposition of Keynes’s ideas is the
one he presented in the 1933 pamphlet The Means to Prosperity, which reproduced in a revised
and enlarged fashion four articles published in the Times of London during 1933. It is here where
he describes the “ideal managed currency” system of his dreams, and where he lays down the
bases of what would eventually become the “Keynes Plan” discussed during the Bretton Woods
Conference in 1944.21

In 1923, in A Tract on Monetary Reform, Keynes wrote what became a famous quote: “In truth,
the gold standard is already a barbarous relic… [I]n the modern world of paper currency and
bank credit there is no escape from a ‘managed’ currency, whether we wish it or not…”22
However, Keynes views evolved, and by late 1932 they were more nuanced. In Chapter V of The
Means to Prosperity he suggests that all major powers adopt a new standard and create an
“international note issue” linked to gold. Keynes wrote: 23

                 “[T]he notes would be gold-notes and the participants would agree to accept them
                 as the equivalent of gold. This implies that the national currencies of each
                 participant would stand in some defined relationship to gold. It involves, that is to
                 say, a qualified return to the gold standard.”

According to Keynes’ plan, central banks would have greater flexibility to undertake
countercyclical policies.24 More importantly, his “international notes” would greatly increase
worldwide liquidity, and reduce central bankers’ apprehensions about “free gold,” or amount of
bullion over and above what was required to back the bank's monetary liabilities. Keynes also
believed that a once and for all depreciation of “national currencies” with respect to gold – notice
the plural, “currencies” – would help increase “loan-expenditure,” as central banks would be “be
satisfied with a smaller reserve of international money.”25 In the managed currency system of
Keyes’s dreams currency values would be linked to the “gold notes,” and thus pegged to each
other; in this world there would not be excessive gyrations in the pound-dollar rate. It was with
respect to this ideal system that Keynes remarked that in late 1933 the dollar was “on the booze.”

Keyes plan was similar to a plan developed, somewhat independently, in 1933 by James P.
Warburg, a banker and adviser to President Roosevelt. In preparation to the London Economic
21

Conference. This pamphlet put together (somewhat) revised versions of four articles that Keynes published in The
Times of London in March 1933. The gold notes were a precursor of the Bancor, the international currency he
proposed in the 1940s.
24
   Already in 1932 a number of economists were critical of the Fed for not undertaking counter cyclical policy. See
Appendix I in Wright (1932). In mid-1933 a group of Chicago economists made a more specific proposal for
reforming the monetary system, which they sent to the Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. This scheme
received the name of the “Chicago Plan.” See Tavlas (1997).

Conference – which was inaugurated on June 12, 1933 –, Warburg drafted a proposal for a new
“international standard” to be adopted by all nations. Gold would continue to be at the center of
the global system, but the rules of the game would be different. There would be more flexibility
and bullion itself would not be physically shipped from place to place. Silver would also have a
role; up to 20% of central bank reserves could be maintained in the white metal. There would be
no gold clauses, which tied debt contracts to the price of gold, and the “cover ratio” would be
reduced significantly in every country. The proposed new cover ratio was 25%, which in the
U.S. represented an important reduction relative to the existing 40%. This “modified gold
standard” would reestablish exchange rate order and would allow exporters, importers, bankers
and investors to plan ahead their international businesses. Every country would declare a new
parity and exchange rates would be pegged to each other. Competitive devaluation would be
ruled out, and with the lower cover ratio central banks would have the ability to undertake
expansive monetary policy during downturns, and thus avoid cycles of deflation. 26

 It was not until late January 1934, with the passage of the Gold Act that the U.S. moved in the
direction suggested by Keynes and Warburg. Indeed, as the results reported above indicate
(Figure 4), after that date exchange rate volatility switched to the intermediate regime and stayed
there until the end of the sample. The world, however, would have to wait until 1944 and the
Bretton Woods conference to start moving in the direction of a new international standard with
managed currencies that was closer to Keynes’s “dreams.”27

     6. Concluding Remarks

The analysis presented in this paper shows that during the early weeks of the U.S. gold-buying
program of 1933, exchange rate volatility increased significantly, as pointed out by Keynes in his
open letter to FDR; indeed according to my estimates at the end of August 1933 the system
moved from intermediate to high volatility regime. However, the results show two additional
features of this period not mentioned by Keynes. (1) During the gold-buying program volatility
was not higher than immediately after the UK abandoned the gold standard in September 1931.
In fact, it was somewhat lower. In that sense, exchange rates may have been “on the booze” for
longer than what Keynes pointed out. (2) Towards the latter part of the gold-buying program
exchange rate instability declined significantly, with the system moving decisively from a high
volatility regime to an intermediate volatility one. This move was related to a change in policy
by the RFC regarding the purchase prices of gold. As noted, these results are robust to the
specification of the Markov switching regressions. They are also maintained if alternative
volatility techniques, such as EGARCH models, are used.

  In 1892, German economist Julius Wolf wrote a memorandum for the International Monetary Conference in
Brussels where he suggested a world international system with bank notes linked to gold, which were to be
deposited at a clearing house that was supposed to work in a way similar to the Universal Postal Union. This plan
was a clear predecessor to the Keynes, Warburg and White plans. For details see Haines (1943).
