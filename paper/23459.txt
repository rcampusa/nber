JEL No. J15,J16

                                       ABSTRACT

We study the role of homophily in group formation. Using a unique dataset of MBA students, we
observe homophily in ethnicity and gender increases the probability of forming teams by 25%.
Homophily in education and past working experience increases the probability of forming teams
by 17% and 11 % respectively. Homophily in education and working experience is stronger
among males than females. Further, we examine the causal impact of homophily on team
performance. Homophily in ethnicity increases team performance by lifting teams in bottom
quantiles to median performance quantiles, but it does not increase the chance of being top
performers. Our findings have implications for understanding the lack of diversity in
entrepreneurship and venture capital industry.

    1. Introduction


        Literature in sociology has documented the existence of homophily, the desire to associate

with those similar to you, in various social networks, from the strongest social ties such as in

marriage (Kalmijn 1998, Fiore and Donath 2005), close friendships (Marsden, 1987, 1988, Currarini,

Jackson and Pin 2009), to professional networks (Gompers, Muhkarlyamov, and Xuan 2016; Ruef,

Aldrich and Carter 2003; Sorenson and Stuart 2001) and acquiescence (Hampton and Wellman

2000). Homophily can arise from the similarities in demographic characteristics, such as ethnicity,

country of origin, age, and gender. It can also be based on acquired characteristics, such as

education, occupation and religion (Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954, Mcpherson et al. 2001). Most past

research has focused on homophily in ethnicity and gender. Relatively few studies1 have examined

homophily in educational and professional backgrounds due to limitation in data. Verbrugge (1977)

and Louch (2000) explore homophily in both demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. While

they confirm the existence of homophily along both dimensions, they do not distinguish the relative

strength of homophily that each dimension engenders.


        In this paper, we contribute four major findings to the literature on homophily and its

effects on performance. First, we estimate the relative economics magnitudes of homophily in

ethnicity, gender, education and working experience. The first central question we address is: what

are the strongest homophilic forces in forming social networks? Using a novel dataset of HBS MBA

students, we find ethnicity and gender are the two strongest homophilic forces in social networks.

Individuals are 25% more likely to form groups with people of the same ethnicity or gender relative

to randomly matching within a set of students who choose the groups that they work with on real

microbusinesses. Homophily in education and working experience is weaker than demographic

1 Among studies that do include education homophily, most of them use “Education year” instead of past educational
institution as a dimension of homophily.

                                                                                                                     3
homophily, but they are still economically significant. School ties and shared working experience

increase the probability of forming social networks by 17% and 11% respectively. Further, we find

homophily in education and working experience is stronger among males than females.


        Our second contribution is to examine the relationship between group size and strength of

homophily. Currarini, Jackson, and Pin (2009) study the friendship patterns in American high

schools. They find the existence of homophily among all ethnic groups, and it is the strongest

among middle-sized groups. They present an economic model in which homophily is generated by

bias in preference and bias in the meeting process. In a follow-up paper by the same authors

(Currarini, Jackson, and Pin, 2010), they empirically estimate the magnitude of each source of

homophily for different ethnic groups. They find that Asians and African American exhibit the

strongest biases in the meeting process. A slightly different model by Currarini and Redondo (2016)

predicts that homophily only exists in relatively large groups, because the cost of inbreeding will be

too high for very small groups.

        Consistent with Currarini and Redondo (2016), we find homophily is weaker among

Hispanic American and African American students, two relatively underrepresented groups

compared to White Americans and Asian Americans in our sample of Harvard MBA students. This

could be due to the high search cost within small groups, or as a result of the strategic decisions to

team up with White and Asian Americans as a means to compensate for being underrepresented

minorities. We also find homophily is strongest among international students, students who

graduated from non-ivy league schools, and students who worked in non-major industries2. This is

contradictory to Currarini and Redondo’s model. The group sizes of these students are small, yet the




2 Non major industries refer to non-finance, non-consulting and non-technology industries. Most of the students are
from finance, consulting or technology industries.

                                                                                                                 4
homophily is the strongest. Future theoretical work should explore the interaction between group

size and different types of homophilic ties with heterogeneous strengths.

        Third, our unique dataset allows us to explore the dynamics of entrepreneurial team

formation. Gompers and Wang (2017) document the homogeneity in gender and ethnicity in US

start-up teams. Female and non-Asian minorities have been underrepresented in the innovation

sector for the past 20 years and the progress to achieve diversity has been slow. One possible

explanation is the biases of hiring people with similar background. Despite large volumes of research

on homophily in various settings, only a few studies have explored the effect of homophily in

entrepreneurship. Ruef, Ruef, and Carter (2003) survey 830 entrepreneurs on their founding team

composition. They find that the probability of a team with the same gender or with the same

ethnicity is higher than a random matching process would predict. In our setting, we observe MBA

students tend to form entrepreneurial teams with people who have similar social and demographic

backgrounds. Given a significant portion of students will be working at start-ups and venture capital

firms after graduation, our results have implications for understanding start-up team diversity,

recruitment process in start-ups and venture capital firms, and deal selection in venture capital.


        Finally, our paper contributes to the understanding of the causal relationship between team

diversity and performance. Theoretical work on diversity focuses on the trade-off between the

information gains and the communication costs. Heterogeneous teams benefit from more diverse

pools of skill and knowledge, but at the same time, differences in ethnicity, culture, and mother

language hinder efficient communication among team members, thus potentially lowering

productivity. (Alesina and La Ferrara 2003, Lazear 1999). Knippenberg and Schipper (2007) review

empirical literature on team diversity and performance from 1997 to 2005, and they conclude that

the empirical results on diversity are “highly inconsistent” because of the endogenous process of

group formation.

                                                                                                     5
        Recent studies use field experiment to alleviate the endogeneity concern. Hoogendoorn and

Praag (2012) find the benefit of information sharing is greater than communication cost in more

ethnically diverse teams. Marx et al. (2015) find horizontal diversity (i.e., at the same level of

authority) in ethnicity decreases team efficiency, because people in heterogeneous teams are more

likely to complain about their teammates. Vertical heterogeneity (i.e., at different levels of authority),

on the contrary, increases team performance, as workers tend to exert more effort when the

manager is from a different ethnic background. Gompers and Wang (2017) find parenting daughter

increases venture partners’ tendency to hire female investment partners. Using the number of

daughters by senior venture partners as the instrument for venture capital firm gender diversity, the

authors find gender diversity improves venture capital firm’s investment performance. Our study

provides a clean setting to test the causal relationship between diversity and team performance. By

exploiting a quasi-experimental setting of team assignments in the class year of 2013, we find

homogeneity in ethnicity increases team performance by lifting teams from the bottom quantiles to

median performance quantile, potentially because it increases communication efficiency and lowers

the probability of conflict within the team. However, homogeneity does not increase the chance of

being top performers. We do not find homogeneity in gender, education, or past work experience is

an important factor in determining team performance.



    2. Setting


        First year MBA students at the HBS from 2012 through 2016 were required to take a field

course in the spring semester of their first year. Throughout the course, students were required to

design and launch a real microbusiness. At the beginning of the semester, students formed teams of




                                                                                                        6
5-7 people from the same section.3 Two months into the semester, students presented their projects

to faculty members. If the faculty members believed the proposed project was achievable, the team

then proceeded to present their project to a panel of judges at the end of semester (“IPO day”). The

panel of judges then ranked all the projects based on teams’ performance and the quality of the idea

during the “IPO day”.


         When the field course was first introduced to the students in the spring semester of 2012 for

the MBA Class of 20134, the school assigned each student to the teams based on their background.

One goal of the assignments was to make teams were somewhat diverse in terms of gender,

ethnicity, education, and past working experience. After 2013, the school changed the team

formation policy and started to have students choose teammates themselves. The school did not

impose any restriction on how students formed their teams. Anecdotal evidence suggests that

students frequently formed teams with friends who had similar demographic backgrounds. Figure 1

plots the probability of a student being matched to her classmate conditional on having the same

ethnicity, gender, education, or industry backgrounds. The conditional probability of matching

increases in all four dimensions when students are allowed to find teammates freely. This provides

clean evidence on the existence of homophily during the process of team formation. In the next

sections, we explore the relative strength of homophily based upon ethnicity, gender, education and

past industry experience. From there, we explore the performance implications of diversity on

performance.


         Because teams were assigned by the MBA Administration for the Class of 2013, the diversity

of teams is exogenous to each team member. As such, the causal implications of diversity for

  2013 refers to the class year of 2013, so do 2014, 2015 and 2016 later in the paper. Students take the field course at first
year. Eg. Class year 2013 students take field course in 2012.

                                                                                                                            7
performance can be estimated for the Class of 2013. We also explore the performance impact of

diversity for the Classes of 2014-2016, although endogeneity of team diversity makes interpretation

of the performance results difficult.



      3. Data


           Our data were provided by the HBS MBA Program. In the data, we observe the gender,

ethnicity, home country, undergraduate institution, past employer, and the industry of each MBA

student from class year 2013 to 2016 but were not provided with students’ actual names. Table I

reports the summary statistics on 3,684 MBA students in our sample. Females make up 40% of total

student population. Approximately 40% of the students are white Americans, 12% are Asian

Americans, 5% are African Americans, 4% are Hispanic Americans, and 35% are international

students. India, Canada, and China represent the top three origin countries for international

students5. In terms of past work experience, roughly half of the students are from the finance or

consulting industries, and not surprisingly, the big three consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain and BCG)

and the two largest investment banks (Goldman and Morgan Stanley) are the top 5 suppliers of

Harvard MBA students (Table II). Approximately 11% of students had experience in the technology

industry, and this number increased by more than 50% from 2013 to 2016. 27% of the MBA

students graduated from Ivy League schools. Harvard, Stanford, and University of Pennsylvania are

the top 3 undergraduate institutes (Table II).


           We also observe the team selection of each student. From 2013 to 2015, there are 150 teams

in each class year and the average team size is 6. In 2016, the average team size was changed to 5 and

there were 180 teams. To examine the effects of homophily on team formation, we construct


5
    Online Appendix Table 1.

                                                                                                    8
student-student pairs by matching each student to every other student within the same section and

year. This process creates 335,686 potential pairs. We then create a dependent variable “real_match”

which equals to 1 if the two students are members of the same team and 0 otherwise. The

independent variable “ethnic (gender, education, industry) tie” equals to 1 if two students belong to

the same ethnic (gender, education, industry) group. Our data construction method is similar to

Louch (2000). To illustrate, consider the following example: James Brown is a Section A student in

2013, and he has 5 teammates. We match Mr. Brown to all his section mates (89 of them) by

creating 89 student-student pairs. Intuitively, each pair is a potential teammate with whom Mr.

Brown could be paired. If the match happened randomly, Mr. Brown would pair with an arbitrary

teammate with a probability of 5.6%6. Variable “real_match” equals 1 for the 5 pairs for which Mr.

Brown is matched to his real teammates. To measure the effect of homophily on matching, we

compare the probability of matching conditional for a pair having the same ethnicity (Gender,

Education and Industry) to the probability of matching for a pair with different ethnicities (Gender,

Education and Industry). Our baseline results are estimated using the following regression models:


                !"#$ &#'(ℎ* = ,-- ∗ /'ℎ01(1'2 31"* + ,-5 ∗ 3"#6 718" + 9"#: ;/ + "*

                 !"#$ &#'(ℎ* = ,5- ∗ <"0=": 31"* + ,55 ∗ 3"#6 718" + 9"#: ;/ + "*

                !"#$ &#'(ℎ* = ,A- ∗ B0=?C':2 31"* + ,A5 ∗ 3"#6 718" + 9"#: ;/ + "*



      4. Empirical Results on Matching


          In this section, we examine the relative strength of homophily for ethnicity, gender,

educational background and past work experience. While homophily is an economically significant


6   5/89=5.6%

                                                                                                     9
force across all four dimensions, it is strongest in demographic characteristics, namely ethnicity and

gender. Table III Panel A presents the regression results for matching from 2014 to 2016, the years

for which students were allowed to choose their own teams. “Ethnicity Tie” increases the

probability of matching by 1.38%. Given the base rate of matching is 5.6%, this represents a 25%

increase from the baseline probability of randomly matching with a student of the same ethnicity.

Similarly, we find common gender increases the probability of matching by 1.33%. The effect of

homophily for education and past industry experience is smaller compared to homophily for gender

and ethnicity. Attending the same undergraduate institution increases the probability of matching by

0.976%, a 17% increase from the baseline, and having the same industry experience increases the

matching rate by 0.637%, an 11% increase from the baseline. Both these results are significant and

economically meaningful. Panel B reports the regression result using 2013 subsample. We do not

expect there to be any homophilic effects because teams were assigned in an attempt to promote

diversity. The coefficients on “ethnicity tie”, “school tie” and “industry tie” are negative and close

to zero. The coefficient on “gender tie” is -1.67% and statistically significant at 1% level. The

matching rate is much lower among student pairs of the same gender compared to student pairs of

different genders. This reflects HBS’s assignment scheme, which appears to match males to females

to balance the gender ratio within each team. Interestingly, other dimensions do not seem to have

been important in assigning teams.


       Our results are largely consistent with prior research on homophily. McPherson and Smith

(2001) give a comprehensive review on homophily in social networks. It is well documented that

homophily exists in both demographic characteristics and acquired characteristics. Verbrugge (1977)

provides some early evidence that homophily bias is stronger in demographic characteristics. To our

best knowledge, our study is the first attempt to estimate and compare the relative strength of

homogeneous ties in group formation.

                                                                                                   10
4.1 Ethnicity Homophily


        While common ethnicity is one of the strongest homophilic forces, its strength varies across

different ethnic groups. We attempt to look at how the relative size of the ethnic group influences

how strong the attraction is. We find homophily is strongest among international students, followed

by Asian Americans and White Americans. It is relatively weaker among African Americans and

non-existent among Hispanic Americans. As discussed below, this could be due to the high cost of

searching among small groups or as a result of strategic decision making by underrepresented

minorities.


        In Table IV, the first two columns show that homophily increases the probability of

matching by 1.08% and 1.16% among White American and Asian American MBA students

repectively. Given the base rate of matching is 5.6%, this represents a 20% increase in the matching

rate. The coefficient for African American students is 0.96%, but it is not statistically significant.

Homophily has no effect on Hispanic American MBA students. Breaking down the matching rate

by year (Online Appendix Table 2), we observe large variance among Hispanic American students.

The matching rate was 11.29% among Hispanic Americans in 2014, and it is twice as large as the

sample average (5.6%). However, the matching rate drops to 3.7% and 0% in 2015 and 2016. The

large variance in matching rates may be due to the small population size of Hispanic American

students in each class year. Given there are only 3.8 Hispanic American students in each section,

they may not be able to find a teammate with same ethnic background easily. Similarly, the average

number of African American students in each section is 5, and homophily among African American

MBA students is relatively weak. This is consistent with Currarini and Redondo (2016)’s model,

which predicts that matching is less likely to happen in small groups because the cost to do so is

high. An alternative, and not exclusive, mechanism could be strategic decision making by


                                                                                                   11
underrepresented minorities. African American students and Hispanic American students may

intentionally form teams with White American and Asian American students to compensate for the

disadvantage of being underrepresented minorities.


         Homophily is strongest among international students. An international MBA student is

3.77% more likely to find a teammate from the same region7, three times greater than the effect

among White and Asian Americans. A detailed breakdown of international students by region

(Online Appendix Table 3) shows that homophily is strongest among students from East Asia, the

Middle East, and Latin America. The coefficients on these three groups are around 6%, twice as

large as the coefficients on Europeans and South Asian students. Note that there are only 3-4

students from East Asia, Middle East and Latin America per section, the strength of homophilic ties

is considerably strong among these very small groups than it is for African American or Hispanic

students who have a similar number of students per section. The coefficient for African students

(Non-American) is negative and significant. This is because there is only approximately 1 African

student in each section in each year.


         Our matching results shed light on the interaction between the attraction of homophily and

group size effect in matching. Group size can affect the matching process by increasing the cost of

searching among minorities as in the case of African American and Hispanic American students. On

the other hand, we also observe that homophily is strongest among international students, which is

inconsistent with Currarini and Redondo (2016)’s model. Given the average group size of




7
 For other international students, we categorize their home countries by regions: Europe (7.7 students per section),
South Asia (6.1 students per section), East Asia (4 students per section), Latin America (4 students per section), Middle
East (3.3 students per section), Africa (1.6 students per section). Two exceptions are Canadians and Australians, we
counted them also as white Americans (Online Appendix Table I).

                                                                                                                        12
internationals students is small8, the cost of searching is very high, yet international students still

tend to form groups with people from the same region regardless of the search cost.


4.2 Gender Homophily


           Gender is another important homophilic factor in social network and gender homophily is

stronger among female students than it is among male students. Table V shows that gender

homophily increases the matching rate among females by 1.22%, and it is 68% higher than its effect

on male students. Not surprisingly, the coefficient on gender homophily is negative and significant

for both males and females in 2013, reflecting the group assignment scheme used by the school that

was intended to increase gender diversity in teams.


           Table VI breaks down ethnicity homophile by gender. The interaction between gender and

ethnicity yields some interesting results. On average, males are more likely to form teams with

people from the same ethnic background. The first and third column shows that “ethnicity tie”

increases the probability of match by 1.54% among males and 1.14% among females. More

specifically, white male students are 50% more likely to choose to form a team with another white

male student than white female students are to form a team with another white female student.

Among Hispanic American and international students, ethnicity homophily is also stronger among

males than females. African American female students, on the contrary, have a higher probability of

matching to another African American female student than are male students. The coefficient for

African American female students is 2.45%, while the coefficient for African American male

students is only 0.326%. Homophily almost does not exist among African American male students.




8   On average, only 4-5 of international students are from the same region in each section

                                                                                                    13
        The interaction between gender and ethnic is less well understood (Block and Grund 2014,

Wimmer and Lewis 2010), as previous studies often treat gender and ethnicity as separate

categorizes. The above results suggest the lack of diversity in entrepreneurship is not a simple

problem of one gender or one ethnicity. It is a more complex story about the interactions of gender

and ethnicity. Policies that fail to consider this interaction effects may be effective in one part of the

population but futile for the rest.




4.4 Education Homophily


        Homophily also exists among people who share similar education background. Individuals

are more likely to interact with people with same level of education (Verbrugge 1977; Louch 2000;

Marsden 1988). People form long-term friendships with their classmates (Neckerman 1996). Equity

analysts are more likely to build relationship and acquire superior information through school ties

with the management (Cohen, Frazzini and Malloy 2010).


        In Table VII, we examine the effect of education homophily on matching in the student

teams. The effect of homophily in education is relatively weaker than gender and ethnicity.

Attending the same undergraduate institution increases the probability of matching by 0.976%, while

the homophily in gender and ethnicity are 1.33% and 1.38% respectively. In column 2 and 3, we

observe the effect of homophily is much stronger among students from non-ivy league schools

which typically have a lower representation among the overall student population. While attending

the same college increases the matching probability by 1.88% among non-ivy school graduate, it only

increases the matching rate by 0.219% among ivy-school graduates, despite the fact that there are far

more Ivy graduates who attend HBS. It is important to note that the group size is much larger for


                                                                                                       14
Ivy-league graduates. 24% of students are from the eight Ivy-league schools. The remaining 76% of

students are from 85 non-Ivy league schools and each school represents less than 1% of the student

population.


       Table VIII explores the effect of school tie among male and female students. Brashears

(2008) finds that homophily in education level is uniform among males and females using the data

from 1985 general social survey. Our results point to a different story. The effect of a school tie is

much stronger among males than it is among females. A school tie increases the matching rate by

1.71% among male students while it only increases matching rate by 0.096% among female students.

Further, it is the strongest among male students from non-Ivy league schools. The difference with

Brashears (2008) could be caused by difference in the setting that we examine, as Brashears (2008)

examines education homophily in American’s core discussion groups, people with whom Americans

discuss “important matters”. Another possible reason for the inconsistency is that Brashears (2008)

uses educational level as the source for homophily, but we use educational institutions. It could be

the case that while male and female both prefer to interact with people with the same educational

level, male students cares more about the schools that others attended.


   4.5 Past Industry Experience Homophily


       Similarity in work experience can also be a source of homophily because it provides a

common basis for socialization and friendships. On the other hand, teams may desire functional

diversity as a way to improve performance, thus one might also expect that students who are seeking

broad sets of skills may form teams with diverse work history (Ruef, Aldrich and Carter 2003). Table

XV reports the results on industry matching. Our results show that at least in the context of the

microbusiness formed as a part of Field 3, functional diversity was not an organizing principal.

Industry homophily increases the probability of matching by 0.637%. Breaking down the homophily

                                                                                                   15
by industry sectors, we find homophily is strongest among people who worked in non-finance,

consulting, or technology industry, and it increases the matching rate by 2.12%. The magnitude of

the effects is similar among finance, technology, and consulting industries, which is around 0.35%.


       Table X investigates the effect of industry homophily among male and female students. Male

students are more likely to form groups with people who have the same industry experience.

Industry tie increases the probability of matching by 0.887% among males. This is primarily driven

by male students with experience in finance and technology. In contrast, industry tie only increases

the matching rate by 0.292% among females. Interestingly, homophily is stronger among females

with consulting background. It is important to note the stark contrast of homophily effect between

males and females from finance industry. Male students with finance background are 0.8% (1%

statistical significance) more likely to form teams with people from finance industry, but the industry

homophily does not exist among females with finance backgrounds.



   5. Homophily and Performance


       The results in the previous section demonstrates that when students are allowed to choose

their own teams to start a microbusiness, the propensity to pair up is increased by common personal

characteristics including ethnicity, gender, education, and work experience. The other important

aspect of our data is that the teams were assigned for the Class of 2013. We can therefore look at

the causal relationship between performance and diversity. In this section, we examine the effect of

homophily on team performance. While we look at the results for all classes, the results for the

Classes of 2014-2016 need to be viewed with caution because of the endogeneity of group diversity.


       In order to examine performance, our unit of observation is now team. There are 150-180

teams in each class year, and each team has 5-7 students. We measure team homophily across four

                                                                                                      16
different dimensions: Ethnicity, Gender, Education and Industry, and construct the homophily

measure for each dimension as the following:

                                       # GH I*JK LJIMJJN IJOP PJPLJQK M*IR IRJ KOPJ SROQOSIJQ*K*ISK
         D@6@Eℎ1$2 7(@:" * =
                                                        TGIOU VGKK*LUJ I*JK *N IRJ IJOP



         To illustrate our homophily measure, consider a team with six people: Three of them are

white, two of them are Asian Americans, and one is an international student from South America.

“Ethnicity Score” in this team will be (3+1)/(5+4+3+2+1)=4/15, as there are three ties between

three white team members9, one tie between two Asian American students and fifteen possible ties

between six team members. “Homophily score” is increasing in team homophily. It equals to zero if

everyone in the team has different characteristics and equals to one if everyone is the same type.


         Table XI provides summary statistics on team homophily by year. The average “Ethnicity

Score” from 2014 to 2016 is 0.281, implying on average, there are 3 to 4 students with the same

ethnic background in a team of 6 people. The standard deviation is also high (0.216), suggesting the

existence of highly diverse teams and highly homogenous teams. The benchmark measure is the

“ethnicity score” of the entire section. Compared to the benchmark, the “ethnicity score” is 19%

higher than the ethnicity score of the entire section from 2014 to 2016, while it is roughly equals to

the benchmark in 2013. Further, we observe the increasing incidents of teams with all White

American students. The average number of teams with all White American students is 1 in 2013, and

it increases to 4.7 after 2013 (Online Appendix Table 4).


         The average “Gender Score” from 2014 to 2016 is 0.574, implying 4 to 5 people having the

same gender in a team of 6. Comparing to the benchmark, “Gender Score” is 12.38% higher in


9 When counting the tie between white people, we count Canadians (3.41%) and Australians (1.26%) also as white
Americans. For other international students, we categorize their home countries by regions: Europe (8.8%), South Asia
(6.9%), East Asia (4.6%), Latin America (4.6%), Middle East (3.8%), Africa (1.5%). A homophilous tie is recorded if two
international students are from the same region (Online Appendix Table I).

                                                                                                                    17
2014-2016, and it is lower than the benchmark in 2013, reflecting the team assignment scheme

utilized by the MBA administration. In addition, in 2013, there are no teams with all males or all

female members. From 2014 to 2016, there are 20 teams with all male members and 8.3 teams with

all female members per year10.


           The average “School Score” is 0.018. Approximately 1 out of 4 teams will have a pair of

students from the same school. The “School Score” is 20% higher than the section benchmark from

2014 to 2016, while it is 5% lower than the benchmark in 2013. It is interesting that the benchmark

of “School Score” is much higher in 2013. This may due to higher proportion of top college

graduates (41.2%) in 2013 compared to 2014 to 2016 (37%)11. The average “Industry Score” is 0.21,

implying around 3 people have the same industry background in a team of 6. The “Industry Score”

is 8% higher than the benchmark in 2014-2016. Comparing class year of 2013 to 2014-106,

homophily increases in all four dimensions in the 2014-2016 cohorts.


           The HBS MBA Program office also provided the outcome of each team’s microbusiness and

we coded the outcome into four binary indicators: (1) “IPO Day”: whether the team presents on the

“IPO Day”. Approximately 75% of the teams were deemed good enough to present on the “IPO

Day”; (2) “Viable”: whether the team that presented on the IPO day was deemed by judges to be

viable. Roughly 50% of all projects are deemed “viable”; (3) “Section Top 3”: whether the project

was ranked in the top 3 of their section by the judges. Approximately 20% of the projects are

“section top 3”; (4) “Class Top 3”: whether the project is top 3 in the entire class year (2%).


           We construct our performance measure based upon the median of the quantile of the team’s

project outcome. If a team does not present on the “IPO Day”, the performance equals to 0.125,

i.e., 25% of teams do not present, hence the median of this quantile is 0.125. Similarly, if a team

10   See Online Appendix Table 4
11   See Table I

                                                                                                  18
presents on the “IPO Day” but the project is deemed not “viable”, the performance equals to 0.375.

The quantile in which this project performs falls between 25% and 50% of the class. Projects that

are deemed viable but are not top 3 in the section have performance equal to 0.65, as their quantile

falls between 50% and 80%. Projects that are top 3 in the section but not in the class year have

performance equal to 0.9, i.e, falling between 80% and 98%. Finally, if the project is top 3 in the

entire class year, the performance is 0.99. Our performance measure is increasing in project

outcome. The distribution of “performance” does not vary significantly by year.


       Panel C of the Table XI provides correlation table between variables. From 2014 to 2016,

years in which matching is voluntary, we observe highly positive correlation between team “ethnicity

score” and “school score”, this is driven by White Americans and Asian Americans who attend top

colleges. The correlation between “gender score” and “industry score” is also high, this may due to

high percentage of male students with finance and technology industry experience. In 2013, in which

the matching is forced by school, “school score” and “industry score” have slightly negative

correlation with “ethnicity score” and “gender score”. Interestingly, there is high correlation

between “gender score” and “ethnicity score” in 2013. Further, “ethnicity score” is highly correlated

with performance both in 2013 and in 2014-2016.


       We split the sample into 2013 teams and 2014-2016 teams and run OLS regression on each

sample. Because the team assignments in 2013 are assigned by the school, it provides a clean

identification of the effect of homophily on performance. We estimate the following regression

models:


                       W":X@:6#0("* = ,-- ∗ /'ℎ01(1'2 7(@:"* + (@0':@$ + "*
                       W":X@:6#0("* = ,5- ∗ <"0=": 7(@:"* + (@0':@$ + "*
                     W":X@:6#0("* = ,>- ∗ /=?(#'1@0 7(@:"* + (@0':@$ + "*
                      W":X@:6#0("* = ,A- ∗ B0=?C':2 7(@:"* + (@0':@$ + "*

                                                                                                  19
         Our performance measures are the median quantile of the team’s project ranking, and our

ethnicity (gender, education or industry) score is homophily measure which increases in team

homophily. Control variables include team size, percentage of students who graduated from a top

college and percentage of students who had start-up experience. Top college and start-up experience

are proxies for students’ ability and we expect these two variables to be positively correlated with

performance.


         Table XII reports the regression result of homophily on performance. Panel A column 1

shows that one unit increase in our “ethnicity score” increases team performance by 0.482 (p<1%),

or equivalently, one standard deviation increase in “ethnicity score” increases performance by

0.08412. Given the average performance of all teams is 0.5, this represents a 16.8% increase in

performance. In addition to ethnicity, homophily in education is also positively correlated with

performance. One unit increases in school score increases performance by 92.5%. In standard

deviation term, one standard deviation increase in “school score” increases team performance by

0.02713, 5.4% increases from the average performance. In column 6 of the panel A, the statistical

significance on school score drops when we control for percentage of students who graduated from

a top school and students who had start-up experience, indicating a positive correlation between

school score and students’ skill. Homophily in gender and past industry experience are positively

correlated with performance, but the coefficients are not statistically significant. As a robustness test,

we also use excess homophily score, defined as homophily score minus benchmark, as independent

variables in Online Appendix Table 6. Our results are qualitatively identical with this adjustment.

Panel B of Table XII reports the results of performance regression using 2014-2016 sample, where


12 We simulated the distribution of “ethnicity score” under the assumption of random matching. The SD of “ethnicity
score” is 0.174 (Online Appendix Table 6, Panel C). 0.174* 0.482= 0.084
13 The SD of “school score” is 0.029 (Online Appendix Table 6, Panel C). 0.029*0.925= 0.027


                                                                                                                      20
the team formation is voluntary. The coefficient on ethnicity score is still positive and significant,

but the magnitude is less than half of the 2013 result. Interestingly, the coefficients on “school

score” and “industry score” reverses sign, implying homophily in education and industry is

negatively correlated with team performance in endogenously formed teams, but the coefficients are

not statistically significant.


        In Table XIII, we investigate the cause of this performance change. We divide our

performance measure into four dummy variables: ipo_day, viable, section top 3 and class year top 3.

The results in panel A show that “ethnic score” increases the probability of presenting on IPO day

and the project being judged viable, but it does not have as significant impact on the team’s chance

of being top three in their section or class year. Thus, greater homogeneity of ethnicity can help the

worst performing teams to become average teams, but it has little effect on inducing superior

performance. In other words, it avoids the worst outcomes. One possible explanation is that

ethnically homogenous teams spend more time on projects as students receive positive utility from

working with each other.         Similarly, disagreements may be less likely in these groups as

communication may be easier. As a result, they are less likely to be at the bottom of the performance

spectrum, but they do not generate outcomes in the right hand tail of the distribution.


        While we find greater ethnic homogeneity is positively correlated with performance, we do

not conclude that diversity decreases performance or is undesirable for the following two reasons.

First, our results on ethnicity lack generalizability beyond the range of diversity we see in our sample.

Because the assignment of teams was done by the School with the intent of having relatively diverse

teams, most teams in 2013 were relatively diverse in terms of gender and ethnic composition. In

Figure 2, the graph plots team performance against “ethnicity score”. The ethnicity score for most

of teams falls below 50%, with mean equals to 23.7%. This implies that, on average, a team of 6 is


                                                                                                      21
comprised of students from 3-4 different ethnic groups14. Since there are too few extremely

homogenous teams, we are not able to draw a conclusion on the effect of ethnic diversity across the

entire spectrum of diversity. Similarly, Figure 3 shows that “gender score” for the Class of 2013

cohort concentrates between 40%-45% and has very little variation. Second, “assigned team

diversity” does not guarantee harmony, as biases may still exist within the team. In fact, research has

shown that mandatory diversity training actually reduces diversity in organizations (Dobbin and

Kalev 2016; Dobbin, Kalev and Kelly 2007).



     6. Conclusion and Discussion


         In this paper, we examine the effect of homophily on entrepreneurial team formation using a

unique dataset of MBA students. We also investigate the causal relationship between diversity and

team performance. Our findings can be summarized as the followings.


         The strength of demographic homophily (gender and ethnicity) is much stronger than

homophily based upon acquired characteristics (education and industry). Specifically, homophily in

gender and ethnicity increases the probability of matching by 25%. Homophily in education and past

industry experience increases the probability of matching by 17% and 11% respectively.


         Homophily is often stronger among smaller groups. Homophily is strongest among

international students from the same region (Tale VII), students who attend non-Ivy league schools

(Table XII) and students who worked in non-finance, consulting, or technology industries (small

industries) (Table XV). One exception is Hispanic American students. Homophily among Hispanic

American students is close to zero (Table VII).



14 For a team of 6, if 3 people are white, 1 person is Asian American, 1 person is Hispanic American and another person
is from Europe, this team will have ethnicity score = 3/15=20%

                                                                                                                    22
        The effect of homophily in education and past industry experience is different for males and

females. Males exhibit more propensity to match with people from the same school or who have

worked in the same industry, particularly in technology and finance industry (Table XVI, XIII).


        Homophily in ethnicity increases team performance by lifting teams in bottom quantiles to

median performance quantiles, probably because it reduces conflicts and enhance communication

efficiency within the group, but it does not induce superior performance in the right hand tail of the

distribution.


        Our results have important real-world implications given a significant portion of the MBA

students will be working in the start-ups and venture capital industry. First, documenting the

relative strength of the forces that cause people to associate sheds light on which factors are critical

for limiting diversity in organizations like venture capital and entrepreneurship. To the extent that

we observe the significant effect of various measures of homophily among MBA students, it is

reasonable to infer that such homophily also exists in start-up team formation, venture capital

investing, and hiring. If one goal of research is to identify the primary drivers that limit diversity,

understanding the relative contribution of various factors is critical.


        Second, in order to bring diversity into entrepreneurship, one needs to think carefully about

how subtle treatment effects may dislodge the biases that occur based upon homophily in social

networks. Results for the gender of venture capitalists’ children (Gompers and Wang, 2017) show

that when venture capitalists have more daughters, they are more likely to hire a female investor.

Other subtle treatment effects may also debias individuals towards team homogeneity in terms of

ethnicity as well. Our hope is the more research can explore the effectiveness of such subtle

treatment effects for promoting greater organizational diversity.




                                                                                                     23
        We also find that ethnic homogeneity reduces the likelihood of bad outcomes, but does not

increase the likelihood of extremely positive outcome. We caveat this result by noting that extreme

homogeneity may actually reduce overall performance given that we do not observe extremely

homogenous teams in the Class of 2013. We can, however, say that in industries like venture capital

and startups, which make all of their returns on outcome in the right hand tail of the performance

distribution, homogeneity does not appear to improve outcomes.


        Finally, in this paper, while we document that demographic homophily is stronger than

homophily in acquired characteristics, we do not attempt to trace the source of homophily. There

are different views on why homophily exists in the economics literature. One view is that homophily

is in an agent’s preference function (Jackson, 2014). Another view is that homophily is the result of

agents’ strategic decisions to reduce uncertainty (Kets and Sandroni, 2016). Presumably, homophily

that arises from these two different motivations may have different implications on the team

formation process and performance. We do not, however, distinguish the motivation behind

homophily. Additional research in this area is also warranted and important to answering these

critical questions.
