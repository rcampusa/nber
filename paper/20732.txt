                                             ABSTRACT

The paper explores the role of institutional mechanisms in generating technological knowledge spillovers.
The estimation is over panel datasets of patent grants, and unpatented innovations that were submitted
for prizes at the annual industrial fairs of the American Institute of New York, during the era of early
industrial expansion. The first section tests the hypothesis of spatial autocorrelation in patenting and
in the exhibited innovations. In keeping with the contract theory of patents, the procedure identifies
high and statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in the sample of inventions that were patented,
indicating the prevalence of geographical spillovers. By contrast, prize innovations were much less
likely to be spatially dependent. The second part of the paper investigates whether unpatented innovations
in a county were affected by patenting in contiguous or adjacent counties, and the analysis indicates
that such spatial effects were large and significant. These results are consistent with the argument
that patents enhance the diffusion of information for both patented and unpatented innovations, whereas
prizes are less effective in generating external benefits from knowledge spillovers. I hypothesize that
the difference partly owes to the design of patent institutions, which explicitly incorporate mechanisms
for systematic recording, access, and dispersion of technical information.

I. INTRODUCTION

Theories of endogenous economic growth highlight the importance of knowledge spillovers in

promoting economic progress within and across countries (Romer 1990, Grossman and Helpman

1991). New information, whether a pure public good or protected by rights of exclusion, can

create benefits for society that are in excess of the private benefits to their producer. Knowledge

spillovers have important implications for the dynamic distribution of income within and across

regions, since the ability to benefit from externalities likely plays a role in the longitudinal

tendency toward convergence and divergence in wealth and standards of living. A question of

some importance is the extent to which knowledge diffuses over time and space. Quah (2001)

argues that economic progress is a function of “weightless” innovations, which defy boundaries

of time and space: once created, these discoveries diffuse rapidly without geographical or

locational limits. In this approach, information becomes the central aspect of technological

change. On the other hand, Keller and Yeaple (2013) attest to the “gravity of weightlessness”

and find that the spatial transmission of knowledge becomes more difficult the greater is the

degree of knowledge intensity. Moreover, the acknowledgement of geographical factors as an

integral part of social and technological patterns has long been emphasized by regional scientists

(Storper 1997).

        Thus, there is still a great deal of debate about the nature and sources of the creation and

diffusion of externalities from technological discoveries. Part of this discussion relates to the

function of institutions in enhancing or inhibiting the flow of ideas and technological knowledge.

To date, a great deal of attention has been paid to the role of property rights and institutions in

agriculture, and their relation to informational spillovers. 1 However, little research has been

directed towards a comparative assessment of the effects of different technological institutions,

and how they might influence spillovers from inventive activity. From a static theoretical

perspective, social welfare might be improved by ensuring open access to ideas and inventions,

and today a number of economists support competitive “open markets” in innovation where

inducements are provided by prizes rather than exclusive property rights in patented inventions

(Boldrin and Levine 2008).2 However, if inventors of productive discoveries cannot appropriate

the returns from their efforts, or if innovation markets do not function effectively,

underinvestment in innovation might occur. The common justification for offering patent

protection proposes a bargain or a social contract by means of which inventors obtain a

temporary monopoly in their discoveries, in return for disclosing their ideas in sufficient detail

that the invention can be recreated by someone who is skilled in the arts. By contrast, alternative

methods of appropriation include the use of lead time, private methods of exclusion, and trade

secrecy. Although these mechanisms might benefit the owners of new technologies, at the same

time they could impose a social cost if the information were not available to others despite its

low incremental cost. This is especially true if the legal system provides protection against the

appropriation of trade secrets or reverse engineering. Thus, it is not clear whether unpatented

ideas would tend to promote knowledge spillovers, or to inhibit them.

         An extensive literature empirically analyzes the nature and determinants of knowledge

spillovers and the diffusion of information, using a variety of methods, data, and levels of

aggregation (Döring and Schnellenbach 2006). The consensus is that externalities in ideas are to

a large extent bounded by such factors as language and distance, which likely implies that

inventive spillovers are primarily local rather than global (Keller 2002). Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and

2
  Boldrin and Levine (“Intellectual property and the scale of the market” (2004), p. 3) also contend that intellectual
property rights tend to offer greater benefits to the wealthy, and that “it would be poor public policy indeed to allow
large monopoly distortions in order to further enrich already wealthy individuals.”

                                                           4
Henderson (1993) model a ‘knowledge production function’ and exploit the information

contained in patent citations, and their analysis shows that citations to prior patents were

clustered within metropolitan areas. Other studies confirm the localization of innovative activity,

and argue that this was due to knowledge spillovers rather than to the concentration of

production (Audretsch and Feldman 1996.) Anselin, Varga, and Acs (2000) find significant

spillovers occur between university research and high technology firms, where geographical

spillovers are measured by means of spatial lags. Moreover, earlier surveys suggest that the

extent of patent activity would tend to vary by industry (Levin et al. 1987, Cohen et al. 2000),

and this leads to the implication that both knowledge intensity and spillovers would also differ

across industries. One concludes from the welter of contemporary studies that technological

inputs and outputs are clustered, but the reasons for these patterns are still not entirely clear. It is

also not known how much of these results are specific to design of the particular research

reported in these papers, including the time period, location, or the measure of knowledge used

(R&D, patents, patent citations, scientific papers and publications.)

        An historical perspective allows us to better understand the nature and sources of

variation in externalities over time, geographical location and technological proximity. For

instance, if spillovers occured in the technologies of the first and second industrial revolutions,

then they are less likely to be a function of time and specific technologies. Over the course of

the nineteenth century there was more heterogeneity in access to markets, as well as the nature of

technological innovations. In a pioneering study, Sokoloff (1988) showed that the expansion of

transportation networks that eased access to markets promoted inventive activity in the

antebellum period, especially in rural locales. Among the great inventors in the United States,

the majority migrated across regions and countries, and tended to cluster in areas with expanding



                                                   5
markets (Khan and Sokoloff 2004). In this, and other respects, technologically and economically

important contributions exhibited similar patterns to those of less eminent inventors. Lamoreaux

and Sokoloff (2001) traced changes in the industrial and geographical location of inventive

activity and transactions in the market for patent rights that flourished during the Second

Industrial Revolution.

        As such geography has always played a role in the historical approach to technological

change, and more recent studies consider the spatial dimension of innovation, and the external

effects from technological creativity in the United States. Lo and Sutthiphisal (2010), who

analyze the geography of “crossover inventions,” downplay the role of knowledge spillovers

across industries, and instead suggest that human capital and institutional factors were more

important in generating innovations. By contrast, Moser (2011) considers chemical innovations

that were exhibited at four world fairs between 1851 and 1915. Her results are based on a

Herfindahl index approach to geographical concentration, and suggest that increases in patenting

rates were associated with a lower degree of geographical localization among innovations in the

chemical industry. After the publication of the periodic table, it was easier for firms to reverse

engineer chemically-based discoveries, and patent around them, which facilitated the diffusion of

knowledge.3

        The early industrial period in the United States amounted to an “age of patented

inventions” where inventors who devised patentable inventions were quick to secure patent

protection (Khan 2005). Unpatented innovations that were exhibited at annual fairs in

Massachusetts primarily comprised contributions that might have aided commercialization, but

were not eligible for patent protection (Khan 2011).4 The objective of the current paper is to

further our understanding of the role of institutions in innovation, by comparing the patterns of

patents, relative to those of innovations that were outside the patent system. The analysis

estimates the degree of spatial heterogeneity as a measure of knowledge spillovers. The

estimation is over a panel data set of some 11,000 observations, comprising a sample of patented

inventions, as well as unpatented innovations that were exhibited at annual industrial fairs in

New York between 1835 and 1870.

        In short, this study investigates spatial heterogeneity in prizes and patented innovations

and examines the implications of spatial factors for understanding the nature and sources of

inventive activity.5 The next section discusses patents and innovations at the fairs of the

American Institute of New York. The third section presents descriptive statistics regarding the

characteristics of the patentees, exhibitors and innovations, including the patterns of inventive

activity across industrial and sectoral categories. The fourth section discusses the empirical

strategy and tests for spatial autocorrelation. The fifth section conducts multivariate spatial

regressions, which take into account the effects of geographical proximity between regions that

conduct patenting activity and those that innovate. The final section offers a discussion of the

results and concludes.



II. PATENTS, PRIZES AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

During the past two centuries technological change has made a significant contribution to

advances in human welfare. However, it is difficult to make accurate estimates of the sources of
4
  These data do not support Boldrin and Levine’s untested assertions. Instead, I find that wealthier individuals
tended to win prizes, whereas less distinguished inventors benefited from patent protection.
5
  Spatial econometrics analyzes spatial and geographical effects linking adjacent observations (Anselin (1988). This
approach is especially useful for examining knowledge spillovers. For instance, Anselin, Varga, and Acs (1997)
employed such techniques to examine the effects of investments in research and development on the metropolitan
distribution of innovation.

                                                         7
such progress, in part because of the paucity of objective measures of inventive activity and

innovation that are comparable across time and region. To date, the most extensive empirical

studies of the economic history of technological change have relied on patents to gauge progress

in the ‘useful arts’. Nevertheless, patents have well-known problems as measures of inventive

activity (Griliches 1990). Most significantly, some inventions are not patentable, not all

inventors apply for patents, and not all patent applications are granted, the propensity to patent

differs across industries and individuals, and patented inventions vary in terms of value.

         Moser (2005) examined the exhibits at the international Crystal Palace Exhibition of

1851 as a way of assessing invention outside the patent system. She argued that only a small

fraction of these inventions were covered by patents at the time they were exhibited. This result

is interesting and important, but it is difficult to extrapolate from such data to make general

statements about the propensity to patent, or even about the relative degree of inventiveness in

any specific country. For instance, a large number of items at such exhibitions were inherently

unpatentable; they were often exhibited by the seller, not by the creator of the invention, offering

poor matches to the patent records; and, unlike patents, it is impossible to attach a date to their

creation, making meaningful estimations of propensities to patent unfeasible. 6 Brunt et al.

(2012) conducted an empirical analysis of prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society of England,

and concluded that these mechanisms proved to be effective in inducing competitive entry into

targeted areas, and in encouraging innovation. Prefectures in Meiji Japan also offered large

numbers of prizes, and Nicholas (2012) argues that these prizes not only increased patenting,

they also created large spillovers of technical knowledge. These studies are timely because
6
  International exhibitions are unlikely to be representative of the inventive capital in individual countries, since the
selection of items introduces biases that are uncorrelated with technological capability. For instance, the size and
content of the exhibition for any country were determined by distance and political expedience rather than by
random draws from the underlying population of inventions in the nation. Moreover, without a time-limited test of
novelty, exhibits comprised a stock rather than a flow measure, which increases the difficulty of comparisons across
institutions.

                                                            8
scepticism has increased of late about whether state grants of property rights in patents and

copyright protection comprise the most effective incentives for increasing creativity. Such

theoretical arguments cannot be fairly evaluated in light of the limited amount of actual evidence

regarding the functioning and consequences of prize systems.

         The present paper contributes to this ongoing debate by analyzing the record of patenting

and prizes for technological innovation in the United States from an historical perspective. I

have assembled a panel data set of innovations and inventors that competed for annual prizes in

the United States during the course of the nineteenth century. These entries were submitted for

prizes in the fairs of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association of Boston, the

Mechanics’ Institute of San Francisco, the American Institute of New York, the Ohio

Mechanics’ Institute, as well as the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.7 The samples of

approximately 17,000 innovations have been matched in the federal manuscript censuses of the

United States to obtain information on characteristics of the inventors, including wealth and

occupations. The inventions and inventors were further traced in patent records, so it is possible

to identify key features of technological innovation within and beyond the patent system, and to

gauge the extent to which patent institutions overlapped with other incentive mechanisms, and

their relative determinants and outcomes.

         The current paper presents results from a sample drawn from the exhibits at the industrial

fairs of the American Institute of New York.              The American Institute of the City of New York

was founded in 1828, with the objective of "encouraging and promoting domestic industry in this

  Previous research (Khan 2013, 2014) was based on the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Mechanics. I
estimated the factors that influenced the award of premiums for specific inventions, and compared these findings to
the determinants of patented inventions and those that were patentable. The analysis suggested that the process
through which prizes are awarded is more idiosyncratic than is true of patent institutions, which has implications for
their efficacy. Prize winners tended to belong to more privileged classes than the general population of patentees,
as gauged by the wealth and occupations of inventors at the exhibition. Moreover, the award of prizes was
unrelated to such proxies for the productivity of the innovation as inventive capital or the commercial success of the
invention.

                                                          9
State, and the United States, in Agriculture, Commerce, Manufacturing and the Arts, and any

improvements made therein, by bestowing rewards and other benefits on those who shall make

such improvements, or excel in any of the said branches."8 The organization also represented the

interests of inventors in political arenas, lobbying for tariff protection, patent reforms, and related

policies of interest. Between 1828 and 1897 the Institute offered inducements for manufacturing

enterprise in the form of annual fairs which initially attracted entrants from New York and the

surrounding Mid-Atlantic region, but soon exhibits originated also from more distant states.9

Exhibits were judged by special committees, who awarded premiums in the form of cash,

certificates, and medals. Recipients could opt for the cash value of an award, but these gold and

silver medals were greatly valued by their winners as a means of promoting and commercializing

their innovations. As such, participants had an inducement to engage in expenditures in excess

of the expected reward.

         Industrial fairs may have had the stated objective of promoting inventive activity and

innovation, but their organizers were well aware of the potential trade-offs that existed with their

joint objective of attracting attendance and participation by firms. Exhibitions that were popular

among the general public would prove to be profitable for the Institute and, similarly, exhibitors

would make the investments to attend, the greater the likelihood of receiving accolades for their

products, and the more numerous the viewers of their displays. At the annual fair of 1850, 2587

  The Institute itself was still in operation until the 1980s. The four standing committees that considered innovations
included the Committee on Manufactures, Arts and Sciences, the Committee on Commerce, and the Committee on
Agriculture. The classes of exhibits at the annual fairs comprised fine arts and education, dwellings, dress and
handicraft, chemistry and mineralogy, engines and machinery, intercommunication, and agriculture and horticulture.
Highly successful during much of the nineteenth century, the Institute’s 1897 Annual Report conceded that "the era
of the fair as an advertising medium, as well as a popular resort, must be recorded as an amusement and business
venture of the past." It is probably not coincidental that the decline of industrial fairs and competition for prizes
coincided with the advent of the age of professional advertising for mass markets. Subsequent fairs were primarily
organized to showcase floral and agricultural exhibits.

items were exhibited, largely in the category of manufacturing, and the organizers distributed

some $3,000 worth of medals, cups, prize books and cash as awards. The Finance Committee

reported earnings of $18,770 with $11,345 in expenditures. During the fair, a number of learned

addresses were given, including a lecture on the patent laws which was delivered by George

Gifford, a patent lawyer who had represented the Singer Sewing Machine Company. Two

decades later, the exhibition of 1870 included 1670 articles on display and the available space

spread over 100,000 square feet. Among the invited speakers were Horace Greeley (President of

the Institute at that time) and Benjamin Silliman, the celebrated Yale chemist. Approximately

600,000 visitors attended the fair, generating revenues of approximately $72,000, along with

expenditures of $51,000. Some 140 judges deliberated before awarding $1213 in premiums,

although they decided that none of the exhibits in that year was worthy of the celebrated Grand

Medal of Honor.10

         The Reports of the Institute included an account of all the exhibits that were entered in

competition for prizes in that year. They offered information that mentioned the name of the

exhibitor (often the agent of a manufacturing or commercial enterprise), the city and state of

residence, a description of the invention, and the type of prize allocated if the invention was

indeed granted an award. In some instances, the names of the committee of judges were

reported. Some of the committees mentioned the reasons for their decisions, such as the degree

of novelty in the exhibit (a patentable characteristic), or their admiration of the attractiveness and

superior workmanship associated with the item (unpatentable characteristics).11 These records


10
   These details are taken from the Annual Reports of the American Institute for the relevant years.
11
   At the Crystal Palace Exhibition and other such events, the criteria for awards were similarly quite variable.
Three types of awards were given: Council medals, prize medals, and honourable mentions. The Council medals
rewarded novelty, but were also given for other reasons, such as beauty and cheapness of the good. The criteria for
the other prize medals and honourable mentions did not include novelty. See REPORTS BY THE JURIES, supra note 79,
at xxiv. Instead, juries were instructed to give prizes for criteria that had little or nothing to do with technological
inventiveness or patentability, such as beauty of design and appearance, “[a]daptability to use, economy in first cost,

                                                          11
on the exhibits were matched to patent documents, and to the manuscript censuses to acquire

further data on the invention and inventor.12

         Thus, at the 1852 exhibition, Gardner Chilson (1804-1877) of Boston, Massachusetts

displayed a portable hot air furnace. The patent records reveal that Chilson was a multiple

patentee in the United States, England and France, who had received a patent for a portable hot

air furnace two years previously. Like many patentees, he was a migrant, who had been born in

Connecticut, and worked as an apprentice in pattern and cabinet making in Sterling, CT. Chilson

later moved to Providence, and in 1837 made his permanent home in Boston. In 1850 his

occupation was listed as a trader, and he did not report any wealth. However, his foundry in

Mansfield, MA which produced the items he invented as well as those of other patentees, was so

successful that he bequeathed an estate that was valued in excess of $300,000.



III. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR THE SAMPLE

The objective of the paper is to compare the patterns from federal patents to the items that

received technological prizes, as a gauge of innovations outside the patent system. The panel

data set comprises two random samples that were drawn from patent data (6500 observations),

and innovations that were collected from the annual exhibitions at the American Institute of New

York (5700 observations). Patent rights are filtered through an examination process that screens

for novelty, whereas access for exhibitors was for the most part unrestricted, although the fairs

excluded itinerant peddlers and hawkers from the standing exhibits. Although a few of the great

inventors such as Cyrus McCormick, Richard Gatling and Charles Goodyear displayed their


durability, economy of maintenance, excellency [sic] of workmanship, strength.” See 1 REPORTS OF THE
COMMISSIONERS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION HELD AT VIENNA 39 (Robert H.
Thurston ed., 1876) (discussing the Crystal Palace).
12
   Since many of the exhibitors at any industrial fair (whether local or international) were firms and commercializers,
such matches cannot be viewed as an accurate estimate of the percentage of displayed items that were patented.

                                                          12
inventions at the fairs, the majority of the exhibitors comprised less eminent inventors. It is

interesting to note that, whereas some observers have suggested that the patent system was (and

is) biased against women inventors because few have obtained patent protection, inventions by

women were even scarcer at this series of exhibitions. Women did feature prominently in areas

such as sewing and paintings, but only 31 appear in the roster of innovations. Thus, the

evidence suggests that reasons for their relatively low formal inventive creativity owed to factors

beyond the nature of technological institutions.

       Industries differ in terms of their technological inputs and intensity, and their capacity for

effective trade secrecy or for generating spillovers also vary. For instance, in the absence of

distinct measures for transmitting information, manufacturing machinery and processes are less

likely to diffuse than innovations in transportation or pharmaceuticals. Table 1 shows that

exhibits primarily comprised manufactured final products such as guns, watches and rubber

goods. The second column denotes whether the exhibit fell under the subject matter that was

patentable (note that this is a very minimal criterion, since patentability further required

substantive novelty, which cannot be determined from any exhibition data.) The exhibits varied

significantly in terms of their patentable subject matter, ranging from over ninety percent of heat

and power innovations, to below a quarter in the furniture industry.

       Discussions of such exhibits often speculate about the propensity to patent. However,

this concept is subject to significant error, since over 35 percent of the exhibits belonged to firms

which (according to U.S. patent law) cannot obtain patents in their own name, and other items

were likewise submitted by individuals who were not the original inventors. Hence, it is

impossible to systematically trace whether all exhibitors have patents on the innovations they




                                                   13
displayed.13 Moreover, many of the names of the exhibitors at all such events include only

initials and surname, making it difficult to assign a match. Unless this is taken into account and

the denominator is adjusted, the calculations of the propensity to patent will be biased

downwards. Of the total 3100 innovations that were credited to individuals, 524 were traced in

the patent records, suggesting that a lower bound of 16 percent of exhibits were patented. Since

1521 of exhibits were patentable, about a third of innovations that fell within the patentable

subject matter were actually patented. However, it is impossible to determine novelty, which

comprises the primary qualification of the patent grant, so this determination does not necessarily

imply that the owners of unpatented innovations were rejecting patents in favour of alternative

mechanisms such as secrecy.

        Table 1 also includes the distribution of medals by industrial category. If medals were

awarded based on technological contributions, we would expect that the proportions would vary

by industry. But, similar to the findings for the other regional and international exhibitions,

medals seem to have been allotted on a fixed ratio, with a quota allocated to each type of

industrial class, rather than on the basis of overall productivity. It is noticeable that the most

evident deviation from this finding is in the category for the arts, such as musical instruments

and the printing of elaborate blank books. This is consistent with the exhibition reports, which

frequently praised items for their visual attractiveness or workmanship, and to a lesser extent for

such criteria as novelty or technological improvements that lead to patents being granted.

        Table 2 describes the characteristics of the data in terms of their industrial and

geographical distributions. The exhibits and patents are fairly similar in sectoral coverage, apart

from the lower percentage of agricultural innovations being shown at the fairs of the Institute.

Specific types of technologies, such as engines and manufacturing machinery, featured in the

patent records as well as at the exhibitions. However, in keeping with the likely objective of the

exhibition, more manufacturing firms and their products are included in these data, than among

the patents sampled. Thus, patents were more representative of the entire population of new

technologies, whereas the exhibitions showcased the population of innovations or

commercialized items, and an examination of the records of the exhibits suggests that they

incorporated lower inventive inputs on average.14

           As one might expect, the patent data are more broadly distributed across regions. The

annual exhibitions of the American Institute were located in New York and, although innovators

from surrounding regions were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to display their

products, the representation of the majority of exhibitors does not extend beyond the Mid-

Atlantic and New England. The New York exhibits fail to track the increasing importance of the

Midwest and West in technological innovation. However, in this early period the limited

regional coverage is not significant for our purposes. First, the Mid-Atlantic and New England

regions were the locus of the majority of patents filed in this early period, accounting for two-

thirds of all patents. Second, the effective geographic range of knowledge spillovers would

likely be fairly restricted before the 1880s, due to the substantial information costs and other

transactions costs that prevailed before the spread of low-cost, high-speed transportation and

communications. Moreover, the emphasis here is on the relative performance of patent

institutions and prize systems.

           Patents and prize-winning innovations differed in many regards, including in terms of the

role of geography and location. The regressions in Table 3 estimate likely determinants of

inventive activity and innovation among exhibits. Similar analyses of patents in New York and
14
     In the rest of this paper, the terms exhibits, prizes and innovations are used interchangeably.

the other regions in the United States can explain two thirds of the variation in patenting rates,

suggesting that inventive activity that is protected by intellectual property rights is somewhat

systematic. By way of contrast, the results here replicate those for the Massachusetts

exhibitions, which indicate that the noise to signal ratio is high, since the award of medals

consists of largely unexplained variation. The grant of gold medals is almost totally random, so

the regressions instead attempt to determine the factors that influence both gold and silver

awards. Firms were more likely to win the better class of medals, especially if they filed exhibits

that fell under patentable subject matter. However, inventors who had larger numbers of patents

did not glean any special advantage for their exhibits, even if their invention was valued in the

marketplace and assigned to another buyer. The second regression adds location and spatial

factors in the form of dummy variables for cities and estimates of longitude and latitude, but

these add virtually nothing to the explanatory power of the estimated model. Similarly,

machinists and engineers, who typically possessed the highest amount of specialized knowledge

and inventive human capital, did not achieve any advantage in the market for prizes.

       Thus, this preliminary discussion leads to the hypothesis that prize exhibits did not reflect

the sort of technological creativity that could expand productive frontiers through spillovers. It

is possible that this is due to the prevalence of final goods that tended to enhance taste and

consumption possibilities, rather than the promotion of inventive activity. The preliminary

regressions in Table 3 suggest the need for further analysis to determine whether patents and

prizes differed in other dimensions. If prizes were less systematic, and had a lower likelihood of

being associated with location and geography, then such awards would fail the necessary

precondition for the prevalence of geographical and technological spillovers. The next section




                                                 16
therefore specifically addresses this issue, and tests for spatial heterogeneity in patents and

exhibits.



IV. EMPIRICAL SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS



The empirical analysis is directed towards determining whether patents and unpatented

innovations differed in their spatial dependence. The first question to determine is the relevant

unit of analysis. Many spatial studies of the modern period examine geographical links at a

fairly high level of aggregation, including countries and states. However, we might expect that

spillovers, productivity and output in the nineteenth century would effectively be a function of

more disaggregated units, so the data here are assessed at the county level.15 Second, it is

necessary to identify the specific connotation of “spatial proximity.” We employ two different

measures of geographic adjacency. It is generally agreed that influence is inversely related to

distance, and we measure distance from other counties using specific locations described in

degrees of latitudes and longitudes. This distance instrument does not incorporate transactions

costs, nor does it include such barriers as inhospitable topography or facilitating factors such as

major transportation networks. The second distance variable uses a contiguous counties

approach that calculates the effects of patenting or innovations in counties that share a common

border (“queen contiguity”) with the county in question. According to the gravity model of

technological knowledge, mechanisms that generate spillovers depend on spatial proximity,

which is precisely defined in terms of a spatial matrix with dimensions (N x N), where N=1788

counties.


15
   In other work, the analysis has been extended to include exhibitions in other states, and explores how sensitive the results are
to other alternative definitions of distance.

                                                                 17
            Spatial autocorrelation exists when the values of a variable comprise a function of its

location and spatial characteristics that are defined in terms of a specific measure of distance. If

spatial autocorrelation is high, this is a result that is interesting in itself; but it also has

implications for the validity of conventional procedures, since the usual method of merely adding

fixed effects for regions or states leads to unobserved heterogeneity that will likely lead to biased

results. Moran’s I statistic allows us to test for the existence of global spatial autocorrelation

(Moran 1950).16 The null hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation implies that the variable in

question is a spatially independent and identically distributed draw from a standard normal

distribution.

Moran’s I statistic can be computed as


                                               n

                                                                      (x           x)

                                                                      i

                                        x= variable of interest
                                        x = the mean of x

                                        S0    w          ij
                                                i   j




The analysis here employs a weight matrix that is based on distance, where the distance between

county i and county j is measured from centered values of longitude and latitudes. Any off-

diagonal entry in the matrix represents the inverse of the distance between point i and point j.

Moran’s I ranges from -1 to 1, and has an expected value of -1/(n-1), which tends to zero as n

increases. Thus, a value that exceeds zero indicates positive spatial autocorrelation (similar

                                                                          18
values are closely located), and a value than is less than zero implies negative autocorrelation

(dissimilar values are closely located). The Z statistic normalizes the value and provides a

standard t-test for statistical significance.

        Table 4 presents the results of testing the hypothesis of spatial correlation among the

patents per capita at the county level. The results for total patents are highly significant, with a Z

statistic of 14.3, implying that we can reject the null hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation in

inventions that were patented. Per capita patenting over this period was affected by strong

spatial localization, implying the existence of geographical spillover effects. In particular, New

England and the entrants into technological markets in the West and Midwest experienced high

benefits from contiguous counties that were innovators. This may be due to the smaller

geographical area of the New England region, and to the abundance of modes of transportation

over water and land, that prevailed even in the early years of settlement of these counties. It is

noticeable that in the postbellum period the degree of spatial autocorrelation falls somewhat in

other areas (even becoming indistinguishable from zero in the Mid-Atlantic), but experiences a

moderate increase in the frontier regions. As followers or late-comers, the frontier areas were

likely beneficiaries from the investments that the Northeast had made in technological inputs.

        The evidence in Table 5 relates to the data from the American Institute exhibitions for the

innovations that were unpatented, and here the conclusions are more mixed. The Z coefficient

for the overall sample of the exhibitions data is only marginally significant. There is significant

variation in the different regions in the existence of spatial dependence. The region of interest

here is New York, which was the place of residences for most of the innovators. However, it is

striking that in each level of the table we cannot reject the null hypothesis for New York.

Unpatented innovations in New York were not spatially autocorrelated, which implies that such



                                                  19
innovations did not generate much in the way of geographical spillovers. The Moran value is

statistically significant in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, but it is possible that these effects

were due not to innovations but to unobserved heterogeneity such as the high patenting rates that

prevailed in these areas.




V. ESTIMATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL SPILLOVERS




The spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that patents were significantly influenced by the

inventive activity in adjacent counties. This is consistent with the bargain or contract view of

patents, which proposes that the limited grant of a monopoly right to inventors benefits society,

because in exchange the public gains information about the discovery that increases social

welfare. The patent grant requires a specification that is sufficiently detailed to enable a person

who is skilled in the arts to recreate the patented invention. From the earliest years of the patent

system, policy makers engaged in discussions about how to ensure that information was

available to the broader public. Patent legislation included measures to publish information

about patents that were granted in annual reports that were widely disseminated, and expired

patents were published in newspapers. The U.S. Patent Office maintained local depositories and

offices throughout the country. Thus, even if the patentee had acquired a monopoly for (at that

time) fourteen to seventeen years, access to the information about the discovery likely facilitated

inventions that worked around the initial patent, or led to ideas for follow-on inventions.


       Thus, the evidence here supports the notion that trade secrecy or even open access to

ideas did not generate as much diffusion as in the case of inventions that were protected by


                                                 20
patent grants. Exhibits at the American Institute might have been open to the public, and some

inventors might have been able to copy from the displays, but there was likely a selection effect

that influenced the owners of inventions that were readily duplicable not to display them at fairs.

Moreover, even if inventors had access to knowledge about innovations from attending the fairs,

there were few or no mechanisms that might have led to the spread of information beyond

physical attendance. This was of course a function of the decentralized nature of the prize

system in the United States, but even in European countries that offered centralized institutions

such as the Royal Society of Arts, access to unpatented inventions and knowledge about them

was quite limited.


       Unpatented innovations may not have led to significant spillovers, but another question is

the extent to which patents were associated with rates of innovation and commercialization. We

will now address this question by estimating the impact of geographical clustering of patents in

counties adjacent to the county of residence for the innovator or owner of the exhibit. The

analysis takes advantage of spatial econometric techniques developed by Anselin (1988) to

model spatial lags. The estimation is over per capita innovations at the county level.


In particular, we estimate the following equation:


                      Per Capita Innovations (P) = ρWΛ +Xβ + ε


                      Where ρ is a spatial lag parameter
                      W is a weights matrix, which designates counties as neigbours if they are
                      contiguous
                      Λ is a vector of per capita patents
                      X is a matrix of other exogenous variables
                      ε is vector of error terms




                                                21
The dependent variable is the log of per capita innovations at the county level. The first term on

the right hand side comprises the product of the weights matrix and the vector Λ of per capita

patents at the county level. It therefore represents the spatial lag of patents for the innovations in

a county, or a weighted measure of patents in all of the counties adjoining a given county (queen

contiguity). We report the OLS regressions here, but similar results were obtained using

negative binomial specifications of the innovations expressed as count data. In this paper we

control just for geographical proximity, but later work will include the technological and

industrial composition of the counties as additional determinants of potential spillovers (Jaffe,

Tratjenberg and Henderson 1993).

       The results of these spatial regressions are reported in Table 6. As in my studies of other

U.S. exhibitions and European data, the previous section reported that exhibits of the New York

Institute were more heterogeneous than patents, and the award of prizes was quite random and

unsystematic, so regressions had low explanatory power. The inclusion of spatial effects here

increases our ability to explain variation in such innovations, and in all specifications the spatial

lag parameter is statistically significant. In general, a one percent increase in patenting activity

in neighbouring counties would tend to increase the amount of innovations per capita in a county

by as much as 0.29 percent. One might speculate that such an impact owed to the possible

influence of manufacturing, available capital funding, or to urban amenities. However, inclusion

of proxies for these variables (manufacturing labour force and urbanization) does not materially

alter the effect of contiguous inventions. Other locational factors such as regions are only

marginally significant. Following other authors, the analysis also tests the impact of location in

terms of latitude and longitude on the dependent variable. It is interesting to observe that

distance has an effect through latitude, but not in terms of longitude. One potential reason might



                                                  22
be the effect of the Erie Canal, and it would be possible to test this hypothesis in future work,

with dummy variables for the counties that adjoined the canal.




VI. CONCLUSION


In recent decades, economists have begun to pay more attention to the role of geography and

distance in enhancing and inhibiting technological change. There is a plethora of evidence to

attest to the existence of significant spatial externalities, at least for the modern period. Yet,

according to Audretsch and Feldman (1996), “The literature identifying mechanisms actually

transmitting knowledge spillovers is sparse and remains underdeveloped,” a statement which

remains true today. By comparing patents and unpatented innovations which were entered in

competition for prizes, we can gain some insight into the institutional mechanisms that influence

technological externalities. Today, many economists have become disenchanted with patents as

a policy to promote technological and economic progress, and have lobbied for prizes as a

substitute. Their focus is on the deadweight loss that monopolies engender, which is absent in

the case of prizes. However, this literature has largely ignored other facets of the trade-off

between patents and prizes, including the role of inventive spillovers.

       The analysis of technological spillovers in this paper was based on spatial econometric

measures that are commonly used in economic geography to measure externalities that are a

function of distance and spatial distribution. The first section tested the hypothesis of spatial

autocorrelation in patenting and in the innovations that were exhibited at the annual fairs of the

American Institute of New York. In keeping with the contract theory of patents, the procedure

identified high and statistically significant spatial autocorrelation, indicating the prevalence of

geographical spillovers in the sample of inventions that were patented. At the same time, prize

                                                  23
innovations were much less likely to be spatially dependent, especially in the key area of New

York. These results are consistent with the argument that inventions that garner prizes and

commercial innovations are less effective in generating external benefits from knowledge

spillovers.

       The second part of the paper was directed toward the estimation of a spatial lag

coefficient, in order to determine whether per capita innovations/prizes in a county were affected

by patenting in contiguous or adjacent counties. The regressions showed that such spatial effects

were large and significant. In short, the results from the spatial econometric analysis of this

paper suggest that patents provided significant positive externalities, not just for other inventors,

but also for innovators or commercializers. By way of contrast, prizes may have offered private

benefits to the competitors involved, but were less likely to create externalities that enhance

social welfare.

       In future work, I plan to consider the effects of technological proximity, which might be

expected to influence clustering of inventions. Another question that is more difficult to answer

is the extent to which technological and geographical spillovers are driven by the quality of an

invention. In the modern period, patent citations are available as a measure of quality, and

numerous studies have shown that spillovers are association with cited patents (Jaffe,

Tratjenberg and Henderson 1993). However, patent citations were not included in nineteenth

century records, so one has to be somewhat more innovative in constructing proxies for quality.

The first approach is to proxy high-valued inventions by those that are filed by great inventors,

following Khan and Sokoloff (2004) who argue that the portfolio of patents by great inventors

are of greater average economic and technical value, than those of ordinary inventors. The




                                                 24
second method of measuring the role of important inventions is to consider those innovations

that were granted gold or silver medals at exhibitions.

        In sum, the results in this study of patents and prizes are consistent with an extensive

examination of the record for various locations in the United States, France and Britain.

Together, they suggest that a great benefit of patent systems comprised their market-orientation,

whereby values were determined through external prices and that, even in the absence of

corruption or personal bias, administrative attempts to replicate the role of the market confronted

significant obstacles.17 Further, the evidence from the spatial analysis are consistent with the

argument that patents enhanced the diffusion of information for both patented and unpatented

innovations, whereas prizes were less effective in generating external benefits from knowledge

spillovers. We may hypothesize that the difference partly owes to the design of patent

institutions, which explicitly incorporate mechanisms for systematic recording, access, and

dispersion of technical information. The Founders of American industrial institutions may

therefore have been prescient in their decisions regarding the appropriate role of patents and

prizes in promoting the progress of science and useful arts during early industrialization.




17
   Judges had to combine technical competence and industry-specific knowledge with impartiality; decision-making
among panels was complicated by differences in standards, interpretation, sometimes language barriers. The
necessary tests of the items displayed was complicated by lack of comparability, poor information on marketability
and price, and variations in taste. The most novel items were associated with the greatest risk, and therefore less
likely to be selected. Such difficulties tended to lead to haphazard decisions, or were often overcome by simply
making the award to the person or firm with the most established reputation, or those who had spent the most to
secure the prize.
