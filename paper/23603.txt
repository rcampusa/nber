                                          ABSTRACT

While many results from the treatment-effect and related literatures are familiar and have been
applied productively in health economics evaluations, other potentially useful results from those
literatures have had little influence on health economics practice. With the intent of
demonstrating the value and use of some such results in health economics applications, this paper
focuses on one particular class of parameters that describe probabilities that one outcome is larger
or smaller than other outcomes, namely inequality probabilities. While the properties of such
parameters have been explored in the technical literature, they have scarcely been considered in
informing practical questions in health evaluations. This paper discusses how such probabilities
can be used informatively, and describes how they might be identified or bounded given standard
sampling assumptions and information only on marginal distributions of outcomes. Graphical and
algebraic exposition reveals the logic supporting these results, as well as their empirical
implementation, to be quite straightforward. Applications to health outcome evaluations are
presented and discussed throughout.

1. Introduction
Nivolumab Treatment for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
         Nivolumab—a biological product marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in the U.S.
as Opdivo—has several FDA-approved indications, one being previously treated advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For treatment of NSCLC, two primary outcomes pre-
specified   1   in a pivotal, phase-III randomized trial of nivolumab versus docetaxel
(chemotherapy) were overall survival time and one-year overall survival rate. In summarizing
that study Borghaei et al., 2015, report:
         Overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel…
         At the time of the interim analysis (minimum followup for overall survival, 13.2
         months), the median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% confidence interval
         [CI], 9.7 to 15.0) with nivolumab and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7) with
         docetaxel, representing a 27% lower risk of death with nivolumab (hazard ratio,
         0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P = 0.002). The overall survival rate at 1 year was
         51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) with nivolumab and 39% (95% CI, 33 to 45) with
         docetaxel.

Figure 1 depicts the data from which these results are computed.2 The two reported estimates
of overall survival are shown: a difference in median survival time of 2.8 months in panel (a);
and a difference in twelve-month survival probability of .12 in panel (b).
         A BMS direct-to-consumer advertising campaign prominent in the U.S. in 2017 has
boasted that Opdivo treatment for NSCLC offers "a chance to live longer."3


A Chance to Live Longer?
         What might the Borghaei et al. results say about the "chance to live longer" pitched in
the Opdivo ads? In claiming "a chance to live longer" at least two questions arise logically. The
first is: "a chance to live longer," compared to what? The second is: "a chance to live longer,"


1   ClinicalTrials.gov study NCT01673867.
2The smoothed empirical distribution functions depicted in figure 1 are approximated from
the data depicted in figure 1A in Borghaei et al., 2015, as survival curves.
3http://www.opdivo.com/advanced-nsclc, accessed April 30 2017. BMS applied on January
31, 2017, for a U.S. trademark for "A CHANCE TO LIVE LONGER" (U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, Serial No. 87319390). At the time this draft was completed, the status of that
application was "Under Examination."
measured how? In light of the Borghaei et al. results, "compared to what" might be answered
reasonably as "treatment with docetaxel" or "treatment with other relevant comparators."
       Of greater interest in this paper, however, are questions in line with the second one:
measured how? Given the outcomes studied in Borghaei et al., one reasonable measure of "a
chance to live longer" might be a difference in median survival times between the two
treatments: subjects had a 50 percent chance to live longer than 12.2 months with nivolumab
treatment compared with a 50 percent chance to live longer than 9.4 months with docetaxel.
Alternatively, "a chance to live longer" might reasonably be characterized in terms of twelve-
month survival probabilities: patients treated with nivolumab showed a twelve-percent
greater chance to live at least twelve months longer than did patients treated with docetaxel.4
       Letting t niv and t doc denote a patient's survival time with nivolumab or docetaxel
               !         !
treatment, then "living longer" amounts essentially to t niv > t doc . While the 2.8-month
                                                       !
difference in median survival times or the .12 difference in twelve-month survival times hints
at a relationship like this, the notion of "a chance to live longer" is something different. "A
chance to live longer" might reasonably be translated as the probability a patient treated with
nivolumab lives longer—not some particular amount longer,5 just longer by some unspecified

                                                                         (           )
amount—than had they otherwise been treated with docetaxel, i.e. Pr t niv > t doc .6 If a patient
                                                                 !
asks: "If I'm treated with nivolumab, what is the chance that I'll live longer than if I'm treated

                                                                     (          )
with docetaxel?", then one number that answers this question is Pr t niv > t doc .
                                                                !

4Either of these characterizations is of the sort that might be advanced as the basis of FDA
marketing-approval applications or of other more general efficacy or effectiveness claims.
5 Cost-effectiveness questions would often balance "how many weeks longer" against cost
across comparators. If such outcome and cost measures are converted into univariate net-
benefit (NB) measures then the choice between comparators amounts to knowing whether or
not NBj > NBk .
    !
6 DTC advertising for Keytruda (pembrolizumab; Merck), whose indications for NSCLC are

similar to Opdivo's, uses the catchphrase "a chance for a longer life."
(https://www.keytruda.com/non-small-cell-lung-cancer/, accessed April 30, 2017). Entresto
(sacubitril/valsartan; Novartis), a treatment for chronic heart failure, is promoted in DTC ads
to "help increase your chances of more tomorrows" (http://www.entresto.com/info/about-
entresto.jsp, accessed April 30, 2017).

        Inequality probabilities like this are the main focus of this paper. In comparing two
outcomes in a population exhibiting outcome heterogeneity, questions about the chance or
probability that one outcome exceeds the other may be natural to pose. How one might
analyze such questions is the main purpose of this paper.


Why Might Inequality Probabilities Be of Interest?
        Let y0 and y1 be two outcomes of interest (e.g. y0 = t doc and y1 = t niv ). The inequality

                 (           )
probability7 Pr y1 > y0 provides an intuitive characterization of the extent to which one
             !
outcome is stochastically larger than another. This can be appreciated from its definition,

wherein f y0 ,y1 is the joint probability density of y0 and y1 . Pr y1 > y0 is sometimes

are relevant indicators in voting (e.g. median voter, majority rule, etc.), strict-Pareto, and
other social choice contexts (e.g. Coate, 2000, Gerber and Lewis, 2004, Jacob and Lundin,
2005, and Pauly, 1989; also see Heckman et al., 1997, for general perspectives).
        Inequality probabilities also play a central role in stochastic settings where the benefit
associated with a choice depends on the ordering among but not the magnitudes of competing
outcomes, for instance a payoff (V) from choosing the winner in an M-participant competition
(e.g. a horserace, a basketball game, or an exclusive therapeutic-category formulary listing). In

such cases y j might measure speed, score, therapeutic cost-effectiveness, etc. In such a
           !
competition the realized benefit from selecting competitor j is

                             (
        B ! = !V × ∏ k≠j1 y j > y k ,
        ! j

by reference to a particular decision criterion might it be determined which such parameters
should be of interest.


Summary Outcome Measures Used in Evaluations
         Asking different questions about relationships between two outcomes leads logically to
different ways to characterize and summarize statistically such outcomes in heterogeneous
populations. In essence the previous discussion posed questions about whether one outcome
(say y1 ) is larger than another (say y0 ), and focused on a particular metric of comparison,
     !                                !

     (       )
Pr y1 > y0 . Whether the outcomes of interest are survival times or perhaps other outcome-
!

8When the y j are random utilities associated with different choice prospects, quantities like
           !
the probability in (3) are familiar from the multinomial discrete-choice literature.
9 Presumably this quantity is of interest since it is one of the study's primary endpoints; see
ClinicalTrials.gov study NCT01673867 and U.S. FDA, 2015. Why a particular value of t' is
privileged merits consideration. Whether for parsimony, for convenience, due to biostatistical
or regulatory convention, or for other reasons is often not obvious. While such choice should
ideally square with decisionmakers' loss functions, it is rarely made explicit that it does; see
Manski, 1998, 2007.

  If it converges the integral of Pr t niv ≥ t' − Pr t doc ≥ t' over t'—characterizing second-order

decisionmaking criteria in stochastic environments14; and point versus interval identification
of treatment effects.15 These broader literatures are not surveyed here although references to
specific work are made when useful. The work most closely related to this paper includes that
of Heckman and coauthors16, a series of studies by Fan and coauthors17, as well as studies by
Adams, 201318, Basu and Thariani, 2016, Firpo and Ridder, 2008, Lee, 2000, and Manski,

questions were discussed in a much earlier working paper by the author (Mullahy, 2005).


Motivation and Plan
         The paper is motivated mainly by the observation that there are important and
potentially useful results on inequality probabilities of the sort examined here that—while
established in the technical literature—have thusfar had little impact on health economics
research.19 In particular, this paper attempts to exposit (relying often on simple graphical
depictions) the elementary features of such results and then extend and apply them to
contexts of interest in health economics.
         Until section 4 the paper's results are largely not new; indeed, the paper's main results
on inequality probabilities presented in section 3 are just tailored applications of Fréchet-

Boole probability bounds.20 Yet their discussion in technical literatures distant from health
economics may have hindered their application in health economics and elsewhere.
Describing, extending, and implementing these results in health economics contexts are the
goals of this paper; at a minimum it is hoped that the paper provides a useful practitioner's
guide.
         The plan is as follows. Section 2 describes the main assumptions and notation. Section
3 presents the results on probability bounds. Section 4 extends the main results in several
directions and offers examples. Section 5 considers the application of the main results to cost-
effectiveness analysis. Section 6 discusses bounds when more than two outcomes are of
interest. Section 7 considers empirical implementation: sampling, estimation, and inference.
Section 8 summarizes.


2. Definitions, Assumptions, and Notation
         The setup here is familiar in the treatment-effect literature. M+1 outcomes of interest,

( y0 ,y1 ,…) ,
!
                 are jointly distributed in the population according to F y0 ,y1 ,…
                                                                        !
                                                                                           (           )   with

                                                            (      )           (
corresponding joint probability density denoted f y0 ,y1 ,… . 21 F y0 ,y1 ,… might be
                                                !                !
                                                                                                   )
interpreted as representing a population heterogeneous in outcomes or as a joint distribution
of random variables.22

                                                                           (           )
         For now assume that there are two outcomes of interest, y0 ,y1 , although more-
                                                                !
                                                                       (           )
general cases are considered in section 5. Unless noted otherwise y0 ,y1 are assumed to be
                                                                 !
continuously distributed. To be consistent with the technical definition of distribution



20The main results here involve set or interval identification, or probability bounds, of the
sort studied and advocated forcefully by Manski. While there may be increasing receptivity by
analysts of set identification, point identification is still the standard in many contexts (e.g.
FDA regulation).

3. Main Results: Bounds on Inequality Probabilities
Revisiting the Nivolumab vs. Docetaxel Example
              To motivate the general results discussed below, consider again the nivolumab vs.

23For discrete outcomes the difference between weak and strict inequality will matter; see
below.
24Subject-indexing subscripts are suppressed unless useful for clarity. Note that the 0 and 1
subscripts are reversed from what is typical in the literature. Economists often consider such
contrasts in a Rubin counterfactual framework, but they are also relevant in other contexts
where information about the jointness properties of F y0 ,y1 is absent.

The lower bound, π1 − π0 ,                            is Pr (( t doc ,t niv ) ∈II) − Pr (( t doc ,t niv ) ∈IV ) ,     coinciding with (5).

Discrete and Ordinal Outcomes
            The main results on identifying bounds on inequality probabilities apply also when
population outcome measures are integer-valued (e.g. count-data; see Cameron et al., 2004),
discrete-ordinal, or categorical measures (e.g. health-status scores or indexes, Likert scales).33

One important consideration in such cases is whether the parameter of interest is Pr y1 ≥ y0
                                                                                  !

        (        )
or Pr y1 > y0 since in the population a nonzero probability of ties, i.e. of the event y0 = y1 , is
   !                                                                                   !

            The 2009 study by Volpp et al. on the effects of financial incentives on smoking
cessation and related outcomes offers an instructive example. One outcome of interest in that
study is a five-point Likert scale measure of subjects' self-assessed health; the distributions of
their sample data are pictured in figure 8(a). Treatment effects using this measure are
assessed by Volpp et al. by examining differences between treatment and control separately at

32   See U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016.
33Huang et al., 2016, consider a discrete functional disability measure as their main outcome.
Also see Allison and Foster, 2004, for some related perspectives on discrete ordinal outcomes.
34In empirical applications consideration of ties is relevant not only when the data are
naturally discrete but also when data that are in principle continuously distributed are
measured coarsely.

5. Inequality Probabilities and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
        Inequality probabilities may usefully inform some questions in cost-effectiveness
analysis (CEA). Much applied CEA involves consideration of mean incremental costs and
outcomes, and focuses on uncertainties arising from sampling variation. This is often true
whether the evaluation strategy is based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs),
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs; Fenwick et al., 2004, and Willan, 2001), or
some other approach. The ideas discussed in this paper permit alternative perspectives on
stochastic CEA wherein the main focus is on underlying population heterogeneity of costs and

willingness to pay for e (e.g. dollars per QALY). For instance, in a social choice setting where

Pr h1 ≥ h0 signals the likelihood that T1 would be the intervention adopted. Pr h1 ≥ h0 is

6. Inequality Probabilities with More than Two Outcomes
Three or More Competing Univariate Outcomes
       While most attention in the evaluation literature is on contrasts between two
outcomes, in some cases more than two outcomes are of interest. For instance, Nissen et al.,
2016, compare in a three-arm trial the cardiovascular safety profiles of celecoxib, ibuprofen,
and naproxen for patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, while marketing39 for


38Indeed, much as in the mainstream treatment-effect literature one reason that means-based
CEA (ICERs, CEACs, etc.) may be popular is that mean differences in outcomes and costs
correspond to differences in their marginal means under suitable sampling schemes.

Competing Multivariate Outcomes
         In some evaluations the outcomes of interest are multivariate. A prominent example is
that of co-primary ("and", "all") outcomes in clinical studies.41 In regulatory settings co-
primary outcomes may involve "use of two or more endpoints for which demonstration of an
effect on each is needed to support regulatory approval" (U.S. FDA, 2017). One
characterization of "effect" might be that all outcomes under one treatment are not smaller

than those under the comparator, i.e. y 1 ≥ y 0 for P-vectors y j . Analogous considerations arise

in healthcare quality measurement contexts where all-or-nothing indicators of quality may be
of interest (Nolan and Berwick, 2006).

         To formalize these ideas, suppose the P-dimensional outcomes are y j = ⎡ y j,1 ,…,y j,P ⎤ ,
                                                                                ⎣                ⎦

probability of the events y 0 ≤ y ' and y 1 > y ' for arbitrary !y ' is bounded as follows:

Obtaining the best bounds on Pr y 1 ≥ y 0 in this case follows in a manner analogous to (24)

considerations.43
         For illustration, consider M=2 co-primary outcomes y j where the y j,p are binary, the

joint marginals are known, and !y ' = 0 in (30).44 Here the best bounds on Pr y 1 > y 0 are
                                                                           !

(refer to (7)):

                { (             )        (           ) }          (
          max Pr y 1 = 1 − Pr y 0 = 1 ,0 ! ≤ !Pr y 0 = 0! ∧ !y 1 = 1 ! = !Pr y 1 > y 0       )       (             )         (31)

                                                                      {        (          ) (
          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ≤ !min 1− Pr y 0 = 1 ,Pr y 1 = 1   )}
                                                                              (              )
This idea also covers the weak inequality case, Pr y 1 ≥ y 0 , albeit with messier probability
                                                !

42   The assumption that the joint marginals are identifiable would often be a reasonable one.
43 In a closely related context Andrews, 1997, discusses how a grid or hypercube search over
!y ' can be confined to the observed sample values of y—as these define the steps in the
empirical joint distribution—thus simplifying estimation. Note that the M elements of Yjk will
                                                                                      !
generally not be the M scalar values that would obtain from applying (22) with reference to
the M univariate marginals.
44For example, Langley et al., 2014, consider two binary co-primary endpoints in a study of
secukinumab versus etanercept in the treatment of plaque psoriasis.



                                                                      22

used to bound composite ("or", "any") outcome probabilities (U.S. FDA, 2017), e.g.

     (                        )
Pr y1,1 > y0,1 ! ∨ !y1,2 > y0,2 .

                                                                            (

Sampling
         The sampling assumptions are standard ones. FP state: "observations on the outcome
of participants in the treatment group identify the distribution of the potential outcome with
treatment, and observations on the outcome of participants in the control group identify the
distribution of the potential outcome without treatment."45 In essence, a random sample

                                  !
                                          (   )              !
                                                                    (           )
containing information on the true y0 ,y1 , or more generally y0 ,y1 ,x , is drawn from the

population. Then for each subject the information on either y0 or y1 is deleted at random,
                                                            !     !
resulting in samples of size Nj of observations on y j . More generally, the FP results apply
                             !                     !
with unconfounded conditioning on x—i.e. selection on observables only—if covariates are
relevant. 46 These assumptions are standard and point to what matters being consistent

                      ()                                                        ()       ()
estimates of the Fj y in the sense of convergence in distribution: Fj,N y → Fj y as Nj → ∞

45All the standard reasons to scrutinize the validity of such assumptions in light of the
processes that may actually generate the observed data are applicable here. See Adams, 2013,

Additional Sampling Considerations
Censoring of Empirical Outcome Distributions
       In applications left (e.g. Tobit-type) or right (e.g. survival times) censoring may be
relevant. Censoring of either or both of the empirical marginal distributions may or may not
affect the magnitudes of the FLB or FUB depending on where censoring occurs relative to the

                                                     (       )
uncensored data's Yjk . Informative bounds on Pr y1 ≥ y0 may still be defined from censored
                  !                           !
samples regardless of the degree of censoring so long as some outcome data are uncensored.
Consider the study by Lee et al., 2016, comparing naltrexone and usual treatment for opioid
relapse. The study's primary outcome is relapse-free survival time. The outcome data (derived
from approximating the data in Lee et al.'s figure 2) are depicted in figure 12. While these data
are right-censored at 24 weeks, it can be determined that D01 is at least .29 based on a
                                                          !
provisional Y01 at 15 weeks.47

Marginal Distributions Observed in or Estimated from Different Datasets or Samples
       Nothing about the results discussed above demands that the data on y0 and y1 be
                                                                          !      !
obtained from the same sample or dataset. All that is required is that the respective empirical

                                                                                        (
marginal distributions converge to the corresponding population marginals of F y0 ,y1 , as
                                                                             !

  When either or both of the Fj,N y are censored, point identification of E ⎡⎣ y1 ⎤⎦ − E ⎡⎣ y0 ⎤⎦ is

between marginal quantiles although informative bounds may be available if one of the
marginial quantiles is observed. For instance, while it is not possible to identify

     ( ( ))       ( ( ))

this difference is at least 13 weeks.

repeated cross-sections, synthetic panels, separate trials, etc.) are truly representative of the
same population—characterized by time, place, and all other observable and unobservable
characteristics—then the previous analysis is applicable without modification.48


Estimation
           Estimation of D01 and D10 requires an algorithm that computes the difference between
                         !       !
empirical distribution functions across their common support. In Stata, this is straightforward
using the ksmirnov procedure. 49 With the data on y0,n and y1,n stacked into a single
                                                  !        !
variable (say y = ⎡⎣ y n ⎤⎦ ) having N0 + N1 observations, and a second variable (say g = ⎡⎣g n ⎤⎦ )
              !                      !                                                !
                                                                         (      )
defined as the binary indicator of group membership, e.g. g n = 1 n > N0 , then the Stata
                                                          !
command is simply:

           ksmirnov y, by(g)

ksmirnov returns the scalar stored results r(D_1) and r(D_2) whose absolute values are,
respectively, the estimates of D01 and D10 . To illustrate, 500 observations are drawn from the

Inference
           The emphases to this point in the paper have been identification of probability bounds

based on Djk and estimation of such bounds. Considerations of inference might involve at
         !
least two questions (see Imbens and Manski, 2004, and Tamer, 2010). First, what purpose is

48The assumption that the two samples are drawn from the same population is a strong one.
For clinical trials inclusion criteria, study sites, etc., would all be relevant considerations; for
population surveys or administrative data, sampling frames, exclusion criteria, etc., would be
relevant.
49R has a procedure, ks.test, that appears to provide output similar to that of Stata's
ksmirnov.

served by conducting inference about bounds? Second, which parameters are of interest for
conducting inference? Assuming useful purposes exist then at least two types of inference

may be relevant: inference about the Djk -based bounds per se, and inference specifically

        For the first type, FP provide large-sample results. Since the Fj,N y are averages of
                                                                       ! j

assuming equal sample sizes in the two groups (this is easily relaxed) and that various
regularity conditions50 are met. Confidence intervals built on these large-sample results must
also respect the 0-1 probability bounds. For the data in figure 1, using (33) to compute 95%
(±2 s.e.) CIs around the estimated D01 and 1− D10 bounds whose point estimates are .17 and
                                   !       !
.96, respectively, results in respective CIs of [.10, .24] and [.90, 1]. FP also discuss bootstrap-
based inference.
        For the second type, inference may be undertaken to understand sampling variation in

the estimates of Pr y1 ≥ y0 . ksmirnov gives p-values for testing directional hypotheses

            !

50FP's results use the assumption (which they suggest can be relaxed) that the Yjk are unique.
                                                                               !
FP also discuss bootstrap inference; see also Abrevaya, 2000, and Abadie, 2002. A sampling
exercise suggests that even a naive bootstrap—with computation of each replicate's estimate
of Djk around the original sample's value of Yjk —reproduces closely both the population

8. Summary
       This paper has proposed the utility in health economics evaluations of some results on
inequality probabilities from the treatment-effect literature that have gone largely unnoticed

or unused in health applications. In comparing outcomes y j across a population, which
                                                        !
metric(s) are used for comparison is at the decisionmaker's discretion. While standard
contrasts like ATEs are informative for some questions, other perspectives may be more
relevant in some decisionmaking contexts. Questions regarding inequality probabilities are
natural to consider in a range of decisionmaking settings. While point identification of such
parameters is challenging, the paper has shown how inequality probabilities can be
informatively bounded using information on the marginal outcome distributions. Of course,
estimating the relevant marginal outcome distributions from the data at hand may itself be
challenging for all the standard reasons.
       Whether decisionmakers are comfortable relying on bounds is a consideration whose
relevance and importance have been emphasized by Manski. Entrenched approaches to
evaluation in regulatory (e.g. FDA) and other contexts may be challenging to budge. Yet
superior decisions will be made if evaluations that inform them are anchored to criteria that
reflect what actually matters to decisionmakers52 rather than to criteria that happen to be
biostatistically convenient or time-honored. True value-based policymaking and healthcare
delivery demand no less.
