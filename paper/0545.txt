               Staggered Wage Setting Without Money Illusion:
                       Variations on a Theme of Taylor

                                   ABSTRACT


     Taylor's model of staggered wage setting is reformulated in terms of

anticipated relative real wages rather than   re1at~ve   money wages.   The relative

real wage (RRW) model exhibits more nominal inertia thim.the relative money

wage (RMW) model in the' following sense.   With N-period contracts the RRW

model yields a 2N-2 order stochastic difference equation in the contract wage

while Taylor's RMW model yields an N-1 equation.    Unlike the RMW model the lag

coefficients need not all have a common sign.    It is a1sa shown that Taylor's

money wage model with relative wage effects is observationally equivalent to

a real wage model without relative wage effects.    Taylor's conclusion that

rational expectations combined with nominal inertia (due e.g., to overlapping,

staggered, non-contingent money wage contracts) leave scope for known contingent

monetary policy rules to influence such real variables as the variance of real

output is not affected.

1.   INTRODUCTION



     In a number of influential recent papers    Taylor (1979a, bi 1980a,b) has

analysed the behaviour of an economy characterized by staggered overlapping

wage contracts and rational expectations.     His model has   "Keynesian" features.

In particular, the distribution function of real output is not invariant under

alternative deterministic (and known) monetary policy rules.      A sufficient

reason for this is the inertia in the money wage process induced by the

staggered contracts.    One of the aims of our paper is to demonstrate that this

is sufficient by removing what may be considered a form of money illusion         from

Taylor's model.     In that model, wage bargainers are influenced by relative

money wages rather than relative real wages.     Money wage contracts are negotiated

without reference to past, current and expected future prices.      Our paper

modifies Taylor's model to render it immune to the money illusion criticism.

The suggested modification does not eliminate the     Keynesian qualities of the

model.   It does, however, have interesting implications for the empirical

estimation of models with staggered wage contracts (see especially Taylor, 1980b).



     Section 2 presents our general N-period overlapping staggered real wage

model or relative real wage model (RRW) and contrasts it with Taylor's relative

money wage model (RMW).    Section 3 contains some explicit numerical solutions of

the RRW model which are then compared with the solutions of the corresponding

RMW models.   One can distinguish three influences on the contract wage.        These are

the average price level expected to prevail over the contract, demand effects

and the response of bargainers to relative (real or nominal) wages.      Taylor's

model contains the demand effect and the relative nominal wage effect.      Section 4

analyses staggered real and money wage contracts without relative wage effects.

One conclusion is that Taylor's RMW model is observationally equivalent to a

staggered real wage model without relative wage effects.                                                 Section 5 considers

some empirical implications of the RRW model.

the duration of the contract.                               We shall assume in this section, along with

Taylor (1980a), that the weights on future and past contract wages are symmetric,

linearly declining in s and sum to unity, i.e.



         d
             s
                 =       d

very simple aggregate demand equation!(                  Equation (3) specifies the current

    In Taylor's own words, the two key assumptions of the                 ~lW   model are

H(l) wage contracts are staggered, that is, not all wage decisions in the

economy are made at the same time, and (2) when making wage decisions, firms

(and unions) look at the wage rates which are set at other firms and which

will be in effect during their contract period." [Taylor, (1980a, p. 2)J.



    It is important to note that the second assumption refers to current multi-

period money wage contract decisions that are made with reference to all other

money wage contracts what will be in effect during the periods covered by the

current contract.         While currently contracting firms and unions may well be

interested in their wages relative to those of firms and unions contracting

at earlier and later dates, rational behaviour would seem to require that the

relative real values of these contracts and not the relative money wages per se

should be the proper focus of concern.                   It can therefore be argued.that Taylor's

RMW model does not isolate the implications of having multi-period non-contingent

(i.e. open-loop) money wage contracts            l/ from those of having a form of money
illusion.

    The RRW model modifies the wage setting process in the following way.

The contract money wage of firms and unions settling in period t, x , is
                                                                                            t
set to achieve a given expected (target) real wage over the duration of                          ~~e


contract.   This expected target real wage depends on expected average excess

demand during the contract interval and on the real wages that are expected

to be achieved by other firms and unions whose contracts overlap with the

period t contract.   With N-period contracts, the current contract money wage

is therefore directly dependent on current expectations of the price level

during the current and the following N-l periods.                 Indirectly, because of

the dependence of the current contract wage on the expected real value of                          ~~e


contract wages with which it overlaps, the current contract wage will depend

on current expectations of the price level during the next 2N-2 periods.



    In general there are three kinds of arguments in the structural equation

for the current contract wage.    First, the price expectation effect, which

reflects the influence of the average price level expected over the life of

the contract.    This effect is absent in the RMW model.                          Second, the relative

wage effect, which can be in terms of either real or money wages.                           Finally,

the demand effect which represents the influence of the average level of

excess demand in the labour market expected over the life of the contract.



    Formally, the RRW model retains equations (2) -                   (5) but replaces (1) by                "

          Note that in (6) we specify the expected real contract wage represented

by the money contract wage that is expected to be negotiated in period t + s

wage negotiated by firms and unions contracting in period t + s over the

entire duration of that contract, i.e. from period t + s to period t + s +                                ~   - 1.

One interpretation of the Taylor                      ~~~       model is that firms and unions negotiate

not on the basis of the actual and expected values of contracts established

by other firms and unions but on the basis only of those real wages earned

by other workers whilst the currently negotiated contract is in force.                                Accord-

Therefore, if (5) holds, equation (7)                                is identically equal to equation (1),

the relative money wage equation of the RMW model.



       Taylor argues that firms and unions negotiating the current contract wage

look at the contract wages which are set at other firms and will be in effect

during their contract period.                           If overlapping contract wages matter because of

what they imply for the real standards of living achieved by other workers and

the real wage costs paid by other firms, the RRW model is clearly the appropriate

one.



       The solution method for the RRW model is similar to that for the RlviW model

(see Taylor [1980a]), although the algebra is somewhat more involved.                                             From (3)

Using well-known formulae, the summations in (14b) and (14c) yield third order

polynomials in s.                           When the summations run from a larger to a smaller number

in (14b) we take the terms to vanish.



        The following points are worth noting.                        Firstly, B is always positive
                                                                                 O
for positive Sy.                            This can be contrasted with Taylor's model.      Second, in

(14c) B is always positive and independent of By.                             Third, in (14b) B is a
       s                                                                                       s
function of BYi since the terms in the summation signs are all non-negative

these B will all change sign for some sufficient large value of By, which will
       s
in general be different for different s.

Because of its symmetry B(L) can be factored as in (16)

A unique rational expectations solution to (15) is obtained by choosing the

polynomial A(L) that corresponds to the unstable roots of B(L).             With this

    It is instructive to compare the behaviour of our RRW model with that of

Taylor's       ~M    model, for identical values of all parameters, including contract

length.        This will serve to bring out the separate contributions of money

illusion and "nominal inertia" due to overlapping, staggered non-contingent

money wage contracts.

(equations (l4a - c), (19) and (20Â»               differs dramatically from the corresponding

     Thus with N-period contracts, the RRW model yields a 2N-2 order stochastic

difference equation in the contract wage while Taylor's ID1W model yields an

N-l order stochastic difference equation in the contract wage.                              Further

differences between the two models become apparent when we consider some

explicit numerical solutions for the two models.                           This is done in the next

section.           In the RRW model, as in the RMW model, the variance of output and of

the price level is a function of the monetary policy parameter                             B.

     Consider the two-period contract case, N = 2.                         Taylor IS RMW model yields a

first order stochastic difference equation in the contract wage

the case when the real money supply is always kept constant; equiproportional

nominal money supply changes accommodate deviations of the price level from

money supply whenever the price level increases.                           No real solution exists for

than proportionately (or even contracted if S > 1) when the price level

increases so that the real                 money supply declines.      -al~   the coefficient on

a higher value of x            will be associated with higher money wage settlements in
                           t
all subsequent periods, through the relative (money) wage effect.                    If policy is

more restrictive (Sy > 1.5), the demand effect dominates the relative wage

effect and a higher value of x                leads through expectations of monetary contrac-

reason is that higher wage contracts formed between t - (2N - 2) and t - N raise

the price level in the periods between t - (N - 1) and t - 1.                  The real value of

contracts negotiated between t -               (N - 1) and (t - 1), which overlap with the one

formed in period t, will therefore be lower.                   Via the relative real wage effect

4.   Staggered wage contracts \Â·:ithout relative ,,,age effects



     In this section we         exa~ine    the money and real wage               ~odels       when

Taylor's second key          ass~~ption    is removed.      That is, when the bargaining

process does not take into account relative wages.                         This corresponds to

the special case of the wage equations in (1) and                    (6)         when d
                                                                                          s
                                                                                               = d
                                                                                                     -s
                                                                                                          =   o.
It enables us to separate the consequences of having relative wage effects

from those of having staggered, overlapping contracts pe2' se.

gives

    In the money wage model without relative wage effects, less                                    accQ~Qdati~g


policy (that is, larger values of ey) ir~reases the dependence of current

wages on past wages, as reflected in the larger absolute values of t::e

(negative) lag coefficients.                     The behaviour of Taylor's            m.r:.,   model is sicilar

to that of the money wage model without relative wage effects, when the demand

effect dominates, that is for large values of By.                             For small values of 3y

the relative wage effect dominates the demand effect in Taylor's                                    cc~el   ar.d

the dependence of current wages on past wages                            diminishes     as By increases
                         -1
from zero to N(N-l)           .       This behaviour can be seen clearly in Tables 2) 4)

and 5).



    In the real wage model we can similarly disentangle the demand effect

from the relative real wage effect and                           the price expectation effect.              In

equation (6)       we set d           = d        = 0, which gives
                                  s         -8




                                                                                                                   (35)



Substituting for expected demand we have



                                                                                                                   (36)



Now substituting money wages for prices and taking expectations of both

sides gives



                              \,N-1 \,N-1            ~

                                           - 22 -




Comparing this with the equivalent expression in the              ~Â·lW   model (21, 22a, 22b)

we can see that the equations are identical when             By   in this model takes a
              -1                                                                                -1
value (N-l) N      times that in the fU.ltv model.       This means that policy is N(N-l)

times more effective in this model than it is in the ffi1W model, but that

otherwise they are identical.



    The only way to distinguish empirically between the money wage model "ith

relative wage effects and the real wage model without relative wage effects is

by knowing    By   and   ~   Â£ priori.   Otherwise the two models are observationally

equivalent.

    It has already been shown (Phelps and Taylor [1977], Fischer [1977]) that

in order to obtain the conclusion that          kno~TI   monetary policy rules affect real

output, it is sufficient to have multi-period non-contingent money wage (or

price) contracts.            It is neither essential to have relative wage effects nor

for contracts to be staggered.           Different policy rules will have different

effects whenever the money stock can be made to respond to new information before all

private agents can revise wage contracts.            To include such features as relative

wage effects and staggered contracts may of course be desirable for its                 c~n sa~e


because it captures an essential feature of reality.

5.       Some empirical implications of the relative real \Â·;s.ge r;.odel



         The RRW model and the ill1W model have some directly testable implications

even if the contract wage cannot be observed.                                  From the price level   equatio~


(3) we see that, if N = 2, the price equation of the illÂ·ll'; model is the ARUlA

(1, 1) process

              with -1    ~   -a       ~   1.
                                  l



With N = 2, the price equation of the RRW model is the ARIH.'\ (2,2) process



                                                                                                                 (38b)


              with -1    ~   -a l     ~   2    and   -1    ~   -a 2   ~   o.


The price equation for the ill1W model with N = 3 is also an ARIHA (2, 2) process



                                                                                                                 (38c)




         Given a priori knowledge of N, we can test the RRW hypothesis that the

price data follow an ARIMA (2N-2, 2N-2) process against the ill1W hypothesis test

that the price data follow an ARlMA (N-l, N-l) process.                                  It is much less

straightforward to include in these tests the inequality constraints on the a
                                                                                                                  i
and a. coefficients shown for N = 2 in (38b) and (38c).                                 Alternatively, without
          ~


prior knowledge of N, we can select the best-fitting ARIMA (i, i)                                 process

(i   ~    1) for the price data.                 If i = 1 and the other restrictions of (38a) are

RRlv model is not.           If i > l, non-r;ested hypothesis tests are in general

inequality constraints sl;ch as those given in (38b) and (38c).                                       However,

however, one might go further and argue that equation (38a) with an                                        ~l;    (1)

both with i.i.d. E: .              To perform these and other empirical tests of the two

6.   Conclusions


     The RRW model we developed as an alternative to Taylor's               ~~~   model differs

from the latter in one important respect.           Taylor's RHH model vie"\vs the money

wage decision of firms and unions contracting in a given period as influenced

by the money "\vage rates set (or expecLed to be set) by other firms and unions

that will be in effect during their      O\oJn   contract period.     The RR\{ model views

current wage bargainers as attempting to achieve a real wage target over the

life of their contract that is influenced by the real wages achieved or expected

to be achieved by those other wage bargainers with whose contract periods there

is some degree of overlap.



     Quite significant differences in behaviour are exhibited in otherwise

identical RRW and RN'i\' models.   With N-period contracts, the RRh' model yields a

2N-2 order stochastic difference equation for the contract wage and an                    ARI}~


(2~-2, 2~-2)     process for the general price level.       The corresponding           ~~   model

yields an   :~-l   order stochastic difference equation for the contract wage and an

ARUL-\   (~-l,   N-l) process for the general price level.          ~\ith   the   ~n~   model the

coefficients on lagged contract wages in the contract wage equation always

have a common sign and decline both in the order of the lag and with the degree

of non-accommodation of monetary policy.          The lag coefficients in the RRW model

will generally have mixed signs.       It was also shown that Taylor's             &~    model is

observationally equivalent to a real wage model without relative wage effects.



     What is perhaps the major qualitative conclusion of Taylor's RlM model is

not affected, however.      This is that rational expectations combined with nominal

inertia due, e.g. to overlapping, staggered,non-contingent money wage contracts

leaves scope for known contingent monetary policy rules to influence such real

variables as the variance of output.

     because the polynomial equation in the expected contract wage is no longer

     symmetric.



3.   The   non-contingen~                 nature of these contracts means that the N-period wage

     contract negotiated in period t does not make the wages paid under the

     contract in periods t + 1, â€¢â€¢â€¢ , t + N - 1 contingent on ir.fcr::ation (on future

     contract wages, future prices and future excess demands) that may become

     available during the life of the contract.                              If a multi-period contract made

     the money wages paid over the life of the contract contingent on future

     information, it would be equivalent to a sequence of single-period contracts.

The fact that j takes values only between 1 and N - 1 means that, for r                                     ~    0, s

is constrained to taking the values between 1 and N - 1 - r.                                  For each s in this

          K                K = Li=l              2                     L. 1                    2            (A4 ')
              -r
                            r          [N(N-l)j                         ~=          [N(N-l)]




Now using the following identities



            N-l-r
           Li=l   N(N-r)                      -   (N-l-r) N(N-r)


            N-l-r
           L =l   (r- 2N)i =                      ~(N-l-        r) (N- r) (r- 2N)

           1..,    1           ~              =   %(N-l- r) (N- r) (2N- 2r-l)
             ~=




we have


                                        (N - 1 - r) (N - r) (2N + r - 1)
          K   = K                   =                                            r=O, .â€¢. , N-2 .           (AS)
           -r    r
                                             6[N (N - 1) ] 2



And in particular,


                                    2N - 1
                       =       6N (N - 1)
                                                                                                            (A6)




Now we deal with (A2).                        Proceeding as before, M is the sum of the series b b.
                                                                     r                          s J
for which



           s+j             =        r                                                                       (A7)



and both s and j lie between 1 and N - 1.                               Hence,



                                                        and

          l~s=r-j~N-l =>r-N+l~j~r-l
                                                  - 32-




The upper and lower bounds on j depend on the value of r.                              There are two cases



        2    ~   r   ~   N- 1 , in which case j lies between 1 and r - 1                                (I)


    2N - 2   ~   r   ~   N         in which case j lies between r - N+ 1 and N - 1                     . (II)




Therefore,


                                r-l
        M = M
         -r  r
                             = E . 1 b. b
                                 J=   J r-j
                                                          r   = 2,   ... ,   N-l                        (A8)



                                  N-l
        M = M
         -r  r
                             = Â£: .       b.b
                                  J=r-N+ 1 J r-j
                                                          r = N,     ... ,   2~-   2                    (A9)




We can now write equation (12) as



        N-I E2N-2 M            x         - N-I    E N-l(2_e)b           +K +M ]~                        (AlO)
         N   s=N -s t-l!t-s                 N       s=l          Y s      -s -s t-llt-s




       N-l 2N-2
      +-N E s=N Mx
                 s t-l t+s
                               A

                                    I     =   0




Here â€¢ as in the text, we adopt the convention that, when a summation runs

from a smaller to a larger number, the term vanishes.                          Substituting (AS, â€¢â€¢. ,9)

in equation (AlO) and comparing with equation (13) gives (14a, â€¢â€¢â€¢ , c).
