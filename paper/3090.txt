 Introduction

      The idea that consumers allocate their consumption over time so as to

 maximize a stable individualistic utility function provides the basis for

 almost all modern work on the determinants of consumption and saving

 decisions. The celebrated life cycle and permanent income hypotheses

 represent not so much alternative theories of consumption as alternative

 empirical strategies for fleshing out the same basic idea. While tests of

 particular implementations of these theories sometimes lead to statistical

 rejections, life cycle/permanent income theories succeed in unifying a wide

 range of diverse phenomena. It is probably fair to accept Franco

Modigliani's (1980) characterization that "the Life Cycle Hypothesis has

proved a very fruitful hypothesis, capable of integrating a large variety

of facts concerning individual and aggregate saving behaviour."

     This paper argues, however, that both permanent income and to an only

slightly lesser extent life cycle theories as they have come to be

implemented in recent years are inconsistent with the grossest features of

cross—country and cross section data on consumption and income and income

growth. There is clear evidence that consumption and income growth are

much more closely linked than these theories predict. it appears that

consumption smoothing takes place over periods of several years not several

decades.

    These results confirm Milton Friedman's (1957) initial view that:

"The permanent income component is not to be regarded as expected

lifetime earnings... it is to be interpreted as the mean income at any

age regarded as permanent by the consumer unit in question, which in

turn depends on its horizon and foresightedness."   They call into
                                    —2—


  question the usefulness of standard representative consumer
                                                                 approaches
  to the analysis of saving behavior. And they call for increased

 emphasis on liquidity constraints and short run Precautionary saving as

 determinants of consumption behavior.

       This paper is divided into five sections. Section I presents the

 rational expectations version of the Permanent Income Hypothesis which has

 been increasingly popular in empirical macroeconomics recently, and draws

 out the low frequency implications of this hypothesis. The
                                                                principal
 implications on which we concentrate are, first, that (absent capital

 market imperfections) the anticipated rate of growth of income should be

 unrelated to the rate of growth of consumption, and second, that the rate

 of interest should be a powerful determinant of the   rate of growth of

 consumption. We present evidence which challenges both of these

 propositions. We demonstrate that over periods of several years there is

 nearly perfect equality between rates of income growth and consumption

 growth. These facts hold both across countries and, within countries,

across different eras when productivity increased at different    rates. The
prediction of the permanent income hypothesis that consumption growth and

anticipated income growth are unrelated is clearly refuted.     We next argue

that these facts cannot be explained by imperfections in the international

capital market, since there is no evidence that Countries   with more rapid

consumption growth have higher rates of return on bonds or other assets.

     Section ii asks whether recognizing that consumers have finite

lifetimes helps in understanding these stylized facts. This is plausible

a priori. Because the gap in lifetime income between old and new

generations ones is greater in rapidly than in slowly growing countries the
                                       —3—


  life cycle hypothesis would predict
                                       that consumption growth should equal
  income growth looking across countries
                                          with permanently different
 productivity growth rates. We find, however, that
                                                         the life cycle story is
 not consistent with the data. Contrary to
                                                the predictions of the theory,
 individual consumers in rapidly
                                    growing countries like Japan have had more
 rapid consumption growth rates than consumers in the United States where

 income growth is slower. Indeed, where
                                             life cycle theory predicts that
 longitudinal age-consumption profiles should be similar in countries with

 different growth rates, the fact is much more nearly that point-in—time

 cross sectional age consumption profiles     are similar across countries.
      The close international linkages between
                                                   consumption growth and
 income growth could arise either because
                                              some common factor causes some
 countries both to defer consumption and
                                             to grow rapidly or because
 individual consumers display more sensitivity to current income than theory

 suggests they should. In Section iii we seek
                                                  to distinguish these
alternative views by looking at the relationship between income growth and

consumption growth for consumers in different     occupations and educational
categories. Using data from several American Consumer Expenditure

Surveys, we discover that there is considerable
                                                    variation in the lifetime
profile of income across categories,
                                        and that the lifetime profiles of

consumption track the profiles of income
                                             very closely.
     Section iv uses information on
                                       saving rates to confirm the inference
drawn in the previous sections
                                that consumers are not responsive to changes
in their long run future income.
                                   First, we show that there is no tendency
for countries that experience
                                 reductions in their expected growth rate to
experience short run increases in
                                    saving as theory would predict. Second,
                                    —4--


 we test the pure life cycle theory's prediction that when a country

 experiences a sharp productivity slowdown as the United States has in

 recent years, there should be a tendency for the relative saving rate of

 the young to increase greatly. This prediction is not borne out. Third,

we document that contrary to the theory's prediction there is no tendency

 for young people in occupations where income rises rapidly to have lower

saving rates than those in occupations where income rises slowly.

      Section V discusses the implications of these results for consumption

theory. We suggest that both our data and the available time series

evidence is consistent with Milton Friedman's view that people save ro

smooth consumption over several years in the face of uncertain income but

because of liquidity constraints, caution or shortsightedness do not seek

to smooth consumption over longer horizons. We follow the recent work of

Deaton (1989) in arguing for a "buffer stock" view of saving as appropriate

for most consumers. This view is supported by tabulations from a

longitudinal data set on tax returns suggesting that about 40% of the

population never earned more than $100 in dividend and interest income over

a six year period, 30% of the population earned more than $100 in every

year, and 30% earned more than $100 in some but not all years. The buffer

stock view of saving is attractive in another respect. If the size of the

stock is proportional to income, then one would expect to observe the close

relation that is actually observed between saving rates and income growth.

We also present evidence, however, that suggests that even if the   typical
consumer may   be accurately described by the buffer stock model, the typical

saver may not be. This discrepancy is possible if the distribution of

saving is more unequal than the distribution of consumption, so that the

great majority of dollars saved are not saved by the typical consumer but
                                      —5—


 rather by a small number of very wealthy consumers who have
                                                                   very high
 saving rates. We argue that the apparent importance of the distinction

 between the typical consumer and the typical saver     is   large enough to
 justify more attention and perhaps to justify different models for the two

 groups.

      Section VI concludes the paper. We begin by discussing the

 destructive implications of the results for representative Consumer

 approaches to the study of asset pricing, economic growth and economic

 fluctuations. We then suggest some constructive implications of the

results for understanding international differences in saving rates,

takeoffs of economic growth and the effects of tax policies. Finally, we

suggest some directions for future research.



I.   International Evidence on Consumption and Growth

     The representative agent infinite horizon consumer model is the

simplest and probably most commonly used model in studies of intertemporal

issues. The Ramsey model (as we will refer to it throughout) provides the

basis for the large body of work on consumption that has emanated from the

seminal analysis of Hall (1978)   .   The increasing popularity of this

framework for analyzing intertemporal income and consumption behavior is

suggested by the large literature surveyed in Campbell and Mankiw (1989)

The focus of the research described there has been on the relationship

between short—run fluctuations in consumption and income and on the nature

of substitution between present and future income.      Here we focus instead

on longer term predictions of the theory.

     In the commonly used constant relative risk aversion formulation,
                                          —6—


 solution of the model gives rise to the first order condition for a

 consumer operating under certainty:



                a(r—8)                                                                      (1)




       where      is the elasticity of substitution of consumption, &            is   the

 consumer's subjective discount rate and r is the interest rate.                 Under

 uncertainty, it will continue to be the case that the interest rate is a

 sufficient statistic for predicting consumption growth. In a world with a

 well functioning capital market that equates returns on the safe asset in

different countries, the simple model of (1) predicts that consumption

growth rates averaged over long time periods should be equalized around the

world if tastes for present as opposed to future consumption do not vary

across countries.1 It certainly would not imply that consumption growth

rates should bear any particular relation to income growth rates. We shall

now argue that this prediction is obviously and dramatically falsified by

the recent experience of industrialized economies.

      We have gathered data on income and consumption for fifteen OECD

countries for the period 1960_l985.2 Our sample includes all the major

Western European economies, Japan, the United States, and Canada as well as

all of the smaller economies for which relatively complete data was

available for the entire period. We study the effects of low frequency

1 We comment below   on the possibility that differences in tastes can explain our

observations.
2 Because of data limitations we do not carefully distinguish durable and non-

durable consumption as theory would suggest. Given that durables are a relatively
stable share of consumption in the United States at least, we doubt that this has much
impact on our results.
                                    —7—

 variations by looking at differences both across Countries and across

 different time periods in individual countries. For these comparisons, the

 issues of measurement and time aggregation that have been discussed in the

 literature on the time series properties of consumption are not very

 important. In order to highlight the strength of the patterns in the data

 we present them graphically.

       Figures la-id document a stylized fact that any theory of consumption

 should account for: At low frequencies there is near perfect equality

between consumption growth rates and income growth rates. When

consumption growth rates are plotted against income growth rates the    result

is almost precisely a 450 line. While Figures la, ib, and ic document this

fact looking across the entire 1960-1985 period and two different sub-

periods, Figure id compares the change in income growth with the change in

consumption growth between the 1960-73 and 1980—85 periods. We choose

these periods so as to avoid the difficulty of assessing when during the

1970s expectations became entrenched that the productivity slowdown would

last. Again the result is close to a 45 degree line.

      While we have used GDP growth in these comparisons rather than the

disposable income measures that would be more appropriate on some views,

this and other measurement issues cannot be important.   it is easy to see

that the consumption growth—income growth regularity has to hold up using

almost any measure. Suppose that over a 25 year period a countrys saving

rate changed by 15 percentage points. This would only alter its

consumption growth rate by .6 percentage points, a rather small difference

compared to the spread of growth experiences illustrated in Figures là and
lb.
      In fact, the striking thing about saving rates, whether measured on a

private or a national basis, is their stability through time. Comparing
                                           —8—


 the saving rates of the Countries in Our sample before and after 1973, no

 country experienced a change of more than 5% in either its private or its

 national saving rate.3 This compares with a range of saving rates across

 countries of over ten percent.

       Returning now to the Ramsey model, Figures la-id appear anomalous in

 light of the model's implication that the expected rate of growth of

 consumption should be the same across countries, and should be unrelated to

 the rate of growth of income, We therefore consider in turn whether income

 surprises, imperfect capital markets, or international differences in

 tastes can explain the consumption/income parallel within roughly a Ramsey

 framework.

 Income Growth Surprises

       One possible objection to direct tests of the independence

proposition arises from the possibility that differences in income growth

over time were largely unexpected. If the consumer receives information

about present or future income she will adjust her level of consumption

discontinuously to be consistent with her new intertemporal budget

constraint. From this new level the proposition will again apply, but if

we calculate consumption growth between the period before the information

arrived and the period after it arrived we will not observe a growth rate

of (r—8). Moving from the abstract to the concrete, this point would be

important if, for instance, Japan's continued growth over the postwar

period constituted a succession of pleasant surprises which
                                                                           successively

caused Japanese consumers to adjust consumption upward in accordance                     with

                                            —9-.


 their new, surprisingly higher, lifetime income.

          A first bit of evidence on the plausibility of this scenario is given

by Figure 2, which plots DRIs projected income growth for our sample of

fifteen countries from 1988 to 2000 against their actual growth rates over

the period 1976-1988. The figure illustrates that there are major

differences in expected rates of growth of income across countries.

Furthermore, expected future income growth is clearly correlated with past

income growth. This suggests that the simplest version of a "surprise"

theory, in which any deviation from the average growth rate is

unanticipated, is very hard to sustain.

          Table 1 presents some more formal tests of the idea that the close

international correlation between income growth and consumption growth

reflects the effects of income surprises. We estimate an international

cross section relating consumption growth to measures of expected income

growth formed on the basis of past income growth. Each equation includes

year dummies so the identifying variation comes from variations across

countries in consumption growth and lagged income growth. The results

using measures of income growth over long past periods suggest a nearly

one-to-one relationship between expected income growth and consumption

growth.4'5

      The results using only a single lag of income growth are less strong.

  Note that this test differs from the popular Hall—style tests by focusing on low—
frequency measures of income growth rates like the geometric average over the previous
five years rather than very high frequency variables iike previous quarters income
growth.     If we believe there is long—term dependence in growth rates then this is an
appropriate variable to use as a proxy for expected current and future growth.
  We recogn1e that the previous discussion does .iot fully address the impliCations
of uncertainty, because the model which produces (IJ is a perfect certainty model. e
address the implications of a model which incorporates important uncertainty below.
                                  — 10   —




 However, this is accounted for by the fact that lagged income growth over a

 long period is a better predictor of contemporaneous income growth than is

 lagged income growth over a short time period. When past income growth is

used as an instrument for expected income growth all specifications suggest

a very strong relationship between consumption growth and income growth.

 Imperfect Capital Markets and Different Interest Races

      Consider a set of independent closed economies with different rates

of exogenous productivity growth. Then theory predicts that each would

converge to a steady state with consumption growth equal to income growth.

The first order condition (1) would be satisfied in each country because of

differences across countries in the steady state real rate of interest.

More rapidly growing countries would have higher real interest rates. It

is possible therefore that the close correlation between consumption growth

and income growth is a consequence of imperfections in the international

capital market. In this case, one would expect to observe a close

relationship between consumption growth rates and rates of return.

     Figures 3a—d illustrate, however, that there is essentially no

evidence looking across countries that differences in consumption growth

rates across countries are explained by differences in real interest rates

or other proxies for ex ante returns. This point may be seen most easily

by comparing the United States and Japan. It is almost inconceivable that

a plausible measure could be found on which ex-ante returns were higher in

Japan than in the United States in recent years. This evidence is

reinforced by Figure 3e which asks whether changes in consumption growth

rates in different countries between the pre-1973 period and the post-1980

period are predicted by changes in real interest rates. Perhaps

surprisingly the countries with the greatest declines in consumption growth
                                    — 11   —




rates   had the smallest declines in real interest rates.

        The point that differences in average returns across countries cannot

account for differences in consumption growth can be made another way. The

range of consumption growth rates in our sample of countries is 3.4

percent. Most estimates of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution

put it at below .25. Even taking the high rate of .25, and assuming that

differences in consumption growth rates were perfectly explained by

differences in rates of return, the range of rates of return would have to

be 13.6 percent. Persistent differences in safe rates of return of this

magnitude over a 25 year period are implausible on even strong views about

world capital immobility.

        In an influential paper Mehra and Prescott (1985) have raised

questions about the ability of the representative consumer model to account

for the risk premium between debt and equity. This problem is deepened by

the apparent absence of correlation between safe interest rates and

consumption growth rates across countries. It appears that any successful

attempt to rationalize differences in consumption growth rates across

countries with fairly similar interest rates would involve postulating a

high interternporal elasticity of substitution. This deepens the difficulty

of accounting for the equity risk premium.

Variation in Tastes

     One potential channel for reconciling the Ramsey formulation with

these facts is to assert that discount rates 3 differ across countries. If

the production technology is of the "Ak" variety discussed by Barro (1989)

differences in 3 would also be associated with differences in steady state

growth rates. The same would be true in endogenous growth models relying
                                 — 12 —




on increasing returns of the type developed by Paul Romer (1986) and

others. Even if there were diminishing returns, one would expect that low

5 countries would grow more rapidly while in transition to their steady

states (assuming countries started with equal, below steady state capital

intensity)

     We are skeptical that differences in growth across countries arid

across time primarily reflect taste differences. It seems very implausible

to suppose that the primary reasons for the worldwide slowdowns in economic

growth rates between the 1960—73 and 1980-87 periods was a taste shock

reflecting increased impatience. Yet, since the growth rate of consumption

in (1) depends only on tastes and the interest rate, a simultaneous

worldwide increase in impatience would be necessary to account for the

simultaneous slowing of consumption and income growth.

     Even returning to the cross—country consumption growth-income growth

relation, the "tastes" theory has a problem. If differences in tastes were

a dominant explanation for differences in growth rates there should be a

strong tendency for low S (fast growing) countries to lend to high S (slow

growing) countries. As Table 1 makes clear, this tendency is not apparent

in the data. No matter how the data are disaggregated by time there is

apparently little or no correlation between trade balances and growth

rates.

     Note finally that unless an extremely high value of a is selected,

enormous differences across countries in subjective rates of discount are

needed to account for the wide range of observed consumption growth rates.

Conclusion

     We conclude that there do not appear to be plausible ways of squaring
                                   — 13 —



 the independence proposition with our facts. While some
                                                         story involving
 both variations in r and in   could be used to account for differences in

 consumption growth across countries, the problem of explaining why they are

 so nearly equal to differences in income growth would remain.



 II. The Life Cycle and the COn3umption/Ineome Parallel

      As a matter of logic, the life cycle hypothesis is   consistent with
 both the stylized fact that consumption and income growth rates are equated

 across a sample of countries and the fact that saving and growth rates are

 positively correlated. To see this think of a very simple life cycle model

 where individuals seek level consumption over their lifetimes.     Even though
 individuals would have level consumption over their lifetimes    regardless of
their income growth rates, it will nonetheless be true that in steady state

total consumption will grow at the same rate as total income.     This is

because the gap in lifetime income between old and young generations is

greater in rapidly than in slowly growing countries.

     Consider the modern life cycle hypothesiss explanation of the

equality between consumption and income growth rates across countries with

different growth rates. The essence of the theory (assuming common tastes

worldwide and the irrelevance of rate of return differences) is that the

rate of growth of consumption for all individuals is the same in all

countries. (Implicitly we are assuming rational expectations rather than

the myopic expectations assumed by Modiglianj in some early statements of

the life—cycle hypothesis.) Countries differ in their consumption growth

rates only because of the differential effect of the continuous replacement

of old, lifetime poor individuals by young, lifetime rich ones.

     This argument has two essentially equivalent testable implications.

First,   tracking the Consumption of a given cohort, say those who were 25 in

1950, one should find no difference across countries in the rate of growth

of consumption. Second, at a point in time the age—consumption cross—

section profile should be less positively sloped in a rapidly growing

country than in a slowly growing country. This is because in more rapidly

growing countries the old are much lifetime-poorer than the young so

consumption of the old will be much lower relative to consumption of the

young. This point is illustrated graphically in Figure 4a. This figure

supposes that each individual desires a rate of growth of consumption over

his lifetime of 2% annually, and demonstrates what the age/consumption

cross—section profile should look like in steady state across countries

with different growth rates, normalizing the consumption of all individuals

by the consumption of individuals at age twenty.

       Compound interest produces dramatic results here. The ratio of the

consumption of the 65 year olds to the consumption of 25 year olds should

be more than twice as great in countries growing at a four percent rate as

in countries growing at a two percent rate. Given the large differences in

growth rates illustrated in Section I, if the life cycle hypothesis is even

approximately accurate some tendency for consumption of the elderly to be

relatively low in rapidly growing countries ought to show up in the

international comparisons.

       In order to test this proposition, we have obtained cross-sectional

point—in—time consumer expenditure profiles by age for Canada, Denmark,

Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.6 Sources and

methods are described in the data appendix. Our estimates of the age-

 consumption profiles are provided in Figure 4b. We have carried the

profiles only up to age 65 because of concern that measures of the

consumption of the aged are distorted in some countries by the tendency of

the poorer elderly to move in with their children.

       The results are at odds with life cycle hypothesis, since the

profiles look quite similar across countries. The similarity of these

profiles means that there is no evidence that old people in the slow-

growing countries have relatively higher consumption than those in the

fast—growing countries. To take a specific example, the profile is more

positively sloped in Japan than in the United States, exactly the opposite

of what the theory would predict given Japan's much more rapid growth rate.

Norway, which has also grown relatively rapidly, also has relatively higher

consumption among the aged than the United States. Deaton (1989) using a

sample of LDC's age—consumption profiles reaches conclusions similar to

those reached here.

       This comparison is very crude. But it is instructive to observe how

large the differences in age-consumption profiles predicted by the theory

would be. Over the 25 year period 1960-1985 per capita GNP in Japan grew

at 5.2 percent as compared with 2.1 percent in the United States.                Suppose

that we take the Japanese steady state growth rate to be 4.0 percent and

the US steady state growth rate to be 2.5 percent. Then the lifetime

income of 30 year olds in Japan should be 3.94 times the lifetime income of

65 year olds, compare. with a ratio of 2.37 in the United States.                This is

a difference equal to more than 150% of the income of the average 65 year

old.   It is large enough that one would expect it to show up even in Our

crude measures of age consumption profiles.7

 Given the large differences in   lifetime   incooe between cohorts it is also
                                          — 16 —




      What about the experience of individual cohorts? The longitudinal

evidence that we would like to have to answer this question is not

available. However, evidence discussed by Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) for

the United States and by Ando and Kennickell (1987) for Japan suggests that

the shape of age—expenditure profiles is quite stable through time.

Figures 5a and 5b for these two countries confirm that between the dates

for which we have specific data the profiles have been fairly stable. If

we make the stability assumption for all the countries in our sample it is

possible to trace the consumption of individual cohorts by using data on

aggregate consumption and the age structure of the population. If

indicates the relative consumption of people in age group                 Pi. indicates

the number of people in this age group ir year t, and Yt is total real

personal consumption in year t, then we calculate a scaling factor s from

the equation:




                                                                                     (2)
            5t cipit

      Using the scaling factor            we calculate real consumption of people

of age group i in year t, cr1t, from cr cst. The results are shown in

Figure 6. Not surprisingly given our results so far, this technique

indicates that individuals in fast-growing countries like Japan have

enjoyed much more rapid growth in consumption than individuals in slower-

growing countries like the United States. How much more rapid? Given that

the cross-section profiles are very similar across the whole range of

countries in Figure 4b, it follows that none of the difference in

surprising under the life cycle theory that the consumption of 30 year olds is not
much greater than the consumption of 65 year olds in both countries.
                                  — 17 —




aggregate consumption growth rates across countries can be explained by
life-cycle replacement effects.

Conclusions

     While there are obviously many measurement problems here, the data

suggest that demographic replacement of the low-consuming aged by the

high-consuming young cannot account for the correlation between income

growth and consumption growth across countries. If this were the

explanation for the correlation there would be large differences across

countries in the ratio of the consumption of the old to the consumption of

the young. These are not observed.

     These results call into question the life—cycle hypothesis's

interpretation of the positive correlation between saving and growth. The

life—cycle explanation as described, for example, by Modigliani (1967)

relies on differences in the ratio of lifetime income among the old and the

young to account for the positive relation between saving and income

growth. It is not consistent with the observation that individuals in

rapidly growing countries enjoy more rapid consumption growth over their

lifetimes than individuals in slowly growing countries.



III. Tests Using Individual Data

     Section I demonstrated that consumption growth has been very closely

related to income growth across both countries and time and argued that

this was not consistent with the standard Ramsey model. Section II argued

that the consumption/income parallel could not be explained by life-cycle

considerations. This leaves two classes of explanations for the apparent

international association of consumption growth and income growth. A first
                                  — 18 —




possibility   is that because consumers are myopic or liquidity constrained

or operate on the basis of rules of thumb, consumption and income are

strongly associated. A second possibility is that some common cause of

both rapid income growth and rapid consumption growth operates across

countries.

     In an effort to distinguish these possibilities, this section uses

information on income growth and consumption growth for individuals in

different occupations and with different educational backgrounds.

Liquidity constraints, myopia, or the like would be expected to create an

association between age-consumption and age-income profiles across

different occupations. On the other hand theories of growth that might

apply at the international level would not imply that individual age-income

and age-consumption profiles should move together.

     Anecdotal evidence about sports stars and medical students suggests

that consumption is closely tied to current income, but for a more formal

test we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure

Surveys of 1960-61 and 1972—73. These studies, originally done for the

purpose of calculating consumer price indices, contain detailed expenditure

and income accounts for a large representative sample of households (13,000

in 1960, 20,000 in 1972), and so are an ideal source for comparing income

and consumption of households at different ages. For our income measure we

took the total after-tax income of the household, We experimented with

several definitions of consumption and expenditures, ranging from total

expenditures of the household (including payments for social security and

prearranged pension plans) to just consumption of nondurable goods. The

consumption measure below does not include payments for social security,
                                          — 19 —



private    pensions, or home mortgages, but does include gifts and

contributions to private charities and to other households, as well as

insurance premia.

       Figures 7a,b and 8a,b present mean income and consumption profiles

for the nine occupational groups and the five educational levels that could

usefully be distinguished with the CES.8 The data's suggestion that

saving for almost all groups increased between the first and second survey

is almost certainly a consequence of changes in measurement procedure.

What is more interesting is the figures' apparent refutation of the simple

life cycle/permanent income view that the shape of the path of income

should not have an effect on the shape of the consumption path. In life

cycle terms, these graphs indicate that people in occupational or

educational groups with income peaks late in life do not borrow

significantly against those future earnings in order to finance higher

consumption when they are young. Conversely, people with income peaks

relatively early in life do not appear to save much in anticipation of

lower future income. These observations appear inconsistent with life

cycle theory.

         It is possible to imagine some combinations of circumstances which

can explain some of the apparent correlation above while remaining roughly

within a life cycle framework. For instance, suppose that each cohort in a

category consumes its permanent income and that the differences in income

8   The unused occupational groups were retired people. nonresponses. and   others. The
unused   educational group was "none, nonresponse, or other". The figures grouped by
occupation are in   order   of increasing variance, so more credibility shoulO be ascrbeo
to inferences drawn from figures near the top of the page than those near the bottom.
The difference in variance across educational groups was substantially less (the
groups are closer in size) so the figures grouped by education are ordered by
increasing educational level.
                                 — 20   —




across categories and age groups are the result of idiosyncratic shocks to
cohorts. Then we would observe the pattern that the income and consumption

of households of any given age within a category would be closely related,

as we see in the figures. This explanation works, however, essentially by

denying any element of predictability in income profiles. But at least

across educational categories there is a very strong resemblance of the

age/income profiles in the 1972—3 CES to those in the 1960-1 CES -    surely   a

strong refutation of the "no predictability' hypothesis. And informally,

we surely believe that people with college and postgraduate educations can

expect higher wage growth over their lifetimes than those with only grade

school educations, so that there is surely some degree of predictability.

Although the degree of similarity of 1960 and 1973 income profiles is

smaller across occupations than across educational categories, it is still

the case that several occupations, particularly professionals, managers,

operatives, and unskilled workers, have quite similar, and thus presumably

predictable, profiles in the different years.

     The calculations here do not take account of changes in family

composition. By calculating consumption on an equivalence scale basis it

is possible to create consumption profiles that do not follow estimated

income profiles. But it is not clear what this proves, since total

consumption spending does follow income. More relevant is the observation

that there do not appear to be large differences in average family sizes at

different ages among different educational and occupational groups. While

the issue deserves further research, our tentative conclusion is that

parallel movements in income and consumption cannot be explained by family

size considerations.
                                  — 21 —



     Another explanation of the consumption/income parallel was provided
by Ghez (1969)   Using the 1960 CES, Ghez prepared a figure for all

consumers similar to our Figures 7 and 8 for subcategories of consumers and

sought to explain the observed close correlation between income and

consumption using a "family production function" model of the type

advocated by Becker (1965) .   Suppose, for example, that utility is a

function both of consumption c and hours of leisure h. Suppose further

that, because of the accumulation of experience or other human capital.

hourly wages grow over the life cycle. Then individuals will have an

incentive to work the longest hours when they are most productive, late in

life. But this extra work takes away leisure time, giving the consumer an

incentive to consume more time—substituting goods. The consumer will

therefore be observed consuming more during those periods of life when he

works most and earns the most income. To be more specific, this model

would suggest that busy executives late in life would be more likely to

have a maid to do housekeeping chores and more likely to send out their

laundry than young people with (presumably) more time on their hands.

     The Ghez model seems unlikely to be a satisfactory explanation for

the close consumption/income parallel observed in Figures 7 and 8 for

several reasons. First, it is not even obvious that consumption and hours

are substitutes rather than complements. With more leisure time one can

engage in expensive activities, such as foreign travel, that may    not   be

possible at all at in busier periods of life. Ghez himself makes the point

that if time is very valuable one may eat more fast food (presumably

inexpensive) and fewer elaborate meals out (presumably expensive)

Further, even if we accept that consumption and hours are substitutes, the

Ghez model only makes predictions about the sign of the relationship
                                   — 22 —




between income and consumption, not about its size. There is no reason in

his model to expect that the relationship between income and consumption

will be one-for-one as we observe. Finally, the Ghez explanation relies

heavily on the assumption that hours and income move exactly in parallel.

Figure 9, which is reproduced from a book by Becker and Ghez (1975), plots

hours worked and hourly earnings at each age across the life cycle for two

educational groups using 1960 census data. It is apparent that there is

very little variability in hours worked over the lifetime in either group.

Furthermore, hours seem to decline after roughly age 35, while income and

consumption both peak in the CES data roughly at age 50. Finally, there is

no clear difference across the two educational groups in the age profile of

hours worked in spite of a noticeable difference in the profile of wages.

we conclude that consumption/hours substitution is not a viable explanation

for the consumption/income parallel.

Conclusion

     This    evidence on individuals suggests to us that explaining why

consumers should allow their consumption to be heavily influenced by

current income is a more plausible route to explaining the international

correlations with which we began the paper than is seeking an endogenous

growth theory that could explain both high consumption and high income

growth. It is also noteworthy that the behavior of these profiles suggests

that the excess association of income and consumption is stronger at the

low frequencies considered here than it is in the higher frequency contexts

that have been more extensively studied.

IV.     Saving and Expected Income Growth

        The analysis so far has suggested that both internationally and

across countries consumption and income growth are much more closely

associated than standard theories would predict. A different way of

stating the same point is to observe that saving decisions appear to be

less responsive to expected long term growth rates of income than simple

theories would predict. In this section we examine the response of saving

to differences in expected income growth using several different types of

data.

        The worldwide productivity slowdown after 1973 provides one natural

test of the proposition that a decline in growth should lead to reduced

human wealth and increased saving. As Figure 10 demonstrates, the life

cycle hypothesis predicts that a two percentage point decline in expected

income growth should have dramatic effects on saving, particularly for

young consumers. Young consumers targeting even a three percent annual

consumption growth rate are predicted to raise their saving ratio out of

income by 20 percent. For the population as a whole the saving rate should

increase by about 10 percent since the human wealth effect is less

important for older consumers.

        As Figures lla-d demonstrate, these predictions are not borne out.

Saving rates around the world did not rise following the productivity

slowdown. If anything they have fallen. Moreover, there is no tendency

for the countries which have suffered the greatest declines in growth to

have had greater than normal increases in saving.

        This failure of the theory might be due to other shocks which have

changed saving behavior. A further test using information derived from the
                                   — 24   —




productivity   slowdown focuses on its effects on consumers in different age

groups. A decline in growth reduces expected future income by much more

for young consumers than for older ones, and not at all for those who have

retired. Whatever happened to overall saving, one would expect to observe

a tendency for the relative saving rate of the young to rise following the

productivity slowdown if consumers were farsighted. This tendency should

have been reinforced by declining fertility. It is borne out only to a

very slight extent in Figure 12.    (Again, because of changes in measurement

procedures, nothing can be inferred from the position of these profiles,

only their shape.) This finding is perhaps not so surprising given that

the shape of the age-saving rate profiles in Figure 12 are not really

consistent with the predictions of the life—cycle theory in the first

place.

     Information on the shape of occupational income profiles can also be

used to test the life-cycle theory. It predicts a tendency for those in

occupations where income can be expected to rise rapidly to save less than

those in occupations where income can be expected to rise slowly. The

profiles from Figures 7 and 8 can be used to calculate a ratio of future

income to current income for young people in different occupational groups

and the results can then be compared with observed saving rates.

     Figures 13a and 13b plot, for each occupation in 1960, the ratio

(future income/current income) against the saving rate of young people in

that occupation, where "future income" is defined as the sum of income for

people age 30—65 and "current income" is the sum of income for people age

25—29, and "young" refers to people in the age group 25-29. The slope of

these lines should be strongly negative because high-future-income
                                  — 25 —



occupations should be low-saving occupations. Instead, the slope seems to
be positive. This evidence is also consistent with the view that

consumption is excessively sensitive to current income, though this cannot

explain the positive association in the data.

     Overall information on saving supports the conclusion reached in

earlier sections that consumption is much more closely tied to current

income than strong forms of the life-cycle or permanent income hypotheses

would predict. While reassuring, this evidence is of course not

independent of the earlier evidence on the behavior of measured

consumption.



V.   Liquidity Constraints, Myopia, and Uncertainty
     One obvious interpretation of the close link between consumption

growth and income growth is that consumers are liquidity constrained or

myopic. This would "explain" why consumption and income growth are so

closely associated. The principal difficulty with this line of thought is

that in order to account for the observed equality of consumption and

income growth rates one would have to assume that essentially all consumers

were liquidity constrained or myopic.

     To see this consider the formulation of Hall (1978) in which the

population is divided into two classes. A fraction a of the population

consumes all its income and no more each year because of liquidity

constraints and/or myopia. The remaining fraction (1—a) behave according

to the first order condition in (1) .   Assuming that the optimizing non-

liquidity—constrained latter group enjoys consumption growth at the same

rate in every country at the rate (c*/c*), the growth rate of consumption

will be given by:
                                   — 26   —




     c/c    a(y/y) + (1—U) (c*/c*)                                             (3)



     In order to account for the unit slope observed in Figure       1 it is

necessary to postulate that U=l    so that    the entire population is liquidity

constrained. This assumption robs the permanent income theory of any

content. In addition, it leaves unanswered the unquestion of where savings

come from. Of course it is also contradicted by all of the evidence

supporting the permanent income hypothesis. The challenge is finding a

theory that can account for the apparent absence of pervasive liquidity

constraints or myopia in high frequency tests but can still account for our

low frequency facts.

     However, the possibility that most consumers act as if they were

liquidity constrained or expected to be in the future should not be ruled

out. Studies such as Campbell and Mankiw (1989) which seek to estimate the

fraction of rule—of-thumb or liquidity constrained consumers by applying

time—series techniques are likely to understate it for three reasons.

First,   the specification   adopted assumes a restrictive form of liquidity

 constrained behavior. It would be more difficult to demonstrate

 conclusively the existence of an economically significant set of permanent

 income consumers if the myopes were assumed to follow a rule in which

 consumption responded to income and its lags. Second, the assumption that

 liquidity constrained consumers spend a fixed fraction of their income on

 non—durable consumption rules out the possibility that these consumers cut

 durable spending disproportionately when income declines. If this is in

 fact the case, standard methods will understate the liquidity constrained
                                  — 27 —




fraction   of the population. Third, most recent research effort has focused

on the post—war period where income is close to a random walk. DeLong and

Sunmer5 (1986) present evidence that in the pre—War period when income

fluctuations were more transitory the fraction of liquidity constrained

consumers was greater.

     In spite of the considerable evidence that liquidity constraints are

important,the assertion that people spend their incomes is not a rich

enough theory of saving. We are attracted by Angus Deaton's (1989) view of

savings as a "buffer stock" for contingencies. As he argues, situations

where consumers are liquidity constrained and where they are unwilling to

borrow because of the possibility that this would force their subsequent

consumption to decline sharply in the event of bad news are likely to be

operationally very similar. The buffer stock view has the appeal of

predicting (or at least labelling) the consumption smoothing which goes on

at high frequency but not implying that consumption smoothing should go on

over long horizons. It also has the potential to explain the observed

correlation between saving and growth. If consumers desire (as financial

planners recommend) a buffer stock equal to a certain number of months'

income, saving will be greater for consumers with rapidly growing incomes

than for those with slowly growing incomes. Essentially, the accelerator

mechanism will create a positive growth—saving relationship.

     Table 3 presents some empirical evidence drawn from panel data on tax

returns for the period 1979-1984 which supports the buffer stock idea. For

persons under and over 65, it presents estimates of the fraction of people,

 fraction of labor income, fraction of total income, and fraction of

 interest and dividend income going to persons with less than $100 in
                                  — 28   —




interest   and dividend income in various numbers of years. The results

suggest that liquidity constraints are potentially very important.   More

than half of total income went to persons who usually (three years or more

out of six) had less than $100 of interest and dividend income.

Furthermore, the fraction of total interest and dividend income received by

those who do not always have such income is quite small.   This suggests

that even in years when such people have over $100 of interest and dividend

income they do not have very large amounts of such income. Interestingly,

whatever weights are used it appears that about a third of households have

minimal interest and dividend income in some but riot all years. This is

what one expects on the buffer stock view. It suggests that "snapshot"

evidence estimating the fraction of the population without assets is likely

to underestimate the potential significance of borrowing constraints.

     The view that borrowing constraints are important for a large

fraction of consumers is also supported by the observation that a large

majority of American households report that they have substantial amounts

of consumer debt. The interest rate on this debt is typically considerably

greater than the rate on safe assets like treasury bills. Simultaneously

borrowing at high rates and holding safe assets is difficult to square with

the Ramsey model view of consumption decisions. As Julio Rotemberg and

others have argued, it is rational for a consumer who believes he may be

liquidity constrained in the future. Such a consumer would also tend to

allow his consumption to closely follow his income.

      It is also important to recall that typical consumers and typical

savers may behave very differently. This point is illustrated by Table 4.

The conceptual unit in this table is the typical dollar of income rather

 than the typical taxpayer. If the distribution of property income is very
                                 — 29   —




                                                               income to
unequal we should expect the median or mean dollar of property
accrue to a person with a very large amount of such income. This is

exactly what the table shows. Although the median dollar amount of

interest and dividend income was $185, the median dollar of such income

went to someone with property income of $16,100. Furthermore, although the

mean amount of interest and dividend income was $2755, the mean dollar went

to a taxpayer earning $46,533 of property income.    (See appendix for

details)

     The numbers become even more striking when we use assumed rates of

return to convert statements about capital income into statements about

liquid assets (see appendix for details) .   When we do this we discover that

the median dollar of (estimated) assets is held by a person holding

$212,415, and that the mean dollar is held by a person with nearly a

million dollars of liquid assets. The general picture of extreme

inequality in the distribution of wealth painted by these numbers is borne

out by an analysis of some evidence from the Federal Reserve's Survey of

Consumer Finances in a recent paper by Avery and Kennickell (1988) .     The

 SCF allows a direct calculation of net saving via a comparison of families'

 net worth in 1983 and 1986. In Table 12 the authors estimate the fraction

 of aggregate positive saving between 1983 and 1986 that was done by the

 members of each 1983 wealth decile. They estimate that nearly 70 percent

 of all the positive saving between 1983 and 1986 was done by families in

 the top 1983 wealth decile. Using crude smoothing techniques (see

 appendix), we calculated that the median dollar of saving was done by a

 family roughly at the 94th percentile in the wealth distribution.

 Smoothing again, we estimated that a person at the 94th percentile in the
                                       — 30   —




1983 wealth distribution had $661,000 (1988 $) of net wealth. This

compares with an estimated median 1983 net wealth of $46,800 (1988 5) .

Again it would appear that wealth and saving are extremely unequally
distributed.

     Taken together, this evidence along with Tables 3 and 4 suggest that

there are two kinds of consumers. The great majority of consumers are

liquidity constrained and have only small amounts of liquid assets, which

they keep as a buffer against uncertainty. A small minority of consumers,

however, have very substantial assets and are not liquidity constrained.

These wealthy consumers are the source of most of the net dollars saved in

the economy.

Conclusion

      The broad picture painted above suggests that focusing separately on

two different models, one for the liquidity constrained majority of

consumers who save little outside of housing equity and one for the small

but wealthy minority who seem to do most of the saving, will yield more

empirical success than continuing to work with a single model postulating

identical unconstrained consumers. These are not new ideas: in arguing for

a typically short horizon, Milton Friedman (1957) observed "..The

appropriate definition of the permanent component [of income] is a period

 of three years or slightly longer. This is the same as the conclusion

 reached earlier from [different] data on urban families. It is also

 consistent with the time series data. It is encouraging to find such a

 close agreement in the precise definition of permanent components suggested

 by three independent bodies of data." And the idea that accumulation is

  Note that these wealth estimates include housing equity, which accounts for the
 discrepancy between the estimated median wealth here and in Table 4.

chiefly   an activity of the already wealthy goes back at least to Pareto.



VI   Conc1usiOfl
     Recent studies of consumption behavior have tested increasingly

subtle implications of the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis using

increasingly sophisticated time series techniques with increasingly

ambiguous results. Many existing estimates suggest that at least a large

fraction and possibly all of consumption is done by optimizing non-myopic

non-liquidity constrained consumers maximizing individualistic utility

functions with long or infinite horizons. We believe this conclusion is

not correct. It seems to us that the wide variety of evidence presented

here is much more robust to the possibility of measurement or specification

error than the numerous complex econometric tests that have been performed.

We regard our evidence as decisively refuting the low frequency predictions

of standard intertemporal theories.

     As we emphasized in the introduction, the evidence here is generally

consistent with the life-cycle and permanent income hypotheses as they were

originally advanced. Indeed, Milton Friedman explicitly rejected the idea

that consumers had horizons as long as a lifetime in discussing the

permanent income hypothesis. And Modigliani relied on myopic expectations

 in some early development of his theory. What is decisively rejected here

 is the modern representative consumer versions of these theories, not the

 core idea that people seek to smooth consumption.

      While the evidence here does not undercut the usefulness of the life-

 cycle and permanent income theories in explaining some broad features of

 consumption behavior, it does cast serious doubt on modern uses of these
                                  — 32   —

horizons will give very good predictions about

changes. And we suspect that those concerned with modelling the

determinants of income growth should build in a different consumption

function than the one suggested by the Ramsey model.        Finally, we note

that a major claim of real business cycle theorists        is that their models on

the basis of non-cyclical phenomena.         It does not appear that the

representative consumer approach used in most real business cycle models is

consistent with low frequency evidence.

      We argued in Section V that Deaton's notion of the saving of the

typical consumer as a buffer stock to smooth consuuptiofl over short

                                                               income was

 consistent with both the evidence usually cited in favor of life-cycle

 permanent income theories and our low frequency evidence. We argued

 further, however, that although the buffer stock model may describe the

 typical consumer well, it may not accurately describe the       typical saver

 because saving and wealth are extremely unequally distributed.        Further

 research is needed to determine how the behavior of the typical consumer

 differs from the behavior of the typical saver.

      Even though it may not apply to all consumers, we are attracted to
                                 — 33 —



the buffer stock model for several reasons.   It provides a natural

explanation for the correlation between saving and income growth both

across countries and across occupational groups. If consumers desire to

hold a cash reserve equal to a certain number of months of income, they

will have higher saving rates the more rapid is their income growth.

     This notion raises a number of interesting possibilities for the

growth process. If, as recent studies have argued, steady growth rates are

increasing functions of saving rates, and if as we have just suggested

saving rates are positive functions of growth rates, there is a clear

possibility of multiple equilibria. This idea might be relevant to the

experience of nations like Taiwan and Korea where actual and expected

growth rates have increased sharply and at the same time that saving rates

have soared.

     The buffer stock model, if correct, also has implications for certain

tax policy issues. In the United States there has been considerable

controversy about the efficacy of IRAs and other savings vehicles. Critics

allege that individuals transfer money from one account to another to

realize tax benefits without doing any incremental saving. To the extent

that, because of its illiquidity, IRA saving is not a substitute for buffer

stock saving, it may be incremental even for households which have liquid

assets.

     Our future research in this area will proceed in two directions.

First we need to refine our knowledge about the behavioral differences

between the typical consumer and the typical saver. Second, we will try to

develop models that can explain the differences between typical consumers

and typical savers, and models that are consistent both with the high

frequency evidence that some consumption smoothing exists and the low

a single unified model may be desirable as an eventual goal, it may turn

out to be more fruitful in the meantime to pursue separate models to

explain the consumption/income parallel and the consumption/saving

divergence. We hope that this multifaceted approach will eventually

International   Cross-Section Data on Income and Consumption

  Gathering the data for Figure 4b sent us far and wide. For Japan we

used the profiles given in Ando and Kennickell, p. 194, specifically the

data on mean CONSM in the working families. For Canada we used data

taken from the Statistics Canada publication Family Expenditure in

Canada, kindly provided to us by Harry Champion of Statistics Canada

prior to publication. For 'Iorway we used unpublished data from

government consumer surveys, graciously provided by Knut Morck. For

Denmark we used data from the Statistisk Arbog 1988 (Statistical

Yearbook), p. 171. Data for Great Britain were taken from Browning,

Deaton, and Irish (1985), p. 5O3.

   To generate Figure 6 we used the above—described cross-section age-

consumption data from all our countries, cohort population data from the

U.N. publication Global Estimates and Projections of Population by Sex

and Age,and real personal consumption data from the DRI OECD databases

mentioned above, We imputed family consumption by age of head of

household by assuming that that the relative magnitudes of consumption

of typical families at different ages did not change over time (see

equation 2 and the description of the calculations in the text)

U.S. Cross—Section Data on Income and Consumption

   All the micro data for the U.S. presented in figures 5a, 7, 8, and 12

were calculated from the Consumer Expenditure Survey tapes of the BLS

for the 1960—61, the 1972—73, and the 1985 and 1986 surveys. These

surveys attempt to construct a complete balance sheet for the households

surveyed over a one year period, including information on changes in

assets and liabilities which should balance the difference between

                                        definitions of variables have
income and consumption. Fortunately the
not changed much between the surveys so we are able to calculate income

and consumption measures that should correspond over time. The 1960
                                   the later surveys in at least two
survey, however, differed from

respects. First, each household was interviewed only once, at the end
                                     recall income and expenditures for the
of the survey year, and asked to

preceding year. In the later surveys each household was interviewed

quarterly for five quarters in a row and asked about consumption over

the preceding three months. Second, in the 1960 survey the interviewers

made a greater effort tO ensure that the family balance sheets actuaiiy

balanced, $0 that if income exceeded consumption by $1000 the

 interviewer tried to make sure that net assets rose by $1000. There was

 less emphasis on such balance in the later surveys.

summaries of the 1972—3 CES, however, we were able to calculate the
average income of the bottomcoded individuals as $973.18 and the average

income of the topcoded consumers as $54,942. The disposable income

figures were $897.14 and $44,057 respectively. For consumers whose

income was top or bottom-coded we assumed that their income was equal to

the average income of their group. A final adjustment to the 1972 and

1985 samples was necessary because a small fraction of the people did

not provide complete information about income; these were excluded from

the sample altogether.

   The basic patterns presented here were robust to the few reasonable

variations in calculation technique we could think of, which consisted

of excluding people from   the   sample for various plausible reasons and of

considering different definitions of consumption and income (e.g.

nondurables consumption, pre-tax income, wage income, etc) .     Detailed
charts for 1985 analogous to those from 1960—1 and 1972—3 were not

presented for two reasons. First, the 1985 data seemed to have much

higher variability. This is partly due to a smaller sample size (about

half as large) and partly (we think) due to a new processing methodology

devised by the BLS. Second, the occupational group classifications in

the 1980s—series CES's are much less detailed, and occupations within

each group seem less similar, than is the case with the 1960—61 and

1972—73 surveys.

Liquidity   Constraints Tax Panel Data
   The liquidity constraints tax panel is a random sample (based on

primary taxpayer's Social Security number) of tax returns. It includes

 single and joint returns, but women drop from the sample when they marry

 and return when they divorce or widow. The sample was maintained for
                                             — 39   —




1979 to 1984. Of the total set of tax returns in the data set, there

were   5997 taxpayers with positive adjusted               gross income in all six

years. This is the sample we used in preparing Tables 3 and 4. The

calculations for the tables were performed by Daniel Feenberg of the

N.B.E.R.

    The procedure      for estimating liquid assets from capital income was

simple. To estimate the market value of the stock portfolio we took

dividend income and divided by the dividend/price ratio on the stock

market as a whole for the appropriate year. To estimate the dollar

value of interest-bearing assets we divided by the average interest rate

on interest—bearing assets and cash. The latter was estimated by taking

total personal interest earnings from the NIPA and dividing by the sum

of cash and interest—bearing assets taken from the Federal Reserve

Board's Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy. The latter figure yields

interest rates in the 8-10% range, probably much higher than the actual

interest rate on the typical dollar of interest—bearing assets and cash.

Overestimating the interest rate should cause us to underestimate

associated wealth, however, so whatever error exists here biases our

 results against finding the extreme inequality in wealth that we do in

 fact find. A more better interest rate measur should only intensify our

 findings about inequality.

     The rates used in these calculations are given below. The

 dividend/price ratios were taken from the Dow Jones-Irwin Business and

 Investment Almanac,         1986.

  A brief word about the interpretation of the numbers in Table 3 is in

order. Consider, for example, the part of the table concerning AGI for

everyone excluding the elderly. We claim that the median AGI weighted

by AGI is $38,537. What this means is that if we were to sort all

taxpayers by AGI and then to find the taxpayer such that the sum of the

AGIs of the taxpayers with less AGI than his equals the sum of the

AGI's of the taxpayers with more AGI than his, that taxpayer has an AGI

of $38,537. This is what we mean when we say that the median dollar of

AGI goes to a taxpayer with AGI $38,537. The meaning of the mean dollar

of AGI weighted by is less intuitive, but can be understood by analogy

with calculation of mean tax rates. Suppose we knew income and total

taxes paid by a set of individuals, and we wanted to calculate the

average tax rate on all the dollars of income in the group. Simply

taking the average of the tax rates across individuals would be

inappropriate because the tax rate on individuals with high incomes

clearly has more influence on the tax rate on the average dollar of

income than the rate on low-income individuals. The appropriate

procedure is to take a weighted mean of all the tax rates, where the

weights are given by the incomes of the individuals. By analogy, the
                                  — 41 —




appropriate   procedure to find the typical"   dollar   of income in the mean

sense is to take a weighted mean of income where the weights are also

given by income.

Wealth Calculations from Avery and Kennickell

     Avery and Kennickell present tables drawn from the 1983 and 1986

Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, which is virtually the only

reinterview wealth survey containing a large number of high income

families. This survey allows a direct calculation of net saving via a

comparison of each familys net worth in 1983 and 1986. In Table 12 the

authors estimate the fraction of aggregate positive saving between 1983 and

1986 that was done by the members of each 1983 wealth decile. We used this

table to generate a crude approximation to the distribution function for

saving by wealth decile.

      The technique was as follows. The graph of saving by wealth decile

 appeared to be close to exponential, so we assumed that the function

 log(saving) =   f(1983 wealth decile) was exactly linear. Using two points,
 the saving of the first decile and the saving of the      last decile, we

 calculated the slope and the intercept for the line passing through those

 two points. This technique should substantially underestimate the

 inequality of the wealth distribution because research (as well as the
                                                                 that wealth is
 simple graph of log saving against wealth decile) suggests

 even more unequally distributed in the upper income brackets than the log

 assumption suggests. Since the results indicate a high degree of

 inequality in spite of this bias we are confident that our figures do not

 overstate the degree of inequality.

      Given a continuous function for the distribution of saving as a
                                                                         to find
 function of wealth it is a simple matter of numerical integration

the point at which saving below that point equals saving above the point.
This is the point that defines the amount of saving done by what we call iLi

the text the "median" saver. The procedure described above was repeated

using Avery and Kennickell's Table 10 to produce a distribution of wealth

by wealth decile and the resulting function was used to calculate the

estimated wealth of someone at the 94th percentile in the wealth

distribution, the point that the previous function identified as being

associated with the median saver.

These equations were run over using the 15 countries described in the text.
Data for 1960—1985 were used, and dussnies for each year (not reported)
       were included in all regressions.

Equation 1 runs current consumption growth on current income growth
Equation 2 forms an expectation of current income growth using
       the average income growth over the past three years
Equations 3 and 4 form expectations using previous five year
       and previous ten year growth rates

Column 1 gives the coefficient when the RHS variable is
        as just described
Column 2 gives the coefficient using a one year lag
        of the variable just described
