     THE EFFECTS OF MERGERS ON PRICES, COSTS, AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION IN THE
                   THE US. AIR TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY, 197O84


                                           ABSTRACT

       We analyze the effect of mergers on various aspects of airline

performance during the period                1970—84, using        a   panel data set

constructed      by Caves et         al.     Estimates      derived     from a simple

"matched pairs" statistical model indicate that these mergers were

associated with reductions in unit cost.                    The average annual rate

of    unit   cost      growth   of    carriers        undergoing       merger    was   1.1

percentage points lower, during the five—year period centered on
the merger, than that of carriers not involved in merger.                         Almost

all of this cost reduction appears to have been passed on to

consumers.      Part of the cost reduction is attributable to merger-

related declines in the prices of inputs, particularly labor, but

about     two-thirds      of    it    is     due      to   increased     total     factor

productivity.          One source of the productivity improvement is an

increase in capacity utilization (load factor).

I. INTRODUCTION

        In a series of previous papers, Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987,

:989a,     l989b)     analyzed   the    effect   of    ownership     change    on

productivity and related variables (i.e., output and inputs) among
U.S.     manufacturing     establishments     using    the    Census    Bureaus

longitudinal        Research   Database.      They    found   that     the least

efficient plants in an industry are most likely to experience an

ownership change in the future; that ownership change tends to be
followed     by     above-average    improvements     in   productivity;      that

reductions in administrative overhead are an important source of

these productivity improvements; and that the productivity gains

associated with management buyouts are much                larger than those

associated with "gardenvariety" changes in ownership.

        The purpose of this paper is to extend this line of research

on   the consequences of control changes for economic performance by
analyzing the effects of mergers on prices, costs, productivity,
and capacity utilization in the U.S. air transportation industry

during the period 1970-1984.             The rate of merger and takeover

activity in this industry increased sharply in about 1979: there
was apparently only one significant merger involving U.S. airlines

during     the    years   1970-78,     but four mergers       during     1979-81.

Although this increase may partly reflect an acceleration in merger
and takeover activity throughout           the economy at around this time,
it     is probably    largely attributable to the deregulation of the

industry that occurred in the late 1970s.             In any case, these and

subsequent developments have stimulated an intense debate about the
effects and desirability of airline mergers.
                                                                                 2

      In a recent paper, Morrison and Winston (1989)              evaluated the

effect of airline mergers (excluding the Texas Air acquisitions)

during 1986—7 on travelers' welfare, accounting for both price and

non-price effects, using an empirical model              of    air travelers'

preferences.      They noted that      in principle, although mergers         may
reduce consumer welfare by reducing competition and thus increasing

fares, this loss may be offset by a number of traveler benefits
that mergers nay provide.       These include reducing transfer time by

eliminating    connections      that    require   changing     airlines,      and
providing a larger network and consolidated frequent flier mileage.

They concluded from their empirical analysis that these mergers had
mixed effects on travelers' welfare: half reduced it, and (provided

that untaxed frequent flier mileage continues to be provided) half

improved it.      In the aggregate, though, the mergers had a modest

positive    impact on   travelers' welfare:        the welfare         gain   from
increased    frequent   flier    mileage    and   cities      served    slightly
exceeded the welfare     loss from increased fares.1              Morrison and

Winston provided evidence concerning the effects of recent mergers

on   travelers'   welfare, but they acknowledged           that    research is
needed to determine      whether       airline mergers     enhance     operating
efficiency.


       Morrison and Winston observe that their failure to account
for changes in choice probabilities and for mode or destination
shifts in response to mergers causes them to underestimate the net
benefits of mergers. on the other hand, they argue that 'mergers
have largely foreclosed any opportunity to integrate the air
transportation   system   more   effectively,   thus   undermining
deregulation's long—run performance" (1989, p. 69). This effect,
since unmeasured, would cause net benefits to be overstated.
                                                                                3

       In the next section we describe the database for our analysis,

and its limitations.         The econometric methodology for determining

the effects       of    mergers   on airline performance     is    outlined    in

Section III.       Empirical results are presented and interpreted in
Section IV, and conclusions are reported in Section V.



II. DATA

       The database for this investigation was developed by Caves,
Christensen,       Tretheway, and Windle      and has been analyzed and

described by them in a number of earlier papers (1981, 1984, 1987)

It    includes   annual observations on 25 U.S. trunk and local service

airlines for 1970—84, and on 10 (start—up) airlines for 1982—84.

The   underlying source      of the data is the Civil Aeronautics Board's

Form 41 report filed annually by each air carrier.

        For each       observation   the database reports      the value      and

quantity    of    output    and of    five inputs2:   labor,      fuel,   flight

equipment, ground property and equipment, and all other inputs

(labelled "materials"). Output and some of the inputs are actually
multilateral       indices of a      number of components.        Output is     a

multilateral index of revenue passenger—miles (RPM) of scheduled

service, RPM of charter service, revenue ton—miles (RTM) of mail,

and RTM of all other freight.            Because, as Morrison and Winston

(1989)    have shown, travelers value attributes such as travel and

transfer time and schedule delay, this producer output index is                 a



     2
       The value of output is total revenue, and the value of each
input is its cost.
                                                                           4

very imperfect index of true input in travelers' utility functions.
However errors in measuring the "quality" of output pose a problem

for   determining the effects of mergers only to the extent that

changes in these errors are correlated with mergers.          Morrison and

Winston found that frequent flier mileage was the only component

of output quality significantly affected by merger.         But apparently

frequent—flier miles flown by passengers are generally included in
the RPM data reported by airlines.3 Therefore our output quantity

and price indexes capture, or "adjust         for", this aspect of output

quality.      Also, frequent-flier programs were much less important

during our sample period than they were in the more recent period
examined by Morrison and Winston.

      Labor    is   an   index of   15   categories of   employees,   flight

equipment is an index of nine aircraft categories, and materials
is an index of 7 categories of materials input.             The output and

input quantity indices are all normalized so that their values

equal 1.0 for Delta Airlines in 1977.
      In addition to these variables, the database includes three

characteristics of airline operations: the number of points served,

load factor (the ratio of seat miles sold to seat miles actually




         Although carriers are not specifically instructed or
required to include frequent-flier miles in RPM in their financial
reports, they generally do so,        according to Clay Moritz,
Supervisory    Systems    Accountant   in    the   Department    of
Transportation's   Office   of Aviation    Information   Management
(telephone conversation with author, 11/15/89).       The issue of
accounting for frequent—flier awards has been considered during the
last few years by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and by the Air Transport Association.
                                                                              5


flown)   ,
             and average stage length (the average distance between
takeoffs and landings).         Caves et al (1984) have demonstrated that

these characteristics are important determinants of the cost of

providing airline services. We calculated the number of seat miles
flown (FLOWN) by dividing the output index by the load factor.

      Our objective        is   to   compare   the performance    of   carriers

involved in a merger with that of other carriers in the years both

before       and after the merger occurred, and to           calculate      the

difference between the before and after comparisons.             The following

five mergers occurred during our sample period:

      YEAR           MERGER

         1972        Northeast merged with Delta

         1979        North Central and Southern merged to form Republic

         1980        National merged with Pan American
         1980        Air West merged with Republic
         1981        Texas International merged with Continental

A key feature of our approach           is to add together the values and

quantities of output and inputs of two airlines for the years prior

to   their      merger.   This will enable us to contrast the relative

efficiency of a given bundle of resources under divided ownership
and control to its relative efficiency under common ownership.              The

unit cost or totai factor productivity (TFP) of the premerger firm

aggregates are essentially weighted averages of the unit costs or
TFP of the two component carriers, with weights proportional to the

relative sizes (total costs) of the latter.

         After adding up the value and quantity data for pre-merger
                                                                                        6

observations,        we    calculated           for all   observations      a number of
additional variables.              We calculated the implicit price of output

(PQ)   and of the five inputs (P1,..,P5) by computing the ratio of
its value to its quantity.                   We calculated the cost share of each

of the five inputs                            by calculating       the ratio of its value
to the sum of the values of all inputs                        We constructed Divisia-

type   indices   of the quantity and price of total input, as follows:

       QI =   exp( E (S        *   In    Q.))

       P1   = exp(    E   (S   *   ln    P)
where QI and P1 are the quantity and price, respectively, of total

input and Q      is   the quantity of input               i   (i   =             We then
constructed      an       index     of       total—factor     productivity,     TFP,   by

computing the ratio of output quantity Q to input quantity QI.
Load factor (LOAD) was defined as the ratio of Q to FLOWN; for the

pre-merger observations, LOAD is equivalent to a weighted average
of the load factors of the               2   airlines, with weights based on their

respective values of "potential output"                        FLOWN.      Average stage
length (LENGTH)       for these observations was defined as a weighted

average of the stage lengths of the two airlines, with weights
based on their respective values of "actual output" Q.

       Unfortunately, although the database constructed by Caves et

j   contains 420 observations, due to the absence of significant

data and to the occurrence of strikes (of greater than 25 days),

they consider only 272               (65 percent)         of the observations      to be

reliable and meaningful.                 We eliminated from the sample the 148

observations identified by then as having bad data.                        Some of these
                                                                                                  7

observations were of airlines about to merge with other airlines.

Therefore      some of      the pre—merger observations                   in    our merger—

sqgregated      data set represent only one of the 2 carriers that

merged.       Including these observations                 in the sample precludes

obtaining meaningful estimates of the effect of mergers on the
levels of values and quantities, such as total cost and output

quantity.       However assuming the data are randomly missing we can

still obtain unbiased estimates of the effects of mergers on ratios

of variables such as prices (ratios of value to quantity)                                ,
                                                                                             unit
cost, TFP,      and     LOAD.     The efficiency          of    our estimates might be

improved       by     giving      less    weight     to        "incomplete"         pre—merger

observations based on only one of the two airlines.4



III. METHODOLOGY



        We   seek     to   measure       the effect       of     mergers       on    a   set of

interrelated airline             performance variables.                 To determine          the

effect on any particular variable X we will estimate an equation

of the form

        ln   X,. =                        M3   +   Ei4     as   M+5 +               ()
where    Xs          the value of the variable for airline                 j    in   year    t;   ir




is   the intercept;             is a "fixed effect" for year t;            Mjr is a dummy
variable equal to one if airline               j   merged       in year   t—r (r=l,...,4),



      When incomplete pre—merger observations were eliminated from
the sample, the estimation results were qualitatively similar but
weaker than when they were included.
                                                                                                    8
and otherwise equal to zero;                                 is sinilarly defined; and         is   a
disturbance tern.                     (We will also generalize the model           by replacing
the intercept               ir    with         a    set of airline fixed effects      .)       The
coefficient             r    measures the logarithmic difference in the mean
values of X in t-r between airlines that did and did not merge in

year t.         Although we will allow for separate coefficients for each
of   the four years before and after merger, due to the fairly small

sample (N=243)               and the relative infrequency of mergers, we do not

expect      to     be        able          to       obtain   very   precise   estimates   of   the
individual         fi       and       o   parameters.         We will focus instead on the

average values of the "before" and "after" coefficients, and on the
difference between the two:
           e            +             /3   +

       a        (o, + 03          +   0    +       04)/4


The parameter                     indicates            how the merger    or   "treatment" group

compared with the non—merger or "control" group in the four years

prior to merger, and a indicates how they compared in the four

post—merger years.                        To obtain consistent and efficient estimates
of the effect of the merger treatment, we will include airline

effects     ir.,    In      the presence of such airline effects, the estimates

of   ,     a,    and r are based entirely on the within-airline sample

moments,        Including the                        is equivalent to using a "matched pairs"

experimental design, which as Womnacott and Wonnacott (1972, 172-

3)   mote is desirable on efficiency grounds.

      Of the variables we shall examine, the one most closely
                                                                                  9

related to consumer welfare is the implicit price of airline
services PQ, defined as the ratio of total revenue (TR) to the
output quantity index (Q):
            —
       PQ       TR/Q
PQ   can also be represented as the product of the price—cost margin
(MARGIN)--the ratio of TR to total cost             (TC) —-and of   unit cost   UC,
the ratio of TC to Q:
       PQ   —
                (TR/TC) * (TC/Q)   —   MARGIN   *
rite growth     rate of the output price is therefore the sum of the
growth      rates of the price-cost margin and of unit cost:
     pg — margin + uc
where lower case symbols denote growth rates of the corresponding
variables. The effect of mergers on the output price, measured by
                   r
the parameter based on eq. (1) with X defined as PQ, is therefore
the      of the effects of mergers on MARGIN and UC. One might
conjecture that mergers increase firms' market power, thus raising
MARGIN, but that they also reduce unit costa.    In this case the
effect of mergers on output price is indeterminate, a nriori, and
must be determined empirically.
     There are two distinct ways—-one external, the other internal,
to the firms involved--in which mergers could affect, and might be
expected to redu e, unit costs. The first is by influencing the
prices paid by the producer for inputs. There may be economies of
 scale in the supply of some of the firm's inputs. Also, the firm's
'nonopsony power (as well as its monopoly power) may be increased
 by merger, thus lowering the prices of factors of prodt.ction.
                                                                               10

        Second, merger may increase totaltactor productivity, the
technical efficiency with which resources are deployed.                As noted

above, Caves    etal   have documented that two features of airline

network    operations-the load factor and average stage length-
affect    output per unit of        total input.      Merging       two airline
networks might constitute a means to increase the rate of capacity

utilization     (load factor)   ,   and more generally,     to      reconfigure
operations    in a more efficient manner.          Figure 1 summarizes the
potential channels we     shall investigate via which               mergers   may
affect the price of airline services.



IV, EMPIRICAL RESULTS



        Estimates of the parameters      ,   a, and    F   corresponding to
different definitions of the variable X are presented in Table 1.

We report "total" estimates (excluding fixed firm effects) of                 and

a, and    both total and "within" estimates (including firm effects)
of F.     The estimates on the first line of the table indicate that
the mean output price of airlines involved in mergers                   was 6,0

percent higher than that of airlines not involved in mergers in the
4   years prior to merger, and 5.1 percent lower in the         4   years after
merger.     The pre— to post—merger change in the merger vs. non-

merger difference    is therefore —11 percent.        The total estimates
suggest    that merger is associated with a movement                from above—

significance.        However when we include fixed firm effects in the

model, thereby utilizing a "matched pairs" design, the estimate of
F is significant at the 5 percent level,                despite the fact that the

point estimate declines by more than half.                      The increase in the
price of output of airlines involved in merger is 5 percentag

points      lower,    from      before   to     after     the    merger,    than    cb
corresponding        increase of     non—merger airlines during             tne
calendar period.         The pre— and post'merger periods are centere'              :o
and a half years before and after the merger, so this is equivalent

to about     a    one percentage point lower average annual rate of

growth.          Since    the    provision      of      frequent-flier      riles   is

incorporated in our output price index, this result is consistent
with     Morrison     and    Winston's        finding     that    mergers    increase
travelers' welfare, when frequent—flier              nuleqe      is accounted for.

       Asdiscussed above, in principle a change in the relative
price of output could be due to a change io the price—cost margin,
a change in unit costs, or both. The second line of the table
indicates that merger is associated with a very small increase in
MARGIN, from slightly below-average to slightly above-average, but
the change in MARGIN is far from signiflcant in both the tota and
within moods. The reduction in the relative price of output iS

more than completely "explained" by the reduction in unit costs.
Airlines involved in merger had          6l
                                    percent higher unit costs prior
to merger, and 5.4 percent lower unit costs post—merger, than non—
merger airlines in trie same calendar year. As in the case of PQ,
the total estimates of the parameters                ,
                                            a, and F are not very

significant    (although highly suggestive), but the within estimate
of F is significant.       It implies that the average annual rate of

unit cost growth      of   carriers    undergoing merger         is   about   1.1

percentage points lower, during the five—year period centered on
t:ne   merger, than that of carriers not involved in merger.
        Wa now proceed to a decomposition of the effect of merger on

unit    costs into its two components, the effect on TFP and                  the
effect    on input prices.        Parameter estimates for the dependent

variable In TSP are reported in line         4   of the table.   The estimates

ejolines   Involved in mergers had oelow-average         productvty mefore,
and above—average productivity after, the merger.                 The findings

that $ < 0 and that F >     0   are very consistent with Lichtenberg and

Siegel's    (1987)   results concerning productivity and changes               in

ownership of marufacturing plants.       They found that plants changing
ovnars                   levels of TSP prior to changing owners,
          had below—average
and above—average TFP growth rates subsequent to the ownership
change. Their estimates of the difference in TSP growth rates were
highly statistically significant, whereas our within estimate of
F is signifioent at only about the 9 percent level, using a one-

tailed tcao, However their estimates were based on a panel of
about  20,000 manufacturing establishments, while our sample
includes only about 30 airlines. Our point estimate of F (040)
is ouoh larger than (about 8 tines) their point estimate of the
effect of ownership change on manufacturing plant productivity.
It is very similar, however, to Lichtenberg and Siegel's (1989b)
                                                                                    13

estimates       of   the effects     of     leveraged     buyouts   and management

buyouts on the five-year (1981-86)                 productivity grawth rates of

manufacturing establishments: .028 and .039, respectively.
     The lion's share          of merger—related unit cost reductions thus

appear     to   be    due to    increased prodactivity.             How   are these

productivity         improvements    achieved?          Two   determinants    of    a".

variables.       Carriers involved in mergers had significantly belLow—

average load factors prior to merging; post—merger,                       their load
factors were no longer below average.                The wIthin estimate of the

change in LOAD         is   4.1 percent, and is significant.                 rhus an
increase in the rate of capacity             tlization        is one source of the

productivity improvement associated with mer-rs.
     The estimates of the effect of merger on average stage length
are more ambiguous.          The total estimates suggest that merger                is

associated with a 20        percent increase       in stage length, from avermge

to above-average values of LENGTH. implyIng that incrmased stcg-

length is another source of productivity gain.                 The within estimate
implies that stage length declines slightly in connection                       wIll'

mergers.         Neither    the     total    nor    the   within    estimates      era

significant, however.
     As we argued in the previous section, declines in anit coat

may result from input price reductions              as well as from productivity

increases.       Input prices are the last set of variables whose                  co
movements with merger events we analyze.                  The last five lines of

curiog the sane period. Because foe labor measure is an index of
     categories of employees, two different factors nay be
ccntributing to the lover average wage growth of merger—involved
airlines. First, mergers may be associated with lower growth in
wages within employee categories.             Second, they nay be associated

with reductions       in   the employment shares           of   high-wage workers.

Lichlinberg and Siegel (1989a, 158Th) found that reductions in the

irployment     shares      of   high—wage     workers       (both   central-office

personnel    and monproduction workers            in production establishments)
tend to orcur in connection with takeovers and leveraged buyouts
of manufacturing firms; it is plausible that these also occut in
connection with airline mergers. They also found that control

changes have no effect or a small positive effect on the wage rates
of production workers, but a large negative effect on the wage

rates of white—collar employees.

        Surveying the remainder of the input price estimates, the only
other     input price for which the within estimate of r is                     even

marginally          significant    is    the price of flight equipment.          The
estimate       implies that mergers          are associated       with   33    mont
reductions in the average price of flight equipment over a                      fva

V. CONCLUSIONS



        Ifl   this paper we have anaiized the              efect of mergers on
various aspects of airline performance during the period 157G-84.

using a panel data set constructed by Caves and his associates.
Previous papers have examined the impact of airline mergers on

fares and other determinants of traveler welfare, but we are not

aware of any previous evidence on their impact on airline operating

efficiency.
     Our           estimates,    derived     from    a   simple   "matched    pairs'
statistical model, indicate that these mergers were associated                 th
reductions in unit cost.                The average anrual rate of         nit cst
growth        of     carriers    undergoing    merger      was    (a   statistically

significant)          1.1   percentage points lower,        during the five-year

period centered on the merger, than that of carriers not involved
in merger.          Almost all    (86   percent)   of this cost reduction appears
                                                                             16

tc   have been passed on to consumers: the annual growth rate of

total revenue per unit of output was 1.0 percentage points lower

during this period for carriers involved in merger.                This result

appears to be consistent with Morrison and Winston's finding that

(more recent) airline mergers have modestly increased traveler

welfare, when frequent—flier benefits are accounted for,                 as we

believe   hem   to be in our estimates.

      part of the reduction in unit costs is attributable to merger—

related declines in input prices, particularly the price of labor:

the five—year growth in the average wage rate               is   significantly

lover among firms involved in mergers during those years than it
is among firms not involved. But an increase in total factor
productivity appears to be responsible for about two-thirds of the
unit cost reduction. The level of productivity of carriers
involved in merger was below—average prior to merger and above—
average subsequent to merger. These findings are consistent with,
albeit far less statistically significant than, Lichtenherg and
Siegel's     estimates   concerning     the    effects    of     takeovers   and

leveraged     buyouts on manufacturing         plant productivity.           Our

estimates    also suggest that increased capacity utilization (load

factor) contributes to    the productivity improvement associated with

cergers.
       Our   findings are consistent with the hypotheses that the
mergers      that   occurred   during    our    sample     period     increased

productivity and capacity utilization, and that they reduced unit

costs, average revenue, and the average wage.            Of course, one would
                                                                           17

not expect our parameter estimates to be unbiased estimates of the

effects of all proposed mergers.           As documented by Morrison and

Winston, 5 out of the    9   mergers proposed during the years 1979-82
were either rejected by the Civil Aeronautics Board (one proposed

merger), or not consummated      (4   proposed mergers).     Presumably the

efficiency gains and price reductions that would have resulted           frc
these mergers would have been smaller in magnitude than (rerhaps

even opposite   in   sign    from)    the corresponding effects     of    the

mergers that were completed.          It   is also   not clear whether   U.S.

airline mergers since 1984       (of which there       have been many), or

mergers in other countries, have had effects similar to those we
have estimated.      Further research is required to address these

issues.
