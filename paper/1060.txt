                MEASURING THE AVERAGE MARGINAL TAX RATE
                     FROM THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX




                               Abstract


    The economic effects of taxation depend on the configuration of marginal

tax rates. We consider here the appropriate measure of a marginal tax rate

for the federal individual income tax, which has a graduated—rate structure

and allows   for numerous legal and   illegal deductions from total income •       Our

conclusion is that the explicit marginal rate from       the tax schedule     is the

right concept for many purposes.      Hence, we construct approximately weighted
averages   of these marginal tax rates for 1916—80. When weighted by adjusted

gross income, the arithmetic average of marginal tax rates is 5% in 1920, 2%

in 1930, 6% in 1940, 20% in 1950, 23% in 1960, 24% in 1970, and 30% in 1980.

We also discuss the dispersion of marginal tax rates, as well as the behavior

of average tax rates and deductions from taxable income. One noteworthy result

concerns the fraction of adjusted gross income that accrues to families that

face a marginal tax rate of at least 35%. This fraction quadruples from 1964

to 1980.

       In order to assess the economic effects of taxation, we have to know the

applicable marginal tax rates for individuals or businesses. For example,

marginal tax rates on income affect decisions to work, produce, save and in-

vest. However, the readily available data refer to totals of tax collections

in various categories, such as individual income taxes, corporate profits

taxes,    and so on.   From   these   figures,   we can construct   measures of average

tax rates. But, especially in the          case of the graduated—rate federal indivi-
dual income tax, these measures do not tell us directly the fraction of            income

that the "representative" person gets to keep at the margin. Therefore, average
tax rates may not provide an adequate basis for determining the allocative
effects    of taxation.

     There have been some attempts—notably, Joines (1981) and Seater (1982)—.-

to use more detailed data to compute average marginal tax rates. Basically,,

for the federal individual income tax, they look across classes of adjusted

gross   income from the IRS data to see how taxes        paid per return vary with in-

come per   return. They then use the ratio of the change in taxes per return
to the change in income per return to calculate marginal tax            rates. Generally—

as Joines and Seater argue is appropriate——this concept of a marginal tax rate
is substantially smaller than the explicit rate from the tax schedule. But,
as we discuss later, there are problems in interpreting their concept of a
marginal tax rate in terms of the underlying substitution effects on individuals'

choices. In fact,      we argue that    the   explicit rate from the schedule is the
right   concept for many purposes)

     In the present paper we focus on the federal individual income tax. This

category is interesting for several reasons. First, it is large——467. of federal
                                            —2—



and 30% of total   government revenues    in 1980. Second, the appropriate dis—

aggregated data are available. Third, because of the graduated—rate structure,

the differences between marginal and average tax rates are likely to be im-

portant. However, a full measure of marginal tax rates would incorporate other

levies, some of which are based on property or expenditures, rather than on

income. We do plan to include soon the social security tax,2 which constitutes

26% of federal and 17% of total government revenues in 1980. We may also con-

sider other types of taxes, but even the full array of these would not be

sufficient. That's because a full concept of a marginal tax rate encompasses

also the transfers that people lose when they earn additional income. Thus

far, we have no plans to tackle this issue.



Theoretical Considerations

    We set up a simple model to deal with the following question. What is

the appropriate concept of a marginal tax rate in the context of an income

tax that first, has a graduated—rate structure, and second, that allows for

numerous legal and illegal   deductions   in the calculation of taxable income?3

In particular, what is the relation among the following:

      • the various substitution effects on people's choices,

      • the explicit tax rates from the tax schedule,

      • the marginal association between taxes and total income (which is

    the Joines—Seater concept of a marginal tax rate), and

      • the average tax rates?

    Consider a family that receives market income, Y. This income comes partly

from working the amount L at the wage w, and partly from non—labor income, I.

Hence, total market income is

      Taxes depend on taxable income, T — Y —                     D   ,   where   D is a broad con-

cept of deductions. This concept includes explicit deductions from the tax.

taxes, interest, etc.), plus personal exemptions, plus unreported income,

plus any excess allowances for business and moving expenses, plus the pre—

ferentia]. treatment of deferred income and (real) capital gains, and so on.

      The relation of taxes to taxable income comes from the law, which specifies

the tax function,


      (2)                                       T=T(YT)

where we assume that the marginal tax rate from the schedule, T' ,                         Is   non-

negative and non—decreasing——that is, T' > 0                       and T" > 0       (a "progressive"

tax). We assume also                   that T =   0    for T <
      We    suppose that deductions——in our broad sense——depend first, on the re-
sources, X that people devote to generating deductions, and second,
                      ,                                                                         on the

quantity of a family's consumption that the tax law treats favorably.                           In the

U.S. this category,.which we label as C2, Includes owner—occupied housing,

charity, various activities of state and local governments, etc.

      We write the function for deductions in the form,


                (3)                         D   f(X) + c&C2


The first part of the function, f(X) ,                      satisfies the properties, f' >      0

f" < 0      ,   and       f(0) >   0   .   In other words, more   resources spent on tax—avoidance,

  ,   generate more deductions, but at a decreasing rate.5 Then, for someone
                                               —4—



who expends no effort, the quantity of deductions generated here is the

positive amount, f(0) .             We   can also think of the function, f(X) , as

incorporating the goods—equivalent of any penalties for tax—cheating, as

well as the probability of being caught. Finally, we note that for some

occupations, such as the self—employed, the ease of concealing income and

taking excessive business expenses implies that deductions, f(X) ,                    are
large for a small amount of effort.

       The second term in equation (3), aC2, describes the effects of favored

consumption. We treat a as a positive fraction, since——except for some

limitations on the amounts of charitable contributions——there do not seem

to be important sources of diminishing effects of favored consumption on

deductions. (Business expenses could be entered explicitly as another source

of deductions in       equation    (3)—see footnote 7          below.)
       For   some of our results, it matters that income——either total or taxable——
not appear in the function that generates deductions, f(X). One way income
might   enter is through the standard deduction, which depends on adjusted gross

income in some years. But, this provision turns out to be quantitatively un-

important for most purposes, because the standard deduction varies with in-

come   only over a limited range at the low end of incomes. For example, for
1944—63, the standard deduction is 10%               of   adjusted gross income,   but only

until   the deduction reaches         $1,000. (Currently, the standard deduction does

not depend on income.). In any case, we neglect these features of the standard

deduction in our analysis.

    Another possibility is that the IRS's examination effort varies with a

family's adjusted gross income, as well, as with the claimed amounts of deduc-

tions. (It might depend also on occupation and other characteristics.) Then,
                                         —5—



 depending on the IRS's procedure, someone with more adjusted gross income

 would find it either easier or harder to generate a given amount of deductions.

 That is, some measure of income would appear in our function, f(X)          .   In
 fact, our subsequent analysis can be used to design an optimal pattern of

 enforcement by the IRS, which would include a possible dependence of the

 IRS's effort on someone's income. Although it would be interesting to ex-

plore this idea, we have not yet done so..

         Finally, income might matter because of some limitations on    categories
of itemized deductions. For contributions, more Income means more potential

deductions. However, for medical expenses and now for casualty losses, an

increase in income means that less deductions can be claimed. Also, there

are limitations on the amounts of interest expense that relate to"investment

purposes." Here, an increase in someone's income from capital can increase

these allowable deductions. Miller and Scholes (1978) stress this point.

         In any case, our present analysis does not incorporate any direct effects

of income in the function that generates deductions. Later on, we note the

consequences of inchtding Income in this function.

         Total   income goes either to ordinary consumption, C1 , favored   consumption,
c2   ,   taxes,    T ,   or tax avoidance, X • For   expository purposes, we do not

consider any saving. Hence, the family's budget constraint is6


             (4)                 YI.1C1+C2+T+X

     The family's utility depends positively on the two types of consumption and

negatively on market work, L •         That   is,


             (5)                 U U(c1, C2, L)
                                     -6-


where the partial derivatives are U1, U2>O and U3<O. Families maximize

utility, subject to the budget constraint from equation (4), the definition

of total market income from equation (1), and the determination of taxes from

equations (2) and (3). The resulting first-order conditions can be written

as follows


          (6).       f'=l/T',


          (7)    -   auia    =   w(l-T')
                     au/sc



          (8)    -   U/L     =   w(l-T')/(l-aT')
                     auic2

     Equation (6) determines the amount of resources, X, that people put into

tax avoidance. At the margin, the gain from applying an extra unit of

resources is the extra deductions, f', multiplied by the marginal tax rate

from the schedule, T'. Hence, people go to the point where the marginal

gain, f'T', equals the marginal cost, 1. It follows that people with a

higher marginal tax rate, V--which will typically be those with higher total

incomes--go to a lower value of f'. Correspondingly, they spend more

resources, X, on avoidance, and end up with more deductions, D.

     Equation (7) says that the utility rate of substitution between ordin-

ary consumption, C1, and "leisure" equals the after-tax wage rate, where the

adjustment for taxes uses the marginal rate from the tax schedule, T'.

Therefore, although people use resources and favored consumption to reduce

their taxes, it is still the explicit marginal tax rate from the schedule

that affects the allocation between ordinary consumption and leisure. That's

because, at the margin, people have the option to work an extra unit, earn

won this amount, retain w(l-T') as additional disposable income (since X

and C2 do not shift at this margin), and spend the funds on cl.8
                                                    —7.-




            On the other hand, when choosing favored consumption, C2, households

     consider the marginal effect, a, on deductions. Therefore, in equation (8),

     the utility rate of substitution between favored consumption and leisure

     equals a different measure of the after-tax wage. The pertinent marginal tax

     rate here is T'(l-a)/(l-aT'), which is below T'since O<ct<l. applies. (Viewed

     alternatively, the utility rate of substitution between C' and C2 equals

     1-aT', because of the preferential tax treatment for C2.)



     Average Tax Rates and Deductions

            For some purposes, we would like to know how taxes vary cross-sectionally

     with total income, Y. We can think of the variations in Y as generated from

     underlying differences in either non-labor income, I, or in the wage rate, w.

     Then, we have


            (9)   dT/dY =    T'(l     -   dD/dY) =       T'(l   -   f'•dX/dY   -   a.dC2/dY)
                           = T'(l     -   ct.dC2/dY) .-dX/dY..


     Therefore, the marginal relation of taxes to income, dT/dY ,                              is   below the explicit

     marginal tax rate, T', because of the positive relation between income and

     deductions, dD/dY. This last term is positive because first, more income

     means more effort spent at tax avoidance--that is, dX/dY>O--and second,

     more income means more favored consumption--that is, dC2/dY>O. We also

V'   find   that 0 <   dD/dY <   1 and hence, that 0 <      dT/dY < T'.        (All of these results

     follow unambiguously as long as 0 < dC2/dY < 1                       holds.) Finally, we get

     the last expression in equation (9) by substituting the condition, f'                                 l/T' ,

     from equation (6).

            Consider how the average tax rate, T/Y , changes with total income, Y

     Since taxes are zero until total income reaches some positive amount (because
                                         -8-


some deductions accrue with zero effort), and since the marginal tax rate, T' ,

rises   with taxable income, the average tax rate tends also to increase with

total income. In order for this possibly not to hold throughout, we need a

range of income where the term, dT/dY ,         declines with Y . But,     it's clear

from equation (9) that this cannot       happen if the marginal relation of deductions
to income, dD/dY ,     is   a positive constant. Rather, we need a range of strong

positive effects of income on dD/dY , so that the ratio of deductions to income,

D/Y , can   increase with income over some interval. But, the diminishing returns
to tax avoidance——that is, f" < 0—works against this. If we neglect the role
of favored consumption, C2 ,      and look     only at the..response of the effort for
tax—avoidance, X , then we tend to get a diminishing effect of income on dD/dY.9
Hence, dT/dY——and, moreover, the average tax rate, T/Y——tend to increase with
total income, Y
      There seem to be two main possibilities for reversing this result • First,
there may be ranges where set—up costs for tax avoidance are important, so
that the concavity of the f—function does not hold throughout. Then, there may
be   regions where D/Y rises with income, so that T/Y may decline.             Second,

the   response   of deductions, dD/dY , depends also on how        favored consumption,
c2 , reacts   to higher income.    If   the favored items   are   luxury goods or if the

demand for these goods becomes increasingly responsive (positively) to higher

marginal tax rates, then the term, dD/dY , may rise with total income. Then,

the response of taxes, dT/dY ,      conceivably    would decline over some range (see

footnote 10, above).

      Overall, it is not easy theoretically to generate positive effects of total

income on dD/dY .       (Empirically,   if we measure Y by adjusted gross income,

then dD/dY appears to be roughly constant as income varies cross—sectionally——

see below.) Hence, the term, dT/dY—and, moreover, the average tax rate, T/Y——

are likely to rise with total income.
                                           —9—



         We focus empirically on measuring the marginal tax rate from the tax
schedule, T' .        This     rate governs the substitution between ordinary goods,

C1   ,   and work.   But, as mentioned before, some others—for example, Joines

(1981) and Seater (1982)——attempt to calculate the expression, dT/dY

(Empirically, they measure Y by adjusted gross income, rather than by total

income, which is unobservable.) Therefore, this alternative procedure includes

the response of deductions, dD/dY ,          in   the measure of a "marginal tax rate."

Clearly, this expression understates the marginal tax rate, T' , which applies

to the substitution between ordinary goods and work. But, we may also be in-

terested in the lower marginal tax rate, T'(l —           cz)/(l — aT')   ,   which    applies

to the margin between favored goods, C2 , and work. Under a very special con-

dition, the Joines—Seater construct, dT/dY , approximates an appropriate weighted

average of the two marginal tax rates, V and T'(l —              a)/(l    —   ciT').   Basically,

this happens if the effort for tax avoidance is unimportant—in the sense that

dX/dY       0——and if favored consumption is roughly unit elastic in total income.il

(Even here we can get into trouble when we use adjusted gross income as a proxy

for total income.) Generally, we cannot directly use a measure of dT/dY to

represent the underlying substitution effects from taxation.

         Our results, which focus on the rate from the tax schedule, V ,               provide
estimates for one of the interesting marginal tax rates          in the theory. But, at
present,    we have not figured out how to measure the other marginal tax rate,

T'(l —    a)/(1   — aT')   .   Fundamentally, this is because we lack observable measures
for avoidance effort, X ,          favored consumption, C2 , and total income, Y
Conceivably, we will be able to go further here by constructing some useful

proxies. For example, itemized deductions give some information about favored

consumption. Also, the expenditures on accountants may tell us something about

the effort for tax avoidance, X

Weightizg

        Suppose that we know each family's marginal income—tax rate, T ,     at
a particular date. We want to construct an aggregate index——or average mar-

ginal tax rate——T, which can be used to understand some aggregate be-

havior. As is usual, we cannot construct a single index that works satis-

factorily in all contexts. But, there are some interesting special cases,

which suggest that it might be valuable to construct some indices.

        Assume first that the logarithm of each family's total consumption

demand, C , depends linearly on the marginal tax rate, T ——that is,12

                             log(C) =        —
        (10)                            aj       bT

(We can think alternatively of the supply of goods, Y , as depending on

   .)    Now, if everyone's slope coefficient, b , on T in equation (10) is

the same, then we can readily construct a useful measure of average marginal

tax rates. This average is a linear combination of the T with weights equal

to Ct/C , where     C is aggregate consumption——that is,


                               ?' — E(c /C)T'
        (11)
                                    ji i.
Here, the relation of aggregate consumption to the constructed average marginal

tax rate will reveal the coon slope coefficient. Specifically, the propor—

tional response of C to V approximates the underlying coefficient, b .            (The

result turns Out to be approximate because our measures for changes in V pick

up some effects from shifts in weights.) Empirically, we use shares of adjusted

gross income to proxy- for the weights by shares of consumption.

        Alternatively, we might have that each family's consumption exhibits a con-

stant elasticity of response to the fraction of income that they keep at the

margin, (1 —    T)    .    This   amounts to postulating a constant elasticity with

respect to the after—tax wage. Then, the form for consumption is


                                           ÷
         (12)             log(C) =                B.].og(i. —

Now, if the elasticity, B ,          is   the same for all, then the appropriate index

is defined implicitly by


         (13)             log(l —   T')   =
                                              E(C1/) •log(l          —

If we construct the average marginal tax rate from equation (13), then the

mates the co=on elasticity, B .                   Here, the index amounts to a geometric

exceed those found from equation (11). (Because log(l —
                                                                               T)     is a convex

function of      .)       But,   empirically, these two types of indices for average

marginal tax rates do not differ greatly.

     For some purposes——for example, when measuring employment                        or   unemployment—
we count numbers of persons, rather than amounts of consumption or income.

Then, in the formulas from equations (11) or (13), we can think of the weight,

Ct/C , as reflecting the 1th family's share of total workers or persons, rather

than of consumption or income. Hence, we would be more interested in person—

weighted average marginal tax rates, rather than in income—weighted numbers.

Operationally, we can construct indices of average marginal                     tax rates        where the

individual rates are weighted by numbers of returns, rather than by adjusted

gross income. The indices weighted by numbers of returns are typically much

lower than those weighted by adjusted gross income.

An overview     of   the Data

       Our   estimates for' marginal tax rates refer to the federal individual in-
come tax, as     reported for each year for 1916—80 in the Internal       Revenue Service's
Statistics     of Income. Unfortunately, the data are not reported in an entirely

consistent manner over time. (This reflects either progress or shifting tastes.)

Therefore, we combine the sources as follows:

       1961—77, 1979—80: There are tables classified by the highest marginal

tax rates that apply to each return. (For 1980, the tables are           in   Statistics

of Income Bulletin, December 1982.) These tables show the numbers of returns

and the adjusted gross and taxable income that apply in each class. From

these tables we can compute average marginal tax rates, using either shares

of adjusted gross income or shares of numbers of returns as weights. However,

we have to make some approximations in order to take account of the maximum tax

rate on earned income (60% in 1971, 50% for 1972—80). Basically, for those

who pay the maximum tax, we treat their marginal tax rate as 50% (60% in 1971)

for all types of      income.       However, the overall impact of the adjustment for

the maximum tax      is   not too large—for example, In 1979 only    about 4%     of the

aggregate of adjusted gross income applies to returns that use the 50% maximum

rate   on earned income.'3

       1954—60: There are tables classified by ranges of taxable income per

return and by filing status (married/filing jointly, single, etc.). Using the

tax schedule foz each filing status, we can compute          the associated marginal tax
rate.14      However, these tables do not provide information about adjusted gross

income. So, we calculate here only the average marginal tax rates when weighted

by numbers of returns.          -
     1916—43: The tables are classified by net income, which is roughly

taxable income plus exemptions for self, spouse and other dependents. The

tax—rate schedules do not depend on marital status for these years. Within

each class of net income, we make the approximation that everyone has the

same taxable income——that is, we neglect variations in the ratio of exemp-

tions to net income. For the purposes of calculating average marginal tax

rates, this approximation is probably satisfactory. (The true dispersion in

examptions would not be too large and the marginal tax rates would be roughly

linear, within each class, in taxable income.) Then, we can calculate mar-

ginal tax rates for each class of net income. We also have the data to weight

these figures by numbers of returns and by total income, which corresponds

roughly to adjusted gross income plus business expenses of individuals. This

weighting by total income approximates that by adjusted gross income   for   the
            15
later years.

     1944—78: We have tables classified by ranges of adjusted gross income

per return and by filing status. The tables indicate for each class the amounts

of taxable income and tax liabilities. We can compute marginal tax rates if

we assume that each taxpayer in a given class has the same taxable income.

More generally, our averages will be okay if the dispersion of marginal tax

rates within a class is roughly linear in taxable income. In any event, we

use these computations only to fill in the missing years from the other tables.

These are 1944—60 and 1978 for the indices weighted by adjusted gross income,

and 1944—53 and 1978 for those weighted by numbers of returns. We fill in the

missing data based on the relation of the different series over the overlapping

years. The high correlation during the overlap suggests that this procedure is

satisfactory.

Non—Filers and Unreported Income

       The IRS data that we use refer to filed returns and to amounts included

in adjusted gross income. But, conceptually, our theory aflows for gaps between

a family's total income and the reported amount of adjusted gross income. Some of these

differences are legal, such as the exclusion from adjusted gross income of

non—taxable transfer payments, fringe benefits, some contributions to pension

plans, and parts of the income from interest or capital gains. Other exclu-

sions are illegal, reflecting especially the unreported income from the under-

ground economy. However, the various exclusions from adjusted gross income

do not disturb the conclusion that the explicit marginal tax rate from the

schedule is the substitution variable that we wish to measure for each family.

If we could, we would change the weighting pattern from shares of adjusted

gross income to shares of a broader concept of income. But, if each family

filed an income—tax return, we would not want to make an overall adjustment

to account for the gap between the aggregates of adjusted gross and total income.

       On the other hand, the data pick up only filed returns. Hence, we would

like to include the non—filers as families (and incomes) that face a zero mar-

ginal. tax rate. Therefore, we need estimates for each year of the numbers of

families   (and their incomes) who do not file tax returns.
       Over the period from 1950 to 1980, the ratio of numbers of returns      filed

to   the Census Bureau's estimate for the total number of households changes
very   little.16 Specifically, the ratio is 1.22 in 1950 and 1.18      in 1980,   with
a range from 1.14 to     1.24   for the intervening years.   (The ratio can exceed   one
because   some households file. more than one return, and because the census's

definition of a household does not coincide with the IRS's concept of a filing

unit.)    Therefore,   we assume as an approximation that the fraction of families
                                          —15—




 that do not file a return does riot change since l95O,, (Subsequently, we also
 make this assumption     for 1946—49.) However, since we      do not know   the   value
 of   this fraction, we make   no adjustment during     this period to account for

 non—filers. This procedure will be satisfactory if nearly all families file

 a tax return, as is suggested by the high ratio of filed returns to numbers

 of households. But, to the extent that we miss some non—filers, our tax rates

will be too high by roughly a constant proportion.

       According   to some recent research, the size of the underground economy in-
creased dramatically     during the 1970s.       See O'Neill (1982) for a discussion
and criticism of this work. Given this background, it is noteworthy that the

ratio of numbers of returns to numbers of households changes little in recent

years. If there had been a major increase in the importance of the underground

economy, then we would have expected to see a decline in this ratio. However,

the ratio would be sensitive only to variations in the numbers of families

whose full—time market activities are in the underground sector. Most people

who participate only on a      part—time basis would presumably file a tax         return.

       For the years before 1947, we have reliable data on nubers of households only at

census dates. Also, the definition of a household varies over time. But, we

do know the     adult population (persons aged 18 and     over) for each year. Further,

the data that we have before 1950 suggest that the adult population proxies

sad.sorily through the late 1940s for the number of households. In particular,

the ratio of adult' population to the number of households is 2.74 in 1920, 2.68

in 1930, 2.63 in 1940, and 2.58     in   1947. This slow rate of decrease in the

ratio of adults to households     would not affect our calculations appreciably.
      Table 1   shows the ratio for each year of the number of tax returns filed

to the adult population (aged 18 and above). Notice that this ratio rises

sharply during World War II, which reflects a large decrease in the level of
                                        —16—



income at which returns must be filed. But, the ratio is reasonably stable

since the war, varying between .50 and .58. In fact, most of the tendency

for the ratio to rise since the late 1940s can be explained by the decrease

in the ratio of adult population to the number of households7

       The ratio of filed returns to adult population is only .05 in 1917, but

then rises because of the tax—law changes during World War I to reach .11 in

1920. After falling to about .05 between 1925 and 1935, the ratio rises to .09

in 1939. Then, the major increases in coverage during World War II raise the

ratio dramatically to .51 in 1945 and .53 in 1946. Subsequently, there are no

sharp changes in the ratio.

       For   the period,   1916—45, we calculate the gap between the actual ratio for

each   year and    mean ratio, .54, which applies from 1946 to 1980. Then, we
                  the

assume that this gap corresponds to the number of families that do not file

returns. That is, we estimate the total number of potential tax returns for
each year from 1916 to 1945 by multiplying the value for population aged 18
and   over   by .54. Then, we use these numbers when we compute the weights in the
formula   for average marginal tax rates (when weighted by numbers of returns).

Equivalently, we include the estimated number of non—filers (the number of

potential    returns less the actual number) as families with zero marginal tax
rates.    For   the years from 1946   to 1980, we make   no adjustments for non—filers.

That   is, we assume that the potential nwii'ber. of returns equals    the actual number.

       In order   to compute   the indices when weighted by income, we used an esti-

mate for each year of the income——corresponding to the concept of adjusted

gross income as reported to the IRS—that accrues to non—filers. We derive this

estimate from the ratio of aggregate adjusted gross income to aggregate personal

income, which appears in Table 1. Notice again that this ratio does not change

greatly.from 1946 to 1980. The range of variation is from .75 to .81, with no

clear trend.   Hence, we again make no adjustments for this period.

     Before 1946, we calculate the gap for each year between the ratio of ad-

justed gross to personal income and the mean value, .79, which applies from

1946 to 1980. Then, we assume that this gap corresponds to the income——equivalent

to adjusted gross income——for those families that do not file returns. That is,

we estimate the total of adjusted gross income for each year by multiplying

aggregate personal income by .79. Then, we use this figure when we compute the

weights in the formula for average marginal tax rates (when weighted by amounts

of adjusted gross income).



Results for Average Marginal Tax Rates

     Table 2 shows our time series of average marginal tax rates for 1916—80.

We present four sets of figures, depending on whether the weights are by ad-

justed gross income or numbers of returns, and on whether the arithmetic or

geometric averaging applies. Notice that the last consideration makes only a

small difference. However, the average marginal tax rates are much lower—by

as much as 10 percentage points in recent years——if the weighting is by numbers

of returns, rather than by income. The series that appear in Table 2 involve

some piecing together of different types of underlying data, as mentioned before.

We provide the details in the appendix.

     Fpr most purposes, the time series weighted by income, rather than by numbers

of returns, will be more interesting. Then, since it makes little quantitative

difference and because the arithmetic procedure corresponds to usual index formu—

las, we focus our discussion now on the series shown in the first column of Table 2.

This series weights by adjusted gross income and uses the arithmetic form of average.

The top graph in Figure 1 shows these values of average marginal tax rates for

1916—80. The highlights are as follows.

Note: We discuss in the text the procedure for weighting by adjusted gross income
       or by numbers of returns. The arithmetic indices have the form of equation
       (11), while the geometric ones correspond to equatIon (13).
      We use the tables from Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns
      for each year, as discussed in the text. The appendix details the proce-
      dure for obtaining the figures in the middle periods (1944—60, 1978, when
      weighted by adjusted gross income, and 1944—53, 1978, when weighted by
      numbers of returns).

        From a value of about 1% in 1916, the average marginal tax rate rises along

with major increases in the tax—rate schedule to a peak of 5% during World War I.

Then, because of a series of rate reductions through 1929 and the declines in

income for 1930—31, the marginal, rate falls to a low point of less than 2% in

1931. Subsequently, the rate rises sharply to reach 5% by 1936. Apparently, the

tax—rate increases between 1932 and 1936 reflect the Hoover—Roosevelt program for

fighting the Depression! In particular, for 1931, the marginal tax rates in the

schedule start at i½%, then rise to a top re of 25% for taxable incomes above $100,000.

But, in 1936, the rate starts at 4%, reaches 62% for taxable incomes above $100,000,

and hits a top rate of 79% for taxable incomes above $5 million.

     From a value below 6% in 1940, the average marginal tax rate climbs to a

 peak of 26% during World War II. These changes reflect three main elements:

 first, reductions in the levels of income at which taxes are positive, second,

 increases in the regular tax rates from the schedule, and third, special levies

 fowar. Following World War II, the average marginal tax rate declines to a

low point of 18% in 1948—49.

        After a peak of 25% during the Korean War, the average marginal tax rate

moves from 22% in 1954 to 25% in 1963. Then, the famous Kennedy—Johnson tax

cuts reduce the rate to 21% in 1965. Subsequently, the growth in nominal in-

comes      and the Vietnam surcharge raise the rate to 25—26% for 1968—69. Then,

following the removal of the surcharge, the effects of bracket creep increase

the rate steadily from 24% in 1971 to 31% in 1978. For 1979, the rate falls

to 29%, apparently because of a widening in the tax brackets, although there

are no changes in the lowest and highest tax rates.    But, for 1980 the average
marginal tax rate rises to 307..

     The first column of Table 3 and the lower curve in Figure 1 show a simple

measure of an average tax rate. This rate is the ratio of total federal individual

income taxes to the aggregate of personal income. Because of the graduated—rate
                                   —22—



structure of the tax law and the excess of personal over taxable income, we

anticipate that this type of average tax rate would be below our measure of the

average marginal tax rate. Also, while many changes in the tax law and in

incomes would generate correlated movements in the two measures of tax rates,

there are others——such as changes in deductibles versus changes in statutory

tax rates—that would produce substantial divergences.

       Empirically, the average tax rate is 30 to 40% of our average marginal

rate 7% for 1916—79, 41% for 1946—79, and 39% for 1970—79). But, the bulk

of the movements in the two series are parallel. For 1916—79, the correlations

between the two are .99 in levels, but only .73 in first differences. For

1946—79, the comparable figures are .87 and .89. Some notable differences

between the series show up in recent years. For example, the average tax rates
 for 1974 and 1977 are nearly the same, but the average marginal rate for 1977

 is about 2½ percentage points higher. Then, the average tax rate hardly

 changes from 1978 to 1979, but the average marginal rate falls by about 2 per-

 centage points. Overall, for 1970—79, the correlation of the average marginal

 tax rate with the average tax rate is .81 in levels, but only .39 iii    first
       Table 3 shows also the average marginal tax rates that Joines (1981, Table 9)

calculates   for 1929—75. (We use his series that applies to the federal income
tax on labor income.) As noted earlier, Joines attempts to measure the marginal
relation of taxes to income, dTfdY . He carries this out by seeing how the
tax   paid per return changes with the adjusted gross income per return as we move
from one class of adjusted gross   income to   the next) Thus, he incorporates
both   the effects of the marginal tax rate from the schedule, T'   ,   and the posi-

tive association of deductions per return with income per return. (Here, de—

ductions refer to the difference between adjusted gross and taxable income. The

gap between adjusted gross and total income is not considered, because of lack

of data.)
                                 —23—



     Not surprisingly, Joines's values are below our measures of average mar-

 ginal tax rates. For example, for 1970—75, his figures average 86% of ours,

while for 1946—75 the percentage is 81%. The correlations of Joines's values

with ours for 1946—75 are .91 in levels and .88 in first differences. (Before

1946, the adjustment for non—filers means that our series and Joines's are not

directly comparable.)

     Suppose now that we compare our average marginal tax rates (column 1 of

Table 2) with the average tax rates and Joines's values, which appear in Table 3.

Clearly, in terms of the levels of the numbers, it makes a great deal of differ-

ence which series one uses. However, because of the correlation among the series,

the choice may be less important for the purpose of time—series regression analysis.

But, there are substantial differences in the behavior of all three series over

time. Until we empoy these series for other purposes——for example, in explain-

ing the behavior of aggregate output and employment——we cannot be sure how im-

portant these differences are:



The Dispersion of Marginal Tax Rates

     We look now at the cross—sectional dispersion of marginal tax rates for

the recent period, 1961—77, 1979—80. For these years, we have the tables that

classify directly by the highest marginal tax rates. Figures 2—6 show the cumu—

lative density functions for the marginal tax rates for some selected years, 1961,

1965, 1970, 1975, and 1979. In each case the upper curve applies to numbers of

returns, while the lower one refers to amounts of adjusted gross income. For

example, for 1979, Figure 6 indicates that 65% of the returns and 33% of the

adjusted gross income are subject to marginal tax rates that are less than or

equal to 22%.

Iote: The average tax rate equals the ratio of total individual income taxes
       (after credits) to the aggregate of personal income. The data on taxes
          are from Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns for each
          year. For personal income, see the notes to Table 1. The values for
          dT/dY are from Joines (1981, Table 9, the column labeled PTL).

Note: The values for the means correspond to those in Table 2. Z    35% is
       the fraction of adjusted gross income or numbers of returns for which
       the marginal tax rate exceeds 35%. The data come from Statistics of
       Income, Individual Tax Returns for each year, using the tables that
       classify by marginal tax rates.
                                   -26—



     Table   4 shows for the period, 1961—77, 1979—80, the standard deviations of

the marginal tax rates about their arithmetic means, when weighted either by

adjusted gross income or by numbers of returns. When weighted by numbers of

returns, the standard deviation rises from .084 in 1967 to .125 in 1980.

ilowever, when weighted by adjusted gross income, this pattern shows up only

since 1973, where the increase is from .110 to .129.

     We get a more interesting picture of dispersion when we look at the

fraction of incomes or returns for which the marginal tax rates are "high"——

that is, if we look at the weight in the upper tail of the cumulative densities

that appear in Figures 2—6. This exercise is interesting because some types of

tax—avoiding activities—such as exotic tax shelters and the heavy use of

currency for transactions—may become worthwhile only at very high marginal tax

rates. Then, in order to study these types of phenomena, we would be more in-

terested in the weight in the upper tail of the marginal tax rate distribution,

rather than in the mean or standard deviation,          se.

     Picking 35% arbitrarily as a high marginal tax rate, we see from Table 4

that there   have been dramatic increases in   the   fraction of adjusted gross income
or of numbers   of returns for which the marginal tax rate exceeds this number.

Specifically, the fraction of adjusted gross incomes for which the marginal

tax rate exceeds 35% falls from 9% in 1961 to 8% in 1964 (because of the Kennedy—

Johnson tax cuts), but then rises to 12% in 1970, 18% in 1975, and 31% in 1980.

In other words, the fraction of income that faces a marginal tax rate of at least

35% quadruples from 1964 to 1980! With respect to numbers of returns, the

fraction falls from 1.2% in 196]. to 1.0% in 1964, but then increases to 2.2% in

1970, 4.1% in 1975 and 10.1% in 1980. Hence, the fraction of returns that faces

these high marginal tax rates rises by a factor of ten from 1964 to 1980.
                                        —27—



        Bob Hall suggests (in private conversation) that the rapid rise in $100

 bills in recent years may relate to the sharp increase in the fraction of income

 that faces high marginal tax rates. (Others have suggested the growth in

 criminal activity as a cause.) In particular, the fraction of the value of

 all currency that is in denominations of $100 or greater is highly stable—

varying only between 20% and 22%——from 1944 to l97O. But, the fraction then

increases sharply to reach 36% for July 1980 and 39% for July 1982.



The Behavior of Deductions

       Figures 7—10 show the cross—sectional relation of deductions per return to

adjusted gross income per return (for all filing statuses) for the years, 1961,

1965, 1970 and 1975. Here, deductions, which refer to the differences between

adjusted gross and taxable incone, include exemptions, but exclude the various

subtractions from total income that precede the calculation of adjusted gross

income. The figures consider the range of adjusted gross income per return up

to $70,000.

       The data do not suggest much tendency for the slope, dD/dY        ,   to   change

with income, once adjusted gross income exceeds a fairly low amount, which            is
$5,000——$1O,000 between 1961 and 1975.21 In fact, this appearance of a roughly

linear relation between deductions and adjusted gross income holds up if we add

the upper tail of income.        (At the low end, the slope decreases with adjusted

gross income.) For the years shown in the figures, which range from 1961 to

1975, and for values of adjusted gross income that exceed $10,000, the estimated

slopes, dD/dY ,      are   in the interval between .16 and .18. That is, once ad-

justed gross income is greater than $5,000——$1O,000, deductions per return are

roughly   a   positive intercept plus 16—18%   of   adjusted gross income per return.

(Of   course, we cannot say how adjusted gross income per return relates to total.
                                      —28—




income per return—presumably, most of the serious tax           avoidance   precedes the
calculation   of adjusted gross income.)

    Recall    that   the marginal relation of taxes to income is


                          dT/dY —   T'(].   — dD/dY)


Therefore, if dD/dY is roughly constant——as appears to be true if we measure

Y by adjusted gross income—then dT/dY is approximately a constant fraction

of the marginal tax rate, T' .        In    particular, if dD/dY lies between .16 and

.18, then dT/dY is 82—84% of V .              In   fact, for the post—World War II period,

this relation accounts for most of the difference in average levels between

Joines's estimates of dT/dY (see Table 3) and our figures on average marginal

tax rates. For 1970—75, his values average 86Z of ours, while for 1946—75, they

are 81% of ours.



Concluding Remarks

    Our time series on average marginal tax rates should be useful for a variety

of research purposes. But, our own plans——and our initial motivation for con-

structing the series——focus on two areas. First, we plan to use the data on

average marginal tax rates in a study of the effects of government policies

on aggregate output, employment, and so on. Some previous work on this topic

stresses the influences of monetary disturbances and of various types of govern-

ment purchases. (See, for example, Barro, 1981) Now, we can add a measure of

the average marginal tax rate to assess this aspect of fiscal policy. Conceiva-

bly, we may also be able to distinguish temporary changes in marginal tax rates

from permanent ones. Then, the temporary changes involve intertemporal—substitution

effects, which do not arise for the permanent changes.             Hence, we can test for a
                                   —29—



different   impact of temporary versus permanent shifts in marginal tax

rates on output, employment, and other macroeconomic variables.

     Second, a theory of public—debt creation, outlined in Barro (1979), in-

cludes the intertemporal behavior of tax rates. Specifically, this theory

suggests that debt management smooths     tax rates over time, in spite of

fluctuations in government spending and aggregate real income. In order to

test this theory fully, we need the time—series data on average marginal tax

rates.

     Finally, as mentioned before, the present series on average marginal tax

rate8 is incomplete because it refers only to the federal individual income tax.

We plan some extensions, at least to incorporate the social security tax and

some other levies. At this point, we are uncertain about how far we can go   in
constructing a   comprehensive measure of the average marginal tax rate.

      1Protopapadakis (1982) also uses the Joines—Seater approach to calculate

average marginal tax rates for capital—gain income. Earlier, Wright (1969)

uses the explicit rates from the tax schedule to calculate average marginal

tax rates for interest and dividends over the period, 1913—58. Except for

his weighting by amounts of interest and dividend income, Wright's approach

seems to accord with the one that we emphasize in this paper.




      2The   important considerations are first, distinguishing the self—employed
from employees; second, allowing for the tax—deductibility of employer contribu-
tions; and third, ascertaining the fraction of persons (and their incomes) whose
earnings exceed the ceiling amount. Joines (1981, p. 199) estimates the last
element from the distribution of labor income per return from the IRS data.
But, this procedure is unsatisfactory, at least for families with more than one
income earner. However, the appropriate data are available directly from the
-Social   Security Administration. A more difficult issue concerns the extra bene-

fits that people get when they "contribute" more to social security. The marginal

benefit shouid be subtracted from the payments to compute a net marginal tax

rate. But, these calculations—which depend on anticipated benefit schedules—

may be difficult.

          4Since   1975,   the   earned—income credit makes   T' < 0      for the
                                                                       (and T < 0   )


  federal individual income tax over some range of incomes. We neglect this element.
  Some other credits can effectively be combined with deductions in our subsequent

  formulation.

        5The function,   f(X) ,   would not be concave throughout if there were

set—up costs associated with producing deductions. At the low end of incomes,

there is non—concavity because of the standard deduction, which is an effort—

free alternative to itemized deductions.




        6We do not allow for changes in the relative prices of C1, C2 or X

Essentially, we think of the various goods as perfect substitutes on the supply

side.




            an alternative, we could write total income as the output of the pro-

duction function, Y F(L , B) , where B is "business expenses," which could
include the costs of moving. These business expees then appear also in the
function that generates deductions • In this formulation the marginal product of
labor replaces the wage, w , in equations (7) and (8). We also get the optimiza—
tion condition for business expenses, (aF/aB)(l — T') 1 — T'•(aD/aB) , where
3D/aB    is the marginal effect of business expenses on deductions. If aD/SB — 1

then    aF/3B   1 applies.



        8Eere, the results change if income has a direct effect on deductions (for

reasons that we mentioned before). If this marginal effect on deductions is

positive (negative), then the effectiye marginal tax rate is below (above) T'

     12Recall that we have abstracted from saving——hence, the effect of
in equation tl0) reflects only the substitution between market goods and leisure.

Possibly, individuals perceive their current marginal tax rates as permanent, so

that the main intertemporal—substitution effects do not arise.




     13Recall that we neglect the earned—income credit, which applies since 1975

for taxpayers who have a dependent child. For 1981, the credit rises by lOZ of

earned income up to a total earned income of $5,000. Hence, the marginal tax

rate is —1OZ over this range. (People with negative taxes receive money from the

government.) Then, the credit is constant until earned income equals $6,000, but
                                         —33—




falls by 123% of earned income up to a total of $10,000. In this range some-
one's   marginal tax rate is     12½Z plus the explicit rate from the tax    schedule.

(For incomes above $10,000, the credit stays at zero.) The amount of earned—

income credit depends also (negatively) on the quantity of unearned income.



        14We also make an adjustment for alternative—tax computations.



        15We have interesting problems for 1942 and 1943, which involve.' the

introduction of tax withholding with the legislation of January 1943. In

order to avoid the payment of two years' worth of taxes in 1943, the govern-

ment forgave roughly 75% of the tax liability for the year——either 1942 or 1943—

for   which an   individual.s computed liability was smaller. Thus sxeue's effecttva

marginal    tax rate for either 1942 or 1943 was only about 25% of the explicit
rate.     For most people, this would be 1942. However, although      the   possibility

of tax forgiveness was discussed before January 1943, we cannot say how much

this provision was foreseen when people earned their incomes in 1942. In any

event, our calculations for 1942 and 1943 use the explicit tax—rate schedules,

which disregard the effects of tax forgiveness.

in the concept of a household), to 2.21 in 1960, 2.15 in 1970, and 2.06 in

1980.

       18Note that personal income includes only a small amount of unreported
income, which comes from estimates by the IRS. (For a discussion, see

O'Neill (1982, pp. 2, ff.).) Therefore, we cannot use the ratio of adjusted.

gross to personal income in order to infer the behavior of unreported income.



       19Joines's values also weight by the estimated fraction of total labor

income   in each income class,     rather than by adjusted gross income.

         This behavior Is surprising, given the large increase in prices and

real incomes. For some reason, the average denomination of currency outstand-

ing    (total dollar value divided by total number of       bills) does not change much

over   this period. The sources for our data on currency denominations are the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,' Bankit,g and       Monetary Statistics,

p.   415; Banking   and Monetary   Statistics, 1941—1970, pp. 622, ff.; Annual
tical Digest,   1970—1979,    p. 552; and   U.S.   Department of the Treasury, Monthly
Statement   of U.S. Currency and Coin, Form 1028, various issues.




       211f we look only at   itemized   deductions (excluding standard deductions

and exemptions), then the slope increases at the low end of incomes. But,

the relation between itemized deductions per return and adjusted gross in-

come per return is again roughly linear for values of adjusted gross income

that exceed $5,000—$l0,000.

                                    Appendix


          Table Al shows estimates of average marginal tax rates for 1944—78,
    based on the tables that classify by ranges of adjusted gross income per
    return. We indicated in the text our procedure for estimating the marginal
    tax rate   within each class. Then, we weight either by adjusted gross in-

    come or be numbers of returns and     use   either the arithmetic or geometric

    formula to generate the figures shown in the table.

         We use the values in Table Al to fill in our missing data as follows.

    For the cases where we weight by adjusted gross income, we get the arithmetic

    values for 1944—60 from the equation, —.021 +      l.093•(value   from Table Al).

    The coefficients come from a regression of the values shown in Table 2 on

    those shown in Table Al over the period, 1961—70. For the geometric form,

    we use the equation, —.020 + l.07l (value from Table Al). En both cases the

    a2   values for the regressions are nearly .99. For 1978, we get the arithmetic
-
    value from the equation —.019 + L.l12.(value      from Table A].). These coeffi-.

    dents come from a regression over the period, 1971—77. Similarly, for the

    geometric value, we use the equation, —.005 +      l.045.(value   from Table Al).

    En these cases the values of R2 are .98.

         We use an analogous procedure for the cases where we weight by numbers of

    returns. Here, we get the missing data for 1944-53 by using regression equations

    that are estimated over the period, 1954—70. For the arithmetic case, the

    equation is —.004 +   l.034•(value   from Table Al). For the geometric case, the

    equation is —.004 ÷   1.037. (value from Table Al). In these cases the R2 values
    exceed .99. We get the missing data for 1978 from regressions that are esti-

    mated over the period, 1971—77. For the arithmetic case, the equation Is
