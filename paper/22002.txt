                                              ABSTRACT

Are the well-known facts about urbanization in the United States also true for the developing world?
We compare American metropolitan areas with comparable geographic units in Brazil, China and
India. Both Gibrat’s Law and Zipf’s Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and
India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis,
the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly
rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that the spatial equilibrium
only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital
spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and
human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China
and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge,
but the correlation between city size and earnings is modest. The cross-sectional relationship between
area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world
than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if
limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.

I.     Introduction
The majority of the world’s urban population will soon live in places that are far poorer than the U.S. and
Europe. This creates a knowledge mismatch, for urban economists have predominantly focused on the cities
of the wealthy west. The relevance of the long literatures on wealthy world urbanization depends on the
similarity between poor world urbanization and rich world urbanization. This paper asks whether the major
stylized facts about the cities in the U.S. also hold for Brazil, China and India.
     Economists frequently assume that our models work everywhere, although diﬀerent levels of income and
education may create marginal diﬀerences. Yet the enormous social and political diﬀerences between the U.S.
and countries like Brazil, India and China may belie that assumption. For example, the central organizing
model of urban economics is the spatial equilibrium, which starts with the assumption of free mobility across
space. Does that assumption make sense in a country like China, which historically imposed legal barriers
to mobility such as the Hukuo system (Au and Henderson, 2006b)?
     We focus on three major areas of research: core facts about city size, characterized by Zipf’s and Gibrat’s
Law, the Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982) spatial equilibrium, and the determinants of urban success,
including agglomeration economies, and human capital eﬀects on wages and city growth. The transferability
of Zipf’s and Gibrat’s Law is of primarily academic interest. The transferability of the spatial equilibrium
framework determines our ability to rely on that framework’s many implications, such as the implication that
the benefits of new infrastructure for local renters will be muted by higher prices. Economists might want
to be far more circumspect about championing human capital and agglomeration if there is little evidence
that human capital externalities and agglomeration economies exist in the developing world.
     Section II of this paper describes the data, which can be particularly problematic in the developing world.
For the U.S., we will work with Census-defined metropolitan areas using standardized geographic boundaries
based on the latest definitions. We tried to duplicate this structure for the other three countries, relying
whenever possible on standard Census-like products, but even the definition of metropolitan areas could be
diﬃcult. In the case of India, for example, we use districts, but include only the urban population. Our time
frame runs from 1980 to 2010.
     In Section III we present the basic facts about the distributions of populations across city sizes. While
Zipf’s Law is often considered to be a universal truth, like Soo (2014) we do not find it so. Standard
statistical tests reject the hypothesis that China, India and the U.S. are characterized by the same power
law distribution. Most notably, China and India have fewer extremely large sizes than would be predicted
by Zipf’s Law. Gibrat’s Law, which claims that growth rates are independent of initial population levels,
holds roughly for the U.S. and Brazil. It does not hold for India and China. In both of these countries,
urban population levels show substantial mean reversion from 1980 to 2010. Following the logic of Gabaix
(1999), the failure of Gibrat’s Law in these countries may explain why Zipf’s Law also fails to hold, perhaps
because India and China are still finding their way towards an urban steady state.
     Section IV turns to the spatial equilibrium, which has long been the organizing principle of urban eco-
nomics. We do not focus on the intra-urban implications of the spatial equilibrium, developed by Alonso


                                                        2
(1964), but rather than inter-urban implications developed by Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982). Perhaps the
most basic implication of that model is that urban advantages in one area should be set oﬀ by countervailing
disadvantages in some other area. Higher wages should be oﬀset by either lower amenities or higher housing
costs.
   In the U.S., a one-log-point increase in area incomes (estimated as the residual from a regression where
earnings are regressed on human capital and demographics) is associated with a 1.6 log-points increase in
annual rents. This relationship is actually too small, relative to the predictions of the Rosen-Roback model,
unless higher income areas have low amenities or higher levels of unobserved human capital.
   The comparable elasticities of area rents to area earnings for Brazil and China are 1.4 and 1.1 respectively.
As in the U.S., the earnings-rent relationships in these countries are quite strong, but smaller in magnitude
than theory would suggest. By contrast, the relationship between earnings and rents in India is practically
non-existent. This finding can imply either that Indian rental data is problematic, Indian rental markets
are dysfunctional, or that the spatial equilibrium does not hold in India. We suspect that the truth involves
some combination of all three explanations.
   A second implication of the spatial equilibrium is that real wages should be lower in areas with better
natural amenities. Within the U.S., real wages rise, primarily because housing costs fall, in areas with less
temperate climate. In Brazil, real wages are higher in more temperate areas, primarily because nominal
wages are much lower in the hottest areas of the country. We suspect this reflects a combination of omitted
human capital and imperfect mobility. There is no relationship between climate and real wages in either
India or China, perhaps because these countries are not rich enough for ordinary workers to sacrifice earnings
for nicer weather.
   We also look at income and self-reported happiness across space in the U.S., India and China (data is not
available for Brazil). Income and happiness are only weakly related across U.S. cities, which suggests that
higher incomes in U.S. metropolitan areas are not generating outsized improvements in personal welfare.
Across Chinese and Indian metropolitan areas, the income-happiness relationship appears stronger, even if it
is imprecisely measured. A stronger relationship could suggest that diﬀerences in unobserved human capital
are larger across cities in developing countries than in the U.S., or again, that the spatial equilibrium has
weaker predictive power in these countries.
   The fundamental idea behind the spatial equilibrium is that migrants move to equalize welfare levels
across space, which seemed distinctly plausibly in the highly mobile U.S. Five-year mobility rates in China
and Brazil are lower than historic U.S. mobility rates, but the drop in U.S. mobility since 2000 and the
rise in Chinese mobility means that the three countries look broadly similar today. India, however, appears
to be far less mobile, which may explain why the Indian data does not seem well explained by the spatial
equilibrium model.
   The case for spatial equilibrium is stronger in the U.S. than in the developing countries. Brazil and China
do have reasonably high migration rates and a strong correlation between income and housing costs. India
has low migration rates and essentially no correlation between income and rents. There is no compensation
for less temperate climates in any of the developing countries. We conclude from this subsection that the


                                                       3
spatial equilibrium framework can be used, if it is used warily, in Brazil and China. We see little reason for
confidence in the framework when applied to India.
   Section V turns to the determinants of local success, such as agglomeration economies and human capital
spillovers. As is well known (e.g. Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2009), there are two standard problems with
agglomeration regressions: unobserved personal heterogeneity and unobserved place-based heterogeneity.
We address these issues in the limited ways that are standard in the literature (see Combes and Gobillon,
2014, for a discussion), controlling for observable human capital and instrumenting for current population
levels with population levels from 1980 and the start of the 20th century.
   In the U.S., we estimate an agglomeration coeﬃcient of .054 when the logarithm of male earnings is
regressed on metropolitan area population. The coeﬃcient on the logarithm of density is slightly smaller
(.046). Our Brazilian estimates are similar to those in the U.S. The elasticity of wages with respect to area
population is .052 in Brazil, and the elasticity of wages with respect to area density is .026. In the U.S., we
estimate a “real wage” (defined as wages controlling for area rents) elasticity of approximately .02. In Brazil,
the elasticity is 0.01, which is not statistically significant.
   By contrast, the estimated agglomeration eﬀects are noticeably higher in both China and India, especially
with regard to area density. The density elasticity in China is .19. The population elasticity is half the
size, which is still higher than the estimated U.S. elasticity, but the Chinese coeﬃcient is not statistically
significant. The Indian density elasticity is .076, which is similar to its population elasticity. In India there is
also a substantial real-wage premium associated with denser areas and larger urban populations, which again
suggests either the unobserved human capital diﬀerences are enormous or that India is not characterized by
a spatial equilibrium. In China, the real-wage elasticity to density (.052) is comparable to the one in India,
but the population elasticity is negative and statistically insignificant.
   We then estimate human capital externalities by following Rauch (1993) and Moretti (2004) and re-
gressing the logarithm of earnings on area-level education (measured as the share of adults with tertiary
degrees), individual education and other demographic variables. We acknowledge the significant problem
that unobserved human capital may be correlated with measured area-level human capital, but we have no
way of solving that problem. Our estimated coeﬃcient for the U.S. is 1.0, suggesting that a ten percent
increase in the share of adults with college degrees is associated with an approximately 10 percent increase
in earnings.
   The comparable coeﬃcients for Brazil, China and India are 4.7, 5.3 and 1.9 respectively. These results
suggest that an area-level increase in education in those countries is associated with a far higher increase in
the logarithm of earnings than in the U.S. The share of the population with a college degree varies far more
across U.S. cities than across developing world cities, so that the impact of a standard deviation increase in
area level education is more similar across the four countries.
   Finally, we end with the correlation between human capital and the growth of urban populations and
income levels. In the U.S., a one percentage point increase in the share of adults with college degrees in
1980 is associated with a 2.2 percentage point increase in population growth between 1980 and 2010 and a .9
percentage point increase in income growth. These results have been taken as evidence for skills-enhancing


                                                          4
local productivity growth (Glaeser et al., 1995) or the increasing importance of human capital externalities
(Glaeser and Saiz, 2004).
   The comparable eﬀects in Brazil are far stronger. A one percentage point increase in the share of adults
with a college degree in Brazil is associated with an almost six percentage point increase in population growth
from 1980 to 2010 and a twelve percentage point increase in income growth. Again, the impact of skill seems
larger in the developing world, although the diﬀerences narrow if we consider the impact of a one standard
deviation increase in the skills measure.
   The impact of skills on population growth in China is even larger. A one percentage point higher increase
share of adults with a college degree is associated with a 22 percentage point increase in population growth
from 1980 to 2010. The measured impact on income growth is negative and statistically insignificant. We do
not have results on income change in India, but education is a weaker predictor of population growth than
in the other developing-world countries. A one percentage point increase in the college educated share in
1980 is associated with only a .34 percentage point increase in population growth over the next thirty years,
and the estimate is not statistically significant.
   Agglomeration economies and human capital externalities appear robust in the developing world. The
correlation between skills and urban growth is extremely strong in China and Brazil. Consequently, two major
policy lessons from U.S. data –skills matter for urban success and agglomeration increases productivity– seem
to be quite relevant for the developing world.
   We conclude that there are both similarities and diﬀerences between urbanization in the U.S. and urban-
ization in the developing world. The core determinants of productivity –human capital and agglomeration–
are important everywhere. But anyone who assumes that India is in spatial equilibrium is making a leap of
faith.
   One interpretation of these results is that the spatial equilibrium framework is not particularly relevant in
poor, traditional economies, where human-capital heterogeneity is enormous and people remain rooted to the
communities of their birth. Looking across the four countries, it seems quite possible that spatial equilibrium
emerges with development as human capital becomes more widespread and as people turn to markets instead
of traditional social arrangements in their home villages. The transition to a spatial equilibrium seems like
a fertile topic for future research.



II.      Measuring Urban Areas in Four Countries
American urban research often examines variation across metropolitan areas. This research is possible
because the United States has a dispersed urban system with a large number of metropolitan areas that have
a rich variety of sizes, education levels and incomes. To examine the diﬀerences and similarities between the
developed and developing world, we chose three countries that are also large, populous and endowed with
a dispersed urban hierarchy: Brazil, China and India. These three countries are notable not only for their
size, but also for the fact that they are not dominated by a single urban giant, such as Buenos Aires, Jakarta
or Mexico City.


                                                       5
   While these three countries are frequently linked together as BRICs, they have substantially diﬀerent
income levels. Per capita GDP in India is approximately one-third of per capita income in Brazil, and
China lies between these two extremes. Figure 1 shows that the paths of urbanization (as defined by the
percentage of the population living in what each national statistics oﬃce calls “urban areas”) also diﬀer across
the countries. In 1965, Brazil was already one-half urban, while India and China were overwhelmingly rural.

   Brazil’s high level of urbanization was part of the classic 1960s puzzle of high Latin American urbanization.
Social scientists noted that “Latin America, on the whole, is more urbanized than it is industrialized or
developed in other respects” (Durand and Pelaez, 1965), and that “urbanization is occurring without any
industrialization” (Arriaga, 1968). While American per capita GDP was $7500 (in 2012 dollars) in the 1920s,
when the U.S. became 50 percent urban, Brazilian per capita GDP only reached that level in 2011, when it
was 80 percent urban. Indeed, today Brazil is more urbanized than the United States despite being far less
wealthy.
   By contrast, India’s urbanization has shown a slow but steady growth from 18 percent in 1960 to 31
percent in 2010. India is still predominantly poor and predominantly rural. Yet India’s vast size means that
it has extensive mega-cities, despite having a low urbanization rate.
   Before 1800, China had the globe’s greatest track record of city building, yet despite that history China’s
urbanization rate remained below 20 percent when Mao died in 1976. After that point, and the economic
opening that came with Deng Xiaoping’s Southern Strategy, China’s urbanization rate exploded. Chinese
income and urbanization levels are now far higher than those in India. China has even more vast cities,
most of whom westerners – even western urbanists– cannot name. According to the OECD (2015), in 2010
there were 643 million Chinese living in 127 metropolitan areas with more than 1.5 million people. By
contrast, there are only 11 such metropolitan areas all together in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,


                                                                                             6
the Netherland, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland (OECD, 2012).


Defining Agglomerations
In order to produce results comparable to U.S. urban research, we need to define comparable geographic
units. Even more challenging, we will need to define geographic units that can be identified in large data sets
with individual-level information. Typically, U.S. research uses metropolitan areas, which are multi-county
agglomerations, defined by the U.S. Census. Since the Census definitions change, we follow the convention of
using the definitions as of 2010 and using Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which are relatively
large groupings. The U.S. Census considers all Americans who live within metropolitan areas to be urban,
since they are part of a large urban labor market, even if their own home is surrounded by considerable
greenery.
    The OECD (2012) and other organizations have already defined functional urban units for a large number
of countries, and for many purposes it would be better to simply use their definitions. Yet our purpose is to
replicate the U.S. urban literature, which uses individual level-data and, as such, we must also use Brazilian,
Chinese and Indian censuses and surveys containing large numbers of individuals. These data sources don’t
use OECD urban area definitions, and typically contain geographic identifiers based on political boundaries.
We will define metropolitan areas using those boundaries, typically excluding non-urban respondents both
from our tests and from our definition of area-level variables, such as aggregate population, density and skill
levels.
    In the case of Brazil we use microregions, which are agglomerations of contiguous and economically inte-
grated municipalities that have similar economic features, defined by the Brazilian Institute for Geography
and Statistics (IBGE, 2002). These areas capture better the notion of local labor markets than munici-
palities, which are more similar to U.S. counties in that they can diﬀer dramatically in size and economic
characteristics. Using legally defined metropolitan regions was not a plausible alternative either, because
the Brazilian constitution of 1988 delegates to the states the right to establish them, and the criteria used
to form these regions varies significantly across states.
    For China we use administrative “cities”, including provincial-level and prefecture-level areas. The name
can be misleading, since these geographical units are typically regions that comprise both urban and rural
territories. While there is not a single spatial administrative structure for cities, a typical “large” city
(provincial or prefecture level) includes both an urban core and large rural areas with scattered towns. The
urban core and its surroundings are in turn divided into districts, and the rural areas into “counties” (Chan,
2007).
    In the case of India we use districts, the second-level administrative division of the country after states and
union territories. This choice enables us to merge the available microdata to area-level aggregates available
from the Indian Census and other sources. However, Indian districts are, for the most, geographically
extensive areas that contain large numbers of rural dwellers.
    In order to make the units of analysis from Brazil, China and India more comparable to those from the



                                                         7
U.S., we restrict the samples to urban individuals and urban-only area aggregates throughout most of the
study. Moreover, we try to homogenize the sample compositions by restricting them to the higher end of
the urban population distributions (areas with 100,000 urban dwellers or more).
   Like U.S. definitions of metropolitan areas, the boundaries of Brazilian microregions, Chinese cities and
Indian districts change over time. In these large developing countries, the process is mostly driven by the
breakup of existing administrative units to create smaller ones. Thus, we need to construct time-consistent
geographies for the cases where we perform inter-temporal comparisons.
   In the case of Brazil, we employ data from municipality-level border changes for the period 1980-2010
to aggregate microregions when necessary and construct time-consistent borders following Kovak (2013). In
the cases of China and India, we use GIS historical data to geo-match current borders to 1980 borders, and
use the 1980 area definitions aggregating smaller areas when necessary.
   We recognize that our definitions are debatable, but we believe that these are reasonable choices with
the goal of creating a standard definition across quite diﬀerent countries.


The Distribution of Populations across Area Sizes
Table 1 shows the distribution of population across diﬀerent population sizes in 2000 and 2010. The first
five columns show the share of the total national population living in metropolitan grouping of diﬀerent
sizes. The last column shows the total size of the population living in all of these groups put together. All
of these countries have more than 100 million people living in these areas. In 2010, collectively these urban
populations include 1.4 billion people, about one fifth of the world’s population.

   The U.S. population distribution is heavily skewed towards the larger metropolitan areas, with 38 percent
of the population in such areas in 2000 and 41 percent in 2010. Collectively the other four population
groupings contain only 26 percent of the U.S. population in 2010.
   Brazil also has a large share of its population (32 percent in 2010) in the largest metropolitan areas,
but it also has a large share in the smaller areas. Twenty-eight percent of the Brazilian urban population
lives in microregions with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants. Some of these smaller areas might not even be
classified as metropolitan areas within the U.S. We highlight this to emphasize that the data issues make
these comparisons challenging, especially when we are dealing with the less populated areas.
   By contrast, only one percent of Chinese in 2010 live in cities of less than 500,000 and 39 percent of Chinese
live in metropolitan areas with more than 1.5 million people. While definitional issues might explain some
of the absence of smaller Chinese agglomerations, there is no doubt that a large number of Chinese live
in extremely large metropolitan areas. Perhaps the most striking fact is that between 2000 and 2010, the
share of Chinese living in such areas increased by 18 percent, which reflects both migration and the rapidly
expanding populations of many Chinese mega-cities.
   Even in India, the share of the population living in the largest urban areas increased significantly between
2000 and 2010 – from ten percent to fourteen percent. India may be the least urbanized country in the
group, but it has 373 million urbanites living in cities with more than 100 thousand people, according to
our classification. This represents the second largest urban population in the world. The typical urbanite in
2010 is far more likely to reside in Beijing or Shanghai or Sao Paulo than in London or New York.
   Before taking a closer look at these city size distributions, we briefly discuss income heterogeneity in the
four countries, both across and within cities. Table 2 shows the national income distributions in the four
countries and the gulf between urban and rural incomes. Despite the enormous attention given to inequality
in the U.S., America is not particularly unequal among these countries. Brazil is the standout in inequality,
with both the highest share of its income going to the top ten percent (42 percent) and the lowest share
going to the bottom ten percent (one percent).
   In India, China and the U.S, between 28.8 and 30 percent of national incomes go to the top ten percent of
the income distribution. In China and the U.S., 4.7 percent of income goes to the bottom fifth of the income
distribution. The poorest quintile of Indians does much better, as a share of national income, earning 8.6
percent of national income. In all three cases, inequality has been widening over the past 20 years.
   In India, China and the U.S, between 28.8 and 30 percent of national income goes to the top ten percent
of the income distribution. In China and the U.S., 4.7 percent of income goes to the bottom fifth of the
income distribution. The poorest quintile of Indians does much better, as a share of national income, earning
8.6 percent of national income. In all three cases, inequality widened over the 1990-2010 period.
   We are particularly interested in the gulf between urban and rural citizens, which is displayed in the
bottom panel of the table. In the U.S., urban incomes are 30 percent higher than rural incomes, which is
a significant gap, albeit one that is oﬀset by higher urban costs of living. In China, urban incomes are 44
percent higher than rural incomes, which is significant but not extreme.
   By contrast, urban Indians in our sample earn 122 percent more than rural Indians. Urban Brazilians


                                                       9
earn 176 percent more than the rural Brazilians. These gulfs are enormous, suggestive of huge productivity
diﬀerences between urban and rural areas. Presumably, a significant fraction of these gulfs reflect unobserved
and observed human capital characteristics (Young, 2013), and perhaps also non-pecuniary compensation in
rural areas. Given the enormous diﬀerences between rural and urban Brazil and India, we will include only
urbanites in the tests that follow. Nonetheless, we will still have to grapple with unusually large earnings
diﬀerences across space that do not seem to be fully oﬀset by diﬀerences in housing costs.

III.        City Size Distributions: Zipf’s Law and Gibrat’s Law
Before discussing facts related to economic theories, we follow Rosen and Resnick (1980) and Soo (2005) and
turn to two stylized facts about city size distributions: Zipf’s Law and Gibrat’s Law. We choose to begin
here despite the large international literature on these laws (e.g. Rose, 2006; Soo, 2014), because we are using
slightly diﬀerent city size definitions and because it is important to duplicate past results using our attempt
at producing consistent data. Zipf’s Law was originally posed as the rank size rule: the population of the
N th largest city is 1/N times the population of the largest city. In large samples, this claim is equivalent to
the city size distribution being characterized by a power law distribution with a coeﬃcient of minus one.
   Gibrat’s Law is dynamic. It states that the growth rate of population is unrelated to the initial population.
Researchers typically test Gibrat’s Law by regressing the change in the logarithm of city population on
the initial level of city population, and testing whether the coeﬃcient is statistically distinct from zero.
Champernowne (1953) and Gabaix (1999) linked the two facts and showed that if Gibrat’s Law holds
for city growth rates, then the equilibrium distribution of city sizes will display Zipf’s Law. This result is
mathematical, not economic, and it requires no assumptions about the motives of migrants or the productivity
of firms.
   Our purpose is not to revisit the many controversies around Zipf’s Law (e.g. Holmes and Lee, 2010) or the
methodological issues related to measurement. We will use the simplest established techniques and compare
across countries. We will also use our measures of metropolitan area population, which are also debatable.
Throughout this paper, we aim to reproduce simple, transparent facts about space, not to advance methods
or debate nuanced issues within the established literature.


Zipf ’s Law across Four Countries
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution of city sizes for our four countries. In all cases, we consider
only those areas with more than 100,000 urban inhabitants. The plots show the relationship between the
logarithm of the city rank minus one-half and the logarithm of the area population.
   We follow Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) who present theory and simulations showing that the relationship
between the logarithm of area population and the log of rank minus one-half is a far better estimate of the
coeﬃcient on the power law distribution for area sizes than the relationship between the log of area population
and the log of the rank in the city population. We also plot the fitted line that is implied by this procedure.
   The results for the U.S. show a coeﬃcient of -.91, which is lower in magnitude than the -1.05 estimate
discussed by Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011). We diﬀer from them primarily because we consider a broader
range of metropolitan areas. The figure shows how the size-rank relationship steepens at higher ranks. If
we restricted our sample to the 135 largest metropolitan areas, as they do, our estimate would be larger in
magnitude and closer to their estimate.
   The next figure shows the results for Brazil. The fit of the relationship is extremely tight. Brazil’s city
populations do seem well characterized by a power law distribution, with less non-linearity than in the U.S.



                                                      11
However, the -1.18 estimated coeﬃcient is much higher than in the U.S. and higher than predicted by Zipf’s
Law. This high coeﬃcient means that population rises too slowly as rank falls, or that Brazil’s biggest cities
are smaller than Zipf’s Law would predict. Soo (2014) finds an estimate of .94 for Brazil across his entire
sample, but the coeﬃcient rises as he restricts the sample to larger cities. Rose (2006) found a coeﬃcient of
-1.23 for Brazil which is quite close to our estimate.

   The third figure shows results for China, following Anderson and Ge (2005). The estimated coeﬃcient
of -.91 seems reassuringly close to the U.S., but the figure suggests that such comfort is mistaken. The
-.91 coeﬃcient masks strong non-linearity in the rank-size relationship, and the r-squared is quite low (.79)
relative to the U.S. (.94) or Brazil (.99). The steep curve among the larger Chinese cities suggests that when
it comes to big areas, China is more like Brazil than like the U.S. China also has far fewer extremely large
cities than Zipf’s Law would suggest. The -.91 estimate is larger in magnitude than Soo (2014), but smaller
than Schaﬀar and Dimou (2012) and Rose (2006).

                                                          12
   The final panel shows results for India, which has -1.03 coeﬃcient, suggesting that Zipf’s Law appears to
work for Indian cities even more strongly than it does in the U.S. This estimate is close to Soo (2005) but
less than Rose (2006). Our r-squared (.92) is somewhat lower than the U.S. and there is also some concavity
in the relationship between rank and size, suggesting that there are again fewer large cities than Zipf’s Law
would suggest.
   In Table 3, we test whether the city size distributions are the same across the four countries. The top
panel in the table shows results for all city sizes. The bottom panel shows results only for city sizes above
500,000, where we are more confident that metropolitan area definitions are not driving the results.

   The table reports D statistics from two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests that compare each pair of
city size distributions. For the whole sample of cities, for every pair of countries we can reject that the
distributions are identical. China’s city size distribution is particularly distinct statistically, with all D
statistics above .5. India and the U.S. appear to have the most similar city size distributions, with a D
statistics less than .2.
   When we turn only to the larger metropolitan areas, the diﬀerences become muted. The U.S., Brazilian
and Indian city size distributions are no longer statistically distinct. China’s city size distribution is, however,
statistically diﬀerent from the other three. The primary diﬀerence is again that China has fewer ultra-large

cities than the U.S. city size distribution would predict if it was applied to the number and total population
of Chinese cities.
   There are many possible explanations for these diﬀerences. China’s population has exploded so rapidly
that it may be far from steady state. China’s governments are far more active in planning city populations
than any of the other countries. The growth of ultra large Chinese cities may also be blocked by disamenities
of size that can become extreme for urban populations over 20 million. Finally, both China and India may
be better seen as continents rather than standard countries and this may also explain some of the diﬀerence.
   The diﬀerences between China and the other countries does raise the possibility that in the long run
China’s urban populations will be much more skewed towards ultra large areas like Beijing and Shanghai.
The attempts of many local governments to boost growth in middle size (Tier 3 and Tier 4) cities seem to
have led to fiscal diﬃculties. Over time, more vertical construction and congestion pricing may ease the
disamenities of crowding and congestion. China’s city size distribution may eventually look far more like
Zipf’s Law, and to examine that possibility we now turn to the dynamics of city growth and Gibrat’s Law.


Gibrat’s Law across Four Countries
Table 4 shows our results on the mean reversion of city populations. In all cases, we report coeﬃcients where
the change in the logarithm of area urban population is regressed on the logarithm of initial area urban
population. Gibrat’s Law implies that the coeﬃcient should be statistically indistinguishable from zero.
   The first column shows results for the United States for 1980-2010. We first show the coeﬃcient for
the entire time period and then results for each of the three decades separately. Over the entire 1980-2010,
there is no correlation between initial population and subsequent population growth. The r-squared in the
regression is 0 to two decimal places. The estimated coeﬃcient is .009. The standard error around that
coeﬃcient means that we cannot rule out the possibility that the coeﬃcient is .03, but even that coeﬃcient
is quite small for a thirty-year period.
   Gibrat’s Law holds less perfectly within the U.S. during each independent decade. In both the 1990s
and the 2000s, the estimated coeﬃcient is close to .01 and statistically significant. Yet given the strong
correlation that exists between metropolitan area growth and other variables, such as January temperature
and education, these coeﬃcients are quite compatible with Gibrat’s Law.
   Gibrat’s Law has failed during many periods of U.S. history. Glaeser, Ponzetto and Tobio (2014b) examine
population growth among eastern counties of the U.S. from 1860 until today. For example, during the 1970s,
there was sharp mean reversion in population levels in those counties. During the 1960s, population growth
was much faster in more populous counties. Gibrat’s Law has not been a permanent feature of U.S. urban
dynamics, and perhaps it should not be expected to hold in countries experiencing far more rapid urban
change.
   The second column shows the results for Brazil, which are generally statistically indistinguishable from
the U.S. Over the entire time period, like Soo (2014), we cannot reject the hypothesis that Gibrat’s law holds
in Brazil. During the 1980s, there was slight mean reversion, but during the 1990s and 2000s, Gibrat’s Law



                                                     14
seems to describe the data well. These results also echo Resende (2004).

   China’s results are shown in the third column. There is strong mean reversion over the entire time period
and during individual decades, except for the 2000s. As China liberalized and migration increased, smaller
and middle-sized cities grew faster than the most populous. These patterns don’t look at all like Gibrat’s
Law, which is perhaps why Zipf’s Law also seems to fail for China.
   The fourth column shows the coeﬃcients for India. Over the entire time period, the coeﬃcient is signif-
icantly negative. If a city’s population was 1 log point higher in 1980, then it grew on average by .052 log
points less over the next 30 years. This negative coeﬃcient does not imply that India has once great cities
that are declining, but rather that growth was particularly robust in smaller agglomerations.
   When we split the Indian growth by decades, we see that the 1980s were marked by positive serial
correlation, where higher populations led to faster growth, while this trend disappeared in the 1990s and the
2000s. One possible explanation for this shift is that prior to the economic liberalization in the early 1990s,
regulation tended to keep the urban hierarchy in places.

   Brazil and the U.S. both appear to adhere broadly to both Zipf’s and Gibrat’s Laws. China and India do
not. Perhaps the most natural reason why Brazil and the U.S. are similar is that they are both moderately
sized places, which have long been largely urban. China and India are both much larger, and many of their
cities are much newer. If they have not reached a dynamic steady state, then perhaps Gibrat’s and Zipf’s
Laws may eventually appear in their urban systems.



IV.        The Spatial Equilibrium
We now turn to empirical tests that are motived by economics. For over fifty years, the spatial equilibrium
has been the organizing principle of urban economics. It was first applied to land prices and land usages
within the metropolitan areas by Alonso (1964) and Muth (1969) and then it was applied to income and
price diﬀerences across metropolitan areas by Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982). The core idea of the spatial
equilibrium is that locations don’t oﬀer a free lunch. If a place has high wages and decent amenities, then
real estate costs should be high. If a place has nice amenities, then real wages (i.e. wages controlling for
local prices) should be lower.
   We look at four diﬀerent empirical patterns that are related to the spatial equilibrium. We begin by
testing whether the costs of living rise with wages across metropolitan areas. We then test whether real
wages are lower in places that have more attractive natural climates. Third, we examine whether self-
reported life satisfaction is higher in places with higher income and we end this section by looking at overall
migration patterns. Migration is not itself a prediction of the spatial equilibrium model, but it is one channel
through which the spatial equilibrium is produced. When migration is low, we might be less confident about
the predictions of the spatial equilibrium model.
   The first three tests all try to assess whether people in one area are receiving a higher welfare level than
people in another area. But if these tests fail, then there are always two quite plausible explanations. First,
a spatial equilibrium might not exist because of legal or preference based barriers to mobility. Second, the
people in the more successful area might have fundamentally diﬀerent levels of unobserved human capital
than the people in the less successful area. If the two areas have very diﬀerent people, then we would not
expect them to deliver the same welfare levels. While we can control for observable human capital measures,
such as years of schooling, we can never reject the possibility that unobserved human capital is driving our
results.


The Relationship between Prices and Wages
The starting point for the spatial equilibrium is the assumption that utility is equalized over space for any
homogenous set of workers who are living in multiple cities. Individual heterogeneity can come in the form of
place-independent heterogeneity, such as diﬀerent levels of human capital or tastes for particular amenities,
or place-dependent heterogeneity, such as taste for living in a particular locale. Both types of heterogeneity
can be modeled. For example, Glaeser (2008) discusses models of heterogeneous worker human capital.



                                                      16
Diamond (2015) works with heterogeneous tastes for cities, as well as heterogeneous human capital. For
expositional purposes, we will stick with the most standard and simple assumption of worker homogeneity.
     In this case, we can define an indirect utility function over wages, prices and amenties V ((1                t) W, P, A),
where (1        t) W reflects after-tax wages, P reflects prices and A reflects amenities. This indirect utility
function is typically either operationalized as a log-separable or a linear-separable function. The log-separable
function is justified by a Cobb-Douglas utility function defined over a general consumption good and housing.
This can produce an indirect utility function of A (1                t) W P   ↵
                                                                                  , where A represents an index of amenity
values which is assumed to multiply welfare and ↵ represents the share of housing in the utility function and
household spending.
     The linear-separable structure is justified by assuming that every person consumes exactly one unit of
housing and, consequently, people’s after-housing income is W                     P . In the linear separable formulation, it
is convenient to assume that the amenity index is just added to net earnings so that total welfare is just
(1    t) W       P + A. In the log-separable formulation, nation-wide proportional taxes are irrelevant to the
relationship between wages and prices. In the linear-separable formulation, nation-wide proportional taxes
will matter, unless housing costs are deductible. In the U.S., housing prices are partially deductible because
of the home mortgage interest deduction.1
     The log-separable formulation suggests the relationship:

                                                      1
                                    Log (P rice) =      (Log (W age) + Log (Amenities))                                      (1)
                                                      ↵

     The linear-separable formulation suggests:


                                           P rice = Af ter T ax W age + Amenities                                            (2)


   If log price is regressed on log wages, then the first formulation implies that the coeﬃcient will be
  ⇣                                    ⌘
        Cov(Log(W age),Log(Amenities))
1
↵ 1+           V ar(Log(W age))          . As the historic share of spending that goes towards housing is ap-
proximately one-third, this suggests a benchmark coeﬃcient of three. The second formulation suggests that
                                                                          Cov(W age,Amenities)
if price is regressed on wage, the coeﬃcient will be 1               t+       V ar(W age)      .   The two models yield tight
predictions only if we know the correlation of the amenity index and wages, which we unfortunately do not.
Our approach is not to attempt to definitively disprove the spatial equilibrium predictions, but rather to
test whether reality is roughly compatible with the predictions of the model in our four countries.
     An added complication is that measured wages and measured housing prices will necessarily vary because
of diﬀerences in human capital and the physical characteristics of the house. Our approach to this issue is to
estimate a wage residual from a regression in which the logarithm of wages is regressed on individual human
capital characteristics, including years of schooling and age. To promote comparability, we will only include
males in this wage regression. We will then include this residual in a regression in which housing cost is
regressed on this area-level wage and other housing characteristics, especially the physical characteristics of

   We begin with the United States. Table 5 shows the coeﬃcient when the logarithm of housing prices (at
the household level) is regressed on two measures of area level income. The first row shows results when we
define income as the logarithm of average income in the area. The second row instead uses the average of
the residual from a regression in which the logarithm of wages is regressed on human capital characteristics,
including age, race dummies and years of schooling. The first coeﬃcient is 1.225 and the second coeﬃcient
is 1.61.

   Figure 3 shows the core relationship visually at the area level. The plot shows the metropolitan area log
wage residual (i.e. the estimated area-level dummy variable from a log wage regression) and the metropolitan
area log rent residual. At the metropolitan area level, the r-squared is .47, but the coeﬃcients all seem too
small. Given that Americans spend, 1/3 of their incomes on housing, the predicted coeﬃcient should be
three, unless urban amenities move with housing costs. When we rerun the regression in levels, we estimate
a coeﬃcient of .13, which is certainly much lower than the value of one minus the tax rate, which is predicted
by theory.
   There are several possible explanations for finding a coeﬃcient below that suggested by the Rosen-Roback
model. Most obviously, amenities may be negatively associated with wages in the U.S., and there is some
evidence to support that view. The share of workers with commute times over 20 minutes is significantly
higher in metropolitan areas with higher incomes. January temperatures are lower in areas with higher
incomes.
   A second hypothesis is that the independent variable is mismeasured badly, which will naturally lead to


                                                            18
attenuation bias. Many renters receive public assistance or are in public housing. Consequently, their rents
may be artificially low. Building quality levels may diﬀer systematically across areas.

   A third view is that since the majority of Americans are owners, and since rental apartments tend to
be lower quality, we are not capturing the true cost of living in a particular place. We have duplicated
these results with self-reported housing values from the Census and Census Median Income, assuming that
ownership costs (including finance, depreciation and maintenance) are approximately ten percent of housing
values. Again, we find that the logarithmic specification yields a coeﬃcient much closer to one than to three.
The levels coeﬃcient is also small, although substantially larger than the rent coeﬃcient. Housing values
are also an imperfect measure of housing costs because they are partially shaped by expectations of future
housing appreciation, and that expected appreciation lowers the eﬀective price of housing.
   The second column of Table 5 and the second graph in Figure 3 shows the basic results for Brazil. The
estimated coeﬃcients range from 1.01 to 1.37. The microregion level r-squared is comparable to the U.S.



                                                          19
metropolitan area sample. These results corroborate Azzoni and Servo (2002) who also find higher costs of
living in higher Brazilian regions.
   The Brazilian figure should be larger than the U.S. figure because Brazilian spending on housing is
a smaller share of total income, approximately 15 percent according the Credit Suisse Survey Emerging
Consumer Survey. If that is correct, then the predicted log coeﬃcient could be as high as seven. The same
explanations for the low estimate exist in Brazil as well as the U.S.: a negative amenity correlation with
high incomes and mismeasurement of both the dependent and independent variable.
   Overall, though, the Rosen-Roback inspired wage-to-rent relationship looks pretty similar in the U.S.
and Brazil. In both cases, area-level rents are tightly correlated with area-level incomes. In both cases, the
coeﬃcients are close to one, which is a far smaller relationship than is predicted by economic theory. The
similarities between the Brazilian and American results leave us optimistic that the tradition of Rosen-Roback
inspired hedonic regressions that has been so successful with U.S. data can proceed in Brazil.
   The third column of Table 5 and the third graph in Figure 3 provide the results for China. The table’s
estimated coeﬃcients are again close to one, which suggests that Chinese do pay more when incomes are
higher, as in Long, Guo and Zheng (2009). Nonetheless, the coeﬃcient of one seems low, since the Chinese
spend an even smaller share of their incomes (ten percent) on housing than the Brazilians. The graph shows
that the r-squared of the relationship (.07) is much smaller than in the U.S. and Brazil. The goodness of fit
in the table and the figure can be quite diﬀerent, because the table reflects individual-level data while the
figure looks at the area-level relationship, which is not weighted by the number of people in each area.
   Chinese rents are correlated with incomes across areas, but the link is much weaker than either the U.S.
or Brazil. One explanation for this is that amenity correlation with income is even more negative and that
is certainly possible. Another possibility is the barriers to mobility in China, especially the famous Hukuo
system make it diﬃcult for migration to equalize welfare levels.
   Yet a third possibility is that public interventions in the housing market are particularly important in
China, and these act to distort market prices. Moreover, only 10 percent of Chinese and 13.4 percent
of Indians rent. A standard explanation for these low homeownership rates is that rental markets are
dysfunctional and distorted by rent-control-like rules. It is notable that speculators in Chinese real estate will
often buy apartments and leave them empty rather than taking the risk of renting them out. Consequently,
people are unable to rent and must buy low quality housing instead. The rental market that does exist may
only reflect a very unusual part of the housing market.
   Finally, with those concerns in mind, we turn to the results from India. The last graph in Figure 3 shows
that there is essentially no correlation between income and rents across Indian regions. This non-result is
repeated in the fourth column in Table 5. Possibly, this non-correlation reflects profound amenity diﬀerences
across Indian cities, but it seems just as likely to reflect terrible measurement of housing rents. For example,
in many cases, landlords are not allowed to raise rents and cannot eject tenants. Indeed, it is hard to see
any pattern in our Indian rent data, which leads us to suspect that without better data on the cost of living,
any hedonic estimates pursued with this data are risky. Certainly, we cannot conclude that this provides
any support for the usefulness of the spatial equilibrium model in India.


                                                       20
   Across the four countries, the patterns in Brazil and the U.S. were broadly similar. Both countries have
a tight correlation between income and rents. In both countries, the estimated relationship was smaller than
would be predicted by the core Rosen-Roback model. The link between income and rents was weaker in
China, but still significant. The link disappears entirely in India. For some reason, the spatial equilibrium
model appears to be least eﬀective in the poorest nation, either because an equilibrium does not exist or
because measurement is most problematic. We now turn to the equilibrium pricing of amenities.


Real Wages and Amenities
Equations (1) and (2) also provide implications about the connection between amenities and real wages, where
real wages are defined either as Log (W age)   ↵Log (P rice), in the logarithmic model or as W age   P rice, in
the linear model. When it comes to amenities, the models do not yield any implication about the magnitude
of the eﬀect. That will depend upon consumer valuation of amenities. The model does, however, imply that
areas will positive amenities will have lower real wages.
   We will focus on climate-related amenities, which have the advantage of being exogenous to the local
economy and generally well measured. In our samples, we will typically have a measure of January and July
temperatures and an average precipitation measure. For January and July temperature, we will transform the
variable by taking that absolute value of the diﬀerence between the average temperature and the equivalent
in Celsius of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.11 degrees Celsius). Consequently, the value can increase if the area
is either particularly hot or particularly cold. The choice of 70 degrees represents a middle ground within
the 65 to 75 degree range that is often discussed an ideal for human comfort. We recognize that this choice
is relatively arbitrary within this range. Our results are not particularly sensitive to minor perturbations in
the assumed bliss point for temperature.
   Table 6 shows our results. The first panel shows the findings for wages, rents and real wages in the
U.S. We use three distinct measures of climate amenities. First, we use the absolute value of the diﬀerence
between the average temperature in summer and 21.11 degrees Celsius. Second, we use the absolute value
of the diﬀerence between the average temperature in winter and 21.11 degrees. Finally, we use the average
annual rainfall.
   The first column shows that there is no relationship between wages and these variables, controlling for
our core human capital attributes (age, race and years of schooling). The second column shows that a ten
degree Celsius diﬀerence between temperatures in either the winter or the summer from idea temperature is
associated with an approximately five percent increase in real wages. Americans do seem to be paid more
when they live in less temperate climates. The third column shows that these diﬀerences are largely driven
by lower rents in less temperate areas. There are no eﬀects of rainfall.
   These climate relationships with rents and real wages are a prediction of the Rosen-Roback model that is
confirmed within the U.S. Do real wages rise with bad climates in the developing world? The second panel
in Table 6 shows the results for Brazil. Brazil has lower wages in places that have less ideal temperatures.
Nominal wages are higher in areas with more rain as well.

 These diﬀerences are driven primarily between the huge gaps in the level of development between northern


                                                           22
and southern Brazil. There are large human capital diﬀerences between north and south which are assuredly
only imperfectly captured by our coarse control variables and which are correlated with the weather (Azzoni
et al., 2000). There are also diﬀerences in the level of capital stock and infrastructure. Other work (Mueller,
2005) finds that Brazilians do seem to value climate diﬀerences that are not correlated with region.
   Finally, the third regression shows results with rents, which are indeed also lower in places with more
extreme weather. While these results are compatible with the Rosen-Roback framework, the coeﬃcients
are not large enough to reverse the also negative relationship with wages and hence we have the anomalous
result that people in Brazil earn more in real terms when the climate is worse.
   The patterns for China and India are almost identical. In almost all cases, there is almost no correlation
between climate and any of our variables. China’s economic divide runs east-to-west rather than north-to-
south, like Brazil, which may explain why there isn’t a large correlation between climate and nominal wages.
Overall, perhaps the most natural explanation is that the Chinese and the Indians are not wealthy enough
to be willing to pay a significant premium to live in places with more temperate climates. Liu and Shen
(2014) also find a far weaker relationship between climate and population growth in China than in the U.S.


Happiness across Space
Economists like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill argued that human beings both should and typically
do try to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. If they were right, then the modern economists’ concept
of utility should be synonymous with self-reported happiness or life satisfaction. Yet many if not most
economists now reject the Benthamite hedonist approach that equates happiness and welfare. Utility func-
tions, in their modern use, are simply rankings based on preferences. People may sensibly make decisions
that appear to lower their level of reported life satisfaction. Parents of young children, for example, typically
report lower levels of life satisfaction, perhaps because of enormous time costs in caring for infants (Mclana-
han and Adams, 1987). This does not mean that those parents have made a mistake. Having children may
be rational and increase utility even if it does not increase happiness.
   Nonetheless, we follow Glaeser, Gottlieb and Ziv (2014a) in believing that happiness can be useful for
examining the spatial equilibrium even if happiness is not equivalent to utility. Heterogeneity in happiness
across space should provide a test of the spatial equilibrium model. Strong diﬀerences in happiness can
be taken as evidence against the spatial equilibrium. Given the diﬃculties in attributing heterogeneity in
self-reported happiness to small samples or local cultures, we focus on the narrower question of whether
happiness rises with income across areas.
   If the spatial equilibrium holds, we expect to find little or no relationship between happiness and area
income. Indeed, happiness may be a proxy for certain urban amenities, and then the spatial equilibrium
might predict that happiness should be lower, not higher, in richer areas. If there is a positive relationship
between income and happiness across areas, then this suggests either that the spatial equilibrium doesn’t
hold, or that diﬀerent people live in diﬀerent cities, or that happiness is not capturing welfare.
   Figure 4 shows the relationship between area income and area happiness for the U.S., India and China.



                                                       23
For the U.S., the relationship is positive but small. If the income of an area doubles, then self-reported life
satisfaction increases by seven tenths of a standard deviation. Certainly, given that richer places also have
people with higher levels of human capital, this is not enough to challenge the spatial equilibrium assumption
in the U.S.

   We do not have comparable data for Brazil, but an IPEA (2012) report finds that happiness is actually
lower in wealthy southern Brazil and highest in the country’s poor and rural northeast. This finding seems
to support the view that there is not a spatial arbitrage opportunity available in moving to Brazil’s wealthier
area. Other work (Corbi and Menezes-Filho, 2006) confirms that across individuals, Brazilian happiness
patterns resemble those in other countries, and that happiness rises with income at the individual level.
   The estimated coeﬃcient for Chinese cities is also on the margin of statistical significance, but the point
estimate is much larger. As income doubles, self-reported life satisfaction increases by more than five tenths
of a standard deviation. There is a great deal of noise in the Chinese data but the coeﬃcient is almost eight
times the size of the U.S. coeﬃcient.
   India displays a point estimate that is three times larger than the U.S., but the coeﬃcient is imprecisely


                                                           24
measured so that we cannot statistically rule-out a coeﬃcient smaller than the one in the U.S. It does seem
that richer cities are happier in the developing countries, more so than in the U.S., but the evidence is far
from conclusive.
   There are at least two interpretations of these results that are quite compatible with the spatial equilib-
rium framework. One interpretation, again, is omitted human capital, and in that case, richer cities have
people who are richer because they are more skilled and we might expect them to have higher happiness
levels. Another interpretation is that happiness is reflecting urban amenities, which are higher in richer
places. In that second case, however, the failure to find much higher prices in high income areas in India
becomes even more of a puzzle.
   The third explanation is that the spatial equilibrium assumption is just not particularly useful when
thinking about China, and especially India. Perhaps the most natural reason why the spatial equilibrium
assumption could fail is that mobility is limited, either because of strong tastes for remaining in places or
because of barriers to mobility like China’s Hukuo system. We now turn to facts about spatial mobility in
the four countries.


Mobility in the Four Countries
In principle, the spatial equilibrium does not require much mobility. Even if no one moves, housing costs can
adjust to keep welfare equal across space. However, immobility can be a sign that the assumptions needed
for the Rosen-Roback model do not hold. For example, if individuals were forbidden from moving across
state lines, then there would be no reason for utility levels to be equalized. Without labor mobility, regional
models revert to having the implications of national models, which certainly do not predict constant utility
across space.
   In reality, mobility is possible but imperfect, and when immobility is caused by heterogeneity of tastes,
then the implications of the Rosen-Roback model weaken. Imagine if villagers have the option to move to a
city but they have tastes for living in the village of their youth and those tastes are heterogeneous. The real
wage gap between the village and the city will equal the taste for the village held by the marginal migrant.
Strong tastes will mean that the real wage gap can be quite large, and immobility is a sign that tastes for
one’s home are strong. Moreover, there are good reasons to believe that the limitations on mobility diﬀer
across countries (Bell and Muhidin, 2009), which may explain the diﬀerences in the empirical value of the
spatial equilibrium concept.
   The U.S. has traditionally been a highly mobile nation, which presumably suggests that many Americans
have only weak tastes for their home locales. As Table 7 shows, according to the 2000 Census, 21 percent
of Americans lived in a diﬀerent county, state, or country five years ago. About one-half of these moves
were just across county lines, which could mean within a single metropolitan area. Still, about one-in-ten
American in 2000 had made a major move over the preceding 5 years. The figures were comparable in 1990
and for many previous years.
   In 2010, only 13.8 percent of Americans had moved counties, states or countries during the previous five



                                                      25
years. Only 7.1 percent had changed states or countries. While these figures are still relatively high by
global standards, they do represent a dramatic drop, which is presumably best understood as a reflection of
the Great Recession. Underwater homeowners may have been unable to sell their homes to move during the
downturn. Younger people often chose to stay at home during the recession to save costs.

   Comparable mobility figures for our other three countries are reported in Table 7. Again, the standard
is to use a retrospective question of current residents, asking them where they lived five years ago. Censuses
typically provide us with this information. We have attempted to use major and minor geographic units in
each country that are comparable to states and counties within the United States.
   Brazilians are mobile (Fiess and Verner, 2003) but they are less mobile than Americans. Brazil’s mobility
rate has also declined over time. In 2000, 9.1. percent of the population had made a major or minor move over
the previous five years. In 2010, 7.1 percent had made a major or minor move. Major moves are particularly
rare. Only 2.4 percent of the population had changed regions, and about one-tenth of one percent of the
population were international immigrants. The high fraction of foreign-born remains a relatively special
aspect of American society.
   In China, our data begins in 2000 and there has been a large jump in mobility between 2000 and 2010.
In 2000, 6.3 percent of the population had made a major or minor move over the previous five years. In
2010, 12.8 percent of the population had moved. Shen (2013) also documents this increase in mobility.
Somewhat remarkably, China is now a more geographically mobile county than the U.S., when we consider
only major moves. Chinese mobility is particularly remarkable because the Hukuo system limits the benefits
from moving. If American mobility supports a spatial equilibrium, then surely Chinese mobility does as well.
   By contrast, mobility is extremely low in India. Only two percent of the sample had moved during the
preceding five years in 2011, and that figure replicates results for 2001 and 1993. Less than one percent of the

                                                        26
population had made a major move. Munshi and Rozensweig (2009) also document a low Indian mobility
rate and suggest that immobility may reflect informal risk-sharing relationships in villages. There is very
little in-migration from outside the country. These low migration rates seem puzzling given the enormous
growth of Indian cities.
   It is quite possible that the Indian data actually understates the true amount of functional migration
that occurs. This data misses the temporary migrants discussed by Morten (2013). There could be other
measurement issues, like listing the migrant’s primary place of residence as their home village, even though
they are working elsewhere. It is also possible that the surveyors may have undercounted many of the
residents living in urban slums. Jedwab and Vollrath (2016) document that urban growth in India and
Africa is also driven by high levels of fertility, which suggests how India can combine low mobility rates and
substantial urban growth.
   The migration rates in Brazil and China are lower than migration rates have historically been for the
United States, but they are not dramatically lower than migration rates in the U.S. today. Consequently,
there would seem to be enough migration in those countries to make spatial equilibrium models sensible
tools for thinking about these countries. However, since China’s migration was much lower historically, it
may take some time for the process to fully equilibrate. By contrast, migration within India is quite low,
and this may help explain some of the Indian facts that seem at odds with the predictions of the spatial
equilibrium model.
   Data cannot prove that a spatial equilibrium exists, but in the U.S., a wide range of facts are quite
compatible with the existence of an approximate spatial equilibrium. Our reading of the data suggests that
assuming a spatial equilibrium is also reasonable in Brazil, where mobility rates are high and housing costs
track incomes. Even China, despite its regulatory limitations on mobility, seems to be moving towards a
spatial equilibrium. India is the big outlier, which systematically fails every test of the spatial equilibrium.
Perhaps, these failures represent human capital heterogeneity across space, or strong Indian preferences to
remain in birth locations.
   The absence of an apparent spatial equilibrium in India seems like an important topic for future research,
especially if the Indian results are duplicated for other extremely poor places. Tests that correctly support
the existence of a spatial equilibrium require both that a spatial equilibrium exists, which relies on factor
mobility, and that omitted heterogeneity is not so large that it drives the results. We suspect that the
spatial equilibrium may end up having relatively little empirical power in many places as poor as India
because there are profound limits on spatial mobility, deep social ties to place, and profound heterogeneity
in human capital and places.

V.       The Determinants of Urban Success: Agglomeration and Hu-
         man Capital
The spatial equilibrium represents one major part of work on cities within the wealthy world. A second large
body of research focuses on the determinants of success across space. One literature focuses on agglomeration
economies and why incomes appear to rise with city size. A second literature focuses on skills and urban
success, whether at a point in time (Rauch, 1993; Moretti, 2004) or dynamically (Glaeser et al., 1995). We
divide this section into three subsections, dealing with agglomeration economies, human capital externalities
and the connection between skills and growth in city population and incomes.


Agglomeration Economies
The core idea of agglomeration economies is that productivities increase when proximity to economic activity
is abundant. The strength of agglomeration economies helps to determine the actual and optimal size of
cities. If agglomeration economies are strong in Brazil, China and India, then this helps to explain why these
areas are urbanizing so rapidly. Strong agglomeration economies would also seem to work against policies
that act to limit the size of city growth.2
    The central fact that justifies economists’ belief in agglomeration economies is that wages are higher in
larger, denser cities. This fact is buttressed by the connection between productivity and city size and the
high commercial rents that are paid within city centers. There are two primary empirical problems with
interpreting high urban wages as agglomeration. First, some places may be intrinsically more productive,
causing wages to rise and density to form. Second, more able people may sort into denser cities.
    While there has been copious work on these issues for decades (Glaeser and Maré, 2001; Combes et al.,
2010), these issues are still not fully resolved within the U.S. We are not going to resolve them for Brazil,
China and India either. Our one approach to address causality is to instrument for current population and
density levels with historic values of population and density.
    The use of lagged population as an instrument does nothing for the problem of sorting into cities. Even
if sorting is only a contemporary event, this sorting may still be shaped by historic city sizes. It may slightly
reduce the problem of unobserved local productivity shocks if we believe that the shocks that are relevant
to current productivity are relatively recent and unrelated to historic population. We see this instrumental
variables strategy as a robustness check rather than as any proper solution to the two great problems inherent
with estimating agglomeration economies.
    Our goal remains a comparison of the four countries using standard methods, not advancing new methods
for solving old problems. As such, we will stick with standard—if flawed—approaches that are easy to

    2 Theory could justify such policies, even in the presence of agglomeration economies, if there are strong negative externalities

associated with contagious disease and congestion. In practice, they can be driven by non-welfare-maximizing motives, or have
negative unintended consequences. For example, in Brazil, Feler and Henderson (2011) document strategic under-provision of
water to small houses in likely low-income migrant destinations during the period 1980-2000. These “exclusionary policies”
can help explain the slower growth and the presence of informal and underserviced neighborhoods in economically successful
localities.


                                                                 28
replicate across countries. We will estimate the coeﬃcient on density and overall population size in diﬀerent
regressions. We do not see these two coeﬃcients as estimating diﬀerent things, but rather diﬀerent ways of
getting at the same concept of agglomeration.
   Each of these measures can be flawed, and it seems sensible for us to show results for both. For example,
consider two agglomerations that are intrinsically identical. In one case, the metropolitan area is drawn
to include a lot of extraneous farmland. In the other case, the borders are drawn tightly around the
agglomeration. The density level will be misleading here, but the population level will not. Conversely,
consider a case in which there are three distinct and identical agglomerations, two of which are grouped into
a single metropolitan area. Population will, in this case, be misleading since we are counting two as one, but
density will accurately capture the eﬀective agglomeration size.
   The first column of Table 8 shows the results for the U.S. All specifications include human capital controls.
The agglomeration elasticity coeﬃcient of log wage on either log density or log population is about .05. This
suggests that if either density or population size doubles, wages rise by about five percent. When both
eﬀects are included in the same regression, the coeﬃcient on each is about .03, but we think that these two
measures of agglomeration are too similar to put much faith in the ability of a regression to estimate the
eﬀects separately.
   In the second panel of Table 8, we show results using population or density in 1980 as an instrument
for population or density today. U.S. metropolitan-area population levels move slowly, so unsurprisingly
the coeﬃcients are quite similar to the results in the first panel. In the third panel, we use population
or density in 1900 as instruments. If anything, the coeﬃcients become slightly stronger but they do not
alter significantly. The core U.S. coeﬃcients are quite robust and don’t change much if we rely on historic
population levels for our variation in population or density.
   The second column gives results on Brazil. A meta-analysis by Melo, Graham and Noland (2009) has
shown sizable diﬀerences in measured agglomeration economies across countries, so we don’t expect this
elasticity to match that found in the U.S. Yet, the population elasticity is .05, which is essentially equivalent
to the U.S. The density coeﬃcient is .026, which is slightly lower than in the U.S. These coeﬃcients are
somewhat smaller than those estimated by Fontes, Simoes, De Oliveira and Hermeto (2009), probably because
they also include non-urban residents. The gap between urban and rural earnings in Brazil is enormous,
and much larger than in the U.S., but the relationship between earnings and density across urbanites is
somewhat weaker in Brazil than in the U.S.
   The second panel shows that using population and density in 1980 as instruments has almost no impact on
the estimated coeﬃcients. Using 1920 population and density as instruments cause the estimates coeﬃcients
to drop and become insignificant as shown in the third panel. One interpretation of that fall might be that
some of the current correlation between agglomeration and income in Brazil reflects omitted 20th century
local productivity shocks that pushed both variables in the same direction.

   The Chinese data, shown in the third column, is somewhat unusual. The coeﬃcient on area population
is larger than the coeﬃcients for either the U.S. or Brazil, but statistically indistinct from zero. This may
reflect much more noise in both variables. The coeﬃcient on density is extremely large, close to .2, and
statistically quite robust. Combes and Demurger (2013) also find an agglomeration coeﬃcient in China
that is roughly three times as large as standard coeﬃcients found in the west. In the second panel, using
1980 population as an instrument, we find that the population coeﬃcient is small and insignificant. Using
1950 population as an instrument, the population coeﬃcient grows dramatically and becomes marginally
significant. We suspect part of the issue is that many of the Chinese “cities” are quite large and may include


                                                          30
workers who are not really in the same metropolitan agglomeration. This would lead to measurement error
in the dependent variable, which should bias the estimated coeﬃcient towards zero. Alternatively, this weak
relationship may reflect an underlying non-linear relationship between population and productivity as found
by Xu (2009).
   By contrast, the density results are large and robust in all three specifications. The high coeﬃcients
suggest China is experiencing dramatic agglomeration economies, but that they are better measured by
density than total population. The density coeﬃcient is about four times higher than in the U.S., which
suggests that productivity is dramatically higher in places where population is concentrated. In the case
of China, the instrumental variable estimates help dispel the fear that this correlation is the reflection of
post-1980 political shocks to particular areas, like the special economic zones.
   Many other studies have also found agglomeration economies in China (World Bank, 2014). Pan and
Zhang (2002) use firm production data and show that as city size doubles, firm productivity increases by
3.6 percent. Lin, Li, and Yang (2011) find significant agglomeration economies in the textile industry. Ke
and Yu (2014) find that productivity growth is tightly tied to industrial agglomeration. Hering and Poncet
(2010) find that market access significantly determines wage diﬀerences across Chinese metropolitan areas,
which is one explanation for these agglomeration economies. Interestingly, Ke (2010) finds that it is the size
of the industrial sector, not employment density that determines productivity.
   The Indian results in the fourth column show agglomeration eﬀects that are somewhat larger than in
the U.S., which echoes the findings of Lall, Shalizi and Deichmann (2004). The coeﬃcients on both current
population and density are approximately .075, which is about 50 percent larger than in the U.S. In the
second panel, we use population in 1980 as an instrument, and the coeﬃcients increase in magnitude. The
coeﬃcient on population becomes statistically insignificant, however. In the third panel, we use population
and density in 1951 as instruments. The coeﬃcient on population rises further still and becomes statistically
significant again. The coeﬃcient on density remains quite close to the ordinary least squares estimate.
   One of the standard tests for examining whether the estimated agglomeration economies represent pro-
ductivity or sorting is to look at real wages. If workers in cities have higher levels of human capital then they
should earn more in real terms, not merely in nominal terms. If workers in cities are intrinsically identical
to workers elsewhere, then they should not be earning higher real wages. Naturally, one diﬃculty with
interpreting these real wage coeﬃcients is that higher real wages in cities might also reflect compensation
for adverse urban amenities.
   Table 9 shows the correlations between real wages and density in these four countries. Again, we use
historical values of density and population as instruments for the current population and density levels. We
also define real wage using the rent data as the logarithm of wage minus .33 times the logarithm of rents.
Appendix figures A.2 and A.1 show the relationship between area average log earnings residuals and area
urban population and area density, respectively.

   In the U.S., we find the real wages coeﬃcient of both variables is .02. The coeﬃcients remain about the
same using the 1980 value of population as an instrument, but the coeﬃcients rise significantly when we use
the 1900 values as instruments. These results diﬀer slightly from Glaeser and Mare (2001), who found no
relationship between real wages and area population across American metropolitan areas, and Glaeser and
Gottlieb (2006) who found that a real wage premium existed in 1970 but not in 2000.
   There are two natural reasons why these results diﬀer. First, real wages can be measured with significantly
more precision in the U.S. using better data, such as the American Chamber of Commerce Real Estate


                                                          32
Association price indices. We did not do that here to ensure comparability with other countries. Second,
in those papers the regressions are weighted at the metropolitan area level, while here they are weighted at
the person level. Nevertheless, these results still suggest that the majority of the agglomeration eﬀect in
the U.S. does not reflect sorting, since these coeﬃcients are so much smaller than the coeﬃcient on nominal
wages.
   For Brazil, there is no evidence suggesting that there is a real-wage premium in bigger cities. All of the
coeﬃcients are quite close to zero. This fact pushes against the view that the Brazilian urban wage premium
reflects omitted human capital characteristics.
   In the third column, we show results for China. In previous work, Au and Henderson (2006a) found that
real incomes initially rise with city size in China and then decline in the largest cities. This is consistent
with the fact that we find in our linear specification a negative but statistically insignificant coeﬃcient.
The density coeﬃcient remains positive, but is much smaller than the density coeﬃcient for nominal wages.
Unless amenities are much higher in denser areas in China, this suggests that most of the nominal-wage
premium received in denser Chinese areas does not reflect sorting of higher-ability people into those areas.
   Finally, the Indian regressions in the last column show that the nominal-wage premium in India that is
associated with both density and population is essentially the same as the real-wage premium. The results
are comparable when we use the recent lag of population as an instrument and implausibly large when we
use the long lag of population as an instrument. In a sense, these results are unsurprising given that we
have already seen that rents and incomes are essentially unrelated across Indian cities and real wages, in our
regressions, are just nominal wages corrected for rents.
   There are two plausible interpretations for this strong relationship between real wages and agglomeration
in India. First, it is possible that Indian urbanites do, in fact, have much higher human capital levels than
rural Indians. Migration rates are low, and education quality may be quite diﬀerent between urban and rural
areas. Second, it is also possible that our rent measures are so bad that these regressions have basically no
information value.
   We supplement these real-wage regressions with Appendix Figure A.3, which shows the connection be-
tween happiness and area population for the U.S., China and India. In the U.S., there is essentially no
correlation between area population and happiness, which corroborates the finding that there is little real-
wage premium in larger cities. The correlation for China is also statistically indistinct from zero. This finding
is corroborated by a small literature on happiness and urbanization within China. Knight and Gunatilaka
(2010b, 2010a) find that wealthier urbanites in China are actually less happy than rural dwellers, perhaps
suggesting that migrants are forgoing current well-being for future economic prosperity. Cheng, Wang and
Smyth (2014) find that second generation rural-urban migrants are less satisfied than the first generation
of migrants. Within India, however, there is a large correlation between self-reported happiness and area
population, which is consistent with the positive real-wage premium associated with area size in that country.
   Appendix Table A.1 repeats these regressions where rent, rather than income or real income, is the
dependent variable. Rents rise significantly with population and density in Brazil, China and the U.S. Rents
are unrelated to population and density in India. Again, this highlights the diﬃculties of using rental data


                                                       33
in the developing world.
   Taking this evidence at face value, it appears that agglomeration economies are stronger in India and
China than in Brazil or the U.S. There is some possibility that the robust agglomeration eﬀects observed
in India are driven by sorting. Still, there is every reason to believe that the literature that explains and
examines agglomeration economies in the developed world will continue to be relevant in the developing
world.


Human Capital Externalities
One prominent theory of agglomeration economies is that knowledge and ideas spread across space. The
theory also predicts human capital externalities: people who work and live in better educated areas will
themselves become more productive because they will accumulate more human capital. Rauch (1993) and
Moretti (2004) are two key contributors to this literature, which consistently estimates a significant relation-
ship between area-level education and earnings, holding individual-level education constant.
   Naturally, the same two problems that bedevil agglomeration regressions also trouble human capital ex-
ternality regressions. It is possible that some omitted productivity variable both disproportionately attracts
skilled people to an area and increases wages. It is even more likely that places with higher levels of educa-
tion also have people with higher levels of unobserved human capital. The issue of sorting on unobservable
human capital is even more severe than in the case of agglomeration economies, because the key indepen-
dent variable is the level of observable human capital, not the level of density. It seems quite likely that
unobservable and observable human capital move together.
   Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) attempt to address the omitted variables problems by using the variation
in compulsory education rules by state to estimate human capital spillovers. They find no spillovers with
this approach, but their source of variation is not ideal for estimating standard human capital spillover
models. For example, Glaeser (1999) provides a model of learning from neighbors in which raising the top
of the human capital distribution will generate spillovers, but raising the bottom of the distribution (which
is essentially the eﬀect of raising the minimum school-leaving age) will not. Moretti (2004) tries diﬀerent
instrumental variable approaches and finds consistent support for the existence of such spillovers.
   Again, we have no magic bullet for addressing the sorting and omitted variables problems. Primarily
for robustness, we will show two instrumental variable regressions as well as the ordinary least squares
regressions. We instrument using a recent but lagged value of the local education variable, typically from1980.
We also follow Moretti (2004) and use the demographic structure of the city as an instrument for education
in the second panel of the table. Specifically, we predict age-group shares of the area population based on the
population shares of each group in the area in 1980. We then attribute to each age group the education level
that is typical for that age group in 2010. Essentially, our instrument is the predicted instrument for the
area if it had kept its age structure from 1980 and if everybody had his or her age group’s average education.
In all cases, our education measure will be the share of the population with a post-secondary degree, which
has the advantage of being readily available and relatively comparable across areas.



                                                      34
   In Table 10 we present two columns for each country. In the first column we show the impact of
area-level education and the second controls for area-level density. In most cases, controlling for area-level
density makes little diﬀerence, since income is much more tightly linked to area-level education than area-
level density. The density coeﬃcients, however, typically fall when we also control for area-level education.
In the U.S., India and China, density remains significant and positive when we control for education. The
density coeﬃcient actually reverses sign in Brazil. Appendix Figure A.4 shows the relationship between area
average log earnings residuals and area-level education.
   The first two columns of Table 10 show our results for the United States. The first row in the first two
columns shows that as the share of adults in the area increases by 10 percentage points, wages increase by
about .10 log points or about ten percent, holding an individual’s own (measured) human capital constant.
These eﬀects are somewhat larger than those reported by Moretti (2004), where a ten percent increase in
the share of adults with college degrees is associated with an eight percent increase in earnings, holding
individual human capital constant. Perhaps the most natural explanation for this diﬀerence is that the
measured human capital externalities have been rising over time (Glaeser and Saiz, 2004).
   The estimated coeﬃcients when we use the 1980 value of schooling as an instrument for education
today are somewhat higher but not very diﬀerent than the OLS results. Using our demographically based
instrument, the estimate rises without the density control and falls slightly when we control for density.
Across all three specifications, the coeﬃcients with controls consistently suggest that earnings increase by ten
percent when the share of adults increases by ten percentage points, holding individual education constant.
   The third and fourth columns show our results for Brazil. In five out of our six specifications, the
coeﬃcients rate from 3.0 to 4.7, which is about three times higher than the coeﬃcients for the U.S. The
instrumental variables estimate that uses demographic composition is an outlier, with a coeﬃcient close to
seven. It appears clear that the estimated impact of skills on nearby earnings is higher in Brazil than in
the U.S. However, the variation in education across Brazilian cities is much smaller than in the U.S. (.033
vs. .06), so the impact of a one standard deviation increase in the level of education has only a 50 percent
larger impact on wages in Brazil, if we accept a coeﬃcient of approximately 3.5. It is also quite possible that
heterogeneity in unobserved human capital is larger in Brazil, which might also explain why the estimated
coeﬃcient is so large. Freguglia and Menezes-Filho (2012) estimate local wage eﬀects with migrant data,
and find that estimated local wage diﬀerences diminish significantly when they control worker fixed eﬀects,
which suggests that omitted human capital factors may be quite important.
   The fifth and sixth columns show results for China. We were unable to re-access the data, so we only have
the specification with recent density and with the instruments, not both together. The estimated human
capital spillover coeﬃcients range from 5.2 to 7.2, which are also much larger than in the U.S. If these
coeﬃcients are taken literally, then a ten percent increase in the share of adults with a college education
in a Chinese city is associated with an over sixty percent increase in earnings. These results are roughly in
line with the work of Liu (2007) who also finds large human capital externalities in China. Fu and Gabriel
(2012) find that the migration patterns of high-skilled workers suggest that they are particularly responding
to human capital externalities in China.

   The variation in education rates across cites is also smaller in China than in the U.S., but larger than
in Brazil. The impact of one standard deviation increase in area level education in China is associated with
a 20 percent increase in earnings if we use the most conservative estimate. The comparable figure with the
U.S. is a six percent increase in earnings.
   The same pattern reappears for India in the seventh and eighth columns. With the exception of the
demographically constructed instrumental variable regression, the coeﬃcients range from 1.9 to 3.2. These
are higher than in the U.S., but lower than either Brazil or China. A one standard deviation increase in area
level education (.033) in India is associated with an approximately seven percent increase in earnings, if we
accept a coeﬃcient of 2.1, which is only marginally higher than in the U.S. A ten percentage point increase
in the share of adults with college degrees is associated with a 21 percent increase in earnings, which is more
than double the U.S. figure.
   All three developing countries show a similar pattern. Education levels vary less across space than in
the U.S. The estimated eﬀect of area level education on wages is much higher than in the U.S. One class
of explanations for these diﬀerences assumes that these human capital coeﬃcients are largely spurious. A
second class of explanations assumes that they are real.
   For example, if we believe that the coeﬃcients are spurious because of sorting on unobservables, then
the correlation between unobervables and area level education is likely to be much higher in countries with
less variation in education. If the regression was univariate, then the bias created by unobservable human
                      Cov(Log(W age),U nobservable Human Capital)
capital would equal         V ar(Observed Human Capital)          .   If variance of observed human capital is small,
then the bias blows up proportionately.
   A second type of explanation assumes that the eﬀect is real. In that case, the high coeﬃcients might
mean that local human capital is more valuable in developing world cities than elsewhere. Local human
capital might be more important in places that have lower levels of development and less such capital.
   We will not try to resolve these issues here, but we believe that these extremely high measured levels of
human capital externalities especially in Brazil and China suggest that this is an important topic for future
research. If these results reflect a true human capital spillover, then developing world cities success really
depends on education. We now ask whether education also seems to have dynamic eﬀects on cities in the
developing world.


Urban Growth and Human Capital
While Gibrat’s Law tells us that urban growth is not correlated with initial population levels, a long literature
documents the connection between skills and subsequent growth within the United States and internationally.
Glaeser, Scheinkman and Shleifer (1995) documented the correlation between the share of adults with college
degrees and population growth between 1960 and 1990 within the U.S. Subsequent work (Glaeser and Saiz,
2004; Shapiro, 2006) has shown that this correlation persists for more recent periods, and that skills also
predict the growth of income at the local level within the U.S. Simon and Nardinelli (2002) show that 19th


                                                          37
century skills predict growth over the next century within the U.S. Using a sample of over 1,500 regions
from 83 countries, Gennaioli, La Porta, Lopez de Silanes and Shleifer (2014) also find a connection between
initial levels of human capital and regional growth.
    Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the skills-growth connection. Glaeser, Scheinkman and
Shleifer (1995) originally suggested that skills sped growth by encouraging the increase of local productivity.
Glaeser and Saiz (2004) find that measured human capital externalities have grown stronger over time.
Alternatively, skills may have also been correlated with amenities that have gotten more desirable, or with
good government. Our goal is not to distinguish between these hypotheses, but rather to look at whether
the skills growth connection also exists in Brazil, China and India.
    Table 11 shows our results when we regress population and income change between 1980 and 2010 on
the share of adults with tertiary education in 1980. We present four regressions for each country: one with
just education for both income and population growth and one with added controls, which is our preferred
specification. The added controls include initial income and population, as well as climate controls. Unlike
other regressions in the paper, Table 11 uses total rather than urban populations.3
    The first regressions in the upper panel show results for the U.S. A ten percent increase in the share of
the population with a college degree in 1980 is associated with a 17 percent increase in population between
1980 and 2010. This eﬀect is statistically and economically meaningful and it is shown in Figure 5. The
second regression shows that the estimated coeﬃcient increases to 2.16 when we control for initial income
and population. The t-statistic is over six, which indicates the strength and robustness of the connection
between skills and area population growth over this time period.
    The lower two regressions show the results for income growth within the U.S. The coeﬃcient on initial
schooling is .5. With the controls, the coeﬃcient rises to .9, which is both statistically significant and
economically meaningful. Ten percentage points more college graduates in 1980 is associated with about
nine percent higher income growth between 1980 and 2010. Initial income controls are particularly important
because income levels typically mean revert, and higher education area in 1980 also had higher income levels.
Controlling for initial income corrects for the mean reversion of income.
    Our next four regressions show the results for Brazil. The population growth pattern is similar to the
U.S., in that the correlation with initial skills becomes stronger when we control for other variables. A ten
percentage point increase in the share of the population with college degrees in 1980 is associated with about
49 percent more population growth between 1980 and 2010. The coeﬃcient increases to over five when we
control for other variables.




    3 In 1980 Brazil, China and India had much lower urbanization rates than the U.S., and urbanization rates diﬀered signifi-

cantly across areas. Regions with lower urbanization tend to have lower formal education levels (Young, 2013). If city growth
in low-urbanization regions is disproportionally driven by own-region rural-urban migration, there can be a spurious connection
between initial low area education levels and faster growth in urban population. Looking at total populations mitigates this
concern, and allows us to better approximate the growth eﬀect of human capital across areas.

   In the lower panel, we show the correlation between skills in 1980 and income growth across Brazilian
microregions. A one percent increase in the share of adults with college degrees in 1980 is associated with
an approximately 13 percentage point increase in income growth between 1980 and 2010. The eﬀect falls to
12 percentage points, when we add the other controls, but this is still 13 times larger than the coeﬃcient
within the U.S. If we think in terms of the impact of one standard deviation of the skill variable, which is
1.8 times larger in U.S. than in Brazil, these diﬀerences look smaller but still sizeable. Chomitz, da Mata,
de Carvalho and Magalhaes (2005) also find significant positive eﬀects of education on subsequent regional

growth in Brazil.
   Higher levels of skills in 1980 is associated with a relatively larger increase in population growth within the
U.S. and a relatively larger increase of income growth in Brazil. One possible explanation for this diﬀerence
is greater mobility of labor and capital in the U.S. If Americans move more readily, then America will see
larger population shifts and smaller income shifts than Brazil in response to the same local productivity
shocks. Greater labor mobility will smooth out the income diﬀerences.

   The third panel shows results for China, where education is even more strongly associated with population
growth. This result corroborates the findings of Fleisher and Zhao (2010) who show that both human capital
positively impacts both output and productivity growth in China. A one percentage point increase in the
share of adults with college degrees in 1980 is associated with 19 percentage points more population growth
between 1980 and 2010. The impact is even larger when we control for other initial variables. A one
standard deviation increase in an American area’s education is predicted to increase growth by about 12
percent over thirty years. A one standard deviation increase in a Chinese area’s education is predicted to
increase population growth by around 52 percent. Again, the Chinese data supports the view that urban

success is quite closely correlated with initial skills in the developing world.
   The lower two regressions for China show a somewhat more mixed picture for income growth. Without
other controls, there is a negative correlation between initial education and income growth across Chinese
cities. With initial controls, the negative eﬀect is much smaller and statistically insignificant.
   Perhaps the most natural explanation for the Chinese pattern is that cities were far from an equilibrium
in 1980, because of profound restrictions on mobility in China. In a world in which migration is initially
forbidden and where skilled cities are more productive than unskilled cities, allowing free migration will
cause the population of skilled cities to soar and the incomes of skilled cities to decline. As population flows
rapidly into skilled cities after liberalization, wages in those areas will consequently decline. Despite the large
population moves, skilled Chinese cities have also seen income increases which suggests that those areas are
also seeing some productivity growth, although not enough to overwhelm the impact of migration.
   The final panel shows results for India, where we only have population growth. Without other controls,
the impact of initial skills on population growth is weakly positive. With controls, the estimated coeﬃcient
becomes larger but still much smaller than in the other countries and statistically insignificant. As in the
human capital externality regressions, the link between education and urban success seems weaker in India
than in the other developing countries.
   Overall, however, this section supported the view that agglomeration and human capital are strong
determinants of urban success in the developing world. Area size is more strongly correlated with income in
China and India than in the U.S. and Brazil. Area education has a much stronger connection with income
in the developing world than in the U.S. Area education also strongly predicts population growth in Brazil
and China, if not in India, as well as income growth in Brazil. We conclude from these facts that the long
literatures on agglomeration economies, human capital externalities and growth and skills in the developed
world are likely to be relevant in the developing world as well.



VI.       Conclusion
In this paper, we performed three types of comparisons. First, we compared the basic patterns of urban
size and growth in the four large countries. Second, we looked at whether U.S. based tests of the Rosen-
Roback framework yield similar results in Brazil, China and India. Third, we look at whether agglomeration
economies and human capital externalities seen to operate similarly in the four countries.
   The Zipf’s law distributions were not identical across the four countries. Most notably, India and China
had too few ultra-large cities relative to what Zipf’s law would predict. The natural explanation for this fact
is that congestion disamenities would be too severe for cities of 50 or 100 million people. From 1980 to 2010,
Gibrat’s law seems to hold for the U.S. and Brazil, but not for India and China. Among Indian districts,
growth was larger in initially larger areas between 1981 and 1991, but smaller over the whole 1981-2011
period.
   The most basic Rosen-Roback fact is the strong correlation between income and housing costs across
metropolitan areas in the U.S., although even the U.S. quantitative relationship is too small relative to the


                                                        41
predictions of theory. The relationship between income and rents is similar in Brazil, China and the U.S.
India, surprisingly, shows no spatial relationship between income and rents, which may reflect data issues or
chaotic rental markets. In the U.S., real wages decline in places with better climates. This is not true in any
of the other countries. There is little relationship between income and happiness across U.S. areas, which is
also compatible with the spatial equilibrium. The relationship is stronger, though imprecisely measured, in
China and India.
   All together, the spatial equilibrium framework fits the data far more poorly in India than in the U.S.
and Brazil. China’s data is more consistent with the spatial equilibrium predictions than India, but not
as much as Brazil. One explanation for this failure is that unobserved human capital heterogeneity is far
more severe in India and China than in the more urbanized, richer countries. A second explanation is that
mobility is limited, either by rules, such as China’s Hukuo system, or by strong place-based preferences such
as those related to cast-based social networks in India.
   While the spatial equilibrium framework fares much more poorly in the less-urbanized developing world
data, the urban productivity and growth relationships are far stronger in those countries. For example, the
coeﬃcient when individual income is regressed on area density is around .05 in the U.S. and .03 in Brazil.
The coeﬃcient rises to .2 for China and .08 for India. We cannot rule out that this relationship is driven by
unobserved human capital, but we can say that the within–country link between density and prosperity in
these places does seem remarkably strong.
   Similarly, the connection between human capital and area success is also stronger in the developing world
countries. For example, the core human capital externality coeﬃcient, when log of earnings is regressed on
the share of adults with a college degree or more, is approximately one in the U.S., controlling for individual
human capital characteristics. In Brazil, China and India, the same coeﬃcient ranges from two to five. This
enormously strong link between area skills and area earnings, controlling for individual skill, may be driven
by omitted human capital but it is certainly worth of more research.
   As in the U.S., skill also predicts urban growth in Brazil and China. In our preferred specification, a
one percentage point increase in the share of college graduates in 1980 is associated with a seven percentage
point increase in population between 1980 and 2010 in Brazil and a 22 percent point increase in population
in China. The eﬀect is much weaker in India. Human capital is also strongly associated with income growth
in Brazil.
   Taken together, these results suggest that the U.S. facts do matter for the developing world, but they
matter more in some places than others, and they matter more in some areas of study than others. Across
the board, Brazil is the most like the U.S. and China is second most like the U.S. India is diﬀerent, probably
because of its extremely low mobility rates and much lower income levels.
   Our interpretation of these results is that skills and agglomeration impact productivity globally in rich
and poor countries alike, but that a spatial equilibrium evolves over time. In the poorest places, social
ties to home communities are strong. Historically, they provided safety and sustenance. As nations evolve
into wealthy market economies with more homogenous human capital, a spatial equilibrium may eventually
appear in countries like India, where it still has not emerged.

   Developing world urbanization is among the most important social phenomena globally, but we know
much more about developed world urbanization. This paper has shown that some, but not all of that
developed world knowledge can be exported to Brazil, China and India. The facts from the west must now
be supplemented with a robust research agenda on developing world cities.
