          We develop a model of aggregate supply and demand in the open economy

to explain the important characteristics of international macroeconomic

adjustment in the 1970s. Traditional demand—oriented models cannot account

for the worldwide phenomenon of rising inflation and unemployment in the

mid—70s, or for the failure of most industrialized economies to recover

from the deep recession of 1974—75. When aggregate supply is carefully

treated, it is found that much of the inflation and sluggish output per-

formance may be attributed to the jump in the real costs of intermediate

inputs and the failure of real wages to adjust downward after the input

price shock. A simulation model shows that fuel inputs are sufficiently

important in production that a large part of the worldwide recession may he

attributed to the change in the relative price of oil, since 1973. In an

empirical section, it is suggested that countries differ in their response

to supply shocks and macro—policies because of differences in key stuctural

relationships, particularly in wage determination.

SUPPLY VERSUS ULMAND APPROAChES TO TILE PROBLEM OF STAGFLATION*




INTRODUCTION


This   paper deals with the co-existence of inflation and unemployment in

industrial countries in the l970s. The period since 1972 marks a departure

from the previous decade in more than one important respect. It began

with an extraordinary spurt of inflation that in many countries is only

now receding. The inflation has been marked by great divergences in rates

between countries. It seems to be generally agreed that the oil crisis

and related events had a lot to do with this upsurge in prices and that

the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of pegged rates had a lot to •do

with the subsequent divergence of inflation rates. What is much more marked

and less well understood is the pronounced decline in output growth which started

with the worldwide recession of 1974-75. The GNP growth of the OECD

countries came down to an annual average of 3 per cent during 1973-78,

compared with about 5 per cent in the preceding decade. Productivity growth

rates came down even more, capital accumulation is still lagging, and above

all, unemployment rates, which more or less doubled since the l960s, are

on average still as high to-day as they were in 1974-75.

         A prerequisite for enlightened economic policy discussion is a

    reasonable understanding of the recent past, not only because past

    events might recur, but because it seems as if the industrial world has

    not yet recovered from the 1974-75 episode. The most natural reaction to

    persistent unemployment, for a world brought up on Keynes, is to think of

    it    purely   in terms of a shortfall in aggregate demand. The oil price
                                                                                   hike
    under    such a view, can be looked upon as an excise levied by OPEC on the
    industrial world, not enough of which has been spent to keep cconomc
    activity at earlier levels. According to this view the slack may be fully
    eliminated     with a sufficient boost to demand on a co-ordinated world scale

    (leaving aside special problems such as the uneniployment of the young or

 other particular social groups). Inflation persists because of strong

inflationary expectations following the commodity boom, but the inflation-

unemployment trade-off of the Phillips curve must, in this view, bring

inflation down. A more monetarist point of view, according to which there

is no such policy trade-off, gives a reasonably good account of divergences

in inflation rates between countries but is hard put to explain persistent

unemployment.

            In ourview,    stagflation cannot be understood only in aggregate demand or

purely monetary terms. Accelerating goods prices and increasing unemployment

suggest the co-existence of demand pressure in the commodity market and excess

supplyinthe labour market.' This is precisely thenatureofa real supply

I
        Stagflation   could be defined in terms of alternative combinations of
        either increasing or persistently high levels of unemployment and inflation
        (see Blinder, 1979).     Rather than sticking to a specific definition we
        prefer to state the events we are trying to account for: during 1973-75
        both unemployment and     the rate of inflation increased simultaneously;
        since 1975   inflation has been tapering off while unemployment remains high.

shock, suchaswascausedbythe rise inoil and raw materials prices in

l972..74.2 An increase in the price of a variable factor of production, such

as oil, may reduce profits, output, and the input of other variable factors,

such as labour, unless their relative price adjusts downwards. If real.

wages are sticky, which, by and large, they have been, unemployment will

result.

        Such a recession can further be exacerbated by restrictive domestic

demand management, which may be required to combat inflation and rising

current-account deficits, and by the accompanying fall in investment demand.

It is precisely because of the existence of demand-induced elements that

it is all too easy to attribute all of the unemployment to Keynesian

factors, although a large part it is really of a 'classical' nature.

That part caii only be eliminated by a fall in real wages or increased

capital accumulation, neither of which is likely to occur in the short run.

        Because supply shocks are a fairly complex and new problem a large

part of our paper (Section I) is devoted to a theoretical discussion of the

effect of supply and demand shocks in a representative open economy and the

various policy responses to them. This is done by means of a diagrammatic

exposition of a model presented in greater technical detail elsewhere.

It is followed in Section II by a brief study of global considerations and

multi-country interactions.

    The relative prices of raw materials have since dropped buck to their

    previous level, but the higher level of relative oil prices has so far
    persisted (see Table 5 in Section III).
    For earlier studies ofthe problem in a closed-economy context, see
    Gordon (1975), Phelps (1978), and Solow (1978).

         One may believe that a supply shock will reduce output in the short
run without being convinced that the 1973 oil-price rise played a major role
in   the world recession that followed. The quantitative evidence of Section

III argues that it did. There we present a realistic simulation model (for

a representative economy and for a two-country world) and some econometric

estimates of important relationships (labour market behaviour, investment

demand, etc.) for seven major industrial economies. It is important to

stress that countries will differ in their response to supply shocks and

macro policies precisely because of differences in one or more of these

key structural relationships.5

         The analysis in this paper is almost exclusively short-run in nature

An important issue, the long-term repercussions on capital accuiiiulation,

is only mentioned in passing. Likewise the long-run effects of current-

account imbalances and the important structural effects on developed

economies of LDC industrialization are left out of the present paper.




     Both Mork and Hall (1978) and Hudson and Jorgenson (1978) have found
     substantial real effects of energy price changes for the United States.
     Separate studies by the authors of this paper (Bruno, 1979, and Sachs,
     1978) have dealt with aspects of these relationships in other OECD
     countries. •

     For example, the United States may be characterized by nominal wage
     rigidity and may therefore be more output—responsive to monetary policy.
     Many European countries would be better described in terms of real wage
     rigidity and are therefore more likely to translate money growth into
     an immediate price rise.   It is certainly a mistake to base one's views
     on observations of only one country.

1.     2'JIE REPIiESENTATIVE OPEN ECONOMY




An understanding of stagflation necessitates a careful specification of

at least two markets, the market for final domestic goods and the labour

market. Our analysis here is based on a model that was laid out and

discussed in much greater detail elsewhere (Bruno and Sachs, 1979,

henceforth MEA). We shall concentrate mainly on a simplified diagrammatic

exposition, leaving the algebra and a quantitative amplification to Section

III.

          While discussing the individual economy it is easiest to consider

external market conditions as exogenously given; this assumption is relaxed

in Section II. We distinguish between two exogenous condriodity prices, the

foreign price of intermediate goods, later to be represented by energy,

and the foreign price of final goods. These prices, in logarithmic form,

will be denoted by p* and                    respectively. The relative price will be

denoted by ir (= p*       -
                              p*)•6   Intermediate goods are used as a major input

(n) in the domestic production of final goods (q), together with labour

() and capital (k). Intermediate goods may also be produced domestically
6
     We   shall use lower-case letters to denote logarithms of upper-case
     variables. Thus p* is the log of the price level                 and Tt   is   the

     lg of 11n =     p*/p*,   etc. The time derivative of a log variable will thus
     be the proportional rate of change of the underlying original variable

     [e.g.,
                 =   (dP/dt)/P   =   rate   of inflation].

 at the given world price and such import substitution (or even net export)

 may    provide one source of international differences in      industrial structure.
 Thesingle domestic final good, q, whose price is p, will be an imperfect
 substitute for the foreign final good in both consumption and exports. The
 domestic   price of the foreign good is (p* + e),      where e is the exchange
 rate   in domestic currency per unit of foreign exchange. The relative price

 of the final good (        -       - e),   or the terms of trade, will be one

 important endogenous variable to be determined in the commodity market.


¶he Commodity Mcrrket

The analysis    of the domestic final goods market (Figure 1) is best conducted
in   terms of the quantity supplied and demanded of the final good, q, and

its relative price, ir, as defined above.        Determination of i = p   -   e   -
                                                                                       p*)
is tantamount to the determination of the real exchange rate (e -
                                                                          p).         In

order to conclude something about the behaviour of the absolute price level,

 p, we still need a theory to determine the nominal
                                                            exchange rate, e.
Under a fixed exchange—rate regime it can be considered exogenous while

under a float it will be determined by money and an asset market and

therefore outside the commodity market. This will be discussed separately.

For the moment we only have to remember that         p = ir + p* + e and that for

given final goods price (p*) and given exchange rate (e) any change in the

terms of trade (ir) implies an equal change in the price level (p).           It is

ar:alytical convenience that suggests using ir        and   q, rather than p and
q,   on the two axes in Figure 1.

        Next we note that in looking at the commodity market we take the real

when the economy operates below capacity. As indicated earlier the            supply
curve is here drawn with the relative price of the intermediate good

(ii =     - p*)   and the real wage (Wc) as given parameters. Any increase

in one of these raises variable production costs and therefore shifts the

S curve up and to the left, while any increase in the capital stock will

shift the curve down and to the right.

        Let us next briefly summarize the demand side of the model. Consider

the main components of final demand: private and public consumption,

investment, and exports. Private consumption of the domestic good is

considered a positive function of real disposable income and a negative

function of the terms of trade (iT       p - e   -
                                                     p*)•   Exports are similarly a

positive function of world income (y*) and a negative function of            rr.



Investment is considered a negative function of the externally given

real interest rate, R*, and a positive function of the rate of profitJ°

        Once this subsystem is solved out it can be summarized in the          forri of
a   demand schedule, drawn in Figure 1 as a downward sloping curve D for

a given set of parameters. This curve will be shifted up and to the right

by an increase in external demand (y*), or by domestic fiscal policy (Z).'

Similarly a shift down and to the left may be caused by an increase

in the real interest rate (R*) or by an increase in the real wage (we).

The assumed sign of the latter in the demand curve comes from its supply

effect on the production and use of intermediate goods and through

          The role of the relative foreign price of intermediate
                                                                 goods is

ambiguous, because of conflicting forces at work. A rise in                       at a

given production level of intermediate goods will depress the real income and

consumption of a net importer of these goods while the substitution effect

and a possible increase in the domestic production of intermediate goods

will work in the other direction. For a net importer of intermediate goods

                                                thedemand curve is thus likely to
shift to the left with an increase in          ii    .    For a net exporter of
                                                 n
intermediate goods or for an economy in which there is considerable domestic

substitutability the shift may go in the other direction.'3 For most OECD

countries the first is the more likely.

          Consider now the effect of two kinds of possible changes in the system.

An import price shock,, involving an increase in the relative price n'

shifts the supply curve unambiguously to the left (see the shift from S

to St in Figure la), leading to excess demand of the amount AA' at the

initial price ir.       lf, as was suggested, demand also contracts as a direct
effect of the rise in       Tr ,   excess demand will be reduced, but the new
                             n
equilibrium at point A will in any case involve a reduction in output.

What will happen to the relative price ir                is not clear; if, as is likely,

the supply curve is relatively flat and the effect on the supply curve


12
     If there are marked differences between the propensities to consume out
     of wages and out of profits the direction might be reversed. This
     possibility is ignored here.
     For the same reasons the demand curve may itself be upward-sloping (see
     MEA).

dominates the demand shift, x will rise;'4           in the

opposite (and for an OECD economy less likely) case, where import prices

are demand-expanding, the terms of trade will obviously rise but the net

effect on output is ambiguous.

         Consider the importance of the degree of real wage stickiness in

this analysis. While we have not yet considered the labour market, it is

clear that unless there is a strong substitution effect, an output

contraction will reduce labour demand and press downward on real wages.

Assume now that nominal wages are downward flexible or that the unexpected

price shock causes a momentary reduction in real wages. In that case there

will be a force working in the commodity market in exactly

the opposite direction to that of the import price shock (consider the

signs attached in Figure 1 to shifts in we). One would obviously expect

to find different patterns of real wage response to the import price shock

in different countries (see Section III).

         It is important to point out that this analysis of the effect of a

rise in import prices is confined to the short-run implications. For

example, a fall in the rate of profit and a contraction in output, in

addition to their immediate effect on investment demand (see below), may

eventually cause a fall in the capital stock, k. Also, changes in the

current account may have repercussions on domestic real wealth, thereby

affecting the demand curve. These are ignored here.


    We   should   remember that the absolute price level, p. may rise even when
    the relative price, rr, falls, provided the domestic price of the final
    export (import) good, p + e, rises sufficiently (which has certainly
    happened in all OECD countries in the 1970s).
 +                                 - 12   -




       The commodity market representation of the effect of a supply shock

 is the key to an understanding of the difference between
                                                              stagflationary
 effects of the kind that affected OECD economies in the early 1970s and

 the more conventional business-cycle demand fluctuations which are either

 inflationary or deflationary in both commodity and labour markets.

A rightward shift in the demand curve will by itself raise prices (unless

we are in a flat section of the supply curve) as well as final output

 and employment (unless we are hitting        a    full   employment ceiling);
But consider now the more relevant case of a demand contraction coming

from either domestic demand restraint (Z) or from a contraction in world

demand (y*)• In Figure lb this is represented as a shift of the demand

curve from D to D' causing excess supply of the amount AA at the

given initial price ratio fl.

       If prices are downward flexible the relative price would fall to        ir,

with equilibrium at A'. But suppose prices (p) are rigid so that at given

     and e, the relative price stays temporarily at u. In that case

output would be constrained by demand and would fall from q         to q, with
unemployment of the conventional Keynesian kind resulting (see further

discussion below in the labour-market context). Firms would like to sell

more but are unable to do so. At point A          (Figure ib) they are, at least

temporarily, not on their supply curves. This is in marked contrast with

the previous case where output contraction originates from a supply shock.

      During the 1974-75 recession there was clearly a combination of a

supply shock with a concomitant demand contraction coining from the

cumulative income reduction in all OECD countries. This was compounded

by a fall in investment and in some countries (notably the United States)
+                                          -13-                                        +




by domestic fiscal and monetary restraint as well. For this reason it is

easy to fall into the trap of attributing all of the unemployment to a wore

conventional demand contraction combined with downward price rigidity. As

pointed out by Malinvaud (1977), until recently the experience of the

industrial countries has been confined to alternations between situations

of Keynesian unemployment or inflation. The developments of 1973-75 mark

a departure from this pattern.

         An import price shock, as we have seen, is most likely to cause a

rise in the relative domestic price level             p - e -      For a given e
and p* the nominal domestic price level will rise. However, it is

important to note that neither the observed price rise nor the intercountry

differences in inflation rates since 1973 can be explained without recourse

to the monetary mechanism and exchange—rate behaviour under a flexible rate

regime. For the determination of e,                  attention must focus on the   asset
markets,      to which we turn briefly.

         Current theory and available evidence stress that the exchange rate is the

relative price of national moneys. One important element of exchange-rate

determination is then the relative growth rates of money stocks. Our model,

like most, has the characteristic that a money supply increase in one

country leads in the long run to an equiproportiona]. depreciation of its

exchange rate and a rise in its domestic prices. Since p and e rise

by the    same amount, p   -   e   -
                                       p   and output are unaffected in the long run

by the   money supply increase.
         In   short run, though, the determination of domestic prices and
              the

the   exchange rate is more complicated. Let us trace through the effect of a One—
shot increase in    the domestic money supply. Initially,       domestic   interest
 +
                                           -l4                                       +




 rates    tend to fall. But given world capital mobility, there is an attempt

 to transfer funds to world assets, which have
                                                       a temporarily higher rate of

 return. With floating rates, the exchange rate depreciates (e rises);

 in fact, e continues to rise until the expected returns of domestic and

 foreign assets are again equalized.

          As e rises, import prices and the consumer price level rise. If

 nominal wages are sticky, w -              falls and the terms of trade worsen,
                                      PC
 i.e., p - e    -
                    p     falls. Domestic prices do not immediately rise in

 equal proportion to e.                    As    real wages are restored, w

 increases, pushing up the domestic price level in        the   process. Eventually,
p and e rise in the same proportion as the original
                                                                money supply change.
 If the real wage is fixed in the short run, then the domestic price level

almost immediately rises in proportion to the depreciation. This is, of

course, the familiar vicious circle of depreciation and domestic inflation.

         Once it is recognized that a significant part of the rccession was

classical and supply-determined, i.e., directly tied to too high real wages,

the inflationary consequences of expansionary monetary policy are highlighted.

It is important to remember, though, that
                                                  expansionary monetary policy may
have some effect on output in the short run, and that for countries like

Canada and the United States, with sluggish nominal wage change (see Section

III), the inflationary effects of the money expansion might initially be

small.

         The three   kinds of shift discussed here (import price shock, exchange
rate   adjustments      and demand contraction) go quite a long way in explaining

both the deep recession of 1974-75 and the intercountry differences in

rates of inflation. But before turning back to these let us consider the

implications for the   labour   market, which in many ways mirrors the effects

already considered in the commodity market.


The Labour Market

The    curve Ld in Figuie 2 represents     the usual downward sloping   marginal
product curve here expressed in terms of the real consumption wage (w) rather
than the real Product wage (w - p).'5 The curve is derived from the
                                                                           commodity
supply   schedule. The direction of the shift caused by changes in the

relative   price r     is again ambiguous because of the conflicting income and

substitution effects. It should be noted, however, that final goods

production may fall with a rise in          and yet labour demand may rise if
the substitution effect is strong enough (see, for example, Hudson and

Jorgenson, 1978). However, the most likely case for an OECD country with

low elasticity of energy Substitution is an unambiguous leftward shift in

the demand curve for labour.      In Figure 2a, which illustrates such a shift,

the result is excess supply (unemployment) of the amount BB at the

initial level of real wage w

        A new equilibrium full employment at B' could be reached after a

process of downward real wage adjustment. Alternatively, if capital is a

complementary limiting factor, capital accumulation might eventually help

to shift the labour demand curve back and thus reduce unemployment. It is

doubtful whether such a corrective mechanism would come about by itself,




15 This is done to conform to the concept of real
                                                  wages that is most
     appropriate from the point of view of labour supply behaviour (see
     curve L5 in Figure 2) and the dynamic adjustment process.

and in any case either adjustment process would be slow to come about.16

Another option for a single country, at least in theory, would seem to

be the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy, in the commodity

market this is represented by a rightward shift of the demand curve leading

to an increase in    both   output (q) and prices (     and therefore p). As

the    final goods price also appears as a parameter of the labour demand
curve (see Figure 2), this expresses itself as a shift back to the right
of    the Ld curve and a reduction in unemployment. The implied cost

in higher prices      and a greater current-account deficit makes this an

unlikely policy to follow for any length of time. Besides, as we shall

see below (Section II) it cannot be adopted by all supply-shocked countries

simultaneously;      when the relative price,      ir, rises in one country it

must fall in the rest of the world.

        If output in the commodity market happens to be temporarily constrained

on the demand (and not on the supply) side, which is the Keynesian

case, producers will not be on their supply curve and the

relevant demand schedule for labour will be represented by the steeper

curve marked L in Figure 2, whose position will be determined mainly

by the demand variables (y*, Z).17


16
     As far as capital accumulation is concerned, the movement was, if
     anything, in the opposite direction (see Section JIl).
17
     The capital stock, k, and the relative price, r, now appear as leftward
     shifting variables while ir     is again ambiguous but more; likely to
     shift the curve to the left. The relative slopes of the curves Ld
     and L     are implied by the assumption that the positiveresponse of
     output supply to a fall in real wages dominates the response of output
     demand.

Figure 2b), with rigid real wage, brings about Xeynesian unemployment of

the amount BB, if Ld stays put. The case represented in Figure 2a

may more appropriately be termed classical unemployment, having been caused

by a shift in the whole marginal product schedule. With both types of

shocks present in the 1974-75 recession it       is,   of course, difficult to

assess how much of the unemployment at any point in time or in any specific

country may have been Keynesian or     classical,18     but it is important to

stress that given the existence of a supply shock, unemployment cannot be

cured only in a Keynesian fashion, for reasons that have already been

mentioned and to which we shall return later.


General Equilibrium


The determinants of the exchange rate and the concomitant development

of the balance of payments have been described only briefly. In 1EA we

model the deterininnts of the exchange rate under the assumption of perfect

capital mobility.

        To get a better idea of how   the various   parts of the   system
are linked, consider a simplified flow-chart of our representative open

economy (see Figure 3). The top part of the chart shows the main links

from the costs of production (raw materials and labour) to the price level

(positively) and the level of output (negatively). Output in turn affects

thedemand  for labour and imports. Both the demand for and the supply of
labour are affected by the (real) wage rate which in turn is adjusted in

    and above the classical unemployment BB.

a dynamic process by the resulting disequilibrium in the labour market as

well as by the extent of price-wage linkages. Lower down, the chart

indicates the main      links   from the demand side (fiscal and monetary policy,

exports) to output. The direct link to prices is likely to be weaker if

the supply schedule is relatively flat. The foreign sector is represented

by the components of demand for real imports'9 and        exports;   these are domestic

or world income as well as the real exchange rate •and foreign prices.20

       The   exchange   rate, in turn, may in principle be affected by both the

balance of payments (capital flows are not directly shown) as well as by

monetary policy, in case of a float.

       The 1973-75 story can be started from an exogenous increase in

external import prices (see the bottom part of the chart). Domestic import

prices, which are also determined by changes in the exchange rate, affected

the price-wage-price system and led to an output reduction. The latter was

exacerbated by an accompanying demand shock largely caused by a contraction

in the world market. Countries differed in their response because of

differences in three inaor areas: the nature of the price-wage linkages,

the effects on the current-account balance and the closely related monetary

policy and exchange rate response. The latter accounts for a substantial

part of intercountry differences in inflation rates.




19 No separation into intermediate and final imports is shown here nor is
    the link from the domestic price level shown.
20 The link from the current account to the exchange rate has not yet been

A    flow-chart such as Figure 3, though    simplified,   may still obscure

the most important issues. The feeling of not being able to see the wood

for the trees may intensify as we proceed, in the next section, to discuss

a quantitative simulation model. One may-sometimes get a nutshell

description of what has been happening even with the aid of one curve and

a very small reduced-form model, albeit at the cost of considerable

oversimplification. Before we plunge into detail let us therefore consider

a summary figure with a familiar pair of axes--average inflation rates

and rates of deviation of manufacturing
                                            output from capacity growth.

starts curving back in 1969, with a fairly flat upward drift in both

inflation and output deviation. From 1972-73 on one obtains the perverse

bell-shaped curve, which is familiar from the experience of so many

countries.22

     A diagram of exactly this kind,averaging the figures of seven major
     cOuntries, as well as individual country pictures appeared in the
     McCracken Report (OECD, 1977). It is worth noting that the Report had the
     figure drawn only up to 1976, with an arrow (and a question mark) pointing
     in a clear southwest direction signifying the hoped-for move "towards
     price stability and full employment." Subsequent developments in 1977
     and 1978 have not exactly fulfilled that promise.

              what     is   the simplest kind of model that can explain such unusual

 behaviour? The broken line in Figure 4 is a prediction based on

         The price equation can he derived from a straightforward price-

adjustment relationship with price expectations and a wage-adjustment

equation built into It.2k The output equation is based on the

output-adjustment relation involving both the negative import cost-push25

and the various demand—pull elements (fiscal and monetary policy, export

demand). The model is highly simplified and suffers from some obvious

statistical deficiencies (one serious problem is that of pooling different

countriest observations into one regression).26 However, it does give

quite good tracking of the curve in Figure 4.      It should also he noted

that the 1978 prediction is a true prediction lying outside the sample

period 27

         Suppose there is no change in import prices and exchange rates

     =      =   = 0).   In that case the pair of price and output equations

2L+ The above pair of equations was selected frbm a preliminary empirical
    study (Bruno, 1979) in which a number of alternative equations were
    estimated for prices, output, wages, and the exchange rate. When a
    money-determined exchange-rate equation is substituted for the exchange
    rate in the price equation during the floating period (after 1972), the
    end results are similar. An attempt to put in separate
    demand elements (Z) into the price equation failed. Even money by
    itself is barely significant. Its main role after 1972 seems to come
    via the exchange rate effect on import prices.
25 Real wages came out negative but statistically nonsignificant and were

    therefore deleted from the equation.
26 The study attempts to deal with this by introducing dummy intercepts or,
    in some cases, allowing for different slopes.. The best alternative,
    which we have followed here, is to look in greater detail into the
    experience of individual countries.
27 The model was also used to texplaint price and output developments in
    the United States, which have followed a similar pattern.

 should   trace patterns that would look more or less like conventional

 Phillips   curve behaviour. •Ihe main driving     force bchind the   system   in
 the    l970s was import prices,28 which   are   the important missing third
 dimension in Figure 4. Their sharp movements have Pushed prices up and
 output rrowth   down,   with lagged wage and price adjustments delaying the
 exit from accelerated inflation.

         It can be seen from the output equation that a change in the relative

 price (p1/p) of the order of 30-40 per cent as in 1973-74 induces a
5-7 per cent drop in q. This accounts for between 40 and 60 per cent of
the reduction in manufacturing growth in these countries in the 1970s, with
world    demand and domestic fiscal and monetary restraint
                                                              making up varying
amounts of the rest. The rise in the relative price of at least •one major

input, energy, has not been reversed since 1974. This explains, at least

partly, that while inflation rates were back t pre-1973 levels by 1978,

considerable unemployment remains in the system. It is a 'real' structural

phenomenon, not one that can be explained, or
                                                    cured, by purely monetary
or even fiscal means. In Section III we present a more detailed quantitative

attempt to trace the dynamics of a macro system under alternative external

shocks. But before that we have to extend the analysis to the many-country

case.

rr.       THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD AND MULTI-COUNTRY INTERACTIONS



Once we move from a single economy to the whole industrial world neither

the world price, level nor world income can be assumed to remain exogenous.

Countries can no longer be assumed to determine their ternis of trade and

real incomes independently of each other. In what sense then, if at all,

can one aggregate the effects of exogenous shocks across countries?

           Before considering multi-country interactions it is helpful to discuss

a highly abstract model in which the whole industrial world is aggregated

into one consolidated economy producing a single final good q at price p,

and trading with a single 'OPEC' hich is assumed to command sufficient

monopoly power29 to determine the relative price (n =
                                                                                   p   -
                                                                                           p) of its only

export, the intermediate good.3°

           Since there is no distinction between                          domestic and traded final goods

the real product wage (w - p) is now the same as the real consumption wage

w and theworld                  final-goods supply schedule can be represented as a

function of the real wage (we), the relative intermediate goods price (Tr)

and the exogenous capital stock (k).3' If OPEC can fix                                      and the real



29 This assumption is crucial for what follows, and it seems to be realistic
      as far as oil prices are concerned.
30 All nominal variables will be expressed in unitsof the single industrial
      world currency (SDRs, say) so that in terms of the previous model we can

      yirite   e =     0,       p =   p.       We ignore the existence of other L[)Cs.
31 In the log-linear case which forms the basis for the underlying
      quantitative model one can write the supply curve in the form: qS
      =
          -b(p1
                  -
                      p)    -   c(w   -
                                          p)   +   k.     In the present simple world model this can
      also be written as q5 =                             -        + k.

wage is rigid, aggregate supply is unambiguously determined. The aggregate

supply curve can be drawn as a vertical line in a price-quantity diagram

(see curve S in Figure 5). Note that it is the absolute world price

level that now appears on the vertical axis.

        To obtain an aggregate demand curve we follow logic similar to

that        applied earlier to the single country case, but, with some

modifications, Instead of taking the real world interest ratc(R) as

given in the investment function we can write R =                  -e        where i    is

the nominal interest rate and e are inflationary expectations. Next

we solve for the nominal interest rate by appealing to a money-market

equilibrium condition.32 After substituting in the investment function and

using a Keynesian aggregate demand framework the quantity demanded

can finally be written as a negative function of real import prices (Tin) and

the real wage (we) and as a positive function f the various demand shifting

elements: fiscal policy (Z), exports to OPEC (x), the real money stock

Cm -   p)   and price expectations (be)         In the p-q diagram this will be a

downward sloping curve D with nominal Cm) rather than                  real    (m -   p) money
as one of the parameters.33

        Consider now an exogenous increase in the relative import price
                                                                                         Ttn'

The supply curve shifts leftward from S to S', while the demand curve

will most probably also shift to the left (from D to D'). The extent

of the shift depends on the real wage response, as before. The equilibrium

point will move from A (q, p) to B (q, p).


32 This can be written in the form m -
                                       p =             Oq   -   Oi.
    A similar closed-economy framework was recently used by Phelps (1978)
    to analyse the implications for monetary policy of an exogenous
    productivity change.

           There are a number of important points to note. Consider first the

unambiguous contractionary effect on output which is wholly supply-

determined, given real wage rigidity. The effect on the price level is

more ambiguous since it depends on the relative strength of the impact

effect on real income and demand as against its effect on supply.3

           With   the   new equilibrium at B, what will happen if an attempt is

made to boost demand? An accomodating monetary policy can be represented

as an increase in m shifting the demand curve back to D. All that would

happen in this case is a further rise in the price level to the full amount

of the increase in the money supply (see the move from B to E in

Figure 5, with prices rising to p). Fiscal policy (Z) will likewise

raise interest rates and force up prices by a crowding-out process. Finally,

greater recycling of OPEC surpluses can here be represented by an increase

in x, again with no expansionary effect on out'j)ut. If the industrial

world is on its supply schedule, an increase in output can come about oniy

as a result of a fall in real wages or a rise in the capital stock.

           Is this a realistic description of the main factors underlying the

recent world recession? Let us repeat two qualifications. First, note

that to the extent that there is nominal wage rigidity monetary policy may

cause real wages to fall, through a price rise, and thus have an expansionary

effect. The second, more important, point is that there could be a

Keynesian recession on top of a classical one. Suppose, for example, that

the    leftward shift of      the demand curve takes the form of a further move   to
D" (because        the effect of the supply shock on real income is stronger or

'     It   also depends on what happens to the expectations term (he) and
      exports (x).

                                                                policy). With prices rigid at p,
 say, the extra fall in output from c                                  to q           marks a Keynesian type of
 demand deficiency with more unemployment in the labour market. It is only

the BC (q               -
                            q)   portion of output slack in Figure 5 that could be                                aken
up by non-inflatioi-iary      expansion of demand. Again there is a hard core
 (q       -   q) that cannot be eliminated.
      Looking at the industrial world as one country obviously precludes
discussion of some important questions relating to the interactions between
different industrial economies. Short of specifying a more elaborate

multi-country model we shall consider briefly the case of two interacting

industrial countries of the kind                                  discussed in Section j35

              Suppose now that relative prices are defined in relation to a world

final-goods price p, measured in some unit of account (e.g., SDR). Assume

also that the world final-goods price level is defined as a weighted

average [log-linear with weights y and (1 -                                   y)]      of the two country export
prices, so that we can write p = y(p                               -
                                                                        e)    + (1 -      'y)(p       -

         This curve differs from a conventional production possibility

frontier        in that the real                 costs of labour (w                     ,    w           ) and the real cost of

A rise in                 TI       shifts            the curve inwards from                                     IS   to TS'   if
the two real wage levels are downward rigid. Suppose the original world
equilibrium was at point A on the curve TS (for determination of the
demand side see below) and as a result of an import price shock is now at

A' on IS' after a contraction of output in both countries. But suppose

the second country now attempts to regain its previous output level (q)

by boosting its domestic demand. Quite independently of any balance of

payments problems (to which we turn later) this can only take place at the

expense of the first country's output since a gain in one country's terms

of trade must be the other country's loss (shift from A' to B in Figure 6).

         This highly simplified argument again shows the fundamental difference

between a supply shock which affects the structure of the industrial world

and between demand shifts which, except for temporary Keynesian Situations,

can ultimately be no more than beggar-my-neighbour cures. Given the rise

adjustment in the real wage in at least one of the countries or by capital

accumulation.

       Is there any point in co-ordinated world expansion except to prevent

beggar_niy_neiglibour results? Again the answer is that when a supply shock

is accompanied by demand contraction, the system may well find itself,

temporarily, in a Keynesian unemployment situation. It terms of Figure 6,

this would be represented by a point such as C inside IS'. Expansionary

policy may then increase output in one economy without necessarily causing

a contraction in the rest of the world (see the movement from C to      13



in Figure 5). One reason why this may very well require co-ordinated

expansion has to do with the current-account
                                               implications of confiningan
expansion to one country while the other remains stagnant. We shall turn

to some quantitative simulations of a two-country world at the end of

III.     fl]ULATICIv MODEL AND EM?1RIC.4L ANALYSIS




The graphical analysis of Section I is based on the detailed model in MEA.

In   this part of the   paper we discuss the empirical relevance of the same

model.     First, the   model's parameter values are selected to describe a

'representative'     OECD economy. The   response of this economy to a doubling

of oil prices is studied under a variety of assumptions about labour

market dynamics. A second economy is then added and we illustrate how

multi-country interactions affect our numerical estimates. Throughout this

section, we also appeal to the country data to support the general structure

of the simulation model (for further empirical results, see Saclis, 1979).

         The simulations convey a clear message: fuel inputs are sufficiently

important in production, and the 1973 oil pricE rise was of such magnitude

that a large part of the 1974-75 recession is directly attributable to the

change in the relative of oil. While monetary policy was contractionary

in most countries in 1974, the simulations suggest that even with

accommodative policy the 1974-75 recession would have been severe, with

significant classical unemployment.

         The dynamic response and   long-run    behaviour of the economy after ar

OPEC-like disturbance are shown to depend heavily on the behaviour of

wages, both nominal and real, For our small representative economy, with

world prices and income given, a fall of I per cent in the long-run real

wage increases employment by 0.65 per cent. The approximate doubling of

the real price of oil in 1973 is calculated to require a 6.4 per cent

decline in    real   wages to maintain employment in the home economy. In the

 two-country   setting, the wage effect is even more powerful. When real

 wages fall by 1 per cent in both countries, output in each increases
                                                                          by
 2.3 per cent. The doubling of oil prices requires a 3.5 per cent decline

 in real wages in both countries for full employment to be restored.

       In Section I, we suested that       an economy's response to external
 shocks is influenced by a few key structural characteristics. For example,

the more dependent the economy is on net fuel imports, the more

aggregate demand declinesafter an oil price increase. In drawing lessons

from the representative
                           economy, it is important to keep in mind how

individual OECD economies differ from the average case. In addition to

the price simulation model, then, we describe in this section key structural

differences between the OECD economies that may explain some of the variety

of macro-economic experience in the past six years.


The Representative Economy:    Aggregate Supply

In this part, parameter values are assigned to the theoretical model. On

the supply side, domestic final goods are produced with labour, intermediate

inputs, and fixed capital. For the empirical simulations, we treat fuel

as the only intermediate input. A two-level
                                               production process is specified.
Capital and labour combine to produce value added; in turn, value added

and fuel are used to produce the final
                                         output: q q[v(, k), n]. For
concreteness, the value-added relation, V, and gross output, q, are described

as constant.elastjcity_of.5ubstjtution functions of their respective

arguments (see note 38).

     The role of oil prices in
                                  aggregate supply determination depends on
the extent to which labour and fuel can substitute for the fixed factor k.
+




Suppose, for instance, that capital and energy are used in fixed proportion;

while capital and labour are partially substitutable. Then oil is also a

fixed factor, tied to capital. The cost of a marginal unit of output is

just the labour cost, since fuel and capital costs are fixed; fuel prices

do not enter marginal cost. Alternatively, suppose that oil is used in

fixed proportion to output. The share of fuel costs in the marginal unit

of output is then equal to the share of fuel costs in the average unit of

output, i.e., the share of total fuel costs in total revenue. In general,

the less substitutable is n for k relative to the substitutability of

2 for k, the smaller is the effect of fuel prices on marginal cost)8

        Most empirical evidence suggests a low short-run elasticity of

substitution of capital and energy, 0k' and a somewhat higher elasticity

    The technical argument is as follows, For a two-level CES production
    function we write final output Q as a CIS function of value added, V,
    and intermediate input,                              N. In turn V is produced according to a
    CES function of L and K (fixed). Thus, QP =                                                   aV   +    (1   -

of    substitution of capital and labour,   GkR,.39 ork and hall (1978)
assume that energy is used in fixed proportion to output, while value added

is a Cobb-Douglas function, i.e., labour and capital have constant shares.

We relax the first assumption, allowing a 1 per cent increase in the real

price of energy to decrease the energy—output ratio by 0.2 per cent. We

keep the assumption of a constant equilibrium share of labour in value

added.

         The aggregate production technology is fully specified by selecting

initial factor shares for labour, energy, and capital. For the

representative economy, the labour share in value added is put at 0.69,

and the capital share at 0.31. At initial equilibrium, the marginal

efficiency of capital is set at 0.1 per cent (Feldstein and Summers, 1977,

calculated VIaK = 0.11      for the United States). The ratio of capital to
value added is then equal to 0.31/0.1 =     3.1.    A good approximation for the
share of fuel in the gross output of the major OECD economies is 0.05.0

     The net input of energy is measured as the sum of net imports of energy

     trade of ISIC category 3, 'funeral fuels'.     To this is added domestic
     production (from U.N., World Energy Supplies 1977) valued at world
     prices. For 1975, energy inputs as a percentage of GN1 were found to
     be: United States, 9.3; United Kingdom, 9.9; France, 4.6; Germany, 6.1;

                                                                                  .1.

This share increased substantially after the 1973 oil price hike,

indicating low short-run substitutability of energy for other factors.

We assume for simplicity that there is no domestic production of energy.

         After normalizing the variables at initial equilibrium the main

aggregate    supply equations       are given by:


(1)         q = 0.617    +   0.55    +    0.OSn


(2)         p = -0.359       + 0.946w +
                                           °°54n + 0.44q.

The first expression is the (log) linear approximation      of aggregate supply.
For    a fixed capital stock, a 1 per cent increase in labour input raises

output by 0.65 per cent, and a 1 per cent increase in fuel use raises output

by 0.05 per cent. Equation (2) is the price equation for a profit-

maximizing firm.         Factor prices are extremely important in determining

the output price. Wage costs are almost fully passed through: with our

assumptions, a 1 per cent increase in nominal wages causes a 0.95 per cent

increase in output prices. About 5 per cent of a fuel price increase shows

up in the final-goods price.' The level of output also affects p.

Because the capital stock is fixed, marginal costs increase with output,:

each 1 per cent increase in output raises the marginal cost, and the

                                                                                    f

          It   is illuminating to rewrite (2) as a supply function:


(3)            q =   0.82   -

This equation describes output as a decreasing function of real factor

costs. For a given product wage (the wage deflated by domestic output

prices), a 1 per cent increase in the relative price of oil causes

aggregate supply to fall by 0.12. Let us now introduce the (log) consumer

price index, as a weighted sum of domestic and
                                                                          foreign final-goods prices,

(4)            PC = O.667p + O.333(p* +                   e).

We can now rewrite output supply as a negative function of the real wage,

a negative function of the world price of fuel, and-a positive function of

the terms of trade, as was shown graphically iii Figure 1:


(5)            q = 0.82     -

42Econometric studies find a significant effect of energy prices on final-
      goods prices (see Mork, 1978b, for U.S. price equations). On the other
      hand, positive output effects on prices have not been as clearly
      dcnionstrated (see the  discussion in Mork, l978b, p. Il). In our own
      econometric     work, reported in Sachs (1979), we find that a fixed-markup
      e4uation, i.e., one without output effects, does not describe the
      1974-75 price behaviour adequately. In a markup price equation a dummy
      variable for 1974-75 is consistently negative. This suggests that the
      recession did in fact lower markups, as equation (2) predicts.

Wage   Determination

The aggregate supply side is closed by       positing   a wage-determination

process. It was shown in     Sections   I and II that the response of wages to

the oil shock is crucial for the dynaniic adjustment of output. Real wages

must fall after a supply shock for full employment to he maintained. To

the    extent that nominal wages adjust slowly to price movements, part of
that real wage decline can be effected through expansionary monetary policy.
To the    extent that wages are indexed, so that real wages adjust slowly

while nominal wages are flexible, monetary adjustments lead only to

compensating price movements, without affecting real output. Indeed, if

real rather than nominal wages are rigid, a sustained period of unemployment

might be necessary to restore equilibrium wage levels after a. supply

disturbance (see also Bruno, 1978).

         Many writers have speculated as to whethr actual wage processes are

more accurately described by wages following past wages (wage-wage process)

or current price expectations (wage-price process). The wage-wage process
corresponds to nornina7    rigidity   in that the real wage can be affected by

anticipated monetary policy. We speculate that the wage-wage process results

in large part frbm the existence of overlapping long-term contracts in the

labour market.43 Until the mid-1970s, aggregate real wage growth was so

constant that the two hypotheses could not be econometrically distinguished.

The increased variability in real wages since 1973 allows a partial answer tO

the question. Indeed, the evidence suggests that different, countries have

significantly different degrees of nominal rigidity.

      See Taylor (1978).   It will be shown later that of the large OECD economies,
      only the United States and Canada exhibit a wage-wage process. Only in
      these two countries is there widespread use of overlapping long-term
       labour agreements with relatively little indexing.

        We    assume that firms are never rationed in the labour market so that
        observed      labour input, £,            equals labour demand. Workers supply the demanded
        level   of labour services, though the demand might be gr-'ater or less than

of the countries, and declined slightly in the United States and Italy and
more sharply in Japan. The acceleration occurred in spite of a massive supply

shock, high unemployment, and adverse productivity changes. After about

eighteen months of recession, wages began to decelerate in the four countrie.;

in 1976, and continued to do so in 1977. The first notable point is that reil

wage growth declines slowly in response to excess supply in the labour market.

            Econometric evidence allows us to measure the real wage response to

unemployment and price changes. Phillips curve regressions are shown in

Table 2."' Canada and the United States display an aggregate wage

determination process that is distinct from the others. In these two

countries wage inflation is essentially unaffected by the level of lagged

unemployment, for given rates of past wage change and expected inflation.

Both countries also display a combined wage-wage, wage-price process. For

the other five economies, lagged unemployment has a significant depressing

effect on current nominal wage change. Equally important, a                              is small

(even negative) and is not statistically significant for the other five

economies, so that lagged wane inflation affects current wage change only

through its impact on expected price inflation. The estimates of

suggest that the oil shock may have had a direct effect on Japanese and

Italian wages, which did not operate through unemployment or price

inflation.

            The implication of these regressions is best seen by rewriting (6)

as a real-wage equation:

 If    2
           > o policy—makers can reduce the real wage through inflationary

 policy, even if the policy is fully expected. Expansionary monetary policy

 will raise income (see Sachs, 1978). On the other hand, for a =
                                                                 0, the
 real wage is invariant to expected
                                        inflation; a monetary expansion will
 lead only to an equiproportiona
                                     change in the exchange rate and domestic
 prices.

       We suspect that much of the difference in the macro-economic policy

 recommendations cf American and European economists stems from the

 difference in the behaviour of their
                                         respective economies reflected in
      In the United States
  2                          monetary policy is effective, while in most

European economies, monetary policy probably operates chiefly on prices

and not on output.


Aggregate Demand and Investment Behaviour


We complete the simulation model
                                by specifying the determinants of aggregate
demand. Since the demand side is less novel than the supply side, we

proceed quickly.

      Aggregate consumption and final-goods imports are functions of disposabie

income and the final-goods terms of trade. It is assumed that total

household absorption is equal to 90 per cent of disposable income. The

division of household expenditure between
                                                 imports, Cm) and domestic goods,
c, is assumed to depend on relative prices. A 1 per cent increase in

world prices relative to domestic prices is assumed, in the long
                                                                 run, to
cause a 0.8 peient decline in the ratio of imported to domestic goods

in the consumer basket.
                          Export demand is made a unit-elastic function of

world income and the ternis of trade.

      The investment demand equation is important in view of the central role
                                          - 46    -




of declining investment in       the   1974-75 downturn. Unfortunately, a
theoretically      sound investment equation requires a long-run model, with

explicit paths of capital accumulation and equity prices (see Blanchard,

1978). A less rigorous formulation is to write inv.stment as a. function

of    the ratio of th current marginal product of capital to                  the current
long-term cost of capital. If we can assume perfect capital nobility,
the    domestic long-term cost of capital is given approximately by the world

1evel.5         For reasonable parameter values, we derive the following
investment schedule:6

(9)           log(I) =   -0.23 - 1.09(w -             008n -   p) -   6.5k.

           The regressions in Table 3   show that this extremely simple investment
model can track much of the movement in fixed investment demand in recent
years.       Notice that the coefficient of the worLd     cost   of capital, proxied by a

U.S. long-term real interest-rate measure, is negative and of reasonable
magnitude.       The two real factor cOsts enter with     appropriate    negative

      The investment     demand equation follows Kouri (l978a). iven with perfect
      capital mobility, the domestic and world cost of capital need not be
      exactly equal. One can show that countries with worsening terms of
      trade will have slightly higher long-term interest fates than countries
      with improving terms of trade. Moreover, differences in tax treatment
      of corporate income can create differences in the cost of corporate
      borrowing,   even under perfect capital mobility.
k6
      We   take investment demand to be a constant-elasticity function of
      (Q/k)/kc with elasticity 0.5 .              For a firm on its supply curve,
      Q/K K'[Q - L(Q/L) - N(Q/N)]             =   K'(Q - LW/P - NP/P). Thus,
      Q/aK,    the marginal product of capital, is also the profit per unit of
      capital. Now, Q, L, and N are functions of W/P and Pa/P by
      earlier   arguments. Upon substitution for Q,       L,   N, and linearizing
      about   the initial equilibrium, equation (9) is found.

 p - p     also reflects the effect on I of the 1974-75 world recession.

 Finally, n - p         might proxy for long-run expectations of profitability,

 affecting I through stock-market prices.

        According to the investment equations, it was not because of excessive

real interest rates due to contractionary

in 1974 and 1975; the Fcldstein-Surnmers (1978) measure of the real long-

term interest rate fell from an average of 4 per cent for 1966-73, to 2½

per cent for 1974-76.

        The simulation model is closed by specifying the asset demand

structure and the process of expectations formation.         For the simulations,

we assume a pegged though adjustable exchange rate. Assuming perfect

capital mobility, the domestic short-term nominal interest rate is equal

to the world level, as long as there is no expectation of devaluation. In

our theoretical work, we spell out the dynamics of a freely floating

exchange rate, which can easily be simulated.

        The entire model is now set, forth in Table 4. All equaUons are

(1og linearized at the initial equilibrium.

the world   price of the intermediate good. Table S shows the dramatic
changes in    the relative price of fuels and other primary commodities from

1972-78.     Energy prices, for which the simulation is designed, more than doubled
between 1973 and 1974. Tn the following years, the relative price of oil
fell   by 10 per cent (and it     increased    again in 1979). Other primary
prices   displayed a more dramatic boom and bust, rising sharply in 1973-74,

and then falling sharply in 1975, with the onset of the world recession.

Our simulation considers a permanent doubling of world energy prices,

although the rise in all the other prices contributed to the world

stagflation, and their fall, no doubt aided the partial world recovery.

        For our representative economy, the oil price rise requires a 6.4

per cent decline in real wages for full employment to be restored. Even

with long-run inelastic labour supply, output falls 0.8 per cent, because

of substitution away from energy inputs. If the labour supply is perfectly

elastic, with real wages fixed at' their pre-shock level, output declines

by 4.5 per cent. Because the model is linear, we conclude that each 1

per cent fall in real wages boosts domestic output by 0.58 per cent.

       The detailed discussion of short-run dynamics is postponed untilthe

two-country case. Here, we make some general observations about dynamic

adjustment. The wage determination process is important for the short-run

response of the economy to the price-hike. In the model, the oil price

rise is calculated to cause a one-year blip in the consumer price index

of about 1.5 per cent. Real wages fall in the year of the Price rise,

because (a) the blip is unexpected       and (b) wages follow lagged wages

as well as current prices.7 If nominal wage change is linked half to

expected price and half to expected wage changes (a =                     0.5 in the wage

equation), the unexpected jump of 1.5 per cent in the CPI in the year of the

oil price hike causes a 1.1 per cent fall in real wages in the sameyear.

As discussed in Section I, this temporary decline in w -                     c      mitigates

the contractionary effects of the shock.

        If long-run labour supply is highly inelastic (a                         0), it is likely

that real wages, although unexpectedly reduced, are still above the

equilibrium level (2,S > d) given the sharp increase inunemployment in

the year of the shock. As w - PC                     falls in succeeding years, so does

p - e   -
            p.   With fixed e and p, the nominal price level p declines.

On the other hand, if workers try to make up for the temporary decline in

real wages (consistent with an elastic long-run labour supply), inflation

will continue in future periods as w -                      p   rises. It should be remembered,

though, that the behaviour of the                   price   level is determined more by the

exchange rate e than by the real terms of trade, p - e                       -

        The importance of the exchange rate in domestic inflation is shown

by a simulated 10 per cent devaluation. Real wages fall temporarily and

output and employment expand. In our representative economy, the

devaluation causes an increase of about 5 per cent in prices in the first

"   The size of the real wage decline in the year of the shock depends upon
    the extent of the formal indexation provisions in labour contracts. In
    our model, nominal wage change is linked to expected price inflation by
    the term (1 - a       ) (e     -
                                       p        )   in   wage equation (8). In the simulations

years. The  latter price increase is brought a1out by the rise in
real wages, generated by the rise in demand for labour after the
devaluation.

Simulation Resu its for the 2o-Country Model


In Section II, we described how an import price shock can shift a many-

country aggregate supply frontier. Following a suggestion of Fair (1979.)

it is easy to illustrate the interactions between countries with our simulation

model.      We link the industrial economy to a mirror image1 making the

exports of one equal to the imports of the other. Various experiments are

then performed by changing the structural labour market characteristics

in one of the countries. In this model, we assume that the two industrial

countries import oil from OPEC, which export oil but not industrial goods.

At this point, OPEC consumption behaviour is not modelled; we assume for

simplicity that oil revenues are saved in the short run (no new theoretical

issues are raised by including OPEC spending on industrial exports).

         For two identical economies, the effect of a real oil price shock is

easily adduced. Assume that the price of oil doubles in terms of a basket

of the two countries' final goods, with each final good having equal weight

in the basket. We again appeal to the aggregate supply relation (5).

Since the countries are mirror images, the terms of trade, p             -   p   -   e, must
remain unchanged, by symmetry. Also, w - PC         15   fixed   in the short run,

by assumption. Therefore, the output effect of the oil shock is


(10)              =   _______ -        = -(O.l2)log(2.O)   =   -0.083,

i.e. 8.3    per   cent.
                                             - 56   -




          An 8.3 per cent decline in output might seem rather large. Of course,

at this point real wages have n,t been allowed to decline at all in reaction

to the jump in unemployment. Each subsequent fall of 1 per cent in the

real wage in both countries produces a 2.3 per cent increase in output.

Real wages must decline at least 3.5 per cent in each country for full

employment to he restored.

          What happens to the     world    real rate of interest along the adjustment

path? Simply, k          falls if the global aggregate demand effect exceeds

the aggregate supply effect just measured, as would be the case for the

real interest rate in a closed-economy model. Given our
                                                                   assumptions,

the deflationary demand effect of the oil shock dominates after the first

year. Real interest rates jump 40 basis points in the year of the shock,

and then fall 120 basis points in the two succeeding years. Very modest

support for this effect is offered by the nieastires of the U.S. long-run

real interest rates in         Feldstein   and Summers (1978). They find that the

long-term U.S. corporate bond rate minus the rate of long-term expected

inflation fell from an average of 4.1 per cent for 1966-73, to 2.6 per cent

for 1974-76, after the oil shock.

          When the economies have different fiscal policies, different rates

of domestic energy production, or different patterns of real wage change1

the final-goods terms of trade vary during the adjustment path. Consider

the case where the home country has rapid real-wage adjustment and inelastic

labour supply, while the foreign country has slower wage adjustment and

long-run labour supply inelasticity.8 The effect of the oil shock is

illustrated       in Table 6.   'Ihe initial 8.3 per cent output decline is the

same in both countries. At home, w - PC            falls more rapidly and output

expands more quickly. Since long-run w - PC            is lower at home, long-run

output is higher.

         The following results, easily established analytically, are suggested:

1. A real wage decline in one country causes real income to rise in both

       countries.

2. A long-run real wage increase in one country lowers real wages in the

       other. '

3.     The economy with the larger real wage decline, ceteris paribus,

       experiences a    trade surplus; the other economy, of course, has an

       equal and opposite deficit.

A fourth proposition, not evident from the table is:

4. The economy with greater domestic produc"tion of oil experiences a

       smaller decline in output than does the other.

         Flow does the simulation estimate of an 8.3 per cent impact effect on

output compare with actual magnitudes of output decline in the industrial

    economies? Table 7 gives a very rough measure. Actually, the 8.3 per

    cent is a mid-range estimate of the decline of GNP relative to trend for

the four countries. One interesting source of intercountry variation is

Canada. The recession in Canada is late and relativ.ly small. This is no

    doubt a reflection of our proposition 4: Canada is a net exporter of



       When both countries have long-run labour supply inelasticity, real wages
       must decline by 3.5 per cent to restore full employment. Now the
       country with inelastic labour supply experiences a 5.0 per cent wage
       decline, because real wages fail to drop significantly in the other

       economy.

energy resources. The calculations are meant only to hint at plausible

measures for the output decline in the recession years. We are now

preparing   a more detailed inter—country comparison of output   and price

responses   in the 1970s.
      As a final experiment, consider the case of Hxcd exchange rates and
sticky nominal wages. The oil shock has a less contractionary impact effect
than is reported above. Assume a given world stock of money and Cambridge
                                                                 0.2

money demand functions in each country of the form M = PQ              ,   where

0.2 is the assumed short-run income elasticity of demand for money. The

decline in output that follows the oil shock will cause prices to rise.

With two identical countries, each 1 per cent decline in income leads to

a 0.2 per cent rise in prices. The unexpected rise in prices following

an oil price increase will reduce real wages in the short-run, as in the

one-country model. When short-run indexation (see note 47) is 0.5, a

doubling of oil prices causes a 1.4 per cent unexpected spurt in prices.

Real wages are reduced by 0.5 X 1.4% = 0.7% in the first period.

Consequently, the output decline is reduced from 8.3 to 6.7 per cent in

the first year.

 I!'.    CONCLUDING i?LMAI?]W


 This    may be an opportune moment to suggest directions for further research.

 Theoretical models of open economies must be extended to allow for both

 classical and Keyflesia11unem)loyment, whose relative importance has been a

 general issue in our paper. Econometric work might be used to determine

 more precisely how much of the 'great recession' was in fact classical or

 Keynesian. New statistical techniques for markets in disequilibrium offer

 tools for careful empirical research in this direction.

        Our simulation did not address the sharp temporary rise in non-fuel

commodity prices in 1972-73, though that temporary shock raises important

questions. Its additional effect on to!) of (and preceding) the oil price

rise was to deepen the stagflation of the mid-l970s. Once world output fell

and excess supply of those commodities forced their price down, the effect

on domestic final-goods markets would imply a rightward shift of the supply

curve. With domestic prices rigid downward, a ratchet effect may have

developed, turning a temporary supply shock into more permanent Keynesian

unemployment.

        Next we note the pc!ar view of exchange rates as either determined by

perfect capitai mobiiity or fixed. The role of the current account and

imperfect capital mobility, along the lines recently modelled by Kouri

(l978b), should be explicitly incorporated into the system.

        On the basis of the preliminary
                                          comparative country estimates given

here, especially with respect to labour market behaviour, it can be seen that

there is room for considerable additional analysis of the differences in

patterns of institutional behaviour and policy responses between countries.

        Let us stress again that this paper has explicitly confined itself to

short-run   aspects of economic developments. One central long-run issue is

that of capital accumulation. For a full analysis of a supply shock,

explicit account irust be taken of the repe:'cuss.ons cn long-run capacity

and growth levels. It seems very likely that OECD countries have not only

suffered a short-term set-back but are now on a !ower long-run growth path

although oil alone cannot explain that.

     As a final long-run issue with short-term nolicy implications one

should mention a development which has become               important in

the 1970s. We have in mind the internal structural implications for. the

highly industrialized economies of the rapid growth of manufacturing

exports by semi-industrialized LDCs. These have been completely ignored in

the present paper although for. some OECD countries, this is gradually

becoming a major issue. In at least one respect, however, the analysis of

this quesion would fall quite naturally into the general approach that we

would like to advocate. Short-term price and output adjustments and real

structural changes may be very hard t- keep apart..
