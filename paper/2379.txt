                 Debt Problems and the World Macro Economy




                                 ABSTRACT




        This paper investigates the role of interest rates, commodity prices,

growth in bringing the debt crisis about and how they facilitated or made more

difficult the first five years of adjustment. We also ask whether and how the

world macroeconomy is likely to contribute to the solution of the debt problem

in the next five years.

                The paper starts with a conceptual framework and a review of

the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in the past quarter of a century.

Next the origins of the debt crisis are discussed as well as the adjustment

period, 1982—1987. The following part reviews alternative scenarios for the

period 1987-90 and their bearing on debt questions. We also ask what

contribution to expect from commercial policies. The paper concludes

pessimistically that for many debtors there is not a sufficient improvement to

be expected from good performance of the world economy.

        This paper discusses the role of world macroeconomic factors in

contributing to the debt crisis. We investigate what role these factors———

interest rates, commodity prices, growth—- played in bringing the debt crisis

about and how they facilitated or made more difficult the first five years of

adjustment. We also ask whether and how the world macroeconomy is likely to

contribute to the solution of the debt problem in the next five years.

                The paper starts with a conceptual framework and a review of

the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in the past quarter of a century.

From there we proceed to a discussion of the origins of the debt crisis, and

to the adjustment period, 1982—1987. The following part reviews alternative

scenarios for the period 1987-90 and their bearing on debt questions. We also

ask what contribution to expect from commercial policies. The paper concludes

pessimistically that for many debtors there is not a sufficient improvement to

be expected from good performance of the world economy. This makes it

necessary to find mechanisms tho make it possible to bring about a reversal

of resource flows.



I. EXTERNAL DEBT AND DEBT CRISIS: A FRAMEWORK



        In this part of the paper we set out a conceptual framework to discuss

debt problems and the macroeconomic background to the debt crisis in 1979—82.
                                       2




1. A Conceptual Framework

        The balance of payments and national income accounts provide a basic

framework of analysis. The identities-relations which are true always and

anywhere by accounting definition—-are an objective conceptual setting.

        There is a debt problem when a country cannot service its debt on the

contracted schedule. Debt service difficulties may either be an ability to pay

the principal of a maturing debt, as is the case for Colombia or Venezuela

today, or an ability to pay both interest and principal. We focus here on debt

difficulties of the more serious kind where interest cannot be paid. The

reason is that difficulties in   paying    principal, when interest is regularly

paid, should not present any difficulty since rolling over is a routine

operation. The only reason difficulties with principal can become debt

problems is if creditors wish to limit their regional exposure and hence

insist on payment of principal even from those countries who are good debtors.

        Focusing on interest payments, the current account of the balance of

payments can be separated into two components: the noninterest current

account (NICA) which includes trade in goods and in all services except

interest payments on the external debt on the one hand, and interest payments

on the other. Interest payments can be financed by noninterest surpluses or by

net capital inflows:


(1)    Interest Payments =   Noninterest Current + Net     Capital
                             Account                   Inf low
                                      3




The category "net capital inflows" includes four categories: reserve

decumulation, direct foreign investment inflows, longterin portfolio inflows

and short or medium term borrowing abroad which is often called "new money".

In the debt problems of the interwar period or the period preceding 1914 new

money took the form of a "funding loan". Today it is concerted or involuntary

lending by the commercial bank creditors and multilateral institutions.

        Table 1 shows these current account components for problem debtor

countries in the 1978—87 period. 1

                                          4




string of deficits until 1982 to a series of surpluses. In the period up to

1982 both interest payments and the noninterest deficit both need financing

and hence are reflected in a rapidly rising debt. Since 1983 a large part of

interest is paid by noninterest surpluses and hence the increase in debt is

sharply reduced. But debt is still rising, reflecting the financing of the

remaining interest payments not met by the surplus, and the financing of

capital flight and reserve build—up.

           Payments     Account                                  Inflows


The category "other net capital flows" is typically very small. There is

little room for reserve decumulation and longterm capital flows tend to be

small. The only time other net capital flows assume importance is in the case

of capital flight or, less frequent a repatriation of capital.

         The discrepancy between the current account on one side and the sum of

net borrowing plus non—debt creating inf lows (chiefly direct foreign

investment and official aid) represents reserve changes and capital flight.

         The noninterest deficit is often called the net resource transfer

since it measures the net imports of goods and services (other than interest)

over which a country acquires command. Noninterest deficits are the normal

pattern for developing countries in which saving is low relative to

investment. Noninterest deficits are the channel through which resources are

transferred from rich to poor countries to support capital formation and

growth in the developing world. Private and public lending forms the

financial counterpart. Using the national accounts identities we can represent

the financing of investment from the resource point of view as is done in (3)

below.




(3)      Investment =   Saving   +   Real Resource Transfer
                                     From Abroad




         Table 3 shows the real resource transfers and the investment rates for

Latin America. The Table brings out strikingly the decline in investment as a

counterpart of the real resource transfer abroad. The shift in resource

transfers is almost exactly matched by a decline in investment.
                                    6

Noninterest Surplus                —0.6              4.7




        The essential distinction between pre—crisis and post—crisis is the

turn of the net resource balance. Now debtor countries are making net

resource transfers to creditor countries.



2. Debt Crises

        Any debt crisis involves the inability of debtors to meet timely

payments of interest and principal. Thus the gap between interest payments

that are due and the noninterest current account (NICA) is the chief

characteristic of a debt problem. Four factors then can be identified as

leading to a debt problem:

        .   With an unchanged willingness to roll over debt and provide a given
flow of new money, an increase in real interest rates raises the financing

requirement. The imbalance between new money requirements and credit

voluntarily supplied brings about a debt crisis.
                                      7




           • A deterioration in the noninterest current account, because of

domestic macroeconomics or because of a worsening in the terms of trade or a

fall in export demand, opens a financing gap,

           • An increase in world inflation leads to an increase in nominal

interest rates and hence to an early real amortization of the external debt.

Although real interest rates are unchanged there is a cash flow problem for

debtors.

           • With an unchanged interest rate and noninterest current account

creditors decide that exposure is excessive and therefore limit new money

commitments and require that maturing principal be paid off.

           We now proceed to identify the impact of world macroeconomic events

on debtor countries. Specifically, given policies such as the real exchange

rate and fiscal policy, how has the world macroeconomy been one of the factors

in leading to the debt crisis, how has it influenced the evolution of the debt

problems since 1982 and what implications can be anticipated from alternative

scenarios of the world economy in the coming years? World interest rates,

growth and commodity price trends are at the center of the discussion.

        But a special interest attaches to their joint behavior. For example,

if the interest payments a country owes increase but the noninterest deficit

also increases. At the same time creditors become unwilling to increase their

exposure. The financing equation then no longer adds up and something must

give. When a debt crisis occurs and outright default or arrears are not the
                                     8




answer creditors are often coerced into involuntary lending and debtors

undergo adjustment programs to turn their noninterest deficits into surpluses.

Creditworthiness is to be reestablished. Now debtors have noninterest

surpluses which finance the interest payments. But there may still be a part

of interest payments financed by net capital inflows or "new money".

        With this background in mind we now turn to the main world

macroeconomic variables that had an influence in creating the debt crisis.



II. THE WORLD MACROECONOMY: AN OVERVIEW

        Figures 1 to 4 highlight the chief external variables for debtor

countries——the interest rate, the real interest rate, the real price of

commodities and world economic activity. In Figure 1 we show the London inter

bank offer rate for dollar deposits (LIBOR). The contribution of interest

rates to the debt crisis is shown by the peak level of an interest rate in

excess of 18 percent in late 1981.

        The interest rate effects appear through two separate channels. One is

associated with the level of nominal rates, given the real rate of interest.

When higher inflation increases the nominal interest rate the effect on

debtors is a shortening of the effective maturity of the debt. The real value

of the debt is amortized at a faster pace. As a result debtors may experience

liquidity problems.

        Interest rates also, of course, hurt debtors when real rates increase.

In this context it must be decided in terms of which rate of inflation the

real interest rate should be assessed and there is considerable difficulty in

identifying the correct inflation rate. Alternative candidates might be the

debtor countries' GNP deflator in dollars or the rate of inflation in world

trade. We chose here the latter series and it is shown in Figure 2 together

with the Libor rate. The behavior of the real rate is, of course, striking in

that the sharp increase in nominal rates was accompanied by a falling level of

prices in world trade. The combination implied that real interest rate facing

debtor countries were much higher than 20 percent per year.

        Figure 3 shows the real price of commodities. The series shown here is

the 1MF index of all (non-oil) commodities deflated by the export unit value

of industrial countries. Commodity prices show a steady decline since their

peak levels in 1973—74. By late 1986 they had fallen to only 40 percent of the

peak level. But in the early 1980s, when the debt crisis first broke out, the

real price of commodities did not show a dramatic deterioration. Commodity

prices thus are not an immediate source of the crisis but they did become

relevant later in raising the costs of adjustment for several debtor

countries.

        Figure 4 shows world economic activity measured by the index of

industrial production in the industrialized countries. The behavior of the

index is relatively smooth. The events of the early 1980s do not appear

striking even though there was a decline of about 5 percent.

           In addition to interest rates, real commodity prices and economic

activity in industrial countries a fourth external factor influences the

noninterest current account. This is commercial policies in developing

countries and their influence on market access and hence export performance.

There are no good aggregate indicators of market access or of changes in

market access. But there is also no suggestion that this factor would have

been an important element in provoking the debt crisis. Of course, that does

not mean that protectionism did not increase the costs and difficulties of

debtor countries once the crisis had started. 2

III. EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECT OF THE WORLD MACRO SHOCK

        The broad overview of external factors gives little guidance to what

was the incidence on individual debtors. Their common factor is only to be

debtors and hence to be hurt by an increase in world interes.t rates. But even

that exposure differs significantly across countries depending on the share of

floating rate debt. At one end of the spectrum are poor debtors with most of

their debt at concessional rates, at the other end are Brazil or Mexico for

whom almost the entire debt has interest rates linked to market rates.

        But differences in trade structure also matter and these imply

differential effects among debtor countries of movements in commodity prices

or in economic activity in industrial countries. Korea, for example, imports

commodities while Brazil or Argentina are net commodity exporters. To

investigate these differential impacts of the 1980s external shock we now look

at a number of cases of individual countries' experiences.



Brazil: Brazil exports commodities and also manufactures. In the early 1980s

the country had just become a predominant exporter of manufactures. Of a total

of $24 billion in exports in 1981 nearly 38 percent were primary commodities

(coffee, iron, soya, sugar) and the remainder manufactures. But much of

manufactured exports had a high import content, as for example steel or orange

juice. On the import side a striking 51 percent was oil. Of the external debt
                                    12




of $50 billion, 80 percent was at variable interest rates and more than eighty

percent was dollar denominated.

         For Brazil, therefore oil prices and the world money market rate were

the chief variables of interest. Being a net exporter of (non oil) commodities

a decline in real commodity prices on balance would hurt. But the

concentration in exports on coffee, orange juice soya and iron ore would be

important to note.

        The external balance problem, of course, originated in the oil price

increase of 1978—79. Oil imports increased from $4.5 billion in 1978 to $11.4

billion in 1981. This increase in the oil bill was automatically financed both

in the budget and in the current account by the borrowing of the State

enterprises in the world capital market.

        The increase in world interest rates in 1979—81 added to the interest

bill. In 1979 net interest payments amounted to $4.2 billion. By 1981 they had

risen to 9.2 billion and in 1982 to $12.6 billion. At the end of 1978 the

external debt was only $44 billion and by the end of 1981 it had risen to $61

billion and by the end of 1982 to $70 billion. The increase in LIBOR from 8.9

percent in 1978 to 12, 14 and 17 percent over the next three years added

immediately a cumulative $7 billion to the external debt. The combination of

higher interest rates and higher oil prices "explains" almost the entire

increase in debt between the end of 1978 and the end of 1981.
                                     13




        The fact that higher interest rates and higher oil prices explain the

increase in debt can also be read to say that the failure to adjust to these

external shocks, and the ability to borrow in world markets, meant that

external debt was the means by which the country financed the impact of the

external shock.

Mexico: The second oil price increase in 1978-79 provided an apparently sound

basis on which to engage in a growth strategy. Petroleum export revenue

increased from only $1 billion in 1977 to $14 billion in 1981. But spending

increased far ahead of the increased revenues. The noninterest budget deficit,

oil revenues notwithstanding, increased from 2 to more than 8 percent of GDP.

The current account deteriorated even though oil revenues doubled every year.

        The strong domestic expansion, combined with a fixed exchange rate

built up overvaluation. The extent of overvaluation at no point became as

extreme as it had been in Chile or Argentina. But even so it led to

significant deterioration in the trade balance and to massive capital flight.

           The capital flight was concentrated in the period 1981—82, in the

 final phase of the Portillo Lopez government. The deterioration in the

external balance and the increasing difficulty in financing the deficit made

 it apparent that an exchange crisis was around the corner. Large wage

increases led to an expectation of a sharp increase in inflation altogether

incompatible with the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate. With no

restrictions on capital flows there occurred then a massive flight into the

dollar. In fact, the capital flight would have been much larger had it not

been for the existence of domestic dollar deposits in the banking system.

These Mex-dollar accounts absorbed a good part of the speculation, although

their holders ultimately did much worse than those who bought the real thing.

           Estimates of the amount of capital flight from Mexico in 1978—82

differ. A recent study by Cuddington (1987) estimates a total of more than $25

billion whereas Morgan Guaranty (1986) gives a higher number of $36 billion.

Whatever the exact number, there is no question that somewhere between 10 and

15 percent of GDP went abroad in these critical years. And the reason is

exclusively mismanagement since, unlike in the case of Argentina or Chile,

there was no deterioration in external conditions until interest rates

increased. On- the contrary, the oil price increase had provided an

extraordinary gain in real income and a potential improvement in the external

balance.

Argentina: The Argentinian external; debt problems were largely due to a

mismanagement of the exchange rate. The overvaluation of 1978—81, combined

with the liberalization of capital flows, brought about massive capital

flight.

          Table 6 shows the basic data. Note the large real appreciation in

1978-80 and the terms of trade improvement up to 1981. The oil price increase

which was important for Mexico, Brazil or Korea had no effect on Argentina's

terms of trade since the country is selfsufficient in oil.

           The increase in external debt in Argentina far exceeds the cumulative

current account. Therefore interest rate and terms of trade shocks cannot

account for the major part of the debt problem before 1981. On the contrary,

overvaluation and capital flight are the chief problems in this period. As we

shall see below this is no longer the case after 1982 when the terms of trade

deterioration becomes an important issue.

Korea: As an oil importer Korea experienced a major deterioration in the terms

of trade. The interest rate shock reinforced the external balance

deterioration. But even so, by 1982 the external balance had already turned

around an the deficit had become more moderate. In part this is a reflection

of the real depreciation which restored competitiveness in the years following

the crisis of 1980. In part it reflects a successful policy of exporting labor

services to the oilproducing countries.

extraordinary overvaluation.

           Only in 1981—82 do international factors take over and deteriorate the

external balance via increased interest burdens. In 1981 the overvaluation and

the external factors combine to yield record deficits. But by 1982 exchange

rate adjustment and domestic restraint already compensate on the trade side

and the current account deterioration only reflects increased interest rate

burdens.



Conclusion: The examples illustrate that external factors were by no means the

only factor in the debt crisis. On the contrary, domestic policies were an

important and often main influence in bringing about a large accumulation of

debt. External factors reinforced the impact of these debts in 1981—82 via the

interest rate shock.

IV. THE PERIOD 1982-1987

        In this part we investigate how the world macroeconomy influenced the

debt problem in the period since 1982. We start with a review of the beliefs

of 1982, namely that favorable trends in the world economy would significantly

facilitate debt service. From there we go to a more detailed consideration of

the actual evolution of the world economy to ask whether world macroeconomic

conditions in fact facilitated debt service or added to the burdens.



1. The Beliefs of 1982

        When in 1982 Mexico, and shortly afterwards a host of Latin American

countries, encountered acute debt service problems the process of concerted or

involuntary lending started. The basic philosophy of that process had three

ingredients:

        • To assure an ultimate return to voluntary lending it was essential

that debtor countries should service their debts to the maximum extent

possible, on commercial terms and without significant concessions other than

in respect to the maturity of the debt principal.

        • Adjustments in debtor countries, specifically in the budget and

exchange rates, would go far to bringing about a swing in the noninterest

balance so as to service debt.

        • The world macroeconomy would make a substantial contribution in

reducing the burden of debt servicing. From the vantage point of 1982 the
                                    19




macroeconomy could only improve. Debtor countries could anticipate higher

growth in demand for their exports, lower interest rates, and improving terms

of trade.

        The question of adjustment in debtor countries is beyond the scope of

this paper and has been amply dealt with elsewhere.3 The issue of interest

here is the contribution of the world macroeconomy. Certainly in 1982 the

outlook must have been favorable.

        • The world economy was in the deepest recession since the 1930s. In

the recovery period there had to be, accordingly, an expectation of growth

significantly above trend. This growth would bring about two results. First it

would mean an increase in demand for manufactures exports from debtor

countries. Second it would translate into a cyclical upturn of real commodity

prices. These stylized facts were quite beyond doubt, given the ample

empirical evidence on the cyclical behavior of real commodity prices and

export volumes.4

        • In respect to interest rates the outlook also had to be outright

favorable. The short term interest rate was at record high levels in American

history. These high levels of interest rates were an immediate result of a

deliberate attempt to use monetary policy to stop the sharply accelerating

U.S. inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s. With the success of

disinflation interest rates would decline and hence the extraordinary debt

service burdens of 1982 would come down.
                                         20




        . Even though the dollar had appreciated already for more than a year

there was not much discussion on this issue. The reason was presumably that

dollar appreciation started from a very low point so that overvaluation was

not yet a relevant notion. Nor was there an expectation of significant further

appreciation. Discussion of a contribution of dollar depreciation to the debt

crisis only occurred over the next three years as dollar overvaluation became

increasingly apparent.

        The framework for analysis of debt problems became rapidly the

Avromovic-Cline model of debt dynamics, focusing on the ratio of debt to

exports, b. The key question was whether the evolution of the world

macroeconomy made declining ratios of debt to exports likely. The evolution of

the debt—export ratio over time (b) can be developed in term of several

determinants, specifically interest rate (i), the growth rate of export prices

(px) and the growth rate of export volume (x):



(4)         b = b(i—px —   x)   —
                                    v;


where v denotes the noninterest current account surplus as a ratio of exports.

        Equation (4) highlights that debt problems in the sense of an ever

rising debt to export ratio. Such a course is unlikely if the real interest

rate, defined as nominal rates less the rate of inflation of export prices, is

less than the growth rate of export volume and if there is a noninterest
                                   21




current account surplus. Table 9 shows the longterm averages for some of these

variables to use as a benchmark.

        With the data for problem debtors, and assuming a spread over Libor of

2.2 percent we observe that the debt—export ratio would be declining unless

there was a noninterest current account deficit in excess of 7 percent of

exports. Of course, in 1978—82 the deficits were in fact much larger.

          The expectation of declining nominal interest rates and cyclically

rising nominal and real export prices for debtor countries implied an

expectation of ow real interest rates. Recovery and sustained growth in the

industrial countries was expected to translate into significant growth in

export volumes.

        Adjustment in debtor countries, both in terms of expenditure cutting

and real depreciation, was expected to translate into significant export

growth and into an increased noninterest current account surplus. Thus for

every element in the debt dynamics equation a favorable scenario could easily

be predicted. And if there was any pessimism on real interest rates and growth
                                    22




in   export volume, the fact of non—interest current account surpluses provided

the necessary leeway to make a trend reduction in debt burdens plausible.

         Cline (1983) in particular expressed the view that the debt problem

was largely under control. Using simulations for the major debtor countries,

and assuming alternative scenarios for the world economy he showed that for

most debtor countries there was an expectation of declining debt-export

ratios. Moreover, the gain in creditworthiness implied by a reduced debt—

income ratio in several cases could be accompanied by significant growth in

the debtor countries. Brazil, for example, could in Cline's simulations

achieve both an average growth rate of 6 percent and a reduction in its debt—

export ratio. The Cline analysis rightly emphasized the crucial role of oil

prices in determining the relative performance of Mexico and Brazil. With the

assumption of declining oil prices Mexico was a problem country and Brazil's

prospects were relatively bright.

         Table 10 shows a mediumterm scenario developed by the IMF in 1982 as

well as the actual outcome for the key variables. The IMF scenario assumed a

strong internal adjustment in the debtor countries, continued inflation

fighting in the industrial countries, a constant real price of oil at the 1982

level and a sharply declining real Libor rate. Table 10 reports three

scenarios: The base line scenario is labelled A, scenario B is pessimistic and

hence imposes extra adjustment requirements on debtors, and scenario C is

optimistic. The optimism and pessimism are judged in terms of the growth—
                                      23




inflation mix in industrial countries. There was apparently no recognition at

the time of the real interest rate consequences of rapid disinflation and of

the U.S. monetary-fiscal mix. The other respect in which the scenario is

interesting is that there was a quite explicit confidence that current account

imbalances could be financed.

2. The Actual Experience Since 1982
                                     24




        The actual outcome shown in Table 10 differs from the IMF scenario in

the following respects:

        • Real interest rates continued to be far higher than expected. The

U.S. monetary-fiscal mix this ha strong implications for the performance of

countries with high debt ratios and a high ratio of floating rate debt.

        • The real oil price fell dramatically and hence the relative

performance of net oil exporters was due more to their adjustment efforts then

to favorable terms of trade.

            The assumption that debtor countries could afford to run significant

current account deficits was overly optimistic. Financing constraints in fact

limited these deficits.

        Table 11 shows further details on nominal interest rates, real oil

prices and on commodity prices which were only addressed in the terms of trade

category of Table 10.

        Nominal interest rates did, indeed, decline significantly from their
                                            25




peak levels and OECD growth showed somewhat above the 3 percent threshold that

had been set as a benchmark for solving debt problems. The significant

difference from the 1982 outlook was in respect to commodity prices. Rather

than showing a recovery in nominal and real terms they in fact continued to

decline. The decline was so significant that in 1986 they were at a lower

level than anytime in the preceding quarter of a century as already shown in

Figure 3 above. In nominal terms they had fallen back to the level of 1977.



Creditworthiness: The belief that debt and debt service ratios would decline

has not in fact been borne out as shown in Table 12. On every measure of

creditworthiness debtor countries today look worse than they were in 1982,

excepting the debt service ratio. The reduction in interest rates since 1982

clearly helped reduce the service ratio as did the longterm restructuring of

debts. But even though there is a marginal reduction in the debt service ratio

the extent of decline falls by short of the 1982 expectations.

        Favorable conditions in the world economy and the beneficial effects

of adjustment programs on the part of debtors were expected to show in time an

improvement in credit worthiness sufficient to warrant a return to voluntary

lending. That remains the expectation, But the process is not on schedule.

Abstracting from the oil shock, which improved the situation of Korea and

Brazil while dramatically worsening that of Mexico, there has been as yet no

improvement as dramatic as had been anticipated. Standard indicators of

creditworthiness such as the ratio of debt to GDP or debt to exports have in

fact worsened since 1982.

        The return of voluntary lending was predicated on countries restoring

their credit standing. While creditworthiness is a broad and vague idea, the

operational concept was a reduction of ratios of debt to GDP and debt to

exports. Table 12 shows that since 1982 creditworthiness measured by these

benchmark ratios has worsened or at least not deteriorated, making the current

adjustment effort of debtor countries entirely openended.



The Cline Projections: While the preceding discussion focuses on group of

countries it is also of interest to see how forecasts fared in specific

country cases. The analysis by Cline (1983) provides that possibility for the

year 1985. Table 13 shows the results for Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

          Three points stand out in these comparisons. First, that export

revenues fall short of those predicted by Cline. Second, that import spending

is much lower than Cline had predicted. Third, that interest payments are

somewhat lower than predicted by Cline. Note,though, that the Brazilian

current account surplus of 1985 was correctly predicted by Cline. Of course,

by 1986 the differences are much more pronounced because of the vast influence

of the decline in oil prices from $28 to $15 per barrel.



Extreme Cases: There are some examples of countries who are outlines in the

adjustment period since 1982. On one side countries who are predominant

exporters of commodities and borrowers primarily from official sources. They

would experience the large and continuing decline in commodity prices without

the advantage of reduced interest burdens.
                                       28




        Among the countries that come to mind in this category there is

certainly Bolivia. Interest payments are to the extent of 70 percent at fixed

rates SC) that the fall in world interest rates did not bring major benefits.

But the terms of trade deteriorated over the period 1981—1986 by 14 percent.

The value of exports declined in 1984—86 cumulatively by 40 percent!

        The most striking improvement in the external debt position in the

adjustment period is probably that of Korea. Korea benefited from every one of

the factors characterizing the 1982—87 period: lower commodity prices, lower

oil prices and lower interest rates. Each of these factors exerts a very

significant impact on the external balance and hence the combined effects——in

conjunction with an aggressive exchange rate policy——produced a dramatic

improvement in the external balance. The shift in the current account

represents nearly 10 percent of GNP by 1986 and is still widening.



V. THE OUTLOOK

        In this section we ask whether there are important shifts in the world

macroeconomic outlook, and in the outlook for trade policies and the capital

market, that promise to help overcome the debt problem or threaten to make its

solution much more difficult. On the side of macroeconomics there is certainly

a possibility of quite different scenarios depending on the way in which the

U.S. budget problem is solved and the response of interest rates and the

dollar to budget cuts when   they   do take place.

1. The 1987 IMF Scenario

         A useful framework of reference economic outlook is the 1987 IMF

medium—term scenario shown in Table 14. The central assumption of this

scenario is a continued high real interest rate level compensated by sustained

growth in the world economy and in debtor country exports. There is an

expectation of moderately rising real oil prices and no change in the terms of

trade.

           In terms of equation (4) above the IMF outlook places major reliance

 on continued large non-interest current account surpluses and on export volume

growth to help contain or reduce debt problems. The fact that the scenarios

allow for growth in imports at roughly the same rates as those of exports is

possible because the starting point is a large noninterest surplus. Hence

maintaining equal growth rates, with unchanged terms of trade, assures that

noninterest surplus are maintained. In other words the IMF assumes that in the

period to 1991 problem debtors will continue to make real resource transfers

to their creditors at present rates.



2.   U.S. Adjustment: Implications for Debtor Countries

           It is interesting to go beyond the IMF outlook and focus on the

central development in the world economy in the next few years, namely U.S.

adjustment of the twin deficits. Table 15 shows the U.S. macroeconomic data

for the recent years.

Table 17     Consequences for Debtors of U.S. Adjustment Scenarios

                              Soft Landing         Hard Landing


                              Moderate Trouble       Debt Default
Trade Restrictions



                              Major Improvement      Moratoria
No Trade Restrictions




           Table 17 shows strikingly that the debt problem today remains wide—

open. Sustained U.S. growth with low real interest rates and unimpaired market

access means debt problems will become significantly smaller. Continued

ability to sell in the U.S. market, higher real commodity prices which come

with dollar depreciation and lower real interest rates all combine to a

scenario favorable for debtors. Of course, the counterpart of U.S. external

balance improvement in this case is a worsening of the net exports of Europe

 and of Japan. But lower real interest rates have a self—correcting property in

 that debtor countries can reduce their noninterest surplus and yet improve

 their creditworthinesSS. This feature means that there is not necessarily a

 conflict between U.S. and debtor country objectives. When debtor countries

 argue for the need to reduce U.S. deficits they presumably have this scenario

 in mind.
                                   34




        The other extreme scenario is a hard landing with trade restrictions.

The consequences are obvious: Recession and high real; interest rates move

debt service problems far beyond what debtor countries an be expected to make

up for by domestic adjustments. Trade restrictions further worsen their

ability to service debts. The almost certain consequence would be 1930 style

debt defaults or indefinite suspension of debt service.

        World growth and real interest rates are central in judging the impact

of alternative scenarios for debtor countries. On the side of growth U.S.

fiscal adjustment will tend to reduce growth in the world economy. If U.S.

output growth is sustained this will mean that real depreciation sustains net

exports and that accordingly foreign growth will tend to be less. It is very

unlikely that Europe and Japan will provide an expansion in demand sufficient

to keep world output growth constant. Thus on the growth side the expectation

must be that the performance of the past few years cannot be sustained. But on

the interest rate side there may be a favorable development, if the U.S. does

adjust the budget and sustains growth by lower interest rates the dollar will

depreciate and this is likely force Europe and Japan into interest rate

reductions even if that threatens monetary discipline.

        The impact of interest rates on debtors current account balances is,

of course very significant. Table 17 shows estimates of the impact on various

Latin American countries of a 2.5 percentage point reduction in interest

rates. Table 18 shows that the impact on individual debtor countries will
                                        35




depend both on their debt ratios and on the fraction of debt that is at

floating rates.

           The impact of interest rate changes on import availability is very

significant for Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, who are the large borrowers from

commercial banks. For Latin America at large a 2.5 percent reduction interest

rates would amount to a resource saving of nearly 8 percent of total imports.

Hence the importance to debtors of the monetary policies that accompany the

correction of the U.S. deficit.

           Trade barriers might not be applied uniformly across U.S. trading

partners. They might be applied only to industrial countries, specifically

Japan, or only to current account surplus countries, rather than to countries

with bilateral surpluses. For debtors the implication here is that an

improvement in    debt   service ability of countries like Mexico or Brazil might
                                       36




 be paid for by extra restrictions on Korea or Taiwan. Thus developing

countries as a group might experience an improvement while specific countries

like Korea bear the burden.

         There is another way of looking at debtor countries and U.S.

adjustment. Suppose that the U.S. in fact achieved a $100 billion reduction in

the external deficit. Assume also that this had as a counterpart a $20 billion

improvement in the U.S. bilateral trade balance with Latin America. How can

Latin America experience a $20 billion deterioration in the external balance?

There are only two ways: much lower interest rates or significant extra

financing. Thus any hard landing scenario without default of necessity

involves a dramatic change in financing availability which is not apparent

today.

         The focus on the U.S. adjustment problem throws a very different light

on the links between world macroeconomics and debt problems. It suggests that

the steady IMF scenario conceals that there is either good or bad news, but

probably not the balanced no—news outlook implicit in Table 14. Of course, it

is possible that U.S. adjustment is a matter of the more distant future, In

that case the JMF scenario would be more appropriate for the nearterm. But

there would   inevitably   be an adjustment some time and that might be more

nearly of the hard landing variety.

         Is there a chance that debt problems will be solved in some other

fashion by the world macroeconomy? Here one would look to a pattern of terms
                                       37




of trade, interest rates and inflation of the 1970—73 variety. Since the U.S.

is already at full employment continuing depreciation and monetary

accommodation, without fiscal contraction, will inevitably raise inflation

while sustaining growth. This policy setting would ease debt problems

significantly. The only question is whether the process of sliding gently into

the soft landing option, with a few years delay, can in fact be achieved. The

monetary authorities would have to be sufficiently accommodating and

impervious to inflation, and asset holders would have to be patient, sitting

out dollar depreciation without a stampede. This does not seem to be a high

probability scenario.



3. The Commodity Price Problem

          The final point to raise concerns the longterm behavior of commodity

prices. Figure 6 shows a longterin time series for the real price of

commodities. Although the exact comparisons across periods is impaired by the

fact that these data are spliced from different series the basic point is very

striking.5 Commodity prices in   the   mid—1980s have reached the lowest level in

real terms since the great depression.

                                       38




        Several factors explain this low level of commodity prices. The high

level of real interest rates is one and, until 1985—86 the high level of the

dollar was another one. But these factors are not sufficient to explain the

large decline as discussed in Dornbusch (1985). Substitution toward resource

saving technologies on the demand side, real depreciation and hence increased

levels of output at given world real prices are other factors. Capacity

expansion in many producing countries are further factors that reduce real

prices. Finally, for agricultural commodities government support policies in

industrial countries have played an important role.

        But this large decline in real commodity prices which has been a

decisive factor in the debt performance of several countries, as for example

Argentina, Bolivia or Peru, may well have bottomed out. Moreover, the recovery

of real commodity prices may turn out to be surprisingly large and rapid.

Certainly the level of real commodity prices is unlikely to return to the high

of the early 1970s because structural factors mitigate so large an increase.

But a resumption of inflation and much lower real interest rates will drive up

inventory demand and thus bring about a significant rise. Indeed, the signs of

such an increase are already quite apparent except for food. In the one year

to August 1987 the Economist index of all commodities increased in dollar

terms by 22.1   percent,   with industrial commodities rising by 46.4 percent. But

that increase was not shared by food which showed a moderate decline.

IV. CONCLUSION

         World macroeconomic policies and variables were until 1981—82 not the

major reason for the present debt crisis. Only in 1981—82 did the sharp

increase in interest rates and the decline in growth help create a crisis in

the aftermath of very poor policy performance in debtor countries.

         Since 1982 the world macroeconomic environment has shown an

improvement. Interest rates declined in nominal and real terms and growth has

been sustained, as was expected in 1982. The only surprises were that dollar

overvaluation lasted as long as it did, a smaller decline in real interest

rates and a massive decline in the real prices of commodities. The world

macroeconomic environment certainly did not provide a setting in which debtor

countries could grow out of their debts by export booms and improving terms of

trade.

         Today, five years into the adjustment process, indicators of

creditworthiness show a deterioration except for the ratio of debt service to

exports. And even that indicator is barely below the 1982 level. Can we expect

that the world economy in the years ahead provides a distinctly more favorable

setting? The IMP outlook for the period 1988—91 shows a no—news setting:

steady, moderate growth, no changes in the terms of trade and an increase in

real interest rates. In such an environment debtor countries would have to
