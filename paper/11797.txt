Motivations for Public Equity Offers: An International Perspective
Woojin Kim and Michael S. Weisbach
NBER Working Paper No. 11797
November 2005
JEL No. F3, G3

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the extent to which investment financing and market-timing explanations
motivate public equity offers. We consider a sample of 16,958 initial public offerings and 12,373
seasoned equity offerings from 38 countries between 1990 and 2003. We provide estimates of the
change in each accounting variable for each dollar raised in an equity offer, and for each dollar of
internally generated cash. Our estimates imply that firms invest 18.8 cents in R&D and 7.3 cents in
capital expenditures for an incremental dollar raised in an equity offer during the year following the
offer, rising to 84.8 cents and 14.3 cents when the change is measured over a four-year period. These
findings are consistent with one motive for the equity offer being to raise capital for investment.
However, firms also hold onto much of the cash they raised, and this fraction is higher when the firm
has a high q. In addition, firms are more likely to issue secondary shares, which are usually sold by
insiders, when q is high, enabling insiders to benefit personally from potential overvaluation. These
results suggest that market timing as well as investment financing is a motivation for equity offers.

         The relation between equity markets and firms’ real decisions is an old and still extremely

important topic in finance. Understanding this relation is complicated by the fact that there are a number

of channels through which equity markets can affect firms. First, firms can raise capital to finance

investments by selling equity in the public market. Additionally, if equity prices are higher than

warranted by firms’ fundamentals, then by issuing equity, firms can increase the value of existing shares

at the expense of new shareholders. 1 Finally, when firms sell equity for the first time in an initial public

offering, the firm changes in a number of ways that increase the liquidity of insiders’ portfolios and the

firm’s access to capital. Thus, there are at least three possible, not necessarily mutually exclusive,

motives for equity offerings: to finance investments, to transfer wealth from new shareholders to existing

shareholders, and to increase liquidity for both insiders and the firm.

         The academic literature has not yet distinguished fully between these explanations. The only

empirical paper that addresses the question of the motivation for initial offerings is Pagano, Panetta, and

Zingales (1998). These authors find that for a sample of Italian IPOs, the predominant reason why firms

go public is to rebalance their capital structure and to exploit mispricing rather than to raise capital for

financing investments. For seasoned offerings, a number of papers have addressed the mispricing

explanation; Loughran and Ritter (1995) and Baker and Wurgler (2000) are notable contributions. In

addition, Greenwood (2005) finds that higher cash holdings lead to lower future returns at the aggregate

level, consistent with firms issuing equity when their shares are overvalued rather than when they have a

particularly high demand for capital.

         However, these papers do not link the equity issues with the subsequent firm-level investments.

The literature is remarkably silent on the fundamental question underlying equity issues (and other capital

raising activities): How is the money raised in the offering used by the firms that raise it? This paper

provides systematic evidence on this question as well as other potential motives for issuing publicly-


1
 Discussion of the possibility of selling overvalued equity to finance investments goes back at least to Keynes
(1936), p. 151. For further discussion and tests of this idea, see Fischer and Merton (1984), Barro (1990),
Blanchard, Rhee, and Summers (1993), Stein (1996), and Baker, Stein and Wurgler (2003).

traded equity. It relies on a sample of 16,958 initial public offerings and 12,373 seasoned equity offerings

from 38 countries, covering the 1990-2003 period. The focus is on the ultimate use of the capital raised,

how this use varies with firm valuation, and how this variation is consistent with alternative motivations

for equity offers.

        To understand the reasons for equity offerings, it is important to distinguish between equity

offerings that raise capital and those that do not. One aspect of equity offerings not emphasized by the

corporate finance literature is the fact that firms have a choice of what kind of shares to offer. Firms can

issue new, primary shares, or offer existing shares held by insiders, which are known as secondary shares.

Only primary share issuances can be used to finance investments, since they lead to capital inflows to the

firm while secondary share offers do not. 2

        We first document the extent to which firms offer primary and secondary shares in public equity

offerings across the different regions in our sample. We find that the proportion of primary shares sold is

roughly 80% in IPOs and 60% in SEOs. For IPOs, this fraction varies internationally, with Asian

countries typically having the highest fraction of primary shares, European countries having the lowest,

and the United States in between. Cross-regional variation in SEOs is smaller than in IPOs, although

European countries still exhibit the lowest proportion of primary shares.

        To examine the effect of equity offerings on investment, we next consider a variety of alternative

accounting variables designed to capture the uses of the capital raised in the IPOs and SEOs. While it is

almost definitional that new capital into the firm has to show up somewhere on the books, there are a

number of alternative possible uses for the capital. We examine increases in total assets, inventory,

capital expenditures, acquisitions, R&D, cash, and long-term debt reduction. We measure the increases in

each variable over a variety of time intervals, ranging from one year to four years, and compare them

across the types of shares being offered.


2
 Existing theoretical models on IPOs do not seem to incorporate the two types of shares simultaneously. For
example, Chemmanur and Fulghieri(1999)’s model considers sale of primary shares to fund a new investment
project, while Zingales(1995) and Mello and Parsons(1998) focus on the sale of secondary shares and does not
model new investment and production activity.


                                                        2
        Univariate statistics on changes in these variables following IPOs indicate that primary only

offerings have the highest increases in most of the variables, followed by combined offerings and

secondary only offerings. Moreover, the magnitude of primary issues is significantly correlated with

increases in capital expenditure, R&D expenditure and cash holdings up to four years after the IPO. In

contrast, the value of the secondary offerings is not related to these variables in most cases.

        We next formally estimate the increase in the accounting variables that represent possible uses of

the capital raised following IPOs. In doing so, we control econometrically for other sources of funds,

firm size, as well as year and country fixed effects. The largest increase is for cash holdings; for every

dollar raised in the IPO, cash holdings rise by 1.067 cents in the year after the IPO. This decreases to

88.8 cents over a four-year period after the IPO as the money is spent on various projects. The largest

expenditures appear to be on R&D and capital expenditures, which increase by 18.8 cents and 7.3 cents

respectively per dollar raised in the year following the IPO, and by 84.8 cents and 14.3 cents over a four-

year period. These results are consistent with the investment financing motivations for the equity offer

and suggest that capital raising is a lumpy process, so that firms raise capital and spend it over a relatively

long period of time.

        We estimate similar equations predicting the uses of funds on the sample of SEOs. As for IPOs,

there are substantial and statistically significant increases in investments, including R&D, capital

expenditures, acquisitions and inventory. This finding suggests that one motivation for SEOs is to raise

capital for investments. In addition, firms appear to save a substantial fraction of cash raised in SEOs,

which declines somewhat as the time horizon gets longer. This high savings rate could reflect firms’

issuing equity when their stock price is high, even if they do not have unusually good investment

opportunities.

        Finally, we explore the extent of market timing motivations in a more direct manner by relating

Tobin’s q with the issuance and investment decisions in SEOs. First, we examine how the fraction of

types of shares sold in an SEO is affected by potential mispricing. If firms sell shares because the stock

price is particularly high, we expect that self-interested managers would sell a higher fraction of their


                                                       3
personal shares through a secondary offering. In contrast, if we observe a firm issuing equity at times

when the price is relatively low, then we would expect a higher proportion of shares sold to be primary.

We find that, controlling for other factors, a higher abnormal valuation proxied by Tobin’s q or residuals

from a first-stage regression of q on fundamentals implies a higher fraction of secondary shares in the

offering. These results are consistent with market timing stories; when equity values, reflected by q, are

high, managers are more likely to sell their own shares in a secondary offering so that they can benefit

personally.

        We also examine whether the sensitivity of investment to primary capital raised in SEOs varies

according to the level of Tobin’s q. We do so because SEOs done to take advantage of high valuation

should occur in firms with relatively high q’s. To the extent that these SEOs do provide additional

capital, the new funds should be more likely to be kept as cash. However, when the purpose of the SEO

is to provide capital for investments, we expect to see more of the money raised to be used to pay for

these investments. Consistent with this intuition, we find that following an SEO, firms with low Tobin’s

q’s spend relatively more on capital expenditures and long term debt reductions than firms with high q’s.

In contrast, firms with high q tend to keep more cash from a marginal dollar raised than do low q firms.

These findings suggest that when firms with low q’s do seasoned offerings, the purpose of these offerings

is to fund investments, while firms with high q’s are more likely to do seasoned offerings to take

advantage of their higher valuation.

        Overall, the results suggest that equity offerings are done both to raise capital for investment and

to exploit favorable market conditions. Firms sometimes issue public equity to take advantage of a hot

market. When they do so they are more likely to use secondary offerings so that they can profit

personally or if they do issue primary shares, then they tend to keep the proceeds as cash. However, firms

also issue equity when stock prices are less favorable. In these cases, the offerings are more likely to be

composed of primary shares and they tend to use the funds they raise to finance R&D, to purchase

inventory, to make capital expenditures and to reduce long-term debt.

sample. Section II provides the distribution of primary and secondary shares offered in IPOs and SEOs

across the 38 countries. Section III presents the averages of subsequent increases in assets and

expenditures for each of the three IPOs offer types and estimates the relation between the capital raised

and increases in investments. Section IV estimates similar equations examining the relation between

capital raised and increases in investment for SEOs. Section V reports the relation between Tobin’s q of

the firm doing the offering and the proportion of secondary shares in the offering. It also presents results

indicating how the valuation, reflected by q, affects the use of these proceeds. Section VI is a short

conclusion.



I. Data Sources and Sample Description

A. Data Sources

        We obtain our IPO and SEO data from SDC Global New Issues Database. This database provides

information on total proceeds and the number of primary and secondary shares offered for each IPO and

SEO. WorldScope provides the accounting data for our sample of equity offers. We augment

WorldScope with Standard and Poor’s Xpressfeed, which provides U.S. and international data

comparable to Compustat. SDC has very limited coverage for non-U.S. offers prior to 1990, so we set

our sample period to be from January 1990 to December 2003.

        From all IPOs reported in SDC, we first eliminate those observations that do not contain

information on the total number of shares sold or the breakdown of these shares into primary and

secondary shares. We also exclude IPOs where the reported value of proceeds is inconsistent with the

offer price and the number of shares sold by more than $5 million. A total of 2,301 IPOs and 7,090 SEOs

were dropped using these initial filters. Since our focus is on public equity offers, we additionally




                                                      5
exclude all private placements and rights offerings (16,415 SEOs). 3 We then exclude the following firms

from our sample:

    (a)      All utilities (3 digit SIC's from 491 to 494) : 250 IPOs, 508 SEOs
    (b)      All financials(1 digit SIC 6) : 5,057 IPOs, 3,858 SEOs
    (c)      All privatizations: 173 IPOs, 160 SEOs. 4
    (d)      All telecoms(2 digit SIC 48): 655 IPOs 5, 682 SEOs
    (e)      All transition economies: 1,117 IPOs, 164 SEOs from China, Hungary, Poland and Russia
    (f)      All nations with fewer than 10 IPO's during the sample period: 89 IPOs from 32 countries,
             338 SEOs from 45 countries

          These requirements are imposed to identify a sample of non-regulated private firms that issue

publicly-traded equity. 6 After applying these filters, we end up with a sample of 16,958 IPOs and 12,373

SEOs from 38 countries, each occurring between 1990 and 2003.7

B. Equity Issues Around the World

          Table I presents descriptive statistics on our sample. Panels A-1 and A-2 present the number of

IPOs and SEOs across different regions over time while Panels B-1 and B-2 report the total value of

proceeds raised in IPOs and SEOs, respectively. The U.S. is by far the largest IPO market in our sample,

accounting for 27% of all IPOs in terms of numbers and 45% in terms of total proceeds. 8 European IPOs

are somewhat modest both in numbers and value in the early 1990s, but start to pick up in the mid 1990s

and surpass the U.S. in the total number of IPOs by the late 1990s. Asian IPOs peak in the mid 1990s and

then drop significantly in 1998-99 after the financial crisis of 1997. Although Asian IPOs comprise 37%




3
  Forty percent of private placements and rights offerings are from Australia. These offerings tend to be very small.
4
  The privatizations are identified from Boutchkova and Megginson (2000), Belke and Schneider (2003), and
Hoover's Online. For all IPOs which raised more than $100 million that are not identified as privatizations in the
previous two papers, we manually checked Hoover’s Online to verify whether the IPO was a privatization or not.
For those IPOs that were not identified on Hoover’s Online, we checked the company’s website if it had one as of
June 2004. Subsequent SEOs by these firms are also excluded from the sample.
5
  Telecoms are similar to utilities in terms of regulations, and many of them also overlap with privatizations.
6
  Concurrent issues both in domestic market and in foreign market in the form of ADRs or direct cross listings are
counted as one issue, and the total proceeds and the number of shares are aggregated after adjusting for differences
in currencies.
7
  Roughly two-thirds of the IPOs and half of the SEOs do not have accounting information just prior to the issue,
partly because our accounting data stops at 2001.
8
  The amount raised through ADRs is included in the country of origin rather than in the U.S. Canadian domestic
IPOs from 1990 to 1992 are all dropped according to the initial filter, and their coverage stops at 2001 in our dataset.


                                                           6
in terms of numbers, they only account for 12% of the total proceeds, implying that Asian IPOs are

generally smaller on average than other IPOs. 9

        The cross-regional pattern for SEOs is somewhat similar to IPOs. The U.S. is the largest issuer,

with 37% of the issues and 49% of the proceeds. Other regions are noticeably smaller, with none

accounting for more than 20% of the total issues or proceeds. Unlike the IPO time series, SEOs continue

both in U.S. and also worldwide, even after the market decline in 2000, with the total number remaining

fairly constant at close to one thousand per year. The proceeds raised in the SEOs decline with the stock

market after 2000, so that the amount in 2003 is only 40% of 2000. However, the magnitude of the

decline is proportionately smaller compared to IPOs, where the proceeds in 2003 is less than a quarter of

2000. This time-series pattern suggests that IPOs may be more sensitive to market valuations than SEOs.



II. Primary vs. Secondary Offers

        Equity offers vary along a number of dimensions, an important one of which is the type of shares

being sold to the public. Firms have a choice of selling new, ‘primary’ shares, or existing, ‘secondary’

shares. A primary offering increases the number of shares outstanding and raises capital for the firm,

while secondary offerings keep the number of shares outstanding constant and has no revenue

consequences to the firm. A third type of offering is a combination of the two, selling some new shares

and some previously-owned shares.

        Table II presents statistics on the three types of equity offers in our sample. Panels A-1 and A-2

report the number of IPOs and SEOs that belong in each of the three categories, while Panels B-1 and B-2

present total proceeds from each type. 10 Panels B-1 and B-2 also separate combined offerings into

primary shares and secondary shares and report the proceeds for each type within the combined category.

Clearly, primary offerings are the most common, comprising 76.2% of IPOs and 60.7% of SEOs. Pure

secondary offerings are relatively uncommon especially for IPOs, accounting for only 1.7% of IPOs and

9
  Almost 60% of Asian IPOs are from India, and Indian IPOs tend to be very small. The median value of proceeds
in India is only US$ 0.7 million, compared to the global median of US$30 million.
10
   The detailed breakdown by each country is provided in the Table I of the Appendix.


                                                       7
18.7% of SEOs, while the remaining 22.2% of IPOs and 20.7% of SEOs are combinations of primary and

secondary offerings. We can infer the total value raised from primary shares and secondary shares

respectively by separating out the proceeds from the combined category into those raised from primary

shares and those raised from secondary shares and adding them back into proceeds from primary only and

secondary only offerings. The last five columns of panels B-1 and B-2 in Table II present these

calculations.

        Overall, 79% of the total proceeds in IPOs are comprised of new capital raised through primary

shares. However, there are distinct cross-regional variations. Other than Japan, Asian IPOs tend to offer

mostly primary shares, with primary offerings accounting for more than 95% of the proceeds of the IPOs.

In contrast, European IPOs exhibit relatively higher percentages of secondary only (12.8% of the

proceeds) and combined offerings (33.5%), and lower percentage of primary only offerings (53.8%).

These differences could potentially reflect differences in the institutional environment and are consistent

with the high rate of secondary offerings in Europe that has been documented elsewhere. In the Pagano,

Panetta, and Zingales (1998) sample, for example, only 41% were primary-only offerings and 49% were

secondary-only. Similarly, Jenkinson and Ljungqvist (2001) report that 67% of IPOs in Portugal and

23% in Germany were entirely secondary in the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, Jenkinson and

Ljungqvist report that European IPOs have begun using a higher proportion of primary offerings since the

early 1990s. Both the fact that Europe has traditionally had a high proportion of secondary offerings, as

well as the recent change towards primary offerings within Europe, suggest that perhaps the conclusions

of Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998) should be reexamined, since that study contains only 69 IPOs

from one European country in the 1980s.

        For SEOs, the proportion of primary shares is relatively smaller than in IPOs, accounting for 58%

of the total proceeds. Unlike IPOs, cross-regional differences seem to be less apparent, although

European SEOs still exhibit the lowest proportion of primary shares. For the U.S., the breakdown is




                                                     8
broadly consistent with the numbers reported in Asquith and Mullins (1986) for an earlier time period. 11

At first, the pattern of seasoned offerings containing more secondary issues may seem counterintuitive

since the insiders in a publicly traded firm can sell their shares directly in the open market. However,

regulations regarding the disclosure of insider trading restrict insiders from selling freely in the market,

leading them to resort to SEOs for selling their secondary shares.



III. Investment Financing as a Motivation for Initial Public Offerings

         Going public is generally considered a watershed moment in a firm’s history, being associated

with a number of important changes. Once a firm is publicly-traded, there is a market in which

executives and other insiders can sell their shares. In addition, the firm can raise capital in public equity

(and possibly debt) markets, and the firm faces increased disclosure and regulatory requirements. Yet,

one possible explanation for going public that is sometimes overlooked is the capital that is raised at the

time of the issue.

         One empirical study examining the motives for IPOs is Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998).

These authors find that in their sample of Italian IPOs from the 1980s, investments do not increase

following the IPO, suggesting that demand for capital is not a major reason for going public. The extent

to which these findings extend to a broader sample of firms in other countries in other time periods is

clearly of interest.

A. Univariate Analysis of Increases in Investments across IPO Offer Types

         A clear prediction of the hypothesis that firms issue equity to raise capital for investments is that

investments should be larger for firms raising capital through an equity issue than they would have been

had the firms not done the equity issue. We do not, of course, know what firms’ investments would have

been had they not raised capital. We do, however, have a sample of firms that did secondary equity issues

that were not associated with capital raising, because the revenues from those sales do not belong to the

11
  Asquith and Mullins (1986) report that out of 266 SEOs by U.S. industrial firms from 1963 to 1981, 48% were
primary only, 32% were secondary only, and 20% were combined offerings. In our U.S. subsample, primary-only
SEOs comprise 46% of the sample, secondary-only SEOs 14%, and combined offers 40%.


                                                       9
firm. We expect investments to increase more for firms that do primary issues than those doing

secondary issues, with combined issues in between. We first compare univariate statistics on possible

uses of funds for firms doing alternative types of equity offers. Subsequently, we estimate

econometrically the expected use of incremental dollars raised in equity offerings.

         We measure changes in seven accounting variables, each of which captures a potential use of the

funds raised. In particular, we consider changes in total assets, inventory, capital expenditure, acquisition,

R&D, and cash, as well as reductions in long-term debt. 12 The first five variables are meant to capture

possible ways in which the capital could be invested in real assets, while changes in cash holdings and

reductions in long-term debt measure possible uses of the funds other than direct investment. To

minimize the impact of outliers, we focus on a logarithmic transformation of each variable. For balance

sheet items (total assets, inventory, and cash), we calculate the log of one plus the change in each variable

normalized by total assets prior to the IPO: ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets 0 ) + 1] , where V is the variable

being measured, year 0 is the fiscal year end just prior to the IPO and year t is number of years after year

0. For income statement and cash flow statement items (capital expenditure, acquisition, R&D and

reduction in long-term debt), we consider the log of one plus the accumulation in each variable since the

IPO, normalized by total assets prior to the IPO: ln[(∑it =1Vi total assets 0 ) + 1] .

         Table III reports the means and medians of this normalized increase for each variable, broken

down by offer type. This table computes the changes for periods between one year and four years in

length. It also presents t-statistics for comparisons of means between the primary-only and combined

groups, and between the combined and secondary-only groups, as well as the Mann-Whitney z-statistic

for comparison of medians.

         We consider differences between offer types to examine the linkage between new, primary capital

coming into the firm, and increases in subsequent investment. The numbers in Table III indicate that

except for a few cases, increases are the largest in the primary-only group, followed by the combined

  Capital expenditures, acquisitions and reduction in long-term debt are directly taken from the cash flow statement,
and reflect cash outflows from investing and financing activities.

group. IPOs that only offer secondary shares exhibit the lowest increases in most cases. Moreover, the

differences in increases of these variables between IPO offer types are generally statistically significant.

        The correlation between IPO type and the increases in total assets probably reflects that primary

offers are used at the fastest growing firms. Firms that are growing the fastest are likely to have the

greatest demand for external capital, to pay for both direct investments and indirect investments.

        While the correlation between increase in total assets and IPO type could come through a number

of channels, the correlation between the increases in the investment variables (inventory, capital

expenditures, acquisitions, and research and development) and the type of IPO provides more direct

evidence. In particular, it seems likely that firms increasing investments most rapidly have the greatest

demand for capital, and thus choose to issue primary shares when they go public. A desire to fund

investments in inventory, capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development could lead

some firms to go public. In contrast, firms that go public to allow managers to cash out through

secondary offers will have, on average, a lower demand for capital. As a result, we could observe the

pattern documented in Table III, in which primary offers are associated with higher increases in

investment than secondary offers.

        Increases in cash could be due to firm’s motivations to enhance financial flexibility independent

of the valuation in the market or it could be a result of active market timing efforts without investment

opportunities as suggested by Greenwood (2005). We attempt to distinguish between these two

possibilities in Section V.

        In summary, the differences in normalized increases in the seven variables across different types

of IPO offerings for various horizons suggest that the firms in each group might have different

motivations for going public. Firms issuing primary shares appear to use the capital both to increase

investment, and to increase financial flexibility, presumably to be able to fund future investments.

        Yet, while these comparisons are suggestive, they omit at least four potentially important

considerations. First, Table II documents that type of IPO is highly correlated with the place of issue and

accounting variables are likely to be so as well, for no other reason than the fact that accounting is done


                                                     11
differently in different countries. Second, Jenkinson and Ljungqvist (2001) suggest that there has been a

secular trend towards primary issues at least in Europe, which should be controlled for econometrically.

Third, the univariate comparisons make no use of the quantity of equity that is issued, which certainly

could affect the use of the funds. Finally, we do not consider differences within the ‘combined’ category;

presumably a firm that issues 99% primary shares and 1% secondary is different from one that issues 99%

secondary and 1% primary. We next consider the normalized increases in our accounting variables in a

mutivariate setting, controlling for these factors.

B. Multivariate Analysis of Changes in Accounting Variables across IPO Offer Types

         To estimate the uses of the capital raised in the equity offering, we rely on a specification that

allows primary capital from the equity offering, secondary capital from the equity offering, and other

sources of funds to enter the specification separately. We normalize each by total assets and take the log

of one plus the normalized cash flow as a way of minimizing the effect of outliers. 13 We also include the

log of total assets as a control for size and fixed effects for year and country, and use heteroscdasticity-

consistent standard errors clustered by two-digit SIC industry. 14 For each of seven possible uses of the

capital raised, we estimate:

                   ⎡⎛ primary capital ⎞ ⎤             ⎡⎛ secondary capital ⎞ ⎤             ⎡⎛ other sources ⎞ ⎤

13
   We also repeat the analysis without the log transformation using the quantile (median) regression approach. The
results are similar to the logarithmic results discussed below.
14
   We exclude those IPOs where the value of the total asset prior to the IPO is less than 5% of the total proceeds
(2.9% of the sample) from the following regressions. Including these IPOs in the regressions yields similar results.


                                                               12
and t = 1, 2, 3, 4 years after the IPO. Total sources of funds include internally generated cash flows from

the firm’s continuing operations as well as other sources of funds from investment and financing

activities. 15 16

          Table IV presents estimates of Equation (1), omitting the country and year fixed effects as well as

the coefficient on total assets for the sake of brevity. The coefficients on primary capital raised in the IPO

and on other sources of capital are mostly positive and significantly different from zero. In contrast, the

coefficients on the value of secondary shares sold are generally small and statistically insignificant from

zero. While it is not surprising that the coefficients on secondary capital sales are zero given that the

revenues from these sales do not belong to the firm, they do suggest that the results are picking up a true,

rather than a spurious relation between new capital and investment.

          Comparing the coefficients between those on new capital from the equity offering with those

from other sources of capital, which is primarily internally-generated, makes it possible to draw

inferences about the underlying reasons for the equity offering. In other words, differences in coefficients

are likely to reflect differences in propensities to use alternative sources of capital for alternative uses.

The results in Table IV indicate that the coefficients on primary capital raised in equity offerings are

substantially larger than the corresponding coefficients for the other sources of capital for two years in the

equations estimating the changes in capital expenditures and up to four years in R&D, and cash. These

findings suggest that the funds raised in an IPO are more likely to be used for investments in new capital

and research. In addition, the coefficients on changes in cash holdings suggest that new capital raised is

more likely to be saved as cash than are internally generated funds.

          In contrast, the coefficients on acquisitions and on long-term debt reductions are larger on

internally-generated capital than on new capital. This pattern indicates debt reductions and acquisitions


15
   Specifically, total sources of funds is the sum of funds from operations, sale of property, plant and equipment,
long term debt issuances, and sale of common and preferred stock. This variable is available In WorldScope. In
Compustat Xpressfeed, this variable needs to be constructed from the component variables.
16
   We have also estimated this equations including firm age as another independent variable with similar results.
This variable is only available for approximately 1/3 of the sample, so we choose to report the results without this
variable in the equation.

are more likely to be paid for by internally-generated than new capital. This result differ from Pagano,

Panetta, and Zingales (1998), who suggest that capital raised in IPOs tends to be used to pay off long-

term debt. Overall, the comparisons between the estimated uses of internally-generated and new capital

are consistent with the view that capital raised in IPOs is used to fund new investments.

         There is a consistent pattern between the coefficients for the equations representing different time

horizons used in computing the dependent variables. For the equations representing changes in

expenditures on inventory, capital expenditures, acquisitions and R&D, the coefficients on primary

capital are generally increasing over time. This pattern suggests that the capital raised is not used all at

once but rather partially saved and used in the future. Consistent with this pattern is the fact that the

corresponding coefficients on changes in cash holdings have the opposite pattern. These coefficients

decrease with the time horizon of the dependent variables, suggesting that firms initially hold the capital

as cash and pay it down over time.

         A useful way to compare the effects of new capital across different uses is to calculate from each

equation the change in the accounting variable implied from a dollar increase in new capital. This value

provides a consistent way of comparing the relative importance of alternative uses of the cash raised. 17

We also report the implied changes from a dollar increase in other sources as a benchmark. The results of

these calculations are also presented in Table IV. For the total assets variable, the implied change from a

dollar increase in primary capital is close to one for one year after the IPO, which is not surprising since

the book value of assets mechanically increases dollar for dollar whenever new capital is raised. 18

Nonetheless, the fact that the implied change in assets for a dollar raised is close to a dollar suggests that

the specification we use is picking up real rather than spurious effects.



17
   The calculations are based on a median-sized firm in 1996 in US. For example, the dollar changes in inventory
for t = 1 is calculated as follows: Median primary capital is 24, median secondary capital is 0, median total sources
is 33.9 and median total assets prior to IPO are 24.4. (All units are in $US mil). Using these inputs together with
coefficients from table IV yields 0.00742 as the predicted value of the log transformation, implying a predicted
change of 0.182 in inventory. Then we add one to median primary capital and repeat the above procedure, which
results in a predicted change of 0.199 in inventory. The difference in the two predicted changes represents the dollar
changes in inventory for 1 unit increase in primary capital, which is given by 0.017.
18
   If some of the new capital were used to pay off debt, then increase in total assets may be less than one for one.


                                                         14
        For the other variables, the implied change per dollar raised is the largest for the change in cash

holdings. These estimates imply that a large fraction of each dollar raised is kept in cash holdings; in year

one, firms hold 106.7 cents in cash for every dollar they raise, decreasing over time to 88.8 cents when

changes are computed over four years. While the numbers are somewhat difficult to take literally, as the

model predicts that the expected change in spending is more than $1 for every dollar raised, they do

suggest that firms keep a substantial fraction of the funds raised as cash, for at least four years after the

IPO. This finding is consistent with the view that one of the motivations for going public could be to time

the market so as to take advantage of a high valuation.

        In contrast, implied changes in investment variables increase over time. In the first year after the

IPO, it implies that for every dollar raised, R&D increases by 18.8 cents, capital expenditures by 7.3

cents, inventory by 1.7 cents, and acquisitions by 2.9 cents. Over a three-year horizon, R&D rises by 64.6

cents, capital expenditures by 17.9 cents, inventory by 2.2 cents, and acquisitions by 3.8 cents. This

effect is likely due to firms spending cash acquired in the IPO over a several year time period. The

relative use of the funds seems clear; by far the largest fraction of money raised in the IPO is used to fund

R&D and capital expenditures, although firms still hold on to much of the cash they raised. A much

smaller fraction is used to increase inventories and engage in acquisitions. Moreover, implied changes

incurred by a dollar increase in internally-generated capital are generally smaller than those incurred by

new capital, except for acquisitions and debt reduction. All these results are consistent with the demand

for an infusion of new capital to fund investments being an important motivation for IPOs.



IV. Capital-Raising as a Motivation for Seasoned Equity Offers

        Equity is also issued in seasoned equity offers by firms that are already publicly-traded. Potential

motivations for these offers have been much discussed in the corporate finance literature. The tradeoff

theory suggests that firms should issue equity to fund investments when their leverage ratio is higher than

their target ratio, while the pecking order theory predicts that when equity offers occur, they will be used

to fund investments as a last source of financing. In contrast, market-timing arguments predict that firms


                                                       15
will issue equity to take advantage of high stock prices. These arguments are not mutually inconsistent; it

is likely that some equity offers could occur for each reason. It is even possible that overvaluation could

cause additional investment, as is suggested in the model of Shleifer and Vishny (2003). 19

           Yet, there has been little empirical work documenting the extent to which demand for investment

and mispricing can explain why firms issue equity. More specifically, if equity offerings are used to fund

investments, we do not know which type of investments they typically fund, and which tend to be funded

from internally-generated capital. This section applies the methods discussed above for IPOs to a large

sample of SEOs with the goal of addressing these questions.

A. Univariate Analysis of Increases in Investments across SEO Offer Types

           Table V presents the means and medians of normalized increases for the seven accounting

variables, broken down by SEO offer type. For each category, the secondary-only offerings coincide with

the significantly smaller growth rates for each of the seven variables than either primary or combined

offers. This pattern is consistent with the primary offerings raising capital for investments, as well as to

increase liquidity through increasing cash and decreasing long-term debt. Perhaps surprisingly, the

combined offerings tend to have larger growth rates than the primary-only ones for each variable except

R&D. This difference is potentially due to a failure of the univariate statistics to control adequately for

other factors. We next attempt to control for such factors in a multivariate setting.

B. Multivariate Analysis of Changes in Accounting Variables across SEO Offer Types

           Table VI presents estimates of an equation predicting changes in each of the seven accounting

variables following SEOs, using the specification presented in Equation (1). As with IPOs, the

specification includes primary and secondary capital separately, funds from other sources of capital, as

well as a control for firm size and dummies for country and year.

           The results for SEOs are similar to IPOs in two respects. First, the value of primary issues is

positively correlated with most of the variables except for debt reduction, whereas proceeds from

secondary shares are mostly unrelated to these variables. Second, proceeds from primary capital are

19
     These authors focus their discussion on mergers, but the same argument could be applied to any investment.


                                                          16
mainly used in R&D and held as cash, while internally generated capital is used for acquisitions and debt

reductions.

        However, the effect of fresh capital on cash holdings seems to be substantially smaller in SEOs

than in IPOs. For example, in Table VI, the change in cash holdings implied by a dollar increase in

primary capital in SEO is 62.1 cents for year one and 46.8 cents for year four. In comparison, the

corresponding implied changes for IPOs from Table IV are 106.7 cents and 88.8 cents. This difference

suggests that market timing motivations may be more apparent in IPOs than in SEOs, consistent with the

time series evidence reported in Table I.

        The implied increase following a dollar increase in other sources of funds is the largest for

reductions in long-term debt. Moreover, the implied increase in long-term debt reduction incurred for a

marginal dollar of internally generated funds is much larger than that incurred by a marginal dollar raised

in a seasoned equity offering. This pattern is broadly consistent with Pulvino and Tarhan (2003), who

show that a dollar increase in internally generated cash flows has larger effect on debt reduction than on

increases in investment.



V. Market Timing as a Motivation for Seasoned Equity Offers

        In the previous two sections, we have argued that demand for capital for investments appears to

be an important motivation for issuing public equity. We also documented that equity-issuing firms hold

on to cash they raise for some time, especially after the IPOs, consistent with these firms timing the

market. In this section, we examine this possibility in a more direct manner by relating Tobin’s q to the

proportion of secondary shares sold in SEOs and the sensitivity of investment to primary shares. We

restrict the tests in this section to SEOs since the tests require information on Tobin’s q prior to the equity

offering.

A. Tobin’s q and the Proportion of Secondary Shares Offered

        The distinction between primary and secondary sales of equity makes it possible to examine

alternative theories of equity issuance. Primary share issuance should be observed when the firm has a


                                                      17
demand for capital, while secondary issuances should coincide with a high demand on the part of the

managers for liquidity. 20 In addition, if a firm’s stock is overvalued, Baker and Wurgler (2000) argue that

managers have incentives to issue more of it, while if the stock is undervalued, managers will, at least at

the margin, choose sources of financing other than equity. 21

        The Baker and Wurgler argument also has predictions for the type of equity offering. If a firm is

issuing equity because managers feel the stock is overvalued, then the difference between the current

stock price and true value represents rents transferred from investors to the selling shareholders. In

primary issues, these rents are shared by all shareholders; however, when the firm issues secondary

shares, they are kept by the selling shareholders. Since managers themselves presumably are one of the

selling shareholders, we expect to observe the fraction of shares made up of secondary shares to be higher

when the motivation for the sale is that the stock is overvalued.

        We now examine this hypothesis empirically. As a measure of valuation, we rely on Tobin’s q,

estimated by the book value of assets minus book value of equity plus market value equity over the book

value of assets as of the closest fiscal year end prior to the SEO announcement. However, there are likely

to be factors that cause rational deviations of observed q from 1. For example, the presence of intangible

assets, or a book value of assets that substantially deviates from its market value can affect q, even if the

market values the firm correctly. We follow Blanchard, Rhee, and Summers (1993) and estimate an

equation predicting expected q as a function of a number of accounting variables.

        One statistical issue when estimating q cross-sectionally is that q is bounded below by 0, but not

bounded above. Thus if we were to use q as the dependent variable, the residuals would likely be skewed

and not normally distributed. In addition, the regression coefficients would in large part be determined by




20
   Information on the identity of the seller of secondary shares is only available for about 20% of the sample. In
what follows, we are assuming that at least some of the shares sold belong to the firm’s managers.
21
   Baker and Wurgler (2000) is only one of a number of studies supporting this view. Perhaps the most telling piece
of evidence is that in their survey of CFOs of public corporations, Graham and Harvey (2001) find that two-thirds
identify the amount to which their stock is overvalued or undervalued as an important consideration in the decision
to issue equity. See Baker, Ruback, and Wurgler (2004) for a survey and discussion of this literature.

a few observations with very large q’s. As a partial correction for this problem, we use the log of q rather

than its level as the dependent variable in the first-stage regression. We estimate the following model:

                −1
                     ⎛ salesit    ⎞ −1 ⎛ salesit               ⎞ −1 ⎛ op. incomeit   ⎞ −1 ⎛ dividend it    ⎞ −1 ⎛ R & Dit        ⎞

              t = −3 ⎝ asset it    ⎠ t = −3 ⎝ salesi ( t −1)   ⎠       ⎝       it     ⎠ t = −3 ⎝ priceit    ⎠ t =−3 ⎝ asset it    ⎠

The estimation results are given by;

      = 0.51 - 0.24(s/a)-1 + 0.14(s/a)-2 + 0.10(s/a)-3+ 0.09(s-1/s-2) + 0.01(s-2/s-3) + 0.14(s-3/s-4) + 0.22(i/a)-1+ 0.29(i/a)-2

where t-stats for each coefficient is reported in the parenthesis with an R2 value of 0.348.

         Fitted values from this regression represent estimates of expected log q’s, conditional on the

factors in the regression specification. Residuals from this regression come from a number of sources,

including model misspecification. However, one important factor that will make up the regression

residual is any potential misvaluation of the security. Therefore, the residual from this regression is a

potential proxy for the level of overvaluation or undervaluation of the stock.

         Table VII reports the results from regressing the proportion of secondary shares offered in SEOs

on fitted values of ln[q] and residual ln[q] as well as the raw ln[q]. In the first four columns, the main

regressors are raw ln[q]. Because raw q can also reflect rational valuations, we also regress the

proportion of secondary shares on the fitted ln[q] and residual ln[q] from the first stage regression in

columns (5) and (6). Columns (1) and (2) use the full sample that has information on q, while in columns

(3) and (4), the observations are restricted to be the same as in columns (5) and (6) where we require

enough information for the first stage estimation. Country and year fixed effects are included in all

specifications.

         The results in Table VII indicate that the proportion of secondary shares is positively and

significantly related to both ln[q] and to the residuals from the first-stage regression. This finding appears

to be robust to choice of specification and is consistent with the view that firms are more likely to issue




                                                                      19
secondary shares when their shares are relatively overvalued. Presumably, when stocks are overvalued,

insiders take advantage of the valuation and sell their shares in a secondary offering.

B. Tobin’s q and Cross Sectional Difference in Sensitivity of Investments to Fresh Capital

        In addition to the type of offering, high valuations potentially affect the use of the proceeds from

the offering. To the extent that high valuations lead to equity offerings because of mispricing, we expect

the proceeds to be kept as cash or other liquid assets. Alternatively, if high valuations reflected by q’s

occur because of high investment opportunities, then we would expect the proceeds of equity offerings

from high q firms to be used primarily to fund investments.

        To test this hypothesis, we first sort the sample of by q in each country, and divide each country

into three equal-sized terciles. We then interact dummies indicating whether the firm is in the high q

group, the medium q group, or the low q group with alternative sources of capital; proceeds raised from

primary shares and internally generated capital. The resulting estimates of this equation are presented in

Table VIII. Panel A contains coefficient estimates and t-statistics and Panel B reports the implied

changes in the dependent variables when primary capital or other sources of funds is increased by a

dollar. Panel B also provides p-values from comparing coefficients between primary capital and other

sources as well as between low q firms and high q firms. As before, all regressions include country and

year fixed effects as well as ln[total assets] and dummies for low q and high q firms, which are omitted

for the sake of brevity.

        The results from Table VIII indicate that the effect of primary capital on subsequent investment

varies according to the level of q prior to the SEO. Firms with low q’s are more likely to use the funds

they raised in increasing inventory, capital expenditures, acquisitions and reducing long-term debt

compared to high q firms. In contrast, firms with high q’s are more likely to hold on to the cash they

raised than low q firms. These differences between high q firms and low q firms are mostly significant

for capital expenditures, debt reduction and cash holdings. For example, the implied increase in capital

expenditures by increasing primary capital by a dollar is 22.6 cents for low q firms but only 3.6 cents for

high q firms in the first year after the SEO. Over time this increases to 67.9 cents for low q firms but only

                                                     20
up to 16.4 cents for high q firms. On the other hand, cash holdings increase by 38.2 cents for low q firms

but up to 56.4 cents for high q firms in the first year after the SEO. Over 4 years this decreases to 23.1

cents for low q firms and 42.0 cents for high q firms, still almost twice as much as the low q firms.

         These results suggest that the relative importance of market timing versus raising capital for

investment depends on the firm level Tobin’s q’s. High q firms appear to be more focused on timing the

market, whereas low q firms seem to be issuing seasoned equities to meet their demand for capital. This

finding also suggests that our estimate of q reflects valuation rather than investment opportunities, since

high q firms are less likely to invest out of marginal funds than are low q firms. 22



V. Conclusion

         Public equity offerings are one of the most visible and most studied events in finance. Yet, the

basic question of why firms issue publicly-traded equity has received relatively little attention from the

empirical literature. We provide some evidence on this question, using a sample of 16,958 IPOs and

12,373 SEOs from 38 countries. We estimate the actual use of the funds raised in both initial and

seasoned offers. In doing so, we control explicitly for the type of shares issued. We also consider how a

measure of the firms’ over or undervaluation affects the issuance, both in terms of the types of shares

issued and the use of the proceeds.

         Our results suggest that equity offers are used both to raise capital to finance investment, and also

to time equity markets to take advantage of high valuations. Our estimates indicate that new capital

raised in equity offerings is used to finance investments. They imply that R&D expenditures increase by

19 cents for a marginal dollar of capital raised in the first year following an IPO, and by 17 cents per

marginal dollar raised in the first year following an SEO. These figures increase to 85 cents per dollar

raised if the changes are computed over the four-year period following IPOs and 54 cents for the four-

year period following SEOs. We find similar relation, albeit smaller, for capital expenditures. These

22
  Lian (2005) finds that SEO firms with intense insider trading prior to the issuance do not invest more but keep the
extra money in cash balances for years. This finding suggests that both the insider trades and the equity offerings
are motivated by the same thing, most likely high firm valuations.


                                                         21
estimated expenditures are substantially, and statistically significantly, larger than the comparable

numbers for a marginal dollar of internally-generated cash. They strongly suggest that one motive behind

the equity offer is to raise capital to finance this investment.

        We also find evidence consistent with the view that some equity offers are made to take

advantage of high valuations. Firms keep much of the money they raise in the equity offer as cash in the

firm; this fraction is substantially higher when the firm has a high value of Tobin’s q, indicating that it is

potentially overvalued. In contrast, expenditures on investments are higher for low q firms than for high

q firms. In addition, SEOs done by firms with high value of q tend to have a higher fraction of secondary

shares, suggesting that insiders are taking advantage of the high valuation to sell some of their shares.

Overall, these results are consistent with view in which equity offers are sometimes used to finance

investment, and sometimes, when a firm is valued very highly by the market, to exploit the high valuation

both for the shareholders’ and managers’ benefits.

         The ability of equity markets to provide financing for firms outside the U.S. and the U.K. has

been widely questioned (see La Porta et al. (1997)). Yet, we find that primary offerings are the

predominate form of equity offerings in most of the world especially for IPOs, and primary offerings

appear to be correlated with a number of factors measuring the demand for capital. These findings are at

least suggestive of the idea that firms around the world do in fact use equity markets to raise capital for

investment. The extent to which they do so, and the factors that determine across countries the

differences in equity markets are important issues not analyzed here, and of course would be good topics

for future research.

                              Distribution of IPO and SEO Offer Types
This table presents the distribution of IPO and SEO offer types across the regions in our sample. An IPO
or an SEO is characterized as primary only, secondary only or combined offering, according to the type(s)
of shares being sold. Panels A-1 and A-2 present the distribution based on the number of IPOs and SEOs
and Panels B-1 and B-2 provide breakdown according to the total proceeds raised. The relative
proportion of each offer type is reported in parentheses. The sample period is from 1990 to 2003.

          Average Normalized Increases in Assets and Expenditures Following IPOs by Offer Type
  This table presents the mean and median increases in assets and expenditures following an IPO. Increase
  in assets (total assets, inventory, cash) is defined as ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets 0 ) + 1] , and increase in
  expenditures (CAPEX, acquisition, R&D, reduction in long term debt) is defined as
   ln[(∑i =1Vi total assets 0 ) + 1] , where 0 denotes the fiscal year end just prior to the IPO and t denotes
           t


  number of years after year 0. t-statistics and Mann-Whitney z-statistics for comparisons of means and
  medians between primary only and combined, and between combined and secondary only group are also
  provided. Bold letters indicate statistical significance at less than 5%. The sample period for this table is
  from 1990 to 2001.

     The Effect of the Type of Capital on Subsequent Increases in Assets and Expenditures in IPOs
  The dependent variable for asset-based variables (total assets, inventory, cash) is Y =
   ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets0 ) + 1] , and for expenditures (CAPEX, acquisition, R&D, reduction in long term
  debt) is Y = ln[( ∑it =1Vi total assets 0 ) + 1] . Independent variables are primary capital, secondary capital,
  other sources of funds, all of which are normalized by total assets, and ln[total assets]. All regressions
  include year and country fixed effects. Coefficient for ln[total assets] and fixed effects are omitted for the
  sake of brevity. Dollar changes are the implied change in the dependent variable when primary capital or
  other sources of funds is increased by $1 (for a median-sized firm in 1996 in the U.S.) Bold letters
  indicate statistical significance at 5%, using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered by
  industry (2 digit SIC). The sample period for this table is from 1990 to 2001.

          Average Normalized Increases in Assets and Expenditures Following SEOs by Offer Type
  This table presents the mean and median increases in assets and expenditures following an IPO. Increase
  in assets (total assets, inventory, cash) is defined as ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets 0 ) + 1] , and increase in
  expenditures (CAPEX, acquisition, R&D, reduction in long term debt) is defined as
   ln[(∑i =1Vi total assets 0 ) + 1] , where 0 denotes the fiscal year end just prior to the IPO and t denotes
           t


  number of years after year 0. t-statistics and Mann-Whitney z-statistics for comparisons of means and
  medians between primary only and combined, and between combined and secondary only group are also
  provided. Bold letters indicate statistical significance at less than 5%. The sample period for this table is
  from 1990 to 2001.

      The Effect of the Type of Capital on Subsequent Increases in Assets and Expenditures in SEOs
  The dependent variable for asset-based variables (total assets, inventory, cash) is Y =
   ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets0 ) + 1] , and for expenditures (CAPEX, acquisition, R&D, reduction in long term
  debt) is Y = ln[( ∑it =1Vi total assets 0 ) + 1] . Independent variables are primary capital, secondary capital,
  other sources of funds, all of which are normalized by total assets, and ln[total assets]. All regressions
  include year and country fixed effects. Coefficient for ln[total assets] and fixed effects are omitted for the
  sake of brevity. Dollar changes are the implied change in the dependent variable when primary capital or
  other sources of funds is increased by $1 (for a median-sized firm in 1996 in the U.S.) Bold letters
  indicate statistical significance at 5%, using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered by
  industry (2 digit SIC). The sample period for this table is from 1990 to 2001.

                        The Relationship between Proportion of Secondary Shares Offered and Tobin’s q in SEOs

The dependent variable is the proportion of secondary shares offered in SEOs. ln[q] is the logarithm of book value of assets minus book
value of equity plus market value equity over book value of assets as of the closest fiscal year end prior to the SEO announcement. Fitted
ln[q] and residual ln[q] are based on the following first stage estimation;
                −1
                     ⎛ salesit    ⎞ −1 ⎛ salesit               ⎞ −1 ⎛ op. incomeit   ⎞ −1 ⎛ dividend it    ⎞ −1 ⎛ R & Dit         ⎞
ln[qi ] = α + ∑ β t ⎜⎜            ⎟⎟ + ∑ γ t ⎜                 ⎟ + ∑δ t ⎜            ⎟⎟ + ∑ φt ⎜⎜          ⎟⎟ + ∑ λt ⎜⎜           ⎟⎟ + ε i

Columns (1) and (2) use the full sample, and columns (3) through (6) are restricted to those observations that have enough information for
the first stage estimation. We use heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered by industry (2 digit SIC).The sample period is from
1990 to 2003.

                   The Effect of the Type of Capital and Tobin’s q on Subsequent Increases in Assets and Expenditures in SEOs
The dependent variable for asset-based variables is Y = ln[((Vt − V 0 ) total assets 0 ) + 1] , and for expenditures is Y = ln[(∑ t Vt total assets 0 ) + 1] . The

independent variables are primary capital, other sources of funds, both of which are normalized by total assets and interacted with 3 dummy variables (LoQ,
MedQ and HiQ) reflecting the level of q’s in each country. Country and year fixed effects as well as ln[total assets], LoQ and HiQ are included in all
regressions(not reported). Panel A presents coefficients and t-stats using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered by industry (2 digit SIC). Panel
B presents implied change in the dependent variable when primary capital or other sources of funds is increased by $1 and also p-values from comparing
coefficients. The sample period for this table is from 1990 to 2001.

Appendix Table I. Distribution of IPO Offer Types

This table presents the distribution of IPO and SEO offer types across the countries in our sample. An
IPO or an SEO is characterized as primary only, secondary only or combined offering, according to the
type(s) of shares being sold. Panels A-1 and A-2 present the distribution based on the number of IPOs and
SEOs and Panels B-1 and B-2 provide breakdown according to the total proceeds raised. The relative
proportion of each offer type is reported in parentheses. The sample period is from 1990 to 2003.
