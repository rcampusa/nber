                                          ABSTRACT

The prison time actually served by a convicted criminal depends to a significant degree on
decisions made by the state during the course of imprisonment--on whether to grant parole or
other forms of sentence reduction. In this article we study a model of the adjustment of sentences
assuming that the state's objective is the optimal deterrence of crime. In the model, the state can
lower or raise the sentence based on deterrence-relevant information that it obtains about a
criminal during imprisonment. Our focus on sentence adjustment as a means of promoting
deterrence stands in contrast to the usual emphasis in sentence adjustment policy on reducing
recidivism.

1. Introduction

         When an individual is convicted of a crime, the court's sentencing decision will not fully

determine the length of his imprisonment. The time actually served by an offender will depend to

a significant degree on decisions made by the state after he is incarcerated. Notably, prisoners are

often granted parole 1 and can benefit from reductions of sentences through good time and earned

time credits provided that they meet certain standards. 2 As a result of these adjustments, the

sentences of individuals held in state prisons are estimated to be lowered by 49 percent. 3

         The contribution of this article is to study the general practice of altering sentences during

imprisonment within a model of deterrence. Specifically, we examine how information about

prisoners obtained during imprisonment can be employed to modify sentences so as to optimally

deter crime. 4 Such information could concern, for example, whether the prisoner has a history of

boards. See "Reentry Trends in the U.S. Releases from State Prison," Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Justice
Programs, U.S. Department of Justice (available at <https://www.bjs.gov/content/reentry/reentry_contents. cfm>;

2016/1495/030_august_31_2016_meeting_10_00_a_m_room_412_east_state_capitol/memono4g>). Although there
is some overlap between good time and earned time, good time credits are typically awarded to a prisoner for
obeying prison rules, while earned time credits are usually conferred for satisfactory participation in a self-
improvement activity, such as vocational training or a drug treatment program. Whether a prisoner receives good
time credits depends on an assessment of his behavior by a state agent while incarcerated. Likewise, whether a
prisoner is granted earned time credits often depends on an evaluation of his involvement in a self-improvement
program.

          See Durose and Langan (2004, p. 5, Table 4). This article from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports the
percentage of mean sentences served by individuals in state prisons who have been convicted of felonies (there is no
subsequent Bureau of Justice Statistics publication that provides the percentage). Parole is currently unavailable to
Federal prisoners, who constitute 13 percent of all prisoners, though they can benefit from good time credits, which
lower their sentences on average by 12 percent. See Carson (2018, p. 3) and Motivans (2015, p. 39, Table 7.11).

           Although, to our knowledge, our article is the first to undertake this task, several authors address related
issues. Miceli (1994), Garoupa (1996), and Polinsky (2015) examine how the modification of sentences can induce
good conduct within prison. Pyne (2015) discusses a mechanism that leads prisoners to reveal their disutility from
imprisonment, which can be used to foster deterrence. Also, Bernhardt, Mongrain, and Roberts (2012) and
Kuziemko (2013), among many others, study the use of sentence adjustment to limit recidivism.

recalcitrance, suggesting that he might be more difficult to deter, or whether he is temperate in

character and follows prison rules, suggesting that he is easier to deter. 5

         We begin in Section 2 by determining the optimal prison sentence in the standard model

of crime, in which sentences are imposed at the time of conviction and are not adjusted

afterwards.

         In Sections 3 and 4 we analyze what we refer to as the sentence-adjustment model, in

which the state might obtain information during imprisonment about the gain a prisoner derived

from the crime he committed and may alter the initial sentence in light of it. (A prisoner's gain is

a stand-in for any factor that affects his incentive to commit a crime, such as the cost of

committing the crime or the disutility he suffers from being imprisoned.) In Section 3, we

assume that the information about the gain is perfect. In that case, if the state learns a prisoner's

gain, the sentence should be lowered to zero when the prisoner could not have been deterred and

the sentence should be set at a level sufficient to accomplish deterrence when he can be

deterred. 6 It also follows that social welfare in this version of the sentence-adjustment model is

higher than in the standard model.

         In Section 4 we consider the sentence-adjustment model when the information the state

obtains about a prisoner's gain is imperfect. We first discuss an example in which what is

learned about a prisoner is whether he is in an easy-to-deter group or a hard-to-deter-group of

potential offenders and we explain why the optimal sentence rises when the information is that

the prisoner is in the hard-to-deter group and declines when he is in the easy-to-deter-group. We

         6
           Of course, since this policy will result in individuals who can be deterred choosing not to commit a crime,
they will not be sentenced in fact.

then show that although imperfect information about prisoners' gains often has social value, as in

the example, it is possible that such information has no social value. We also supply two general

sufficient conditions for imperfect information to have social value.

          In Section 5 we conclude with several comments on the interpretation of the model. We

also remark on the failure of prison authorities and scholars to consider the role of deterrence in

sentence adjustment policy--including that they ignore the possibility that raising sentences may

be desirable and that lowering sentences dilutes deterrence. Instead, their virtually exclusive

concern is with how the early release of prisoners affects recidivism.



2. The Standard Model

          We first consider the standard model of deterrence, in which criminals are sentenced

before imprisonment and sentences are not adjusted afterwards. 7 In this model individuals

choose whether to commit a harmful act and differ in the gains that they would obtain if they do

so. Let

   h = harm caused by the act; h > 0;

   g = gain that an individual would obtain from the act; and

f (g) = probability density of g in [0, ¯
                                        g]; f (g) > 0; ¯
                                                       g > 0,

where F is the cumulative distribution function of f. 8 We assume that g
                                                                       ¯ < h in order to rule out

cases in which acts are socially desirable to commit. We also assume that the state cannot

observe g but knows its probability density.




          7
              See Becker (1968) and Polinsky and Shavell (2000).
          8
            The function f should be interpreted as the distribution of gains conditional on the information available to
the state at the time of sentencing.

                                                           4
         Individuals who commit the act are caught with a probability and sentenced to a term of

imprisonment. Imprisonment imposes disutility on the offender and results in the state bearing

costs associated with the operation of prisons. Let

   p = probability that an individual who commits the harmful act is caught;

        p > 0;

   s = prison sentence; s is in [0, ¯
                                    s ]; ¯
                                         s > 0 ; and

   k = cost to the state per unit of imprisonment; k > 0.

We treat p as fixed in order to focus on optimal sentencing policy. The sentence s is assumed to

be equivalent to its disutility to a criminal. Hence, an individual will commit the harmful act if

g > ps and otherwise will be deterred. 9 We assume that ¯
                                                        s<¯
                                                          g to guarantee that it is not possible

to deter all individuals from committing the harmful act; the case of full deterrence would not be

of interest.

         Social welfare is the sum of individuals' gains from committing the act, less the harm

caused, less the disutility of imprisonment, and less the cost to the state of imprisonment: 10

                                           g
                                           ¯
                                 W (s) = [g ­ h ­ p(1 + k)s] f (g)dg.                                                (1)
                                          ps

In other words, each individual who commits the act changes social welfare by the amount g ­ h

­ ps ­ psk = g ­ h ­ p(1 + k)s. The state's problem is to choose the sentence s to maximize social

welfare (1). The solution, s*, can be characterized as follows.




         9
             We assume for convenience that the individual is deterred if g = ps.
         10
           This measure of social welfare does not reflect the cost to the state of maintaining the probability of
detection p. Were we to include that cost, it would be a constant term in social welfare.


                                                            5
        Proposition 1. In the standard model of deterrence,

        (a) the optimal sentence s* may be at either endpoint or in the interior of [0, ¯
                                                                                        s ];

        (b) if 0 < s* < ¯
                        s , then s* must satisfy condition (5); and

        (c) if s* > 0, then a positive number of individuals will be imprisoned.

        Note. The optimal sentence s* reflects a tradeoff between the benefit of deterring more

individuals as s is raised and the social cost of longer sentences borne by individuals who are not

deterred. The optimal sentence might be zero because the social costs of imprisonment might

always outweigh the social benefits of deterrence, or maximal for the opposite reason. When s*

is positive, some individuals will always be imprisoned because a positive fraction of individuals

are undeterrable (those in [¯
                            s, ¯
                               g ])

        Proof. Part (a): The derivative of social welfare is

                                                           g
                                                           ¯
                   W (s) = ­p[ps ­ h ­ p(1 + k)s] f (ps) ­ p(1 + k) f (g)dg                          (2)
                                                          ps

                          = p[(h + pks) f (ps) ­ (1 ­ F (ps))(1 + k)],

where the first term is the marginal benefit from deterring individuals of type ps and the second

term is the marginal cost from sentencing undeterred individuals for an additional unit of time.

We first show that s* can be 0 by demonstrating that W (s) can be negative for all s in [0, ¯
                                                                                            s ]. We

do this by providing an example in which there is an upper bound on the first term in brackets in

the second line of (2) that is strictly less than a lower bound of the second term in brackets. In

                                                    ^ between 0 and ps . Then (h + pks ) f
                                                                                         ^ is an
particular, suppose that f (g) is uniform at height f                ¯               ¯

upper bound on the first term. Clearly, (1 ­ F (ps
                                                 ¯ ))(1 + k) is a lower bound for the second term.

Thus, W (s) will be negative for s in [0, ¯
                                          s ] if

                                            ^
                                 (h + pks
                                        ¯ ) f < (1 ­ F (ps
                                                         ¯ ))(1 + k),                                (3)

which will hold for a sufficiently low f

         To demonstrate that s* can be an interior point, we claim that W (0) > 0 and W (¯
                                                                                         s)<0

can hold simultaneously. We know that W (0) = p[hf (0) ­ (1 + k)], which will be positive if f (0)

is sufficiently high. Similarly, W (¯
                                    s ) = p{[h + pks
                                                   ¯ ] f (ps
                                                           ¯ ) ­ (1 ­ F(ps
                                                                         ¯ ))(1 + k)}, which will be

negative if f (ps
                ¯ ) is sufficiently low.

                                 s , we show that W (s) can be positive for all s in [0, ¯
         To prove that s* can be ¯                                                       s ]. Let f (g)

be uniform over [0, ¯
                    g ], and thus f (g) = 1/g
                                            ¯. Then h(1/g
                                                        ¯ ) is a lower bound for the first term in

brackets of the second line of (2). Clearly, (1 + k) is an upper bound for the second term in

brackets. Thus, W (s) will be positive for s in [0, ¯
                                                    s ] if

                                             h(1/¯
                                                 g ) > (1 + k),                                         (4)

which will hold for a sufficiently high h.

         Part (b): If s* is an interior solution, it must satisfy the first-order condition from (2),

namely

                                [h + pks] f (ps) = (1 ­ F (ps))(1 + k).                                 (5)

         Part (c): Individuals who will not be deterred include those for whom g is in (ps
                                                                                         ¯, ¯
                                                                                            g ]. This

group has positive mass since ps
                               ¯<g
                                 ¯. The fraction p of these individuals will be imprisoned for

the positive length of time s*. 



3. The Sentence-Adjustment Model with Perfect Information

         We now modify the standard model by assuming that after an offender is initially

sentenced and imprisoned, the state will learn his gain with some probability. In that event, the

state can change the offender's sentence. Let




                                                     7
              sI = initial sentence; sI is in [0, ¯
                                                  s ];

              q = probability that the state learns g when a person is in prison; 0 < q < 1; 11 and

          s(g) = adjusted sentence if the state learns g; s(g) is in [0, ¯
                                                                         s ].

         A person of type g will commit the harmful act when

                                          g > p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs(g)],                                                   (6)

for if the person is caught and sentenced to sI, the probability is (1 ­ q) that the state will not

observe g and thus that the sentence will remain sI, and the probability is q that the state will

observe g and alter the sentence to s(g).

         The state's problem is to choose sI and the function s(g) to maximize social welfare,

which is

                                      g
                                      ¯
                     W(sI, s(g)) = (g)[g ­ h ­ p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs(g)](1 + k)] f (g)dg,                                  (7)
                                     0

where (g) is 1 if (6) is satisfied and 0 otherwise. 12 The solution is as follows.

         Proposition 2. In the sentence-adjustment model of deterrence with perfect information,

         (a) the optimal initial sentence sI* may be at either endpoint or in the interior of [0, ¯
                                                                                                  s ];

         (b) if 0 < sI* < ¯
                          s , then sI* must satisfy condition (12);

         (c) the optimal adjusted sentence s*(g) accomplishes deterrence for all types g who can

be deterred, and is zero for all types g who cannot be deterred: s*(g) = 0 for g in [0, p(1 ­ q)sI];




         11
          For simplicity, we assume that q does not depend on the length of the initial sentence. If we were to
assume that q rises with sI and that q = 0 if sI = 0, the essential character of our results would not be affected.
         12
             This problem can be interpreted as that facing the state with respect to information it might obtain during
trial rather than during imprisonment. Then sI would be the sentence the state would impose if it only knew the
offense that was committed, g would be the possible information obtained about the offender during trial, and s(g)
would be the sentence determined at trial given g.

s*(g) = [(g/p) ­ (1 ­ q)sI]/q and rises from 0 to ¯
                                                  s for g in (p(1 ­ q)sI, p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                                                                         ¯ )]]; and

s*(g) = 0 for g in (p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                   ¯ )], g
                                         ¯];

        (d) if sI* > 0, then a positive number of individuals will be imprisoned; and

        (e) some individuals will be deterred in the optimal solution.

        Notes. (i) It is clear that if s(g) can be chosen so as to deter individuals of type g, it is

desirable to do so because the harmful act is socially undesirable. (For low values of g, this does

not require s(g) to be positive since the initial sentence sI is imposed with a positive probability.)

Conversely, if deterrence is not possible, s(g) should be zero since nothing is accomplished by

imposing costly sentences. 13 This explains part (c). It also explains part (e) because it will

always be possible to deter some individuals with a positive s*(g).

        (ii) The explanations of parts (a), (b), and (d) regarding sI* parallel the explanation of the

results regarding s* in Proposition 1.

        Proof. Part (c): If an individual is deterred, there will be no change in social welfare,

whereas if he is not deterred, the change in social welfare will be g ­ h ­ p(1 + k)[(1 ­ q)sI +

qs(g)], which is negative. Therefore, it is desirable to deter any individual who can be deterred. It

is clear from (6) that a person can be deterred if and only if g  p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                                                                 ¯ ]. For individuals

with g in [0, p(1 ­ q)sI], deterrence will be achieved if s(g) = 0. For individuals with g in (p(1 ­

q)sI, p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                     ¯ ]], it can be verified from (6) that deterrence will just be achieved if s(g) =

[(g/p) ­ (1 ­ q)sI]/q; in this interval, s(g) rises from 0 to ¯
                                                              s . We will use [(g/p) ­ (1 ­ q)sI]/q for

s*(g) when g is in [0, p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                      ¯ ] even though s*(g) in this region is not unique because a

higher s(g) would also deter. For individuals with g in (p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                                                        ¯ ], g
                                                                             ¯], who cannot be

deterred, the change in social welfare is g ­ h ­ p(1 + k)[(1 ­ q)sI + qs(g)], which is maximized

when s(g) = 0.

          Part (e): Some individuals can be deterred, those for whom g  p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                                                                       ¯ ), and

from part (c) we know that they will be deterred.

          Part (a): Given part (c), social welfare (7) can be written as

                                        g
                                        ¯
                               W(sI) = [g ­ h ­ p(1 ­ q)(1 + k)sI] f (g)dg,                            (8)

so that

      W (sI) = ­p(1 ­ q){p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs

                    p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs

We first show that sI* can be 0 by demonstrating that W (sI) can be negative for all s in [0, ¯
                                                                                              s ].

The proof parallels that of the corresponding result in Proposition 1. Again, assume that f (g) is

                  ^ between 0 and ps . Then (h ­ pqs + p(1 ­ q)ks ) f
                                                                    ^ is an upper bound on the

term. Thus, W (sI) will be negative for sI in [0, ¯
                                                  s ] if

which will hold for a sufficiently low f

          To demonstrate that sI* can be an interior point, we claim that W (0) > 0 and W (¯

                                                                      ¯ ) is sufficiently low.

be uniform over [0, ¯

                                                                 ¯ ) is a lower bound for the first

term in brackets of the second line of (9) and (1 + k) is an upper bound for the second term in

brackets. Thus, W (sI) will be positive for sI in [0, ¯
                                                      s ] if

which will hold for a sufficiently high h.

         Part (b): If sI* is an interior solution, it must satisfy the first-order condition from (9),

namely

         [(h ­ pqs
                 ¯ + p(1 ­ q)ksI) ] f (p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs
                                                      ¯ ]) = (1 ­ F (p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs

         Part (d): Individuals who will not be deterred include those for whom g is in (ps
                                                                                         ¯, g

group has positive mass since ps
                               ¯<g
                                 ¯. The fraction pq of these individuals will be imprisoned for

the positive length of time sI*. 

         The next result concerns social welfare under the sentence-adjustment model and

compares that model to the standard model.

         Proposition 3. Under the optimal solution to the sentence-adjustment model,

         (a) social welfare is higher than under the optimal solution to the standard model;

         (b) social welfare is increasing in the probability q that the state will observe the

prisoner's gain during imprisonment; and

         (c) the use of sentences is always desirable, whereas in the standard model the use of

sentences might not be desirable.

         Notes. (i) There are two welfare advantages of the sentence-adjustment model over the

standard model. First, sentencing costs can be lowered. To see this, suppose that sentences in the

sentence-adjustment model are initially chosen so as to duplicate the sentence in the standard


                                                     11
model--that is, sI = s(g) = s*--in which case the same individuals will be deterred in both

models, those for whom g  ps*. However, sentencing costs can be reduced by lowering s(g) to 0

for all individuals for whom g > ps*, that is, for those who are not deterred. The second

advantage of the sentence-adjustment model is that, if s* < ¯
                                                            s , greater deterrence can be

accomplished without incurring additional sentencing costs. To see this, suppose again that the

sentence-adjustment model duplicates the standard model. Consider individuals whose g is

slightly greater than ps* and who therefore would not be deterred in the standard model. These

individuals can be deterred in the sentence-adjustment model by raising s(g) above s*.

         (ii) The two welfare advantages of the sentence-adjustment model just described depend

on the observation of an offender's gain g. Therefore, if the probability q of observing g rises,

welfare will rise.

         (iii) In the standard model the use of sentences might not be desirable because the

deterrence benefits of any positive sentence might be exceeded by its sentencing costs. In the

sentence-adjustment model, however, it is always possible to use positive sentences to

accomplish deterrence without incurring sentencing costs. For example, set sI = 0, s(g) = ¯
                                                                                          s for g

in [0, pqs
         ¯ ] , and s(g) = 0 for g in (pqs
                                        ¯, g
                                           ¯]; then individuals with g in the first interval will be

deterred and everyone else will not face sentences.

         Proof. Part (a): The optimal solution to the standard model, s*, can be duplicated in the

sentence-adjustment model by setting sI = s* and s(g) = s* for all g. But Proposition 2(c) shows

that, if s* = sI = 0, s*(g) is positive in the interval [0, q¯
                                                             s ], implying that social welfare must be

higher in the sentence-adjustment model. Similarly, if s* = sI > 0, s*(g) is 0 in the interval (p[(1 ­

q)sI + qs
        ¯ )], g
              ¯], again implying that social welfare must be higher in the sentence-adjustment

model.


                                                   12
        Part (b): We prove this result by showing that social welfare (8) rises with q holding sI

constant. (Social welfare would be at least as high if sI were chosen optimally as a function of q.)

When q rises, the integrand rises, raising social welfare. The lower limit of integration remains

the same if sI = ¯
                 s and rises if s < ¯
                                    s . Thus, since the integrand is negative, social welfare must rise.

        Part (c): We know from Proposition 2(c) that in the sentence-adjustment model s*(g) is

positive over some positive interval of g. And we know from Proposition 1(a) that in the

standard model s* = 0 is possible. 



4. The Sentence-Adjustment Model with Imperfect Information

        We next consider the sentence-adjustment model when there exist imperfectly

informative signals about prisoners' gains. In particular, suppose that a signal identifies only a

subset of individuals to which a prisoner belongs, where the possible subsets are mutually

exclusive and exhaustive and are denoted Z (1), Z (2), . . ., Z (n), with n  2. Although each

individual in the population is a member of a single subset, we assume that different individuals

with the same g may be members of different subsets. Let f (g, j ) be the conditional density of g

over subset Z ( j ) and let r ( j ) > 0 be the probability of that subset. We assume that signals are

informative in the sense that at least two of the subsets have different conditional densities. The

unconditional density f (g) is the sum of r ( j ) f (g, j ) over j. Each individual in the population is

assumed to know his Z ( j ).

        In this section the adjusted sentence must be a function of the subset Z ( j ) to which a

prisoner belongs. Let

        s ( j ) = adjusted sentence if the state learns Z ( j ),

so that an individual who is a member of Z ( j ) will commit the harmful act when



                                                       13
                                        g > p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs ( j )]                                     (13)

and will be deterred otherwise.

        The state's problem is to choose sI and the function s (j) to maximize social welfare,

which is

                           n g
                             ¯
           W(sI, s (j)) =  {(g, j )[g ­ h ­ p[(1 ­ q)sI + qs ( j )](1 + k)] r ( j ) f (g, j )dg},       (14)
                         j =1 0

where (g, j ) is 1 if (13) is satisfied and 0 otherwise. To explain (14), consider a person who is a

member of Z ( j ). That person will commit the harmful act when (13) is satisfied, in which case

(g, j ) will be 1. The term in brackets then is his contribution to social welfare, and r ( j ) f (g, j ) is

the unconditional density of g in Z ( j ).

        It will be useful to define the conventionally optimal sentence sj* for subgroup Z ( j ) to be

the optimal sentence in the standard model if the distribution of gains g were given by the

conditional distribution f (g, j ).

        We now illustrate the sentence-adjustment model with imperfect information. Suppose

that the maximum gain g
                      ¯ of individuals is 100; the harm h is 150; the probability p of catching

offenders is 0.5; the maximum sentence ¯
                                       s is 160; the probability q of a signal is 0.3; and the

public cost k of sentences is 1 per unit time. Note that the highest expected sentence is 80, so that

any individual with a gain exceeding 80 is undeterrable.

        Suppose also that the population is divided into two subsets of equal size, so that r (1) =

r (2) = 0.5. The density of gains for each subset is a triangle over a lower region that consists of

deterrable individuals and is uniform over a higher region that consists of undeterrable

individuals. In particular, let the conditional density of subset Z (1) be 0 between 0 and 10; rise

linearly between 10 and 30 to a peak at height 1/30; decline linearly between 30 and 50 to 0;

remain at 0 until 80; and then be constant at 1/60 between 80 and 100. Similarly, let the
                                                        14
conditional density of subset Z (2) be 0 up to 30; rise linearly between 30 and 50 to the same peak

and then decline linearly to 0 at 70; remain at 0 until 80; and be constant at 1/60 between 80 and

100. We will refer to the first group as easy-to-deter and the second group as hard-to-deter

because the triangle of deterrable individuals in the first group is to the left of the triangle of

deterrable individuals in the second group.

        When this model is solved (which was done numerically), the optimal initial sentence sI*

is 130; the optimal adjusted sentence for the easy-to-deter group s (1)* is 10; and the optimal

adjusted sentence for the hard-to-deter group s (2)* is 150. 14 Consequently, the optimal expected

sentence for individuals in the easy-to-deter group is 47 (= 0.5[0.7(130) + 0.3(10)]) and the

optimal expected sentence for individuals in the hard-to-deter group is 68 (= 0.5[0.7(130) +

0.3(150)]).

        To understand these results, it is useful to compare them to the conventionally optimal

sentences for the two groups. For the easy-to-deter group, this sentence s1* is 94, which results in

an expected sentence ps1* of 47. The conventionally optimal sentence s1* reflects, for this group,

a balancing of the benefits of greater deterrence as the sentence is raised and the increased costs

of sentencing associated with individuals who are not deterred, some of whom are imprisoned.

As seen in the previous paragraph, the optimal solution to the sentence-adjustment model

achieves the same expected sentence for individuals in the easy-to-deter group--by lowering the

initial sentence sI* = 130 to the adjusted sentence s (1)* = 10--and therefore accomplishes the

same balancing of deterrence benefits and sentencing costs for individuals in this group. A

parallel explanation applies to the hard-to-deter group, for which the conventionally optimal

sentence s2* is 136 and ps2* is 68. This outcome, too, can be duplicated in the sentence-



        14
             The solution is not unique although optimal expected sentences are unique.

                                                          15
adjustment model by raising the initial sentence sI* = 130 to the adjusted sentence s (2)* = 150

when a signal identifies a prisoner as a member of the hard-to-deter group. 15

         If there were no chance of a signal identifying the group to which a prisoner belonged, a

single sentence would have to be used for everyone--this is the standard model. Then the

optimal sentence s* would be 132 and the expected sentence ps* would be 66 for all individuals.

Consequently, the resulting tradeoff between deterrence benefits and sentencing costs would be

suboptimal for both groups--excessive deterrence for the easy-to-deter group and insufficient

deterrence for the hard-to-deter group. The ability to adjust sentences on the basis of signals

raises social welfare by permitting different expected sentences to be employed to deter

individuals in the two groups, achieving a better tradeoff between deterrence benefits and

sentencing costs for both groups.

         A natural question is whether an informative signal about individuals' gains from crime

necessarily leads to an increase in social welfare. In some incentive contexts, informative signals

about individuals always can be employed to enhance welfare. Notably, this is true of signals

about individuals' effort in principal-agent models. 16 Here, however, informative signals about

individuals' gains might not raise welfare, as the next proposition demonstrates.

         Proposition 4. Information about individuals' types may not have social value; that is, the

optimal solution to the sentence-adjustment model may be equivalent to that of the standard

model.




         15
           The optimal expected sentences in the sentence-adjustment model will equal the conventionally optimal
expected sentences for all groups only if the signal probability q is sufficiently high (the intuition is that if q = 0, the
expected sentence has to be the same for all groups, while if q = 1, the expected sentence can be perfectly tailored
for each group).
         16
              This statement presumes that agents are risk averse. See Hölmstrom (1979) and Shavell (1979).


                                                            16
       Note. We will show that if signals convey information only about individuals who would

be deterred in the standard model, there may be no advantage in having that information.

       Proof. We employ a version of the above example in which the density of gains for each

subset is a modified triangle over a region between 20 and 60. For both groups, Z (1) and Z (2),

the conditional density is 0 up to 20 and between 60 and 80; and then constant at 1/60 between

80 and 100. For Z (1), we modify the triangle between 20 and 60, which has a height of 1/30 at

40, in the following way. Let the density between 25 and 35 rise by 1/200. For Z (2), we employ

the same triangle but lower the density between 25 and 35 by 1/200.

       Observe that the unconditional density of gains is 0 between 0 and 20; rises linearly

between 20 and 40 to a peak at height 1/30; declines linearly between 40 and 60 to 0; remains at

0 until 80; and then is constant at 1/60 between 80 and 100. Given this density, the optimal

solution of the standard model is s* = 114, with an expected sentence of 57 for everyone.

       Note that Z (1) and Z (2) convey information about gains below 57, and thus about

individuals who are deterred in the standard model. An optimal solution to the sentence-

adjustment model is sI* = s (1)* = s (2)* = 114, also resulting in each individual facing an

expected sentence of 57. Thus, social welfare in the two models is the same. 

       Although informative signals are not always socially valuable, we now provide two

sufficient conditions for them to have value.

       Proposition 5. A sufficient condition for information about individuals' types to have

social value is that the optimal sentence s* in the standard model is positive and that there exists

a type whose support lies above ps*; that is, the support of one of the subsets Z (j) lies above ps*.

       Notes. (i) This condition should ordinarily apply because it will commonly be true that

there are some individuals who can be recognized as undeterrable given p and s*.



                                                 17
       (ii) The reason that this is a sufficient condition is that the sentence for individuals of this

type can be lowered without affecting the deterrence of anyone else.

       Proof. First set sI = s* and s ( j ) = s* for all j, so that the outcome in the sentence-

adjustment model duplicates the optimal outcome in the standard model. Let group Z (1) be a

subset of individuals whose support lies above ps*. In both the standard model and the sentence-

adjustment model under our present assumptions, these individuals will commit the harmful act.

Now change s(1) to any s < s*. Individuals in subset Z (1) will continue to commit the harmful

act, but sentencing costs with respect to them will decline from ps*(1 + k) to p[(1 ­ q)s* + qs](1

+ k). Their contribution to social welfare will thus rise, while social welfare with respect to

everyone else will be unaffected. 

       Proposition 6. A sufficient condition for information about individuals' types to have

social value is that there is at least one subset Z ( j ) for which the conventionally optimal sentence

sj* differs from s* and that social welfare is concave in sj.

       Note. The reason that this condition is sufficient for information to have social value is

that it permits a sentence adjustment to be made that moves the expected sentence in the

direction of the ideal sentence for the specified group.

       Proof. First set sI = s* and s ( j ) = s* for all j, so that the outcome in the sentence-

adjustment model duplicates the optimal outcome in the standard model. Let group Z (1) be a

subset of individuals for whom s1* differs from s*. If s1* > s*, raise s(1) by a small amount 

from s* to s* +  < s1*. The expected sentence for individuals in group Z (1) will thus increase

from ps* to p[(1 ­ q)s* + q(s* + )]. Because this expected sentence is between ps* and ps1*, the

assumption of concavity implies that the contribution to social welfare of individuals in Z (1) will




                                                   18
also increase. Since social welfare with respect to everyone else is unaffected, social welfare

rises. If s1* < s*, an analogous argument (with s(1) declining by a small amount ) applies. 



5. Concluding Comments

         (a) Determinate versus indeterminate sentencing. The sentencing decision of a court may

be determinate--name a particular term--or indeterminate--specify lower and upper bounds on

the term, such as five to ten years. In the United States, approximately two-thirds of the states

employ indeterminate sentencing, with parole boards deciding on the length of time that

prisoners serve within the sentence's limits, together with adjustments for good time and earned

time. 17 In other countries, indeterminate sentencing is even more dominant as the form of

sentencing. 18 Although we assumed for simplicity that sentencing was determinate in our model,

it is clear that the thrust of our conclusions would not be altered if we studied indeterminate

sentencing. It would still be true that deterrence-relevant information acquired during

imprisonment would be socially desirable to employ in deciding on the length of incarceration.

         (b) Do potential offenders take sentence adjustment into account? Substantial evidence

exists that individuals are responsive to the threat of criminal sanctions. 19 This could only be the

case if individuals view the magnitude of possible sanctions as serious. Given that the level of

sentences is significantly altered during imprisonment­­we noted in the introduction that

sentences are reduced on average by about half--it is reasonable to assume that potential




         17

          18
             See Aharonson (2013, pp. 164-175). He views the United States as an outlier due to its increasing
reliance in recent decades on determinate sentencing.
         19
          See, for example, Andenaes (1966, pp. 960-973), Levitt and Miles (2007, pp. 466-474), Durlauf and
Nagin (2012, pp. 47-71), and Chalfin and McCrary (2017, pp. 13-32).

                                                            19
offenders would factor into their calculation of expected sentences the general effect of these

adjustments. This belief is reinforced, moreover, by the fact that the institution of parole is part

of our popular culture, as reflected in books, television and movies, and the news.

         (c) Can the state acquire information about prisoners that bears on deterrence? It is

plausible that the state can obtain information during imprisonment that is pertinent to

deterrence. Suppose, for example, that a parole board ascertains that a prisoner has generally

followed prison rules, has made an effort to obtain job training, and is remorseful for his crime.

This kind of record might indicate that a shorter sentence than would otherwise apply would be

appropriate on grounds of deterrence. 20 Or suppose that prison authorities find that a prisoner is

mentally ill. Such a discovery might suggest that he would not be very responsive to the

possibility of being caught and punished for criminal acts, again implying that a shorter sentence

would be desirable from the perspective of deterrence. 21

         Conversely, suppose that it becomes apparent to a parole board that a prisoner has a

history of insubordination, altercations with other prisoners, and the like. Behavior of this sort

could suggest the need for a lengthier sentence to properly deter. Likewise, suppose that it is

learned that the prisoner is a gang member. This too could indicate that a longer sentence would

be appropriate, for gang members might derive status benefits from committing crimes and also




         20
            The personality type of such a prisoner suggests that his criminal act may have been motivated by
unusual circumstances and that ordinarily individuals with his set of characteristics could be deterred by a shorter
sentence. The reason for lowering the sentence is not that the particular individual in prison would have been
deterred with a shorter sentence, for obviously he would not have. Rather, it is that a shorter sentence is more
desirable in expectation for individuals of this type. The rationale for lowering the sentence in the example in
Section 4 when a signal identifies a prisoner as a member of the easy-to-deter group is of this character.
         21
           The basis for this conclusion is essentially that given in Section 3 for the result that, if an individual's
gain g can be observed and his gain is so high that he cannot be deterred, the optimal sentence is zero. See
Proposition 2(c) and note (i) following the proposition. Here the reason for the inability to deter an individual is his
mental illness rather than his high gain.

                                                           20
view imprisonment as having less disutility because they will be protected from violence within

the prison or receive favorable treatment from guards.

         (d) The failure of parole boards and prison authorities as well as scholars to consider the

effects of sentence adjustment on deterrence. As we observed in the introduction, sentences are

reduced in various ways, through parole, good time, and earned time. But none of these

reductions are motivated by considerations of deterrence. When parole boards decide on

sentence reduction, they focus on whether a prisoner is likely to commit another crime if he is

released, that is, whether he will become a recidivist. 22 Good time credits are employed by prison

authorities mainly as a reward for good behavior within prison; and earned time credits are used

to encourage prisoners to participate in self-improvement activities. 23 Moreover, discussions of

sentence adjustment by scholars focus on issues of recidivism and encouraging good behavior of

prisoners. 24

         This lack of attention to the effects of sentence adjustment on deterrence can lead to

undesirable social policy. First, the practice of lowering sentences during imprisonment can

obviously undermine deterrence. Suppose a person is sentenced to a twenty-year prison term for

murder but is released after ten years because a parole board concludes that, given his exemplary

behavior in prison, he would no longer be a risk to society. 25 Clearly, other individuals



         22
            See generally Cohen (2018, § 4:30), who observes that "the most basic criteria for release on parole" are
"whether there is a reasonable probability that a prison inmate, if placed on parole, will be able to live and conduct
himself or herself as a respectable, law-abiding person, and whether release will be compatible with the offender's
own welfare and the welfare and safety of society."
         23
              See note 2 above.
         24
            For example, Bernhardt, Mongrain, and Roberts (2012) and Kuziemko (2013) focus on the effect of early
release of prisoners on recidivism, not on deterrence.
         25
          According to Durose and Langan (2004, p. 5, Table 4), the mean prison sentence for murder (including
nonnegligent manslaughter) is 225 months (18.8 years), whereas prisoners serve on average 142 months (11.8
years).

                                                          21
contemplating committing murder could believe that they too would serve a sentence much

shorter than twenty years if they behaved well in prison. Second, it may obviously be desirable to

raise sentences if information indicates that doing so would promote deterrence (see comment

(c)), yet sentences are never raised in practice.
