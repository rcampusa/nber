                          THE CHANGING LABOR MARKET
                        POSITION OF CANADIAN IMMIGRANTS


                                        ABSTRACT

       This paper uses pooled 1971, 1981, and 1986 Canadian census data to evaluate the extent
to which (1) the earnings of Canadian immigrants at the time of immigration fall short of the
earnings of comparable Canadian-born individuals, and (2) immigrants' earnings grow more
rapidly over time than those of the Canadian-born. Variations in the labor market assimilation
of immigrants according to their gender and country of origin are also analyzed. The results
suggest that recent immigrant cohorts have had more difficulty being assimilated into the
Canadian labor market than earlier ones, an apparent consequence of recent changes in Canadian
immigration policy, labor market discrimination against visible minorities, and the prolonged
recession of the early 1980s.

    THE CHANGING LABOR MARKET POSITION OF CANADIAN IMZ4IGRMJTS



     Immigration   has accounted for slightly more than half of

Canada's population increase this century, with the new

immigrants' share of population increase having grown steadily
since the 1930s (Bloom and Gunderson 1991, p. 327). Especially
since the period following World War II, immigration has been a
key instrument of Canadian labor market policy. Policymakers
have used immigration flows to ameliorate the effects of
variations in labor market tightness, both across regions and

over time. Policymakers also expect immigration to be an
important source of future labor force growth, providing

resources that will help satisfy the growing health care and
pension needs of an otherwise aging population.

     The importance of immigration to the growth and stability of
Canada's economy has given rise to a number of related policy
issues. First, "visible minorities" are one of four designated
groups targeted for affirmative action to promote employment
equity.' Second, the effects of immigration are being
dramatically felt in the education system, especially in larger
cities, where increasing numbers of students do not speak English

or French as their primary language. Third, immigration has
always been a contentious issue with respect to its impact on the


1. The federal government has passed formal employment equity
legislation (including contract compliance) which essentially
requires affirmative action for four designated groups: women,
aboriginal people, handicapped people, and visible minorities.
Such legislation also exists, or is under consideration, in a
number of local and provincial jurisdictions.
                                                                   2

wages and employment of the native-born population. Finally,
multiculturalisrn has been fostered as a policy to encourage the

"vertical mosaic" image of Canadian society, as opposed to the

"melting pot" image that is the stereotype in the United States.
If the vertical mosaic is to prevail, however, immigrants must

have a reasonable opportunity to assimilate throughout the
vertical structure and not be segregated at lower rungs of the
ladder.

     This paper focuses on a topic that cuts across all these
issues: the extent to which immigrants assimilate into the

Canadian labor market in the sense that their earnings patterns

come to match the earnings patterns of otherwise comparable

Canadian-born individuals.2 The paper's contribution is
empirical. It provides evidence on such factors as: (a) the
extent to which immigrants' earnings at the time of immigration
fall short of the earnings of comparable Canadian-born

individuals (that is, the entry effect); (b) the extent to which
immigrants' earnings grow more rapidly over time than those of
comparable Canadian-born individuals (that is, the assimilation
effect); (c) the number of years it takes for immigrants'

earnings to catch up with those of comparable Canadian-born
persons; (d) the extent to which the observed patterns of such

assimilation may be biased because they do not adequately control
for unobserved quality differences across immigrant cohorts (that

is, cohort effects)3; and (e) the degree of variation in the

labor market assimilation of immigrants according to such factors

as gender, country of origin, period of immigration, and the
state of the economy. This paper expands on Bloom and Gunderson
(1991) by adding evidence from the 1986 census, an important
update because it includes the effect of the prolonged recession
of the early 1980s, and by adding evidence for women and region

of origin.
     The paper begins with a brief description of Canadian

immigration policy during the period covered by our data
analyses. The basic empirical model is then set out, followed by
the empirical results and a comparison of the results with those
from other studies. The final section summarizes and discusses
the results.


C?NADIAN IIGRATION POLICY


     A number of key elements of Canadian immigration policy

during the period of our data analyses—the period following World
War II until the 1986 census—are likely to affect the




3. Quality is taken here to mean conventionally unobserved
attributes like motivation, ambition, and ability that may affect
earnings, Changes in conventionally observed determinants of
worker quality, such as years of education and work experience,
are controlled for by including them as regressors in the
earnings equations.
                                                                  4

selectivity, labor market behavior, and assimilation of

immigrants.4 These policy elements include the following:
     1. An emphasis on skills and labor market criteria in

determining eligibility for immigration;
     2. An emphasis on the labor market's capacity to absorb new

immigrants without placing undue hardship on the existing
domestic work force;
     3. A willingness to change criteria in a "tap-on, tap-off"

fashion to alter immigrant flows to meet domestic economic needs;
     4. The introduction of the point system in 1967, which was
skills oriented, but was mainly for the independent class, and

which otherwise led to greater emphasis on family reunification;
     5. The increased emphasis in the late 1970s on human rights
and humanitarian issues as they related to immigrants, especially

refugees.
     For our purposes, the changes in immigration policy that
occurred after the mid-1960s (points 4 and 5 above) are

particularly important. The point system introduced in 1967
continued the emphasis on skills orientation and adaptability to

the labor market; however, this emphasis applied mainly to the
independent class of immigrants (and to a lesser degree, to
assisted relatives) .   Family reunification became more important


4. The key elements are discussed in an appendix that is
available from the authors on request. Green (1976) provides a
more detailed discussion of earlier immigration policy, with more
recent changes discussed in DeSilva (1992), Green and Green
(1993), Stoffman (1993), and Wright and Maxim (1991) .
                                                                  5

as a criterion, and immigrants arriving to be with their families

did not have to meet the skills requirements.5

    These changes were associated with two notable developments.

The first was a decline in the proportion of immigrants in the

independent and assisted relative (e.g., brothers, sisters,
cousins) categories (both of which have to meet the skills-
oriented criteria, with points awarded for having relatives in
Canada) and a dramatic increase in the proportion admitted under
the refugee and family classes (who did not have to meet the
skills criteria, but who entered to be reunited with their

families or as refugees) •6 These changes became especially
pronounced after the early 1970s. Their dramatic effect is

illustrated by the changing distribution of immigrants by entry
category. In 1968 approximately 74 percent of immigrants were.
admitted under the point-related independent and assisted
relatives categories, while 26 percent entered under family and
refugee status. By the 1980s these proportions had almost
reversed themselves, with only 35 percent admitted under the


5. Abbott and Beach (1993) document the fact that Canadian
immigration policy became increasingly skills oriented until the
late 1960g. Stoffman (1993)and Wright and Maxim (1991) document
how it became less skills oriented thereafter.

6. Under the Immigration Act of 1976, which was implemented in
1978, the category of nominated relative was replaced by assisted
relative, and the category of sponsored applicant was replaced by
the family category. The new categories were essentially the
same as the old ones, except that in the earlier designations,
parents and grandparents were included as nominated relatives if
under the age of sixty and as sponsored applicants if older than
sixty. In the 1976 designation, they were categorized as family
irrespective of age.
                                                                   6

independent and assisted relatives categories and 65 percent
under family and refugee status (Wright and Maxim 1991).

        The second development was a shift in the country of origin
distribution away from the industrial countries (notably European
countries and the United States) to the developing countries (see

Bloom and Gunderson 1991.; Borjas 1988; Wright and Maxim 1991).
Wright and Maxim (1991) indicate that in 1968, approximately 80
percent of immigrants were from industrial countries and 20

percent were from developing countries. By 1985, 33 percent came
from industrial countries and 67 percent came from developing

countries. Presumably, the changes that occurred since the mid-
1960s have led to more difficulty in labor market assimilation

because of the decreased emphasis on skills orientation and the

greater emphasis on family reunification and human rights and
humanitarian issues. This hypothesis is tested empirically in
the following section.



THE EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORX: ENTRY, ASSIMILATION, AND COHORT EFFECTS


        The basic empirical model is a Chiswick (1978) type of

immigrant earnings equation, augmented to allow for the cphort-

specific effects emphasized by Borjas (1985)


    y =    Xf   ÷ aI + ÔYSM(I) + Ee,COH(I)                       (1)



where
                                                                  7

    y =    natural logarithm of earnings
    X =    vector of standard human capital   determinants of

earnings and other control variables (given in appendix i), with

associated parameter vector f;
     I = dummy variable coded 1 for immigrants, 0 for Canadian-

born individuals;
    YSM = years since migration for immigrants (= 0 for

Canadian-born individuals); and
     COH = a vector of time period dummy variables reflecting

immigrants' year of entry into Canada, coded in five-year
intervals (all dummies coded as 0 for the Canadian-born)

The coefficients of most interest in this specification are:
     a =   entry effect
     6 =   assimilation effect
       =   vector of immigrant   cohort effects
     Assuming that cr<0 and 6>0, an estimate of the number of

years it takes for immigrants' earnings to catch up with the
earnings of otherwise comparable Canadian-born individuals (that



7. Experience is measured here in the conventional fashion using
Mincer's identity (age minus education minus six), because the
census data do not contain a direct measure of actual experience.
The discrepancy between actual and measured experience could be
especially important for women, who are more likely to have
interruptions in their labor market experience. Because they use
the Canadian National Mobility Survey of 1973, which is unique
for Canada in that it has a measure of actual experience, Abbott
and Beach (1993), Beach and Worswick (1993), and Meng (1987) can
circumvent this problem. The trade-off, of course, is that the
1973 Mobility Survey data contain no information on immigrants'
assimilation patterns since the 1970s, which are the focus of
this analysis.
                                                                  8

is, years to equality) is given by the number of years it takes

for the positive assimilation effect to offset the negative entry
effect (net of any cohort fixed effect). This is calculated as

 — _______


     The entry effect, a, is simply the difference in earnings
between immigrants and otherwise comparable Canadian-born
individuals at the time of entry of the immigrants into Canada,
that is, when YSM = 0, and for the reference cohort that entered

prior to 1956. We would expect this difference to be negative,
reflecting the depreciated value of human capital that is

specific to the origin country, the difficulties immigrants may
initially have in communicating in Canada, a possible lack of

information among Canadian employers concerning immigrants'
credentials and qualifications, the possibility of relatively
more labor market discrimination against new immigrants, and a
lower reservation wage for immigrants.

     The assimilation effect, ó, is the average percentage change
in immigrants' earnings for each year spent in Canada, over and
above any increases associated with other labor market

characteristics (such as experience) that both immigrants and
Canadian-born individuals enjoy. We would expect the estimate of
6 to be positive, reflecting the assimilation of immigrants into
the labor market as they generate credible information about
their skills (especially if immigrants are positively selected on
the basis of intelligence, ambition, spunk, and so on), as they
                                                                  9

secure appropriate job matches, build their language skills,
acquire other inforuation valued in Canada, set up their own

businesses, and so on.8

    The cohort effects, O, measure the average unobserved
quality of particular immigrant cohorts relative to the omitted

reference group of pre-1956 immigrants. For example, if the
quality of a given number of school years increased across
successive entry cohorts of immigrants, the corresponding
estimates of cohort effects would tend to be positive and

increase, irrespective of any cross-cohort changes in average

years of schooling.
     The cohort effects are of interest because they will capture
the impact of immigration policy changes such as a shift from a

skills-oriented points system to a refugee or family-
reunification system, which may influence the labor market
adaptability of new cohorts in a manner that is not captured by
changes in immigrants' observed labor market characteristics.




8. Note that the assimilation effect in our analysis is linear,
i.e., 6 is constant. Chiswick (1978) and several other authors
have included a quadratic term for the effect of YSM. We included
such a term in some specifications of our model (not shown here)
This did not affect the entry and cohort effects significantly.
However, for the more recent cohorts, parameter estimates for the
specification imply that wage catchup will never occur. Since
even the linear specification implies an extremely long catchup
period, we chose to report those results.
                                                                  10

DATA ISSUES: CROSS-SECTIONAL, LONGITUDINAL, AND QUASI-
LONGITUDINAL DATA


     The parameters of the empirical model in equation (1) cannot
all be estimated using a single cross-sectional data set. In

particular, the years since migration (YSM) variable is perfectly
collinear with the vector of cohort effects in a single cross-

section. For example, an immigrant in the 1986 census reporting
four years since migration would automatically have to be

included in the 1981-85 entry cohort. Early work in this area

using cross-sectional data estimated a version of equation (1)

that did not allow for cohort effects (see Chiswick 1978 and

Borjas 1982) .   However, Borjas (1985) points out that biased
estimates of assimilation effects may result from this
specification. That is, the coefficient of YSM in a single
cross-section is the result of both the earnings growth
associated with YSM for a given cohort (the within-cohort effect)

and the earnings growth that may be associated with different
cohorts of immigrants (the cross-cohort effect) .
     This   problem can be circumvented by the use of longitudinal
data for which YSM does not uniquely determine an immigrants'

entry cohort. For instance, an immigrant with YSM = 10 in 1970
would have arrived in 1960, while an immigrant with YSM = 10 in



9. The coefficient may also reflect non-random patterns of
immigrant outmigration and immigrant mortality (see Lam, 1987 and
Bloom and Gunderson, 1991).
                                                                11

1980 would have arrived in 1970. Unfortunately, to our knowledge
such longitudinal data are not available for Canada.

    As an alternative, following Borjas (1985) for the United
States and Bloom and Gunderson (1991) for Canada, we use cross-
sections pooled over the 1971, 1981, and 1986 census years as a
ITpseudo.longitudinaln data set. While the same individuals

cannot be identified across the three census years, different
individuals with the same number of years since immigration can
be identified as coming from different period of immigration
cohorts, that is, the YSM variable is not a linear combination of

the period of immigration cohort dummies. This data
configuration enables estimation of assimilation effects (within-
cohort earnings growth) as well as period of immigration cohort

effects (cross-cohort earnings growth).


EMPIRICAL RESULTS


     The empirical results are presented first for men (table 1)

and then for women (table 2)    Separate cross-sectional
regressions are reported for each census year. Pooled
regressions are also reported to control for possible cohort

10. The same regression specification is used for both men and
women. The usual caveats apply for women, especially in the
measurement of experience as noted earlier. Unfortunately, we
could not address this issue by including children ever born in
the equation because it was not reported the same way in all
three censuses. The 1971 and 1981 censuses report the number of
children ever born, while the 1986 census reports the number of
children by age group currently living in the family.
                                                                  12

effects. Appendix 1 defines the variables used in the analysis
and reports basic descriptive statistics for the variables.

Coefficient estimates for the human capital and other control
variables are shown in appendix 2 for men and appendix 3 for
women.   (The regressions control for weeks worked per year and
hours worked per week so that the results can be interpreted in

terms of effects on hourly wages.) Separate results by region of
origin (Europe and the United States compared to Asia, Africa,
and Latin America) are given in table 3 for men and in table 4

for women. For expositional purposes, only the pooled results
controlling for cohort effects are presented in tables 3 and 4)1

     Table 1 (for men) confirms the expected negative entry
effect and positive assimilation effect for each of the census
year cross-sections. For example, the 1971 census indicates that

immigrant men had, on average, a 5 percent earnings disadvantage
at the time of their arrival in Canada relative to comparable
Canadian-born men. However, their earnings grew by about one-
third of one percent faster per year, so that after fifteen

years, their earnings had caught up with the earnings of
Canadian-born men. The fact that their earnings subsequently
exceeded those of otherwise comparable Canadians is consistent
with the hypothesis that immigrants are a positively selected
group in terms of unobservable characteristics such as motivation

and ability.


11. Complete cross-sectional and pooled regressions by region of
origin are available from the authors upon request.
                                                                 13

    The negative entry and positive assimilation effects become
substantially larger (in absolute values) in the 1981 and 1986

censuses. For example, by 1986 the average immigrant had a 22
percent earnings disadvantage at the time of entry. Even though
the assimilation effect was also larger—almost 1 percent faster

earnings growth per year—it would take immigrants 26.5 years to
catch up with Canadian-born men.
    The pooled regressions indicate that with the exception of

the 1961-65 cohort, each successive cohort of male immigrants had
lower earnings at the time of entry, even after controlling for
the effect of human capital and other determinants of earnings.

This cross-cohort trend is quite pronounced for immigrants
arriving in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, immigrants
arriving between 1981 and 1986 (years marked by Canada's longest
and deepest recession since the 1930s) earned 34 percent less
than did comparable Canadian-born men (-30.3 percent cohort
effect plus -3.5 percent entry effect) •12 As the next-to-last
column in table 1 indicates, if the immigrants who arrived in the
1970s and 1980s assimilate into the Canadian labor market at the

same rate as the earlier cohorts of immigrants (that is, have the




12. Nakamura and Nakamura (1992) show that the labor market
position of immigrants is more sensitive to business-cycle
downturns than the position of comparable native-born
individuals, in both Canada and the United States.
                                                                 14

same rate of excess wage growth), they will never attain the

earnings of otherwise comparable Canadian-born men.13

     The persistence of this earnings decline throughout the

sustained prosperity of the l970s, however, suggests that the
lower earnings were not just caused by the economy's inability to
absorb the new immigrants in times of high unemployment. One

likely explanation is declining immigrant quality in terms of
unobserved characteristics valued in the labor market, reflecting

the policy shift away from the skills orientation and towards

family reunification and human rights. Discrimination is another

possible explanation, given that the composition of immigrants
was changing rapidly towards visible minorities from Asia,
Africa, and Latin America. Another possibility is that more
recent cohorts of immigrants show an even greater tendency to
cluster together in networks of families and ethnic

13. Note that the calculations for the implied years to equality
may be somewhat uncertain for the recent cohorts given that they
are based on only a few years of experience in Canada. Using a
standard approximation formula for the variance of the ratio of
two random variables (see Stuart and Ord, 1987, page 325) yields
an estimate of 45 years for the standard error of implied years
to equality for the 1981-1986 cohort. By contrast, the estimated
standard error is roughly 6 years for the cohorts that arrived
before 1970. The results for the recent cohorts are therefore not
well determined. The recent cohorts might also overtake
Canadian-born individuals faster than predicted because of a
higher assimilation effect. Our specification of a constant 6
does not allow that to happen. We tried other specifications
with interaction terms between the assimilation and cohort
effects. For some cohorts, the results (available from the
authors) showed a substantial reduction in years to equality.
However, the range of values of YSM for those cohorts was also
quite small, which makes any prediction of years to equality
unreliable. For that reason, our preferred specification
remained the one with a constant 6 estimated with the information
obtained from all the cohorts.
                                                                   15

neighborhoods, making them feel less pressured to learn a new

language and fit into the Canadian labor market.
     Once the separate cohort effects are controlled for, the
entry and assimilation effects are reduced relative to those of

the separate census regressions. Overall, male immigrants into
Canada have all entered at an earnings disadvantage and have
enjoyed wage catchup at a rate of 0.25 percent per year, so that

it takes them, on average, about twenty-seven years to catch up.
The overall picture, however, is dominated by the cohort effects,

which show a clear pattern of increasingly lower earnings at the
time of entry for more recent cohorts such that they can never

expect to assimilate fully in the sense of catching up with
comparable Canadian-born men. This finding confirms the
importance of accounting for cohort effects in the analysis of

immigrant labor market assimilation.
     The last column of table 1 presents the results of similar
calculations done for male immigrants into the United States
using the 1970, 1980, and 1990 U.S. censuses. (The full set of
results used to prepare these calculations are available on

request from the authors) .   These results also show a tendency
for years to equality to increase for the cohorts that arrived in

the mid-1960s and later. However, the estimates of years-to-
equality are smaller in magnitude for the United States than for
Canada, which suggests that recent immigrants to the U.S. are

assimilating faster than those entering Canada.
                                                                 16

    As table 2 shows, the picture for women is fairly similar to

that for men. The separate cross-sectional regressions for each
census year indicate a pattern of increasingly lower wages at
entry and more rapid assimilation, although the time needed to
catch up still exceeds twenty years in the 1981 and 1986
censuses.

     The pooled regressions for women indicate a pattern of lower

entry wages for successive cohorts of immigrants, but not until

the 1970s, and especially the 1980s. Cohorts that entered after

the l970s could never expect to assimilate fully in the sense of

catching up with comparable Canadian-born women. After
controlling for the cohort effects, the overall entry effect

indicates that immigrant women earn about 4 percent less than
comparable Canadian-born women. Their earnings growth is about

0.17 percent per year greater, but this is sufficiently small
that it will take them twenty-seven years (the same as for men)
to assimilate fully in the sense of catching up with the earnings
of comparable Canadian-born women. As with men, the average
twenty-seven years to equality masks large variations in the
assimilation prospects of different cohorts. The most
disconcerting finding is that recent cohorts of immigrant women,

as is the case with immigrant men, can never expect to become

fully assimilated.
     While the assimilation coefficients for women are all
positive, they are uniformly smaller than those for corresponding
                                                                17

samples of men.14 This finding suggests that migration
selectivity is stronger for men than for women, which is an
unsurprising result because women are more likely than men to be

tied movers (see Mincer 1978).
     Finally, the last column of table 2 reports years to
equality for female immigrants into the United States (the full

results are available from the authors). The findings are

interesting, although somewhat puzzling. Contrary to our
expectation, all the female immigrant cohorts have a positive
earnings gap at entry, so that the estimated number of years to

equality is a negative number. This finding, which clearly
deserves further exploration, suggests that female immigrants in
the U.S. do not suffer any economic disadvantage, contrary to
their Canadian counterparts and to men in both countries.


RESULTS BY REGION OF ORIGIN


     Table 3 reports results by region of origin for men. The
negative entry effects are much stronger for immigrants from
Asia, Africa, and Latin America than for immigrants from Europe
and the United States. Even though the assimilation effects are
also relatively large for immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin
America, they are insufficient to overcome the disproportionately


14. The difference between the assimilation coefficients for men
and women is statistically significant at the 10 percent level or
less for each of the three cross-sectional regressions, but not
for the pooled regression.
                                                                  18

larger negative entry effects. Thus, catchup does not occur for

forty-three years, compared to eleven years for European and U.S.
immigrants. For both regions of origin, the cohort effects
generally show declining assimilation for the more recent
generations of immigrants. Each cohort of immigrants from Asia,
Africa, and Latin America took longer to assimilate than the
corresponding cohort from Europe and the United States. Indeed,
the post-1970 cohorts could not be expected to assimilate over a

reasonable work life.

     Of considerable interest is the large negative cohort effect

for the most recent (post-1981) immigrants. Such a large
increase in the entry effect after 1981 could not reflect

increased discrimination, because it occurred for immigrants from
Europe and the United States as well as from Asia, Africa, and
Latin America, and it probably does not reflect the effects of

changes in immigration policy as few occurred during that period.
This leaves the labor market's inability to absorb new immigrants
during a prolonged recession as the most plausible explanation.

     As indicated in table 4, the results for women by region of
origin are qualitatively similar to those for men, with one
exception: female immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America
assimilate faster (in nineteen years) than their counterparts
from Europe and the United States (twenty-four years) .   Note,
however, that these estimates are somewhat imprecise because of
the relatively small sample sizes for the separate cohorts.
                                                                    19

COMPARISON WITH OTHER STUDIES


     The results described above are generally consistent with
those of previous studies based on independent data sets.
(DeSilva 1992 reviews the methodology, data, and results of many
of these and other related studies) .   For example, based on the
1973 Job Mobility Survey, Abbott and Beach (1993) and Meng (1987)
found that men caught up at thirteen and fourteen years,

respectively, which is comparable to our estimate of fifteen
years from the 1971 census. Based on the same survey, Beach and
Worswick (1993) found the assimilation effect to be much smaller
for women than for men, but the wage disadvantage at the time of
entry was also smaller (in fact a premium) for women than for
men. For the closest comparable year of our data—the 1971
census—we also find smaller assimilation effects for women than

for men, although we find a statistically insignificant entry
effect for immigrant women. Comparisons among more recent
cohorts of immigrants are not possible because the Job Mobility

Survey is for 1973.

     Similarly, our results are generally consistent with those
based on census data. Using 1971 data, Tandon (1978) found that
immigrant men in Toronto catch up after sixteen years, which is
comparable to our estimate of fifteen years for immigrants across
Canada when our analysis is restricted to the 1971 census. Using
the 1981 census, Chiswick and Miller (1988) found that men caught
up after 22.0 years, which is similar to our estimate of 23.9
                                                                20

years when restricted to the 1981 census. Based on both the 1971

and 1981 censuses, Borjas (1988) documented the worsening
position of immigrants over time, especially as the composition
of immigrants changed towards groups that have more difficulty in

adjusting to life in Canada. Finally, Baker and Benjamin (1992),
wright and Maxim (1991), and other studies that included the 1986

census also tended to find a worsening position of immigrants

over time.



CONCLUS IONS



     Our analysis suggests that the Canadian labor market has not

been easily able to assimilate more recent cohorts of immigrants
given the changing nature of such immigration. Prior to 1965,
complete assimilation within fifteen years was the norm for both

men and women and for immigrants originating from different
regions. Thereafter, assimilation took longer and longer, with
complete assimilation appearing completely out of reach for post-
1970 immigrants. Assimilation has been particularly slow for

immigrant men from Asia, Africa, and Latin America compared to
those from Europe and the United States. For all regions of
origin, however, assimilation has been slower or nonexistent for

more recent cohorts.
     Our results suggest that three major factors have
contributed to the decline in immigrant assimilation, namely:
                                                                  21

    1.    Reduced immigrant quality because of changing

immigration policies;
    2.    Increased discrimination as the composition of

immigrants changed towards more visible minorities; and
     3.   Reduced absorptive capacity of the labor market,

especially for less skilled groups, possibly reflecting the
effect of prolonged recession.
     The decline in assimilation began in the mid-1960s, just

after changes in immigration policy de-emphasized skills and
emphasized family reunification and human rights and humanitarian
issues. These changes led to a decline in the share of
immigrants in the skills-oriented independent category and to an
increase in the family category. They also led to a shift in the

composition of immigration from industrial to developing
countries. These changes may have led to a decline in immigrant
quality in terms of attributes that facilitate assimilation into
the labor market. They may also have led to increased
discrimination because immigrants from developing countries are

more likely to be visible minorities.
     Increased discrimination cannot be the full explanation,

however, because the decline in assimilation occurred for
immigrants from Europe and the United States as well as for

visible minorities from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
(DeSilva 1992 provides evidence from the 1981 census indicating

that there is little discrimination against immigrants purely on
the basis of color) .   Neither   can quality changes (emanating from
                                                                 22

immigration policy) provide a full explanation, because
assimilation deteriorated markedly in the early 19805, and yet

immigration policy did not change significantly at that time.
    The large deterioration in assimilation that occurred for
the 1981-86 cohort suggests that the recession of the early 1980s

had a pronounced negative effect on the labor market position of
that cohort, but whether this is a lasting effect we do not know.
Recession, however, also cannot be the full explanation given the

continuous decline in assimilation prior to the 1980s.
     Further research is clearly needed to quantify the relative

importance of the various factors contributing to the declining
assimilation of immigrants. At this stage, it appears that the

three factors considered here -   immigration   policy,

discrimination, and macroeconomic forces - have all contributed

to declines in the relative economic position of Canadian

immigrants.

(a)      Calculated from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 U.S. censuses. The model specification is the
         same as for Canada, with the following exceptions: a dummy for black is included; the
         reference catagory is immigrant, who arrived before 1960; one year must be subtracted
         from all the cohort definitions (e.g., the 1961-65 Canadian cohort corresponds to the
         1960-64 U.S. cohort). The U.S. data also allow us to calculate years to equality for
         the more recent 1985-89 cohort of immigrants. The result is 61.4 years.
(b)      Average years to equality, calculated as a weighted average for the different cohorts,
         with cohort sample sizes used as weight..
