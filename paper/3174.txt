  PRICES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION:  WAS THE DEFLATION OF 1930-32 REALLY
                               UNANTICIPATED?


                                            ABSTRACT
   Several   explanations for the depth of the Great Depression presume that the —30% de-
flation of 1930—32 was unanticipated. For example, the debt-deflation hypothesis originally
put forth by Irving Fisher is based on the notion that unanticipated deflation increases the
burden of nominal debt, adversely affecting the banking system and the aggregate economy.
Other theories imply on ex ante real interest rates being low during the period, and so it is
essential that the deflation was unanticipated.
   This paper measures inflationary expectations from data on prices, interest rates and
money growth in order to investigate whether the deflation could have been anticipated.
Current econometric techniques are used to compute expectations implied both by the
univariate time series properties of the price level, and by the information contained in
nominal interest rates. The major conclusion is that price changes were substantially serially
correlated, and so once the deflation began, people expected it to continue. This implies
both that the deflation was anticipated, and that real interest rates were very high during
the initial phases of the Great Depression. These results call into question the validity of
theories that rely on contemporary agents' belief in reflation during the early 1930s, and
provide further support for the proposition that monetary contraction was the driving force
behind the economic decline.

1    Introduction
    In 1933, Irving Fisher (1933) published a paper entitled 'The Debt-Deflation Theory
of the Great Depression.' He hypothesized that the nearly 25% cumulative deflation of
1930—32 was primarily responsible for the depth of the Depression. The argument proceeds
as follows. Since unanticipated deflation increases the burden of nominal debt, it caused
debtors to default on loans. This, in turn, led to bank failures and the collapse of the
financial system.
    Recently, Bernanke and Gertler (1987 and 1989) have formalized one aspect of the debt-
deflation hypothesis. They examine a model in which a debt-deflation lowers borrower net
worth, thereby increasing leverage and the desire of entrepreneurs to take on risk, and raising
the probability of bankruptcy. This lowers the of level investment, causing a reduction in
both aggregate supply and aggregate demand.
    The debt-deflation theory requires both that there be substantial nominal debt out-
standing, and that the deflation of 1930—32 be unanticipated. This paper investigates the
second of these by examining whether the deflation of early 1930s, when prices fell at an
average of -6.7% per year for three years, might have been anticipated. Data on both prices
and interest rates provide empirical support for the proposition that the deflation could
have been anticipated at horizons of three to six months. This calls into question theories
of the Depression that rely on contemporary agents' belief in reflation prior to 1933.
   A number of pieces of evidence suggest this conclusion. First, deflation was within the
recent experience of the people living in 1929. In fact, in the fifty or so years between the
Civil War and the Great Depression, there were four episodes in which the price level fell
for two consecutive years or more. Second, inflation was very persistent during the inter-
War years. This suggests that simple rules of thumb would have led to the expectation of
continued deflation during the period. Finally, the information contained in interest rate
data can be used to extract estimates of both ex ante real interest rates and expected
inflation. While nominal interest rates were low, the data suggest that beginning as early
as 1927 and going through early 1933, real interest rates were very high. This leads to
the conclusion that individuals of the time period perceived that prices were falling, and
expected the deflation to continue.
    While the primary purpose of this paper is to present evidence consistent with the notion
that the deflation of the 1930s could have been anticipated, the empirical results can also be

                                               1
used to address other outstanding issues as well. In the process of generating estimates of
anticipated price changes, I am able to produce estimates of the real rate of interest during
the period from 1919 to 1940. These estimates show that real interest rates were high
throughout the period from 1929 trough 1932. This provides further support for the position
of Friedman and Schwartz (1963) in their debate with Temin (1976). As Schwartz (1980)
points out, a high real interest rate is one of the key features that distinguishes the monetary
hypothesis from theories based on exogenous declines in real consumption or investment.
    The approach of this paper is to use contemporary econometric tools to examine data on
prices, interest rates and money in order to measure implied expectations. Three separate
types of evidence are brought to bear on the question. First, Section 2 describes the history
of past deflations. This is followed by a study of the univariate time series properties of
the price level in Section 3. Included are unit root tests, identification and estimation of
ARMA models, and a discussion of the properties of the forecasts implied by the estimated
models. Section 4 describes a method for estimating expected inflation from interest rate
data. In all cases, the conclusion is that the deflation was anticipated at horizons of three
to six months.
    These results challenge those of previous work, particularly that of Hamilton (1987)
who measures inflationary expectations from data on commodity futures prices. Section 5
contrasts the methods used here with those used by Hamilton to assess the relative validity
of the different techniques. The final section contains concluding remarks and suggests
directions for future research.


2    The History of Previous Deflations
    While a sustained, broad decline in nominal prices would take virtually everyone by
surprise if it happened today, this was not true in 1930. Deflation was clearly within the
experience of contemporary economic agents. This point is made clear by Table 1, where
information is presented on the deflations of the late 19th and early 20th century. Data
sources are described in the appendix.
    Between the Civil War and the Great Depression, there were four periods of sustained
deflation, when consumer prices fell for two consecutive years or more. The 1920—22 de-
flation following World War I was clearly the most severe. In fact, the cumulative price

decline during these two years was roughly the same as the decline during the early 1930s.
      Given this history of deflations, people must have been aware of the possibility of price
declines and had experience coping with them. In light of that experience, the subjective
probability assigned to the occurrence of such an event could have been fairly high. It is
unreasonable to presume that the 1930—32 deflation caught people completely off guard.


3      The Time Series Properties of the Price Level
3.1      Overview
      The first step in examining the data on inflation is to study the univariate properties of
the consumer prices. The major purpose of this section is to examine ARMA forecasts of
inflation for the 1930—32 period. The conclusion is that there was substantial persistence in
the inflation in the 1920's, and so it is reasonable to believe that once it started, deflation
was anticipated to continue.
      It is useful to begin with a simple plot of the data on level of consumer prices, monthly
from 1913 to 1940.1 Figure 1 plots the natural logarithm of the index. The figure includes

    1As described in the appendix, the data on consumer prices is mainly the cost of living index (CLI)

vertical lines drawn at the beginning of 1919 and the beginning of 1929, the period which
will be examined more closely below. The data clearly show a pattern that is inconsistent
with a stationary time series. The plot shows that prices did not revert to any sort of
absolute level or deterministic trend. Instead, the pattern is that of a nonstationary series.2
   The remainder of this section begins with a series of preliminary steps and then reports
the results of a univariate ARMA forecasting exercise. Section 3.2 establishes the plausibility
of assuming that the log of the price level is a first order integrated process, implying that
inflation is a stationary series. This is done by examining both empirical evidence based on
the data plotted in Figure 1, and theoretical arguments in favor of the unit root hypothesis.
   The following section presents the results of a simple exercise to determine the univariate
ARMA process for inflation. Using quarterly data from 1919 to 1928 only, inflation is
modeled by an MA(2). When data through 1940 is added to the sample period, the resulting
identification is that inflation follows an AR( 1). Both of these processes imply persistence.
      Finally, results on univariate forecasts of inflation are presented using both MA(2) and
the AR(1) model, along with the forecasts implied by the models. The forecasts clearly
suggest that the deflation of 1930—32 was anticipated.


3.2      Unit Roots: Theoretical Arguments and Empirical Tests
      The first step in estimating ARMA models is to examine whether the price level contains
a unit root. There are both theoretical and empirical reasons for believing that the price
level is nonstationary. It is well recognized that in the presence of a paper money standard,
inflation is tied to the level of money growth, which is normally presumed to be an exogenous
policy variable. The conclusion is that the price level is nonstationary. In fact, the data
on the post-WWII period suggest that it is the second difference of the price level that is
stationary with the current institutional arrangement.3
    It is less clear what the time series properties of the price level should be in the presence
of a gold or commodity money standard. But the same reasoning that leads one to suspect

constructed from monthly surveys by the National Industrial Conference Board. These data are based on
contemporaneous monthly surveys and were made available through publications of the period. Prior to
1919, the consumer price data is drawn from the current Bureau of Labor Statistic Consumer Price Index
series (Cl'!). The CLI series is preferred to the CPI, since the later appears to have been constructed by
interpolating data at a frequency of approximately six months.
    2The wholesale price series, which is also used in the following analysis, has the same broad profile.
    'Barsky (1987) identifies inflation as an IMA(1,1) using quarterly data from 1960 to 1979.


                                                    5
that the price level is nonstationary when there is fiat money, holds when a gold standard
is operating. In fact, the price level would be stationary only by chance.
    The argument follows directly from the equation of exchange, which can be manipulated
to yield
                               ilogP = dogMj + logV — AlogY                    .                            (1)

where M is the stock of money, V is velocity, P is the price level, and Y is real output.
Under a gold standard, the money stock M is a roughly constant multiple of the size of the
monetary gold stock.4 Equation (1) implies that velocity, money, output and the price level
will be cointegrated. This means that logPj will be stationary only if the three variables on
the right hand side are either all stationary, or are cointegrated with cointegrating vector
equal to (1,1,—i). Put another way, the simple quantity theory implies that, unless the
rate of growth of the gold stock happens to match the rate of growth of real output, or
velocity happens to be growing to exactly offset the difference between the base money and
output growth rates, the price level will contain a unit root. Using a similar argument,
Bordo and Ellson (1985) demonstrate that as a result of resource constraints and in the
presence of depletion, one should actually expect long-run deflation under a classical gold
standard.5
    The natural next step is to see whether the unit root hypothesis is confirmed by statisti-
cal tests. Dickey and Fuller (1981) have proposed a test based on examining the coefficient
on the lagged price level in the regression given by

                                                          k
                                  itpt=a+bpi_i>citpt_i+v                   ,                               (2)


where p is the log of the price level, p is the first difference in the log of the price (inflation),
v is a random error, and the remaining terms are parameters. The null hypothesis is that
the log of the price level (pg) has a unit root, namely that 6 =                   0.   The test requires the

    4As described in equation (1) of Bordo and Ellson (1985), the stock of money is equal to the product
of the value of monetary gold stock, the fixed nominal price of gold, and a multiplier relating the sum of
currency and deposits to the value of the monetary gold stock.
    5Bordo and Elison's conclusion suggests that deflation should have been the long run tendency throughout
the 1920a. This means that each year that passes without deflation should increase the probability of deflation
in the near-term future. Since prices actually rose from 1919 to 1928, Bordo and Elleon's reasoning suggests
that by 1929 agents should have assigned a significant probability to price level declines.

   6While the Dickey-Fuller test has enjoyed widespread use, Schwert (1988) has shown that it has substantial
size distortion and low power when the true model contains an autoregressive component along with the

be roughly the cube root of the sample size — the suggestion made by Said and Dickey (1985).

root comes from the quarterly WPI. Otherwise, all of the values of the test statistic are well
below the 10% critical value. Using the shorter sample, from 1919 to 1928, the picture is
slightly different. For the monthly WPI, the tests all fail to reject the unit root null. But
for consumer prices, and for the quarterly WPI, this is no longer the case. For monthly
consumer price data, the unit root null is rejected at the 10% level when k equals 4 or 5.
For the quarterly consumer data, the unit root null is rejected at the 10% level when k
equals 1, 2, or 4 and at the 5% level when k equals 5. Finally, for quarterly WPI data, the
unit root is rejected at the 10% level when k equals 4 and at the 5% level when k equals 5.
    While the results from the Dickey-Fuller tests are somewhat inconclusive, the majority
of the evidence fails to reject the existence of a unit root in the price level. Together with
the theoretical arguments, this strongly suggests studying the implications of assuming
that inflation is the stationary series. The following section, proceeds by examining ARMA
models of inflation.8

3.3 ARMA Models: Identification, Estimation and Forecasting
  The next natural step is to identify the appropriate ARMA model for inflation. As
Campbell and Mankiw (1987) describe, there is a difficulty in estimating the parameters of
ARMA processes with moving average roots close to unity. Following their recommendation,
a set of ARMA models has been estimated using the Kalman filtering algorithm described
in Harvey (1981). All of these models are of the form

                                           A(L)irt = B(L)e      ,                                        (3)


where, x is inflation, A(L) and B(L) are lag polynomials of order p and q respectively, and
  is a Gaussian white noise error term.

    Table 3 reports values of the likelihood function for ARMA(p,q) models up to order (2,2)
using quarterly consumer price data over sample periods beginning in 1919 and ending either

quarter.
     1t is important to note that differencing the data in no way biases the conclusions about persistence
of inflation or deflation. As Campbell and Mankiw (1987) discuss in detail, modeling the first difference of
a time series as a stationary ARMA process leaves open the question of whether the level is a stationary
process. This j not to say that the results would be the same if the ARMA models where estimated in
levels. The assumption that the log of the price level is an AR(2), for example, would imply that the price
level is reverting to some mean level. This has the rather dramatic implication that the more unanticipated
deflation there is, the more inflation is expected.

for model selection.9
    Two models stand out. For the sample ending in 1928, the MA(2) model is not rejected
by any other more general model at the 5% level using a likelihood ratio test. Furthermore,
the MA(2) is chosen by the Schwarz criterion. While the Akaike criterion suggests that
the ARMA(2,2) is superior to the MA(2), it is by an extremely small margin. The AR(1)
model is clearly dominant when the long sample is used.'° Both the Akaike and the Schwarz
criteria select it as the best by fairly wide margins.
    The MA(2) model estimated over the 1919 to 1928 period is (inflation is measured in
percent per quarter at an annual rate):

                      =     0.262       +   Et   +   0.586             +     0.708    Et...2

                                     Mean of ir = 0.263         = .443
                            Standard Error of the Regression =             8.195

and the AR(1) model estimated over the 1919 to 1940 period is:

                                    =   —0.288 +       0.522    Tg._   +
                                                                                                      (5)

                           Standard Error of the Regression =          8.025

    Both of these models imply persistence in price changes at horizons of two quarters. Once
a deflation begins, it is expected to continue for at least several quarters. The MA(2) model
suggests that if a deflation were to begin unexpectedly, as it must be since the constant in
(4) is positive, it would then be predicted to continue for two quarters at between one-half
and three-quarters the initial rate. The AR(1) estimates imply that beginning with a ten

   5A3ke suggests minimizing —2InL + 2(p + q), while the Schwarz criteria is to select the model that
minimizes —2lnL + (p + q)lnT, where T is the sample size.
  20Using quarterly data on inflation measured using the official BLS CPI from 1919 to 1938, Barsky (1987)
concludes that inflation was an AR(2) with coefficients of 0.42 and 0.17.

                                                     10
percent annual rate deflation, prices would still be forecast to fall by 1% (at an annual
rate) one year later. The conclusion is that inflation during the entire inter-War period
was substantially serially correlated and that once a deflation started, it should have been
expected to continue.
    It is possible to use the ARMA estimates in (4) and (5) to generate forecasts of inflation.1'
Forecasts were computed in three ways. In the first, the model was estimated using data
through 1928 and then one quarter ahead forecasts were computed using all the information
up to the date prior to the date of the forecast. In this procedure, the parameters of the
ARMA process were fixed. This is pure out-of-sample forecasting.
    In the second case, an expanding sample was used to reestimate an ARMA model using
all the data up to the date prior to the date of the forecast. Then the reestimated model
was used to calculate the forecast.
    Finally, within sample forecasts were computed. Here the model was estimated using
data through 1940 and then forecasting was done using these parameter estimates.
    Figures 2 and 3 report the results of this exercise for each of the models, along with
the actual values of inflation. (The vertical lines in the figure mark dates associated with
specific events such as the stock market crash and various bank panics. These are described
in more detail in Table 4.) For both figures, the dashed line represents actual inflation, the
full within sample forecast are indicated by squares (0), the out of sample forecasts based
on data through 1928 are marked by triangles (s), and the out of sample forecasts based
on an expanding sample are shown by stars (*). Perhaps surprisingly, the three methods
yield very similar forecasts.
   As is to be expected, the AR(1) model generates smoother forecasts, and forecasts
deflation more consistently. The MA(2) model shows larger, more erratic jumps. But in
both cases there is a clear tendency to forecast deflation. While the forecasts imply that
there was still some unanticipated deflation, the univariate models come quite a bit closer
to the actual values than one might have thought.

  "The forecasts are computed using the difference equation described in Chapter 5 of Box and Jenk-
ins (1976) using 100 backca.sted residuals. The TSP procedure BJFRCST was used with the default settings.

4    Measuring Expected Inflation from Interest Rates
    In addition to studying the expectations implied by the univariate inflation process, it
is also possible to obtain measures of anticipated price changes from data on interest rates.
This section employs a procedure first suggested by Mishkin (1981) for dividing information
in the nominal interest rate into the component that represents the ex ante real interest
rate and the component that represents expected inflation.
    Mishkin's technique has several advantages over the univariate procedure of Section 3.
First, it allows the use of additional information. Estimates of expected inflation are based
not only on the behavior of the price level, but also on movements in interest rates and
other macroeconomic variables such as money growth. Furthermore, estimates of expected
inflation (or deflation) that are constructed from interest rate data are not sensitive to
assumptions about whether or not the price level is stationary. All that is required is the
extremely plausible assumption that the real interest rate is stationary. Given the difficulty
inherent in testing for a unit root in the price level, this technique provides results that are
complementary to those reported in Section 3.
    To understand how Mishkin's procedure works, for a j period bond held from t to I + j,
define  r to be the expectation at time I of the j period real return on a nominally riskiess
bond, and i to be the j period nominal return at I. If        is expected inflation from t to
I + j, then by the Fisher identity the ex ante real rate of interest on a j period bond held
to maturity is defined by
                                              =        —                                        (6)

While rj   is   unobservable, the ex posi or realized real return is not. Define eprrt,j and 1rj
as the realized real return and the realized inflation from t to I + j respectively. Then

                                        eprrt,,j = i,j —                                        (7)


Combining (6) and (7) it is clear that eprrt,J —        rj, the difference between the ex ante and
ex post real interest rate, is unanticipated inflation, (t,j —      Rational expectations
implies that unanticipated inflation is always expected to be zero. So if fl is information
available at time t, then E(r       —   r7)IQt) =      0.   The econometrician, being less informed
than agents in the economy, observes only a subset of fl. Using this reduced information
set, X, an estimate of the ex ante real rate of interest can be obtained by projecting r

                                                  14
on X, P(rt,IX) = X8. This will entail a projection error u1 that is orthogonal to X1.
Making appropriate substitutions yields the regression equation

                                  eprrt,, = X113 + ut,3 + (7rt,3     —                                       (8)


Since unanticipated inflation and the projection error for the real rate are both orthogonal
to the components of the information set X, equation (8) is a standard linear regression
that can be estimated using ordinary least squares.12 It is clear from the above discussion
that the fitted values from this regression, X1/3,          are   estimates of the er ante real rate.13
    Applying Mishkin's technique to Mankiw and Miron's (1985) data on three and six
month time loans at New York banks, I have constructed estimates of the real interest rate
for the inter-war period. The results for both maturities are virtually identical, only the
three month estimates are reported below.
    Choice of the variables included in the information set X was dictated by several con-
siderations discussed at length in Mishkin's work. First, the nominal interest rate was
included. Then five additional variables were considered. These were the level of inflation
(jr), the monetary base (MB), two measures of the stock of money (Ml and M2) and the
new industrial production series recently constructed by Miron and Romer (1989).14 For
each of these five variable, I began by constructing 12 month log differences. For a variable
x, define z.xt = log          Then, for a given variable (x1_1,z1_13,x1_25) were all
added to the regression (8). That is, the information set was assumed to contain the most
recently available value of the growth rate in x over the previous year, as well as the growth
rate lagged one and two years. After estimating the projection equation including these
variables, a Wald test was performed in which the null hypothesis was that the three coeffi-
cients on the new variable were jointly different from zero. if null was rejected, the variable

  '2Equation (8) can be thought of as a simplified linear form of the expression for the interest rate that would
arise in the model developed by Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) and applied by Brown and Dybvig (1986).
In their scheme, the bond yield is a linear function of the state variables, or factors. The weights on the
factors depend on the parameters of the vector stochastic process that describes the state. If we assume
that this process is stable, so that the weights are time invariant, and that X is a set of variables describing
the state at time t, then the 's are the weights. Since the purpose here is to recover the real interest rate
without explicitly specifying the set of factors and their stochastic process, it is unnecessary to do more than
examine the simple projection equation (8).
  '3As is discussed in the work by Huizinga and Mishkin (1986), when the holding period jis larger than
one, and overlapping data are used, the error in this regression will be a moving average of order j. This
implies that a robust procedure must be used to estimate the standard error of consistently.

a monthly frequency, but for three month yields, the error term in (8) is a second order
moving average. This means that a robust covariance matrix estimator must be used.15
Variables were examined in the following order: inflation, industrial production, M2, MB,
and Mi.'6 The resulting tests yielded the specification which included inflation, M2 and
the monetary base.'7
    Figure 4 plots the estimates of rg,3, the one quarter ahead ex ante real interest rate from
1919 to 1940 along with five percent confidence intervals. The vertical lines on this and
all subsequent figures represent events related to the Friedman and Schwartz chronology in
Table 4.

   The most striking feature of Figure 4 is the height of the real interest rate estimates
throughout the latter half of the 1920s and the early 1930s. While it moves substantially,
it is consistently between 5 and 10 percent. These high real rates persist until the bank

  15The estimates here employ the simple moment estimator suggested by Hansen and Hodrick (1980),
unless it is not po6itive definite in which case the Newey and West (1987) estimator is used.
  '6The actual statistical properties of such a sequential testing procedure are not known. The order in
which the vanables were tesi does make a small difference. For example, if M2 is entered before inflation,
inflation wilj not have much added explanatory power. Fortunately, the results for the estimated levels of
the real interest rate and expected inflation are robust to these changes.
  '71n the presence of overlapping data, an additional check on the specification is to see if the residual
autocorrelations beyond two are equal to zero. Cumby and Huizinga (1989) have recently developed a
test for this hypothesis. The value of their test statistic testing the null that the third through eighth
autocorrelations in the residual in the regression (8) are zero is 7.79. This statistic is distributed as Chi-
squared with six degrees of freedom under the null. The 10% critical value for a X2(6) is 10.65, implying
that the model meets the desired criterion.

holiday in 1933 (the vertical line labeled 7), when the estimates show a sharp drop to fairly
sizable negative levels. Given that nominal interest rates declined steadily from October
1929 to February 1933, with only a brief rise in late 1931 and early 1932, this implies that
deflation was actually anticipated during 1930 and 1931.
   Figure 5 plots expected inflation implied by the real interest rate estimates in Figure 4.
Once again, 5% confidence intervals are included. Beyond supplying clear support for
the proposition that the 1930—32 deflation was anticipated, these are relevant to two on
going debates about the nature of the Depression. The first pertains to the Lucas and
Rapping (1969) claim that unanticipated deflation led to intertemporal substitution, which
then explains the low level of employment during the 1930s. Clearly these estimates do not
support their position.
   The primary debate over the causes of the Great Depression is Friedman and Schwartz
vs. Temin (1976). The most recent version of this is the appears in Brunner (1981). As
Schwartz (1981) points out, the monetary hypothesis requires that real interest rates be
high from 1930 through 1932. This is clearly supported by the results presented Figure 4,
where real interest rates on three month time loans exceed 5% throughout the period, and
reached a peak in excess of 20% in early 1932. Finally, the fact that real interest rates were
high beginning in 1927 confirms Hamilton's (1987) conclusion that tight monetary policy
initiated the Depression.
    It is useful to compare the results from the univariate models of Section 3, the MA(2)
and AR(1), with those obtained from the interest rate data. Table 5 presents the estimates
of expected inflation using six different procedures. For each of the three models, the table
contains two estimates of expected inflation. The first are the full within sample forecasts,
and the second are the expanding out of sample forecasts. All the estimates are for three
month periods, measured at annual rates. In addition, the table reports the actual, ex     post

level of inflation.
   The expanding sample estimates all have an advantage over the within sample fitted
values. Any procedure that relies on least squares, including the Mishkin technique and
simple estimates of autoregressive models, has major shortcomings that might lead one to be
skeptical of the results based on full sample estimation. In particular, the fitted values from
any OLS regression tend to follow the raw data rather closely — estimates of cx ante values
will look very much like ex post realizations. This makes inferences about expectations from

within sample fitted values suspect.'8
   Out of sample forecasting is a natural way to address this concern. The expanding
sample estimates compute forecasts using data that was available at the time the forecast
needed to be made. To understand the procedure, take a simple example. In every case,
the estimate for the first quarter of 1930 was obtained by estimating the model through the
end of 1929 and then forecasting the beginning of 1930. The forecasts use only information
through the end of 1929.
    The important feature of Table 5 is that all the estimates show the same basic properties.
By the end of 1929 deflation was anticipated, although expectations were that it would be a
fairly moderate —2 to —3 percent. But things got progressively worse, and expectations of
deflation clearly persisted. For the first three quarters of 1931, these methods all generated
expectations of deflation that exceed —5%. Furthermore, this conclusion that the deflation
was anticipated is robust to changes in the estimation procedure.
    All of the evidence presented above suggests that the deflation of 1930—32 was antici-
pated, at horizons of three to six months. The historical record suggests that deflation was
within the experience of contemporary agents, while statistical analysis of data on infla-
tion and interest rates shows that the deflation was readily forecastable. The substantial
persistence in the inflation process is the driving force behind these results.


5     Comparison with Previous Work
    The results using both univariate prices and interest rates differ dramatically from those
reported by Hamilton (1987) and by Dominguez, Fair and Shapiro (1988). Both of these
papers conclude that the deflation was unanticipated. It is worth commenting on the reasons
for these differences.
    Using data from commodity futures markets, Hamilton (1987) concludes that the defla-
tion of 1930—32 was unanticipated. Hamilton measures expectations of future inflation by
looking at the difference between the current spot price and the futures price, six months
ahead, for a number of storeable commodities including cotton, wheat, corn and oats.
    There are at least three reasons to be skeptical of his results. First, when considering

   In essence, the agents in the economy have to know the true model before the data have been produced
for an econometrician to estimate it. During a period like the 1930s this seems like a rather large leap of
faith.


                                                   21
commodity futures markets it is important to keep in mind the existence of physical stocks.
These stocks are assets whose risk adjusted nominal return must equal that of other assets.
A bond is in this set of alternatives and since, except for in exceptional circumstances
described in Cecchetti (1988), the nominal interest rate can never be negative, the price
of the stored commodity can never be expected to fall.'9 Second, it appears from work
by Mishkin (1987) that anticipated changes in commodity prices, as represented by futures
contract prices, are a poor measure of expectations of aggregate price movements. Instead,
the information contained in the futures represent anticipated relative price movements.20
    The final reason to doubt Hamilton's conclusions comes from examining the nature
of government intervention in the futures markets during the early 1930s. Peck (1976) de-
scribes how from 1929 to 1933 the Federal Farm Board in an attempt to stabilize agricultural
commodities prices, traded futures contracts. While its goal was the stabilization of the
all agricultural commodity prices, the focus of the Farm Board's activity was on the wheat
and cotton markets. Peck documents that during 1930 and 1931, the Farm Board, through
the Grain Stabilization Corporation, held large open positions in the wheat futures market.
During late 1930 and early 1931, the Farm Board's positions often comprised over half of
the open interest in wheat futures in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis markets.
In fact, in Minneapolis, the Farm Board owned 93% of the open interest in wheat futures
during March 1931. Furthermore, by the end of the 1930—31 crop year, the government
owned outright more than 250 million bushels of wheat, or nearly three quarters of the 344
million bushels produced during that year.
    Peck's study focuses on wheat futures held by the Federal Farm Board through the Grain
Stabilization Corporation, but she notes that other federal agencies were participating in
futures markets at the same time. The clear goal of government policy was to keep the
prices of agricultural commodities from falling and one of the main methods for doing so
was to participate in the futures market. Given the nature and magnitude of government
intervention in the commodity futures markets between 1929 and 1933, it is difficult to see

  '9There are several caveats to this simple argument. In the presence of a convenience yield, the commodity
price can fall at that rate. Furthermore, the price can be expected to drop at the harvest date, at which
point the stock of the previous year will be nearly exhausted.
   20Mishkin examines Hamilton's procedure by comparing it to his own method of extracting estimates
of expected inflation from cx post real interest rates. (See Section 4 below.) He concludes that 99% of
the movement in the own commodity real rates computed from futures market data is a consequence of
anticipated relative price movements, while only 1% is the result of movements in the aggregate real interest
rate.


                                                     22
how prices in these markets can be used to infer the beliefs of private agents in the economy
at the time.
     By contrast, Dominguez, Fair and Shapiro (1988) examine the joint time series process
of prices and industrial production, interest rates, stock prices and the money stock, in
addition to indices constructed by Irving Fisher and by the Harvard Economic Service.
Using a vector autoregression that includes the price level they conclude that deflation was
unanticipated. The critical difference between their results and those reported here that
they presume the price level to be stationary, while I do not. If the price level is stationary
and follows an AR process, then unanticipated deflation will ultimately lead to anticipated
inflation. This means that the prolonged deflation of 1930—32 would have been more and
more unanticipated. All of the results in Sections 3 and 4 suggest that this is implausible.


6     Conclusion
   The purpose of this paper has been to show that the deflation of 1930—32 could have
been anticipated. Simple models of price expectations, based on either univariate time
series models or on the information contained in interest rates, suggest that the persistence
in the inflation process would have led agents to believe that the deflation would continue
once it began. This result suggests simple debt-deflation theories for the propagation of
the Depression must rely on the failure of agents to anticipate deflation several years in
advance, not several quarters in advance. To show that debt-deflation was an important
part of the contraction of the early 1930s it is important to document the accumulation of
substantial medium and long term debt prior to 1929.21
    While answering one question, these conclusions naturally lead to a new question. If
the debt-deflation hypothesis is suspect, then how can we explain the severe contraction of
1930—32? It seems likely that the deflation was an important characteristic of this period.
The observation that the deflation of 1930—32 could have anticipated suggests a new in-
terpretation of the Great Depression that concentrates on the consequences of anticipated
deflation. Future research will examine the implications of a deflation that is so severe
that it causes the nominal interest rate to hit its zero constraint. This has two immediate

   21The results in Bordo and ElIson (1985) suggest a radical interpretation. They infer that depletion of
the gold stock should have led to deflation beginning anticipated throughout the 1920s. If they are correct,
it would be even more difficult to make sense of the debt-deflation story.


                                                    23
implications. First, it drives up the real return on money and will lead to negative net
investment. Second, when the zero nominal interest rate constraint binds, the opportunity
cost of money to becomes negative, leading to a change in the nature of currency. The
natural response is a flight to quality, in this case cash or other government liabilities, that
puts the banking system at risk.

Data Appendix
This appendix describes the data used in the paper.

Consumer Prices:
The monthly consumer price series was constructed by splicing together two series. From
January 1913 to December 1919 the raw data is the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. From January 1920 to December 1940 the raw data
are the National Industrial Conference Board all items consumers' price index published in
Sayre (1948) Table 1. It does not appear that the BLS collected and published at monthly
series on the prices of consumer goods during the 1920's and 1930's. The all items CPI data
that are currently available for this period seem to have been created from data sampled at a
lower frequency and then interpolated using some component series. The quarter consumer
price series is then constructed by taking the last observation of each quarter of the monthly
series.
  The annual consumer price series is constructed by splicing the annual Federal Reserve
Bank of New York 'Estimated Cost of Living' index to the BLS CPI.

Wholesale Prices:
Data on wholesale prices were constructed by splicing data from Warren and Pearson (1935)
Table 1 to the all commodities wholesale price index published by the BLS beginning in
January of 1913.

GNP Deflator:
Prior to 1929, data were taken from Romer (1988). Beginning in 1929, the data are from
the Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts.

Money Stock:
All data on money are from Friedman and Schwartz (1963) Appendix A. Data on the
Mi and M2 are taken Table A-i, and data on the monetary base are from Appendix A,
Table A-2.

Interest Rates:
Interest rate data is three month time loan rates at New York banks. The data were
collected by Ma.ukiw and Miron (1985).

Industrial Production:
The new series collected by Miron and Romer (1989) was used. The data are monthly,
seasonally unadjusted and provide a consistent monthly series beginning in January 1884.
