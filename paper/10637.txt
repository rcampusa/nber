Public Debt, Fiscal Solvency and Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Latin America: The Cases of
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico

                                        ABSTRACT

Ratios of public debt as a share of GDP in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico were 10 percentage points

higher on average during 1996-2002 than in the period 1990-1995. Costa Rica's debt ratio remained

stable but at a high level near 50 percent. Is there reason to be concerned for the solvency of the

public sector in these economies? We provide an answer to this question based on the quantitative

predictions of a variant of the framework proposed by Mendoza and Oviedo (2004). This

methodology yields forward-looking estimates of debt ratios consistent with fiscal solvency for a

government that faces revenue uncertainty and can issue only non-state-contingent debt. In this

environment, aversion to a collapse in outlays leads the government to respect a "natural debt limit"

equal to the annuity value of the primary balance in a "fiscal crisis." A fiscal crisis occurs after a

long sequence of adverse revenue shocks and public outlays adjust to a tolerable minimum. The debt

limit also represents a credible commitment to be able to repay even in a fiscal crisis but is not, in

general, the same as the sustainable debt, which is driven by the probabilistic dynamics of the

primary balance. The results of a baseline scenario question the sustainability of current debt ratios

in Brazil and Colombia, while those in Costa Rica and Mexico seem inside the limits consistent with

fiscal solvency. In contrast, public debt ratios are found to be unsustainable in all four countries for

plausible changes to lower average growth rates or higher real interest rates. Moreover, sustainable

debt ratios fall sharply when default risk is taken into account.

1.     Introduction

       The ratios of public debt to GDP have been rising steadily in the economies of

Latin America. Comparing averages for the period 1996-2002 with those for the period

1990-1995, the average debt ratios of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico increased by about

10 percentage points in each country. In Costa Rica, the public debt ratio did not change

much, but it was already at a relatively high level of around 50 percent at the beginning

of the 1990s. Given that growing public debt has traditionally been an indicator of

financial weakness and vulnerability to economic crisis in the region, there is concern for

assessing whether these high levels of debt are in line with the solvency of the public

sector or should be taken as a warning signal that requires policy intervention.

       The goal of this paper is to assess the consistency of the public debt ratios of

Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico with the conditions required to maintain fiscal

solvency. This assessment is based on a variant of the framework proposed by Mendoza

and Oviedo (2004). In particular, we apply their one-sector model with exogenous

government expenditure rules. This methodology produces estimates of the short- and

long-run dynamics of public debt ratios in a setup in which public revenues are subject to

random shocks and the government aims to maintain its outlays relatively smooth in the

face of this uncertainty. The government is handicapped in its efforts to play this

insurer’s role because markets of contingent claims are incomplete. The government can

only issue one-period, non-state-contingent debt.

       Mendoza and Oviedo (2004) show that, in this environment with incomplete

contingent-claims markets, a government averse to a collapse in its public outlays and

facing revenue uncertainty will impose on itself a “natural debt limit” (NDL) determined
                                                                                              2

by the growth-adjusted annuity value of the primary balance in a state of “fiscal crisis.”

They define a state of fiscal crisis as the one at which a country arrives after experiencing

a sufficiently long sequence of adverse shocks to public revenues and the government

adjusts its outlays to minimum admissible levels.

       An important implication of the NDL is that it allows the government to offer its

creditors a credible commitment to remain able to repay “almost surely” at all times

(including during fiscal crises). It is important to note that this commitment is not an ad-

hoc assumption but an implication of the assumptions that (a) government is averse to

suffering a collapse of its outlays, (b) public revenues are stochastic, and (c) markets of

contingent claims are incomplete. However, the commitment is in terms of an “ability to

pay criterion,” and as such it does not rule out default scenarios that may result from

“willingness to pay” or strategic reasons.

       The NDL sets the upper bound for public debt but is not, in general, the same as

the “sustainable” or equilibrium level of debt. The model does not require public debt to

remain constant at the level of the NDL. Instead, the path of “sustainable” or equilibrium

public debt depends on the initial conditions of debt and revenue, the probabilistic

process driving revenues, and the policy rules governing public outlays. In the short-run,

the dynamics of the distribution of public debt are driven by the government budget

constraint. In the long run, depending on alternative sequences of realizations of public

revenues, the government can end up retiring all the debt or hitting the debt limit. This

extreme behavior of the long-run debt dynamics is particular to this basic version of the

Mendoza-Oviedo model. The two-sector general equilibrium variant of their framework
                                                                                               3

with endogenous government outlays features a unique, invariant long-run distribution of

public debt (see Mendoza and Oviedo (2004) for details).

        The results suggest that current debt ratios in Brazil and Colombia are near the

natural debt limits that would be consistent with fiscal solvency only if one assumes

perceived commitments to large reductions in non-interest outlays (in excess of 6

percentage points of GDP) in a fiscal crisis. Mexico was also near its debt limit in 1998.

However, in Mexico’s case the reduction in outlays that would have been needed to keep

the government solvent if revenues had continued to suffer adverse shocks was smaller

(at 1.5 percentage points of GDP). Still, in all three cases the implied level of adjustment

in outlays to keep the government solvent in a state of fiscal crisis is more than two

standard deviations below recent averages, indicating that the likelihood that the

countries could produce the required adjustment in outlays if they were called to act on

their perceived commitment is low. In contrast, the model indicates that Costa Rica’s

largest public debt ratio of the last 12 years could be financed in a state of fiscal crisis

with a modest cut in outlays equivalent to 1.2 times the standard deviation of outlays.

        The above results are very sensitive to underlying assumptions regarding the

long-run real interest rate and growth rate. Current debt ratios in all four countries are

found to be unsustainable for plausible reductions in growth rates to the averages of the

last 20 years, instead of the average of the last 40 years used in the baseline scenario.

Similarly, the current debt ratios are found to be unsustainable if the long-run real interest

rate is set at 8 percent instead of the 5 percent value of the baseline estimates.

        The Mendoza-Oviedo framework was designed as a forward-looking policy tool

that intentionally sets aside the risk of default. This was done because the framework is
                                                                                           4

intended to produce the sustainable debt ratios that a government that does not consider

the option of defaulting on its obligations could support. This is in line with the

assumptions of the traditional approaches to assess debt sustainability based on

deterministic steady-state estimates or empirical applications of the intertemporal

government budget constraint. However, while this approach is the ideal benchmark in a

forward-looking policy analysis, it does have the drawback that it does not take into

account how default risk considerations could affect sustainable debt dynamics. To

address this issue, we study in this paper how estimates of natural debt limits and

simulated debt dynamics vary when the basic Mendoza-Oviedo model is modified to

incorporate exogenous default risk. Introducing default risk results in marked reductions

in the levels of natural debt limits.

        We also compare the results of the Mendoza-Oviedo model with those produced

by the conventional methodology based on calculations of steady-state debt ratios (or

“Blanchard ratios”). In the countries where the average of revenues exceeds that of

outlays by a large enough margin (Costa Rica and Mexico), the Blanchard ratio yields

higher debt ratios than the natural debt limits of the Mendoza-Oviedo model. This

finding shows that assessments of sustainable debt based on steady-state calculations that

use averages of revenues and outlays and fail to take into account aggregate, non-

insurable fiscal shocks can lead countries to borrow more than what is consistent with

fiscal solvency. In the countries where the averages of revenues and outlays are very

similar (Brazil and Colombia), the Blanchard ratios yield negligible debt ratios. The

Mendoza-Oviedo model can explain high levels of debt in these cases if the government

can commit (credibly) to large enough cuts in outlays in a state of fiscal crisis. To be
                                                                                              5

credible, however, these cuts must not represent unusually large deviations relative to the

historical mean (i.e., they should not be larger than two standard deviations in percent of

the mean).

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a short survey of the existing

methods for calculating public debt ratios consistent with fiscal solvency. Section 3

summarizes the one-good variant of the Mendoza-Oviedo model. Section 4 applies the

model to the cases of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico and discusses the results.

This Section includes sensitivity analysis and an extension to incorporate exogenous

default risk. Section 5 reflects on important caveats of the analysis and provides general

conclusions.

2.     Computing Public Debt Ratios Consistent with Fiscal Solvency: A Survey

       A central question in fiscal policy discussions is how to determine whether the

stock of public debt is “sustainable,” in the sense of being consistent with the fiscal

solvency conditions implied by current and future patterns of government revenue and

outlays. Developing effective tools for computing these sustainable public debt ratios has

proven a difficult task.

       The first problem that studies in this area face is how to give operational content

to the notion of fiscal sustainability. There is a tendency to associate the notion of

unsustainable public debt with failure to satisfy the government budget constraint, or with

the government holding a negative net-worth position. However, from an analytical

standpoint these can be misleading because the “true” government budget constraint (as

an accounting identity relating the overall public sector borrowing requirement to all

sources and uses of government revenue) must always hold. Thus, an analysis that shows
                                                                                                6

that a given stock of public debt fails a “particular” definition of the budget constraint is

ultimately reflecting the fact that the analysis failed to incorporate important features of

the actual fiscal situation of the country under study. How this failure translates into a

judgment about the sustainability of public debt depends on assessments (typically

implicit in the analysis) about the macroeconomic outcomes associated with the different

mechanisms that can be used to maintain fiscal balance. Arguments about sustainability

are therefore implicitly arguments about the pros and cons of these alternative

mechanisms, not about whether the intertemporal budget constraint of the government

holds.

         Consider a basic example. In the canonical long-run analysis of public debt

sustainability, we consider long-run, average levels of public revenue and expenditures,

and view as the sustainable debt-output ratio the annuity value of a long-run target of the

primary balance-output ratio. If a government has a large stock of contingent liabilities

because of the high risk of a banking crisis, the stock of public debt may be judged to be

unsustainable because, once these contingent liabilities are added, the debt-output ratio

exceeds the long-run indicator of sustainability. However, the government budget

constraint must hold, and thus if a banking crisis does occur the government will

ultimately have to adjust the primary balance or rely on other “sources” of financing such

as the inflation tax or a debt default. Adjustment via the primary balance is generally

judged as consistent with this canonical view of sustainability, while adjustment via

inflation or default would not because these would be viewed as alternatives inferior to

adjustment of the primary balance in terms of social welfare.
                                                                                               7

       Beyond the problem of defining an operational concept of public debt

sustainability, there are also problems in the design of methods for calculating sustainable

debt levels. These difficulties reflect the gap between the aspects of fiscal policy

emphasized in the different methods and those aspects that seem empirically relevant for

explaining the actual fiscal position of governments. The literature on methods for

assessing public debt sustainability reflects the evolution of ideas on these issues. In the

lines below we review the main features of the different methods. The intent is not to

conduct a comprehensive survey of the literature (as there are already a number of

excellent surveys, see for example Chalk and Hemming (2000) or IMF (2002) and

(2003a)) but to highlight the central differences among the existing methods.

       The starting point of most of the existing methods for calculating sustainable

public debt-output ratios is the period budget constraint of the government. This

constraint is merely an accounting identity that relates all the flows of government

receipts and payments to the change in public debt:

                                  Bt +1 = Bt (1 + rt ) − (Tt − Gt )                           (1)


where Bt+1 is the stock of public debt issued by the end of period t, Bt is maturing public

debt on which the government pays principal and the real interest rate rt, Tt is total real

government revenue and Gt are current real government outlays (i.e., Tt - Gt is the

primary fiscal balance).

Long-Run Methods

       As the example of the long-run approach to debt sustainability given earlier

illustrated, the long-run approach is based on steady-state, perfect-foresight

considerations that transform the government’s accounting identity (1) into an equation
                                                                                                 8

that maps the long-run primary fiscal balance as a share of output into a “sustainable”

debt-to-output ratio that remains constant over time (see Buiter (1985), Blanchard (1990)

and Blanchard, Chouraqui, Hagemann and Sartor (1990)). In particular, if we define the

long-run rate of output growth as γ and after some basic algebraic manipulation, the

accounting identity in (1) yields:

                                                t−g
                                           b=                                                   (2)
                                                r −γ


where b is the long-run debt-to-GDP ratio, t and g are the long-run GDP shares of current

revenue and outlays, and r is the steady-state real interest rate. Condition (2) can be read

as an indicator of fiscal policy action (i.e., of the “permanent” primary balance-output

ratio that needs to be achieved by means of revenue or expenditure policies so as to

stabilize a given debt-output ratio), or as an indicator of a “sustainable” debt ratio (i.e.,

the target debt-output ratio implied by a given projection of the long-run primary

balance-output ratio).

Intertemporal Methods

        An important shortcoming of the long-run approach is that it fails to recognize

that the “long run” is essentially a theoretical construct. In the short run governments

face a budget constraint that does not reduce to the simplistic (albeit significantly more

tractable) formula of the long-run analysis. There can be temporarily high debt ratios, or

temporarily large primary deficits, that are consistent with government solvency, and

indeed incurring in such temporarily high debt or deficits could be optimal from a tax-

smoothing perspective. To force a country into the straight jacket of keeping its public

debt-output ratio no larger than the level that corresponds to the long-run stationary state
                                                                                                  9

can therefore be a serious mistake. The realization of these flaws in the long-run

calculations led to the development of intertemporal-budget-constraint methods that

shifted the focus from analyzing directly the debt-output ratio to studying the time-series

properties of the fiscal balance, so as to test whether these properties are consistent with

the conditions required to satisfy the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. This

intertemporal constraint serves as a means to link the short-run dynamics of debt and the

primary balance with the long-run solvency constraint of the government.

        In their original form (see Hamilton and Flavin (1986)) the intertemporal methods

aimed to test whether the data can reject the hypothesis that the condition ruling out

Ponzi games on public debt holds. This condition states that at any date t the discounted

value of the stock of public debt t+j periods into the future should vanish as j goes to
                  j
infinity: Lim ∏ (1 + rt +k ) −1Bt +1+ j = 0 . In other words, in the long run the stock of debt
          j →∞
                 k =0


cannot grow faster than the gross interest rate. If this no-Ponzi-game (NPG) condition

holds, the forward solution of (1) implies that the intertemporal government budget

constraint holds: The present value of the primary fiscal balance is equal to the value of

the existing stock of debt, and hence the exiting public debt or public debt-output ratio is

deemed “sustainable.”

        A number of articles tried different variations of this test by testing for stationarity

and co-integration in the time series of the primary balance and public debt, and produced

different results using U.S. data (Chalk and Hemming (2000) review this literature).

These intertemporal-budget-constraint methods also began to introduce elements of

uncertainty into public debt sustainability analysis, but mostly in an indirect manner as

sources of statistical error in hypothesis testing, or by testing the NPG condition in
                                                                                                                        10

expected value or as an orthogonality condition that considers the fact that at equilibrium

the sequence of real interest rates used to discount the “terminal” debt stock must match

the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in private consumption.1

           The article by Bohn (1998) provided an alternative interpretation of intertemporal

methods that reduces them to testing if the primary balance responds positively to

increases in public debt. In particular, if the primary balance-output ratio and the debt-

output ratio are stationary, the following regression can be used to test for sustainability:

                                               st = ρ bt + α ⋅ Z t + ε t                                                (3)


where st is the ratio of the primary fiscal balance over GDP, εt is a well-behaved error

term and Zt is a vector of determinants of the primary balance other than the initial stock

of public debt. In Bohn’s case, he included in Zt the cyclical variations in U.S. GDP and

a measure of “abnormal” government expenditures associated with war episodes. He

found strong evidence in favor of ρ > 0. Thus, controlling for war-time spending and the

business cycle, the debt-output ratio is mean-reverting in U.S. data. Moreover, the

positive coefficient ρ, indicating that the primary balance displays a linear response that

is both positive and systematic to increases in debt, is sufficient (albeit not necessary) to

ensure that the intertemporal government budget constraint holds. This is because, as the

more recent methods for evaluating fiscal sustainability under uncertainty emphasize,

ensuring fiscal sustainability requires that above a certain critical maximum level of debt

b*, the primary balance responds positively (in either linear or non-linear fashion) to

changes in public debt. The intuition is that if this is the case any large increase in debt

due to “ large negative shocks” is eventually reversed through primary surpluses.

       Chapter III of IMF (2003b) applied Bohn’s method to a panel of industrial and

developing country data. The results identified a group of developing countries where

the sustainability condition ρ > 0 holds, and others where it does not. Moreover, the

study also shows evidence of non-linearities in the relationship between debt and primary

balances, indicating that countries that were able to sustain larger debt ratios in the data

also displayed a stronger response of the primary balance to debt increases.

Recent Development: Probabilistic Methods and Methods with Financial Frictions

       Recent developments in public debt sustainability analysis follow two strands.

The first strand emphasizes the fact that governments, particularly in emerging markets,

face significant sources of uncertainty as they try to assess the patterns of government

revenue and expenditures, and hence the level of debt that they can afford to maintain.

From the perspective of these probabilistic methods, measures of sustainability derived

from the long-run approach or the intertemporal analysis are seen as inaccurate for

governments that hold large stocks of debt and face large shocks to their revenues and

expenditures. The key question here is not whether public debt is sustainable at some

abstract steady state, or whether in a sample of a country’s recent or historical past the

NPG condition holds. The key question is whether the current debt-output ratio is

sustainable given the current domestic and international economic environment and its

future prospects.
                                                                                               12

       The second strand aims to incorporate elements of the financial frictions literature

applied to the recent emerging-markets crises. For example, public debt in many

emerging markets displays a characteristic referred to as “liability dollarization” (i.e.,

debt is often denominated in foreign currency or indexed to the price level.). As a result,

abrupt changes in domestic relative prices that are common in the aftermath of a large

devaluation, or a ‘sudden stop’ to net capital inflows, can alter dramatically standard

long-run calculations of sustainable debt ratios and render levels of debt that looked

sustainable in one situation unsustainable in another. Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi (2003)

evaluate these effects for the Argentine case and find that large changes in the relative

price of nontradables alter significantly the assessments obtained with standard steady-

state sustainability analysis. The general version of the Mendoza-Oviedo model also

incorporates these effects (see Mendoza and Oviedo (2004)).

       The probabilistic methods for assessing fiscal sustainability propose alternative

strategies for dealing with macroeconomic uncertainty. A method proposed at the IMF

by Barnhill and Kopits (2003) incorporates uncertainty by adapting the value-at-risk

(VaR) principles of the finance industry to debt instruments issued by governments. The

aim of this approach is to model the probability of a negative net worth position for the

government. The method requires estimates of the present values of the main elements of

the balance sheet of the total consolidated public sector (financial assets and liabilities,

expected revenues from sales of commodities or other goods and services, as well as any

contingent assets and liabilities), and an estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the

variables that are viewed as determinants of those present values in reduced form. This

information is then used to compute measures of dispersion relative to the present values
                                                                                           13

of the different assets and liabilities that determine the value at risk (or exposure to

negative net worth) of the government.

       A second probabilistic method recently considered for country surveillance at the

IMF (see IMF (2003c)) modifies the long-run method to incorporate variations to the

determinants of sustainable public debt in the right-hand-side of equation (2), and also

examines short-term debt dynamics that result from different assumptions about the

short-run path of the variables that enter the government budget constraint in

deterministic form. For example, deterministic debt dynamics up to 10 periods into the

future are computed for variations of the growth rate of output of two standard deviations

relative to its mean.

       The same IMF publication proposes a stochastic simulation approach that

computes the probability density function of possible debt-output ratios. This stochastic

simulation model, like the VaR approach, is based on a non-structural time-series

analysis of the macroeconomic variables that drive the dynamics of public debt

(particularly output growth, interest rates, and the primary balance). The difference is that

the stochastic simulation model produces simulated probability distributions based on

forward simulations of a vector-autoregression model that combines the determinants of

debt dynamics as endogenous variables with a vector of exogenous variables. The

distributions are then used to make assessments of sustainable debt in terms of the

probability that the simulated debt ratios are greater or equal than a critical value.

       Xu and Ghezzi (2002) developed a third probabilistic method to evaluate

sustainable public debt. Their method computes "fair spreads" on public debt that reflect

the default probabilities implied by a continuous-time stochastic model of the dynamics
                                                                                            14

of treasury reserves in which exchange rates, interest rates, and the primary fiscal balance

follow Brownian motion processes (so that they capture drift and volatility observed in

the data). The analysis is similar to that of the first-generation models of balance-of-

payments crises. Default occurs when treasury reserves are depleted, and thus debt is

deemed unsustainable when the properties of the underlying Brownian motions are such

that the expected value of treasury reserves declines to zero (which occurs at an

exponential rate).

3.     The Basic Version of the Mendoza-Oviedo Model

       The probabilistic methods summarized in the last section make significant

progress in incorporating macroeconomic uncertainty into debt sustainability analysis but

they are largely based on non-structural econometric methods. In contrast, the Mendoza -

Oviedo (MO) method aims to provide an explicit dynamic equilibrium model of the

mechanism by which macroeconomic shocks affect government finances. The MO

method also differs from the other probabilistic methods in that it models explicitly the

nature of the government’s forward-looking commitment to remain solvent, instead of

focusing on computing estimates of exposure to negative net worth or depletion of

treasury reserves. As explained below, the MO method determines sustainable debt

ratios that respect a natural debt limit consistent with a credible commitment to repay

similar in principle to the one implicit in the long-run and intertemporal methods.

       The structural emphasis of the MO approach comes at the cost of the reduced

flexibility and increased complexity of the numerical solution methods required to solve

non-linear, dynamic stochastic equilibrium models with incomplete asset markets. At the

same time, by proceeding in this manner the MO framework seeks to produce estimates
                                                                                           15

of sustainable public debt that are robust to the Lucas critique. The non-structural or

reduced-form tools used in the other probabilistic methods to model the dynamics of

public debt are vulnerable to the policy instability problems resulting from the Lucas

critique. This is not a serious limitation when these methods are used for an ex-post

evaluation of how well past debt dynamics matched fiscal solvency conditions, but it can

be a shortcoming for a forward-looking analysis that requires a framework for describing

how equilibrium prices and allocations, and hence the ability of the government to raise

revenue and service debt, adjust to alternative tax and expenditure policies or other

changes in the environment (including, for example, a Sudden Stop limiting the access to

international capital markets or a collapse in the real exchange rate triggered by a

devaluation of the currency).

       The basic principles of the MO method are as follows. Assume that output

follows a deterministic trend (so that it grows at a constant, exogenous rate γ) and the real

interest rate is constant. Public revenues follow an exogenous stochastic process. The

government is extremely averse to suffering a collapse in its outlays. Hence, it aims to

keep its outlays smooth unless the loss of access to debt markets forces it to adjust them

to minimum tolerable levels. The government can only issue non-state-contingent debt.

The government budget constraint in (1) can then be re-written as:

                                (1 + γ )bt +1 = bt (1 + r ) − (tt − g t )                  (4)


where lowercase letters refer to ratios relative to GDP.

       Since the government wants to rule out a collapse of its outlays below their

tolerable minimum levels, it would not want to borrow more than the amount of debt it

could service if the primary balance were to remain forever (or “almost surely” in the
                                                                                               16

language of probability theory) at its lowest possible value, or “fiscal crisis” state. A state

of fiscal crisis is defined as a situation reached after a “sufficiently” long sequence of the

worst realization of public revenues and after public outlays have been adjusted to their

tolerable minimum. This upper bound on debt is labeled the “Natural Debt Limit”

(NDL), which is the term used in the precautionary-savings literature for an analogous

debt limit that private agents impose on themselves when they can only using non-state-

contingent assets to try to smooth consumption (see Aiyagari (1994)). The NDL is given

by the growth-adjusted annuity value of the primary balance in the state of fiscal crisis.

          The “history of events” leading to a fiscal crisis has non-zero probability

(although it could be a very low probability) as long as that crisis state is an event within

the support of the probability distribution of the primary balance, and as long as there are

non-zero conditional probabilities of moving into this crisis state from other realizations

of the primary balance. Under these conditions, the government knows that there is some

probability that it could suffer a fiscal crisis in the future, and to ensure it can pay for its

minimum level of outlays it must not hold more debt than it could service then.

          Since the NDL is a time-invariant debt level that satisfies the government budget

constraint with revenues and outlays set at their minimum, it follows that the NDL

implies that the government remains able to service its debt even in a state of fiscal crisis.

Thus, the NDL that a government imposes on itself in order to self-insure so as to rule out

a collapse of public outlays below its tolerable minimum also allows that government to

offer lenders a credibly commitment to remain able to repay its debt in all states of

nature.
                                                                                                             17

         To turn the above notions of the NDL and its implied credible commitment to

repay into operational concepts, we need to be specific about the factors that determine

the probabilistic dynamics of the components of the primary balance. On the revenue

side, the probabilistic processes driving tax revenues reflect the uncertainty affecting tax

rates and tax bases. These processes have one component that is the result of domestic

policy variability and the endogenous response of the economy to this variability, and

another component that is largely exogenous to the domestic economy (which typically

results from the nontrivial effects of factors like fluctuations in commodity prices and

commodity exports on government revenues). The one-sector version of the MO model

used in this paper incorporates explicitly the second component.2

         On the expenditure side, government expenditures adjust largely in response to

policy decisions, but the manner in which they respond varies widely across countries.

Industrial countries tend to display countercyclical fiscal policies while fiscal policy in

emerging markets is generally procyclical (as the recent literature on procyclical fiscal

policy has shown). In addition, the “adjustment” or minimum level of public outlays to

which the government can commit to adjust in a fiscal crisis is particularly important for

determining the NDL and the sustainable debt ratios in the MO model.

         Labeling the fiscal-crisis level (or lowest realization) of the government revenue-

GDP ratio as tmin and the minimum level of the ratio of outlays to GDP that the

government can commit to deliver as gmin (for gmin < tmin), it follows from the government

budget constraint in (4) that the NDL is the value of b* given by:


2
  Note that the exogenous determinants of public revenue dynamics can be important even in economies
that have successfully diversified their exports away from primary commodities. In Mexico, for example,
oil exports are less than 15 percent of total exports but oil-related revenues still represent more than 1/3 of
public sector revenue.
                                                                                             18


                                                   t min − g min
                                    bt +1 ≤ b* ≡                                             (5)
                                                       r −γ


This NDL is lower for governments that have (a) higher variability in public revenues

(for example, if fiscal revenue follows a symmetric Markov chain that obeys the rule of

simple persistence, the value of tmin can be written as a multiple of the standard deviation

of public revenues and hence lower values of tmin reduce the debt limit), (b) less

flexibility to adjust public outlays, and (c) lower growth rates or higher real interest rates.

       The NDL represents a credible commitment to repay in the sense that it ensures

that the government remains able to repay even in a state of fiscal crisis for a given

known stochastic process driving revenues and a given policy setting the minimum level

of outlays. However, this should not be interpreted as suggesting that the need to respect

the NDL rules out the possibility of sovereign default. Default triggered by “inability to

pay” remains possible if there are large, unexpected shocks that drive revenues below

what was perceived to be the value of tmin or if the government turns out to be unable to

reduce outlays to gmin when a fiscal crisis hits. In addition, default triggered by

“unwillingness to pay” remains possible since the NDL is only an ability to pay criterion

that cannot rule out default for strategic reasons. Later in Section 4 we explore an

extension of this framework that incorporates default risk into the basic MO setup.

       Consider a government with exogenous, random fiscal revenues (say, for

example, oil export revenues) and an ad-hoc smoothing policy rule for government

expenditures, such that gt = g (for g≥ gmin) as long as bt+1 ≥ b*, otherwise gt adjusts to

satisfy condition (4). By (4) and (5), if at a particular date the current debt ratio is below

b* and the realization of the revenue-output ratio is tmin, the government finances g by
                                                                                               19

increasing bt+1. In contrast, if at some date the current debt ratio is at b* and the

realization of revenues is tmin, (4) and (5) imply that gt=gmin.

        In a simple example with zero initial debt, it is straightforward to show that if the

government keeps drawing the minimum realization of public revenue, it will take the T

periods that satisfy the following condition for the government to hit the NDL:

                                             T
                                        R    g − g min
                                        γ  =                                                (6)
                                             g − t min


This result indicates that, in the worst-case scenario in which revenues remain "almost

surely" at their minimum, the government can access the debt market to keep the ratio of

public outlays at the level g for a longer period of time the larger is the excess of

"normal" government outlays over minimum government outlays relative to the excess of

normal outlays over the minimum level of revenues. Thus, the government uses debt to

keep its outlays as smooth as possible given its capacity to service debt as determined by

the volatility of its public revenues, reflected in the value of tmin , and its ability to reduce

public outlays in a fiscal crisis, reflected in the value of gmin .

        It is critical to note that the key element of the expenditure policy is not the level

of gmin per se but the credibility of the announcement that outlays would be so reduced

during a fiscal crunch. The ability to sustain debt and the credibility of this

announcement depend on each other because a government with a credible ex ante

commitment to major expenditure cuts during a fiscal crisis can borrow more and access

the debt market for longer time, and hence, everything else the same, this government

faces a lower probability to be called to act on its commitment. In a more general case in

which public revenue is not an exogenous probabilistic process but it is in part the result
                                                                                             20

of tax policies and their interaction with endogenous tax bases, the credibility argument

extends to tax policy. Governments that can credibly commit to generate higher and less

volatile tax revenue-output ratios will be able to sustain higher levels of debt, and to the

extent that this helps the economy produce stable tax bases it helps support the credibility

of the government’s ability to raise revenue.

       The condition defining the NDL in (5) has a similar form as the formula for

                                                                      t−g
calculating sustainable debt ratios under the long-run method: b =         . However, the
                                                                      r −γ

implications for assessing fiscal sustainability under the two methods are sharply

different. In general, the long-run deterministic rule will always identify as sustainable a

debt-output ratio that is unsustainable once uncertainty of the determinants of the fiscal

balance and the NDL are taken into account. This is because the long-run method

ignores the role of the volatility of the elements of the fiscal balance, while in the MO

model one finds that, everything else the same, governments with less variability in tax

revenues can sustain higher debt ratios.

       Consider the case of two governments with identical long-run averages of tax

revenue-output ratios at 20 percent. The tax revenue-output ratio of government A has a

standard deviation of 1 percent relative to the mean, while that of Government B has a

standard deviation of 5 percent relative to the mean. Assuming for simplicity that the

distributions of tax revenue-output ratios are Markov processes with tmin set at two

standard deviations below the mean, the probabilistic model would compute the natural

debt limit for A using a value of tmin of 18 percent, while for B it would use 10 percent.

The deterministic long-run method yields the same debt ratio for both governments and

uses the common 20 percent average tax revenue-output ratio to compute it. In contrast,
                                                                                            21

the MO method would find that debt ratio unsustainable for both governments and would

produce a debt limit for B that is lower than that for A.

        Another important difference between the two methods is in the way that the MO

method views the debt limit vis-à-vis the way in which the long-run method views the

steady-state debt ratio. In the long-run analysis, the debt ratio is viewed as either a target

ratio to which a government should be forced to move to, or as the anchor for a target

primary balance-GDP ratio that should be achieved by means of a policy correction. In

contrast, in the MO method condition (5) defines only the maximum level of debt.

Unless the NDL binds, this maximum level of debt is not the equilibrium or sustainable

level of debt that should be issued by the government (although it clearly plays a central

role in determining both). Depending on the probabilistic and policy assumptions driving

revenues and expenditures (and, generalizing condition (5), depending also on the

stochastic processes of the real interest rate and output growth), a country can have levels

of debt lower (even much lower) than this critical level, and may take a very long time on

average to enter a state of fiscal crisis or even never arrive at it.

        The MO methodology models uncertainty in the form of discrete Markov

processes. Given information on the current stock of public debt, the current tax

revenue-GDP ratio and the assumed behavioral rules for government outlays and

statistical moments of the public revenue process, the model produces conditional one-

period-ahead and unconditional long-run distributions of the debt-output ratio, as well as

estimates of the average number of periods in which b* is expected to be reached from

any initial bt. Again, depending on the nature of the stochastic processes and policy rules
                                                                                          22

of revenues and outlays, it may take a few quarters to hit the debt ceiling on average or it

may take an infinite number of quarters to do it

4.     Results of the MO Method for Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica & Mexico

       This Section applies the MO method described in the last section to the cases of

Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico. The Section begins with a brief review of the

recent growth performance and evolution of public debt, public revenues and public

expenditure ratios in these countries. This review serves to identify key parameters

needed to simulate the debt dynamics and solve for natural debt limits.

Review of Growth Performance and Fiscal Dynamics

       The growth performance of the four countries examined in this study over the last

two decades was weak. As shown in Table 1, average growth in GDP per capita for the

period 1981-2000 ranged from a minimum of 0.5 percent in Brazil to a maximum of 1.25

percent in Costa Rica. These countries grew at faster rates in the past. Taking averages

starting in 1961, the smallest average per-capita GDP growth rate was 1.8 percent for

Costa Rica and the largest was 2.6 percent for Brazil. Given the apparent structural

breaks in the trend of GDP per capita of these countries since the early 1980s, we conduct

our public debt analysis under a baseline growth scenario that uses 1961-2000 average

growth rates, and compare the results with a scenario that views the growth slowdown of

the last two decades as permanent by using 1981-2000 average growth rates.

       Reliable cross-country estimates of public debt stocks and interest rates on public

debt at the general government level are hard to obtain. We use the figures documented

in IMF (2003b) for ratios of public debt to GDP for the period 1990-2002. As shown in

Table 1, the mean debt-GDP ratios for the full sample range from 33.7 percent in
                                                                                            23

Colombia to 49.5 percent in Costa Rica. However, these full-sample averages hide the

fact shown in Figure 1 that debt ratios have been growing rapidly (except in the case of

Costa Rica, where the ratio has been fairly stable but also fairly high). If we split the

sample to create averages for 1990-1995 and 1996-2002, we find that the mean debt

ratios of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico increased by about 10 percentage points between

the first period and the second periods. By the end of the sample period, all four

countries displayed debt ratios of about 50 percent (see Figure 1). The key question to

answer is therefore whether a debt ratio of 50 percent is consistent with fiscal solvency

given the pattern of growth and interest rates and the volatility of fiscal revenues that

these countries face.

       Real interest rates on public debt are hard to measure because of differences in

maturity, currency denomination, indexation factors, and residence of creditors for the

various debt instruments that each country issues, and also because of the existence of

time-varying default and exchange-rate risk premia. One useful proxy is the measure of

sovereign risk proposed by Neumeyer and Perri (2003), which is the spread of the

EMBI+ index relative to the U.S. T-Bill rate deflated by an estimate of expected inflation

in the U.S. GDP deflator. The sample period of this measure is relatively short (starting

in 1994) and biased because it includes mainly observations for a turbulent period in

world capital markets. Still, this measure of real interest rates on public debt shows

substantial premia over the world’s risk free rate (the average real interest rates including

the risk premia for a quarterly sample from 1994:1 to 2002:2, are 12.9 percent for Brazil

and 10.3 percent for Mexico). The real interest rate on debt instruments will deviate from

these figures to the extent that (a) debt instruments are domestic rather than external, (b)
                                                                                             24

debt is denominated in domestic currency rather than in foreign currency or in terms of

an indexation factor, and (c) the debt instruments have liquidity or transactions value for

the holders. The lower bound of the interest rate on public debt is set by the real interest

rate on U.S. public debt. The 1981:1-2000:4 average of the U.S. 90 day T-bill rate

deflated by observed U.S. CPI inflation is about 2.8 percent.

       Given the above considerations, we consider two interest rate scenarios in our

calculations. The baseline scenario considers a real interest rate of 5 percent, which

incorporates a small long-run default risk premium of about 2.2 percentage points above

the U.S. T-bill rate. The alternative is a high-real-interest-rate scenario in which the real

interest rate is set at 8 percent (i.e., the long-run default risk premium is about 5.3

percentage points above the T-bill rate). In both scenarios we remain relatively

optimistic about growth prospects, using average growth rates for the period 1961-2000.

       The measure of public revenues that we need to isolate for conducting the debt

analysis is the total of all tax and non-tax government revenues excluding grants. For

government expenditures we require the total non-interest government outlays (including

all expenditures and transfer payments and excluding all forms of debt service). Once

again, limitations of the existing international databases make it difficult to retrieve

consistent measures of these variables that apply at the level of the entire non-financial

public sector and, in the case of the outlays, that include the annuity values of all

contingent liabilities resulting from obligations like banking- or pension-system bailouts.

We put together estimates of the revenue and outlay ratios for the four countries under

study by combining data from IMF (2003b) and World Development Indicators (see the

footnotes to Table 1 for details). The former shows data for the non-financial public
                                                                                            25

sector but it does not separate interest and non-interest expenditures for some countries.

The latter separates interest and non-interest expenditures but reports data only for the

central government. Thus, the revenue and expenditures data are not exactly comparable

across countries.

       The average ratios of total public revenue to GDP during the period 1990-2002

ranged from 12.6 percent in Colombia to 23 percent in Mexico (Table 1). Turning to

examine the volatility of public revenues, Costa Rica displays the lowest coefficient of

variation in the revenue-output ratio, at 5.4 percent of the mean. The coefficient of

variation of revenues is similar in Colombia and Mexico (8.9 and 8 percent respectively).

Brazil shows the highest coefficient of variation of public revenues at 14.1 percent.

Interestingly, the country with the lowest coefficient of variation in public revenues

(Costa Rica) is also the one with the highest average public debt-GDP ratio.

       The average of total non-interest outlays as a share of GDP is very similar in

Brazil, Costa Rica and Mexico, at about 19 percent. The average outlays ratio for

Colombia is much lower, at 12.8 percent, but this is one of the measures that applies only

to the central government, so the actual ratio for the non-financial-public sector must be

higher. With regard to the variability of non-interest outlays, Mexico shows the smallest

coefficient of variation (about 4 percent), followed by Costa Rica (10 percent). Brazil

and Colombia show the highest coefficients of variation in the outlays ratio, at about 14

percent for both.

Natural Debt Limits: Baseline Scenario and Two Alternatives

       Table 1 reports three sets of calculations of natural debt limits for Brazil,

Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico. The baseline scenario considers the 1961-2000
                                                                                             26

average growth rates of GDP per capita and a 5 percent real interest rate. The growth-

slowdown (GS) scenario uses the 1981-2000 average growth rates (with the real interest

rate still at 5 percent). The high-real-interest-rate (HRIR) scenario uses a real interest

rate of 8 percent (with the growth rates set at the 1961-2000 averages).

        The baseline scenario differs from the other two because it is designed to produce

a coefficient of fiscal adjustment that yields an NDL equal to the largest debt ratio

observed for each country in the 1990-2002 period. Table 1 reports this coefficient of

“implied fiscal adjustment” in terms of how many standard deviations relative to the

mean of non-interest outlays are needed to yield a debt limit equal to maximum observed

debt (given the data for means and coefficients of variation of revenues and outlays, the

average growth rates, the real interest rate, and assumed floors of public revenue equal to

two standard deviations below the corresponding means). The Table also shows the

implied minimum ratio of outlays to GDP resulting from the coefficient of fiscal

adjustment. The GS and HRIR scenario keep the same fiscal adjustment coefficient and

just alter either the growth rate or the real interest rate.

        The public debt-GDP ratios of the four countries under study peaked at similar

levels during the 1990-2002 period (ranging from 50 percent in Colombia to 56 percent

in Brazil). The coefficients of implied fiscal adjustment reported in Table 1 show that, in

order to produce NDLs that can support these high levels of debt, three of the four

countries (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) need credible commitments to undertake large

cuts in outlays if they were to hit a fiscal crisis. The adjustment measures 2 standard

deviations below the mean of non-interest government outlays in Mexico, 2.3 in

Colombia and 2.6 in Brazil (which are equivalent to cuts relative to the average outlays-
                                                                                            27

GDP ratios of 1.5, 4 and 6.7 percentage points respectively). The fact that these

adjustments are outside the two-standard-deviation threshold of the data for non-interest

outlays of the previous decade suggests that the probability that the governments could

produce these large expenditure cuts if they needed to act on their commitment is low.

       The situation in Costa Rica seems more favorable. Costa Rica can support a

credible commitment to repay a debt-output ratio as large as 53 percent of GDP with a

fiscal adjustment of 1.2 standard deviations below the mean of non-interest outlays

(which is equivalent to about 2 percentage points of GDP). Thus, the model is consistent

with the data in predicting that Costa Rica, the country with less volatility in public

revenues, should be the one that has a better chance of sustaining a high debt ratio. This

is the case even though Costa Rica’s growth rate is the same as Colombia’s and is lower

than the growth rates in Mexico and Brazil by 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points respectively.

       The potential dangers of using the Blanchard ratios for conducting debt

sustainability analysis are illustrated in the baseline results. The case of Mexico is

particularly striking. The Blanchard ratio, which would compute a sustainable debt ratio

using the difference between the average public revenue and the average government

outlays, yields a debt ratio of about 132 percent, nearly 2.5 times larger than the NDL

produced by the MO model. In the case of Costa Rica, the Blanchard ratio also exceeds

the NDL but by a very small margin. In contrast, in the cases of the two countries where

complying with the NDLs would require the largest expenditure cuts (i.e., where the

consistency of the high debt ratio with fiscal solvency is more questionable), the

Blanchard ratio yields public debt ratios so low that are of little practical relevance. The

Blanchard ratio for Brazil is 3.5 percent and for Colombia the ratio is negative, at –5.3
                                                                                            28

percent (because in the data the average outlays exceed the average revenues by 0.16

percentage points of GDP). In these cases the Blanchard ratio would be switched to its

alternative interpretation, where a target debt ratio would be chosen and the Blanchard

ratio would then be used to set an average primary fiscal balance that the governments

should aim to obtain by adjusting fiscal policy.

       Consider next the natural debt limits in the GS and HRIR scenarios. If the growth

slowdown of the last two decades persists, and even assuming that the coefficients of

fiscal adjustment were to remain as high as estimated in the baseline scenario, the current

debt ratios would exceed the natural debt limits of all four countries by large margins.

The situation of Brazil would be particularly compromised, because the current debt ratio

of 56 percent would exceed the maximum debt ratio consistent with a fully credible

commitment to repay in the GS scenario by nearly 26 percentage points of GDP.

       The HRIR scenario, in which for example a retrenchment of world capital

markets, increased long-run default risk, or the pressure of large fiscal deficits in

industrial countries push the real interest rate on emerging markets public debt to 8

percent, has even more damaging effects. In this case, even if the growth rates recover to

the 1961-2000 averages and even with the large fiscal adjustment coefficients set in the

baseline scenario, the natural debt limits of all four countries fall to a range between 25.2

percent for Brazil to 27.4 percent for Costa Rica. Notice, however, that the prediction of

the model is not that an increase of the interest rate to 8 percent would trigger immediate

fiscal crises in all four countries. For a fiscal crisis to occur immediately, the increase in

the interest rate would have to be once-and-for-all and permanent. A transitory hike in

the real interest rate could be absorbed in an analogous manner as a transitory downturn
                                                                                             29

in public revenues, and hence a fiscal crisis would only be triggered after a sufficiently

long sequence of adverse shocks.

       This last observation highlights again the fact that the NDL is not (in general) the

same as the sustainable or equilibrium level of debt, which is determined by the dynamics

driven by the government budget constraint. We turn now to study these dynamics.

Debt Dynamics

       The simulations of debt dynamics consider a grid of public debt-GDP ratios that

spans the interval from 0 to the NDL (the model assumes that if the government budget

constraint yields negative debt at any time, the corresponding fiscal surplus is instead

rebated to the private sector as a lump-sum transfer). The dynamics of sustainable debt

can be traced from any initial public debt ratio in this interval. However, one needs to be

careful in studying the long-run dynamics of debt ratios because this basic version of the

MO model features at least two long-run distributions of public debt, one converging to 0

and the other to the NDL. Which of these two distributions is attained in the long run

depends on initial conditions.

       The prediction that the long-run debt ratio is not determined within the model

(i.e., that the long-run debt ratio depends on initial conditions) is not a peculiarity unique

to the MO model. An outcome like this is the key prediction for debt dynamics of the

classic tax-smoothing framework of Barro (1979), and it is also in line with the findings

on Ramsey optimal taxation problems in which smooth taxes are optimal taxes (see

Chapter 12 of Ljungqvist and Sargent (2000)).

       The stochastic processes of public revenues used in the simulations are

characterized by time-invariant Markov chains. The Markov chains are defined by three
                                                                                             30

objects: an n-element vector of realizations of the revenues, t, an nxn transition

probability matrix, P, and a probability distribution for the initial value of the realization

of revenues, π0. The typical element of P, Pij , indicates the probability of observing

revenues t=tj in the next period given that revenues are t=ti in the current period.

        For each country, the vector of realizations of revenues has 5 elements (n=5). The

lowest value of t is set two standard deviations below average revenues in each of the

four countries under analysis. We use Tauchen’s (1986) univariate quadrature method in

order to construct the rest of the elements of t and the matrix P so as to approximate the

first-order autocorrelation and standard deviation of public revenues observed in the data.

        The stochastic simulations require also that we generate a T-period time series of

realizations of revenues, i.e. t1, t2, ... tT, drawn from the Markov vector t. This time series

is constructed using realizations of a uniform random variable u in [0,1] that indicates

how to pick one realization of tax revenue in period t+1 given the realization at time t.

The tax revenue at t+1, tj say, is determined according to:

                                       j           j +1

                                      ∑ Pi,l < u ≤∑ Pi ,l
                                      l =1         l =1


or tj = t1 if u<Pi1

           The first application of the stochastic simulations is illustrated in Figure 2,

which shows the number of periods that it takes to hit a fiscal crisis (i.e., to hit the NDL)

for the country-specific calibrated parameters and seven initial debt ratios that span the

range between 0.25 and the maximum debt ratio observed in each country in the 1990-

2002 sample. From each initial condition of the debt ratio, there are different stochastic

paths that public debt, revenues and outlays can follow in the future, and each of these

paths features a different number of periods to hit a fiscal crisis. The tall bars in the
                                                                                               31

figure report the average time to a fiscal crisis from 1000 simulations of the public-debt

dynamics induced by the government budget constraint in equation (4). The simulated tax

revenues correspond to the realizations of revenues drawn from the Markov chains

calibrated to the revenue processes of each country (see Table 1 for the corresponding

averages and coefficients of variation). Depending on initial conditions, there are

simulation in which a fiscal crisis never occurs (particularly for low initial debt ratios).

In these cases, the average measure of time to fiscal crisis would go to infinity, and hence

is omitted from the charts.

        The short bars in the plots show the minimum possible number of periods before

hitting the fiscal crisis. This extreme adverse scenario corresponds to simulations of debt

dynamics under the assumption that, in every period, the government draws the lowest

realization of the public revenue contained in the vector of realizations of revenues.

        The top two graphs in Figure 2 show that in Brazil and Colombia the mean time

to a fiscal crisis is high (15 years or more) for an initial debt ratio equal to 0.25. A fiscal

crisis can occur much sooner on average (in less than 2.5 years) when then initial debt

ratio is around 0.5. The difference between the mean and extreme time to hit a fiscal

crisis is larger in Brazil than in Colombia for all initial debt ratios. Furthermore, the

extreme scenario indicates a shorter time to a fiscal crisis in Brazil than in Colombia

regardless of the initial debt ratio. This is because the lowest realization of revenues are

calibrated to be two standard deviations below the mean, so the higher volatility of

revenues in Brazil implies that the crisis-level of revenues for Brazil is more distant from

the mean than for Colombia.
                                                                                            32

       The bottom two graphs in Figure 2 (for the cases of Costa Rica and Mexico) serve

to illustrate how uncertainty affects the dynamics of public debt and the fact that the NDL

is not in general the same as the equilibrium or sustainable debt. The fact that these plots

only show bars for the mean time to a fiscal crisis for high debt ratios (above 50 percent)

indicates that in the sampling of 1000 stochastic simulations starting from debt ratios

below 0.5, there were many cases in which the debt ratio converged to zero instead of

reaching the NDL. Consider for example the initial debt ratio of about 0.35 in the plot

for Costa Rica. The extreme measure of time to a fiscal crisis shows that a fiscal crisis

will occur after 10 years of experiencing realizations of revenues two-standard-deviations

below the mean. However, in the 1000 stochastic simulations used to calculate the mean

time to a fiscal crisis, only about half of the simulations reached the NDL and the rest

converged to a zero public debt position in the long run. Similarly, for an initial debt

ratio of 0.4, the debt ratio never reached the NDL in 127 out of 1000 simulations. Thus,

the Costa Rican and Mexican cases illustrate examples in which the sustainable debt

dynamics deviate sharply from the NDL.

          Figure 3 shows a sample of simulated time series of the public debt ratio and

illustrates further how much the NDL and the sustainable debt ratios differ. The figure

shows 50 simulations of debt ratios all starting from a common initial ratio of 0.35, using

the parameter values calibrated to Costa Rica. At each date t, a random draw of public

revenues, along with the date-t debt and the fiscal rules for public outlays, are used to

determine the value of the debt at t+1. Notice that, whereas for some paths the debt ratio

increases rapidly to reach the NDL, for other paths it takes a long time to reach it and for

other paths the debt goes to zero. As explained above, for a large range of initial values
                                                                                              33

of public debt the model predicts that debt ratio will reach the debt limit while for other

initial values the debt ratio goes to zero. This implies that for starting values of the debt

ratio above 0.35, the fraction of paths driving the debt to its maximum level increases and

for starting values below 0.35 that fraction decreases.

Default Risk

       Up to this point we followed the methodology proposed by Mendoza and Oviedo

(2004) in which sovereign default was set aside to focus on modeling the optimal debt

policy consistent with fiscal solvency and an ad-hoc rule smoothing public outlays.

Default risk was only taken into account in setting the value of the long-run real interest

rate used to solve for the NDLs and the debt dynamics (5 percent in the benchmark case,

8 percent in the high-interest-rate scenario). However, time-varying default risk premia

are an important feature of public debt in emerging markets. It may make sense for a

government to conduct a forward-looking debt sustainability exercise in which it assumes

that default risk is time invariant as a benchmark scenario, but it is important to study

how the results change when time-varying default risk is introduced.

       One important limitation of the analysis of default risk is that existing theoretical

models of default on optimal sovereign debt contracts face serious challenges in

explaining observed debt ratios. The canonical model of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981)

considers a risk-neutral lender and a risk-averse borrower that has the option of

defaulting at the cost of facing permanent exclusion of the debt market. The lender is

willing to take on the risk of default by charging a rate of interest that incorporates a

premium consistent with the probability of repayment (as implied by a standard arbitrage

condition between the expected repayment on defaultable debt and the return on risk-free
                                                                                            34

bonds). There are well-known theoretical problems with this setup, related to the classic

Bulow-Rogoff critique showing that the threat of exclusion may not be credible because

of the option to enter in deposit contracts with lenders, but even if the model were not

affected by these problems, recent quantitative studies show that models in the Eaton-

Gersovitz tradition support very small debt ratios of less than 10 percent of GDP (see

Arellano (2004)). This is because the models yield probabilities of default that increase

too rapidly at very low levels of debt.

        Given the above difficulties with the theory of endogenous default risk, we follow

a pragmatic approach that takes into account the same risk-neutral lender of the Eaton-

Gersovitz model but incorporates an exogenous probability of repayment calibrated to

match observed default risk premia in emerging markets. The arbitrage condition of the

risk-neutral lender implies:

                                       Rw        Rw
                            R (bt ) =        =           ,    a>0                           (7)
                                      λ (bt ) exp(−abt )


In this expression, Rw is the gross world risk-free real interest rate and λ(bt) is the

probability of repayment (i.e., 1-λ(bt) is the probability of default). The repayment

probability is modeled as an exponential probability distribution exp(-abt), where the

curvature parameter a determines the speed at which the repayment probability falls as

debt increases.

        The exponential formulation of default risk has the advantage that it is consistent

with two key properties of the endogenous default probability of the Eaton-Gersovitz line

of models: (a) the probability of default is increasing and convex on the level of debt and

(b) the probability of default is zero if the stock of debt is zero. The formulation fails to
                                                                                              35

reproduce the property of the Eaton-Gersovitz setup that the probability of default

approaches 1 for a finite “rationing” level of debt at which debtors always find it

preferable to default than to repay (the exponential probability of default approaches 1

asymptotically as debt goes to infinity). However, the formulation still allows for values

of a that yield very large risk premia for high levels of debt comparable to those observed

in the data.

        We calibrate the value of a so that the arbitrage condition in (7) holds taking as

given the EMBI+ country risk premium and the public debt ratio observed in Mexico in

1998 (the year of Mexico’s maximum debt ratio in the 1990-2002 sample). Mexico’s

debt ratio in 1998 was bt = 0.549 and the real interest rate that the country faced on this

debt, measured as the U.S. 90-day T-bill rate plus the EMBI+ spread, was R(bt) = 10.48

percent. The risk-free rate (i.e., the real U.S. 90-day T-bill rate) was Rw =3.2 percent.

Plugging these figures into (7) and solving for a yields a = 0.124. Interestingly, the

observed maximum debt and the real interest rate with default premium for Brazil in the

year 2002 are very similar to Mexico’s 1998 figures (Brazil’s debt ratio was 0.56 and the

real interest rate with default risk was 10.8 percent). This suggests that using a common

value of a for the four countries under study is not a bad first approximation.

        As we show below, default risk has two important implications for the analysis of

sustainable debt based on the MO model. First, it lowers the levels of NDLs, since the

real interest rates considered in Table 1 are lower than those resulting in the worst state of

nature with default risk. Second, it alters the dynamics of public debt, since the rate of

interest now increases with the level of debt. These two effects result in lower NDLs,

reduced levels of sustainable debt and faster convergence to states of fiscal crisis.
                                                                                                            36

         Table 2 shows the effects of introducing time-varying default risk in the

calculations of NDLs.3 In all the estimates shown in this Table, the risk free rate is set at

the 1990-2002 average of the real 90-day T-bill rate, which is 2.36 percent, and the

curvature parameter of the probability of repayments is kept at a = 0.124.

         The first panel of Table 2 shows how the benchmark estimates of NDLs change

when default risk is introduced. These benchmark estimates take the same growth rates

and minimum levels of public revenues and outlays as in the benchmark scenario of

Table 1. The resulting NDLs are significantly smaller (by 17 to 26 percentage points of

GDP) than those in the benchmark case without default risk. Note that this sharp decline

of the NDLs occurs despite the fact that the risk-free rate at 2.36 percent is about half the

long-run real interest rate used in the benchmark scenario of Table 1. The repayment

probabilities at 96 percent and the default risk premia around 4.35 percent are similar

across countries. The NDLs in this case ensure that governments would be able to repay

even during a fiscal crisis, but they still may choose to default on debt ratios about 0.33

with 4 percent probability.

         The second panel of Table 2 shows how NDLs change in the growth slowdown

scenario (which is perhaps more relevant since the data used to calibrate the risk free rate

and the repayment probability function are for the 19901-2002 period). Again, relative

to the growth slowdown scenario of Table 1, we are lowering the risk-free rate from 5 to

2.36 percent and introducing time-varying default risk. To isolate the contribution of the

latter, the third panel of Table 2 shows the NDLs obtained using the growth rates of the



3
  Note that with default risk, the constant rate of interest in the denominator of the formula for the NDL is
replaced with the interest rate including default risk defined in equation (7). Since this interest rate depends
on the level of debt, the NDL is now the solution to a non-linear equation.
                                                                                           37

growth slowdown scenario but assuming that there is no default risk so that countries can

borrow at the 2.36 percent risk free rate. Since this rate is about half the one used in

Table 1, we obtain very high NDLs (ranging from 73 to 152 percent of GDP).

       Two comparisons are interesting to make using the second and third panels of

Table 2. First, the fact that the NDLs of the growth slowdown scenario in Table 1

(ranging from 30 to 45 percent of GDP) are much smaller than those of the no-default-

risk case in panel 3 of Table 2, shows that our strategy of setting a long-run real interest

rate of 5 percent as a proxy for default risk in the estimates of Table 1 was not a bad

approximation. Second, the calculations of NDLs of the second and third panel differ

only because the second incorporates the time-varying default risk premium (i.e., both

have the same risk-free rate of 2.36 percent). Since the NDLs without time-varying

default risk are 3 to 5 times larger than those with default risk, this comparison shows

that default risk has major implications for estimates of NDLs.

       The last panel of Table 2 re-computes the required adjustments in outlays (i.e. the

values of gmin) needed to support the observed maximum debt ratios of each country in

the 1990-2002 sample as NDLs taking into account time-varying default risk. The

adjustments in outlays are significantly larger than those reported in Table 1. Measured

in standard deviations, the required adjustment in outlays exceeds the two-standard

deviation threshold for all countries and it is larger for Mexico than for the other

countries. Measured in terms of percentage points of GDP, the adjustments rank from

9.4 and 6 percentage points for Brazil and Colombia respectively to about 7 percentage

points for Costa Rica and Mexico. This ranking suggests again that the debt positions of
                                                                                             38

Brazil and Colombia are more difficult to reconcile with fiscal solvency considerations

than those of Costa Rica and Mexico.

       Figure 4 illustrates the implications of default risk for the dynamics of public debt

reflected in the measures of time to hit a fiscal crisis. The average time to hit a fiscal

crisis is generally lower once the fact that the default risk premium rises with the level of

debt is considered. Moreover, default risk produces debt dynamics that hit NDLs more

often. This can be seen in the plots for Costa Rica and Mexico. In Costa Rica’s plot, for

example, an initial debt ratio of 40 percent produced at least some stochastic simulations

in the sampling of 1000 runs in which the debt vanished when we use a fixed interest

rate. With default risk, however, all 1000 stochastic simulations eventually hit the NDL

and on average it takes about 9 years for the economy to hit a fiscal crisis.

5.     Conclusions, Caveats & Extensions

       This application of the basic version of the MO model to the cases of Brazil,

Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico shows that, with the exception of Costa Rica, public

debt ratios are already close to the natural debt limits that the governments of these

countries should respect if they wish to preserve smooth access to debt markets, and

protect the credibility of their perceived commitment to be able to repay their debts. This

is the result assuming a relatively optimistic scenario in which the growth slowdown of

the last two decades is reversed to recover the average per-capita growth rates observed

between 1961 and 2000, and the real interest rate remains at a relatively low level of 5

percent. This baseline scenario is also optimistic in that it requires credible commitments

to large cuts in government outlays which recent experience indicates are a low-

probability event (in terms of a coefficient of adjustment defined in units of standard
                                                                                               39

deviations relative to the mean of the ratio of outlays to GDP). Considering less

optimistic scenarios in which growth continues at the low trend of the last two decades or

the real interest rate increases to 8 percent, current debt ratios would exceed NDLs even

with the same tough stance to cut outlays in a state of fiscal crisis assumed in the

benchmark scenario.

       The model predicts that the long-run dynamics of the public debt ratio are

undetermined (or more precisely that there is no unique, invariant limiting distribution for

the debt output ratio). This result needs to be considered carefully. On one hand, the

result does not require very strong assumptions: stochastic revenue, relatively inflexible

outlays and some limit to debt market access (whether an NDL or some an ad-hoc debt

limit). Also, the same outcome would result if we take outlays as given and consider

instead arguments for tax smoothing as in Barro (1979). If these are the maintained

assumptions of fiscal solvency analysis, the estimates of time to a fiscal crisis and the

stochastic simulations of debt ratios shown in Figures 2-4, together with the natural debt

limits, summarize all relevant information for assessing whether observed public debt

dynamics are sustainable. In addition, we would need to worry about how this non-

stationarity property affects other statistical methods of debt sustainability analysis that

rely on the existence of a well-defined long-run distribution of debt.

       On the other hand, we may question the validity of the assumptions that led to the

result of an indeterminate long-run distribution of debt. In Mendoza and Oviedo (2004)

we propose a setup in which government chooses its outlays optimally instead of setting

ad-hoc rules. In particular, we assume that government outlays yield utility to the private

sector, with the added feature of a Stone-Geary-like utility function that sets minimum
                                                                                              40

levels of government expenditures. We preserve the spirit of the “tormented insurer’s”

problem by keeping the assumption that the government aims to maximize its

contribution to private utility given the randomness of fiscal revenue and the fact that it

can only issue non-state-contingent debt. In this setup, the government has a

precautionary-savings motive that yields a unique, invariant limiting distribution of

public debt (resulting from the trade off between the need to self-insure against the risk of

persistent revenue shocks and the desire to smooth government outlays). The role of the

NDL is made clearer because the desire to respect it emerges from the fact that otherwise

the government is exposed to the risk of experiencing states in which its outlays can be

very low, and the government is very averse to these states because of the constant-

relative-risk-aversion nature of the utility function of public expenditures.

        Most of the analysis was conducted giving a limited role to default risk (by simply

setting a long-run, time-invariant real interest rate with a premium above the risk-free

rate). This was done following the approach of the MO model to provide a forward-

looking tool to design fiscal programs with the explicit intention of preserving the

government’s ability to fulfill its financial obligations. However, default risk is an

important feature of emerging markets of sovereign debt, and hence it is worth adding it

to the analysis of debt sustainability.

        We introduced default risk by adopting an exogenous, exponential probability of

repayment that varies with the level of debt. We assumed that lenders are risk neutral

and hence are willing to take default risk by lending at a rate that incorporates the

premium that equates the expected return of risky lending with the risk-free interest rate.

The risk premium function was calibrated to match observed debt ratios and EMBI+
                                                                                             41

spreads on sovereign debt. Introducing this change into the basic version of the M-O

model produces smaller debt limits and speeds up the dynamics that lead to states of

fiscal crisis in which NDLs are reached. NDLs that completely ignore default risk

support dynamic paths of sustainable debt with much higher debt ratios than those

obtained when default risk is introduced. However, since the basic M-O model

approximated the long-run component of default risk by adding a constant premium

above the risk-free interest rate, it yields results for debt dynamics that are a much closer

approximation to those produced by the model with time-varying default risk than those

of a model that ignores default risk completely.

       The application of the MO model undertaken in this paper did not consider two

other important elements of the dynamics of public debt in emerging economies: the

endogeneity of the tax bases and fiscal policy choices and the role of financial frictions

like liability dollarization. The endogeneity of the tax bases can be incorporated into the

structure of the MO model. This requires introducing the decisions of the private sector

with regard to the variables that determine the allocations and prices that conform tax

bases (such as labor supply, consumption, the current account and capital accumulation).

Similarly, liability dollarization can be introduced by modifying the model to incorporate

tradable and nontradable goods. The dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model

studied in Mendoza and Oviedo (2004) tries to make progress in these two directions.
