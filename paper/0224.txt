           The Earnings Function: A Glimpse
                  inside the Black Box


     This paper studies the wage determination process for a

group of managerial employees in a major U.S. airline. As
would be expected, those with greater-than—average schooling,

pre—coinpany labor market experience, and company service

receive greater—than—average earnings. The analysis also
addresses the question of whether or not the managers within

a grade level who are paid more receive higher performance
ratings by their supervisors. The answer is "no" in the case
of those with more pre—coinpany labor market experience (i.e.,

those who are older) and with more company service. This sug-
gests that the salaries received by managers within a grade
reflect their age and tenure with the company more than their

present performance.

       The relationship between educational background, work experience and

earnings——"the earnings function"——has been the focus of much of the empirical

work done by labor economists during the past fifteen years.' Nevertheless,

very little attention has been devoted to a number of basic questions concerning

the impact of schooling and work history on labor market success. One particu-

larly important one is: Why do individuals with more schooling and work experi-

ence receive higher earnings than otherwise—similar individuals? This is the

question addressed in this paper, which presents relevant evidence based on an

econometric analysis of a unique set of data for the managers of a major U.S.

airline (hereafter called the Company).

      Because of the type of information collected for data files available to

the public, no one study has been able to analyze the way in which the dimensions

of schooling and work history are associated with both earnings and a nonearnings

measure of job—related performance. In the vast majority of discussions about

the earnings function, it has been assumed implicitly or explicitly that earnings

differentials   are attributable to productivity or performance differentials.
There have been, however, a few attempts at directly measuring the association
of   schooling and work history with a nonearnings measure of performance or

productivity. Some studies have used aggregate data to derive production func-

tion estimates of the impact of years of schooling on value added or value

of shipments per labor hour.2 Another has presented estimates of educational

production functions where output was defined as the change in a student's

achievement test score and the input set included the schooling background

and experience of the student's teacher.3 In addition, there is a group of

studies, done primarily by industrial psychologists, that present estimates

of the effect of educational level on an overall job performance rating (usually
                                      —2—



done by a worker's immediate supervisor).4 Nowhere in the literature, however,

does there appear to be a study providing a comparison of productivity or

performance differentials with earnings differentials among the same workers.

By offering a comparison of this nature, the present study differentiates

itself from its predecessors.

     Section I discusses the data used in isolating the relationship of each

element in vectors describing educational background and labor market experience

with both earnings and a supervisor rating of job performance. The data file

includes information on the nature of each manager's schooling (level of school-

ing, names of institutions attended, and majors) and work history (time with the

Company and time spent in jobs with specified prior employers). In addition, it

contains an evaluation of each manager's job—related performance (along a number

of dimensions).

     Section II first presents estimates of the coefficients of the schooling and

work history variables that come from fitting variants of the standard earnings

function form. These findings appear to be quite consistent with what has been

found in the large number of related studies. The section then provides job

performance and earnings regressions that are directly comparable in that each

holds constant an individual's position in the managerial hierarchy and has a

dependent variable that has been transformed into z—score units.

     Section III asks what these within management—level earnings and performance

results imply about the workings of the black box that transforms schooling and

work experience into earnings. In particular, it focuses ott the question:

Within a level of management do individuals with more schooling and work experi-

ence receive higher earnings solely because they are more productive?

I. The Data

     Like many major U.S. corporations, the airline whose managers are being

studied collects and computerizes a great deal of information about its manager-

ial employees. This section provides a detailed discussion of the collection

of these data and the manner in which they have been transformed for use in

this analysis.5

     In the fall of 1972 the Company began a program under which each of its

managers was asked to fill out a "Personal Information Questionnaire." The

cover of this questionnaire states:


          The Personal Information Questionnaire (PIQ) System is a
          corporate—wide management employee skills inventory, using
          a computer to give [the Company] quickly available data on
          the qualifications of its management employees. It will be
          used in conjunction with pertinent payroll and management
          appraisal data to select appropriate candidates for promo-
          tion and advancement.


     The questionnaire elicits information on a number of aspects of an individ-

ual's background, such as his or her: education, employment with other companies,

job skills, licenses, certificates, languages, honors and awards, and military

experience.


Educational Background. Exhibit 1 is the page from the questionnaire that

explains to respondents the information on their educational background that is

sought. There are two additional pages in the education section that give codes

for 127 potential major courses of study, which are classified by the Company

into six groups (business, engineering, life sciences, physical sciences, and

other).

     The sample used in this analysis included only those individuals who had

at least some college. The responses of these individuals were transformed

to capture the salient characteristics of their college and graduate school
                                      —4—


backgrounds. The level of schooling information was recoded as follows to

create a variable equal to the number of years of college: PIQ code 08 = 1,

codes 09 and 10 = 2, code 11 = 3 and codes 12 and 13 =   4.
     Since number of years is only one dimension of an individual's college

background, additional information from the PIQ was used to capture the

academic and social environment in which the post—secondary schooling took

place. The characteristics of the colleges and universities at which each

manager studied could be obtained since the Company's file has the name of

each institution attended. In particular, it was possible to obtain data by

college on the average amount of institution expenditures per student, the

average aptitude of the student body, and the distribution of the students'

families by income.6

     The enrollment and expenditure data were compiled from the Higher

Education General Institutional Survey conducted annually between 1966 and

1974 by the U.S. Office of Education.7 Data for the 1970, 1971 and 1972

academic years were used, since enrollment data for years preceding and fol-

lowing this period are not strictly comparable. The enrollment figures used

in the analysis were each relevant institution's estimate of its full—time

equivalent students. The expenditures data used are under the category

"Educational and General Expenditures: Total."8 The post—1970 expenditures

were deflated to 1970 dollars with the Consumer Price Index. Then, the mean

amount of expenditures per full—time equivalent student for the 1970 to 1972

period was calculated for each relevant institution.

     The average academic ability of each relevant college's undergraduates was

approximated by an estimate of the average combined verbal and math Scholastic

Aptitude Test scores of the school's 1971 entering freshmen. These estimates

(which involved some imputations) are discussed at length in Astin and Henson.9

     Data relating to the income distribution of the families of undergraduate

students were collected from the "Tripartite Application" (i.e., "Institutional

Application to Participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs"), a

standard form (#1035) of the U.S. Office of Education)0 On the 1974 applica-

tion (from which the data were obtained), each school was asked to estimate the

number of full—time and half—time undergraduates from families in the following

income ranges: $O—5,999, $6,000—8,999, $9,000—l1,000, and $12,000 and above.

Full—time and half—time students were combined for this study by multiplying

the latter by .50 to obtain the total number of full—time equivalent undergraduate

students from families in each of the four income classes.

    Any manager with at least one year of college had appended to his or her

record weighted average figures on expenditures per student, combined SAT scores

and the distribution of family income, where the weights reflected the amount of

time spent at various undergraduate institutions (for which the relevant data

were available).

     About 10% of the managers on the file had masters degrees. Two questions

concerning the years spent obtaining these degrees seemed pertinent for this

analysis: Was the individual studying business? If so, what is the academic

quality of the business school at the degree awarding institution? To capture

the nature of the graduate school background of each manager, dummy variables

were formed which indicated whether or not he or she received a masters degree,

whether or not it was in business,11 and whether or not it was from a "top 15"

business school. A "top 15" business school is one which was rated among the

best 15 in terms of academic quality by a panel of business school deans sur-

veyed by MBA magazine in 1975. The very few individuals with law or medical

school backgrounds or with doctorates were dropped from the sample, since their

assignments are most likely very different from those given to other managers.
                                      —7—


Work History.     Exhibit 2 is a photoreduction of the section from the Company's

Personal Information Questionnaire dealing with the manager's employment record

with firms other than the Company. The computer file stores data on the five

most recent employment experiences. The jobs used in the construction of vari-

ables for this study were those held by managers (before joining the Company)

after the completion of their last year of college. Because only five pre—

Company jobs were coded, it is likely that some prior work history was lost for

the very small percentage of managers who had five or more post—college pre—

Company jobs and a time gap between the last year of college and the first listed

pre—Company job. For this reason, these individuals were not included in the

sample.

     The responses coded from the pre—Company work experience part of the ques-

tionnaire were transformed to yield the following variables deemed relevant for

an analysis of the performance of managers in the airline industry: years in

airline industry prior to the Company (based on the names of the companies that

were previous employers), years in all other transportation industries prior to

the Company, and years in the military.12

     The current personnel record of each manager gives the month, day, and

year from which his or her Company service should be calculated. Hence, it was

possible to determine the number of days each individual has been permanently

attached to the Company. In addition, a variable was constructed that equals

age minus schooling (prior to joining the Company) minus Company service minus

five. Since virtually all of the managers (especially the subsample of white

males to be used in the statistical analysis) had uninterrupted employment

(including military service as employment) after completion of their schooling,

this construct closely approximates total years worked prior to being hired by

the Company.

Performance Appraisal.    A 1973 Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) survey of 139

companies (referenced as "Management Performance Appraisal Programs") indicates

that the Company's performance appraisal practices are similar in most respects

to those of many other U.S. firms. Seventy—six percent of the companies in the

BNA sample had a formal performance appraisal program for their supervisory

(first—level) employees, 72 percent had a formal program for evaluating middle

management and 49 percent had one for top management (p. 2). The factors most

commonly used in appraising managerial performance in the surveyed companies

were: "Managerial skills (e.g., knowledge and experience, ability to organize,

communication skills, etc.)" used in 81 percent of responding companies,

"Achievement of goals (completion of programs, costs, production, etc.)" used

in 77 percent, "Personal traits (attitudes, intelligence, dependability, etc.)"

used in 69 percent, "Job behavior (as related to duties specified in job

description)"   used in 66 percent, and "Potential (capacity for development and
advancement)"   used in 52 percent   (pp. 4—5).
     The two appraisal techniques most frequently employed in the BNA sample

were essay evaluations (used by 52 percent of responding companies) and rating

scales for various factors (used by 45 percent). These management reviews

were done once a year by 82 percent of the BNA respondents. They were typically

done by the manager's immediate supervisor (96 percent of the respondents) and

discussed with the manager (91 percent). The four most commonly cited uses of

the appraisal information   were: "Salary adjustments" (85   percent of the re-

sponding companies),"Promotion decisions" (64 percent), "Setting goals" (57

percent), and "Determining management development needs" (56 percent) (pp. 5—8).

     The Company calls its formal performance review for individuals at all

levels of management: "A planning, evaluation and development program." The

first page of the Reviewer's Workbook states the program's potential uses to

the reviewer:
                                     10—


     ——to help you improve the performance of your unit by providing systematic,

corrective feedback;

     ——to provide feedback to help your subordinate manager improve his or her

performance and develop his or her career potential;

     ——to assist [the Company] in identifying and utilizing management effectively

and efficiently.

     Under the Company's program, each manager is supposed to be appraised

annually (usually every twelve months from the date a job is assumed) by his

immediate supervisor. The appraisal is then discussed with the manager who

presents his own self—evaluation. During this meeting, there is discussion of

the skill and performance areas in which the reviewer feels that the manager

needs improvement. In addition, there is discussion of the manager's career

path aspirations in terms of the additional experience and training that could

(perhaps) make them realities.

     The actual formal appraisal involves rating the manager's unit achievement,

subordinate coaching, teamwork and overall performance. The Reviewer's Workbook

instructs the reviewer to:


          Record specific examples of the manager's performance over a
          twelve month period. Record and evaluate what the manager has
          accomplished. Do not think in terms of personal characteristics
          or other subjective factors. [Italics in original.]

The Unit Achievement page of the Workbook states:

          Describe the major results accomplished by the manager's unit
          during the year. Unit refers to the manager's job or area of
          responsibility. Which targets and objectives did the manager
          meet and which did he or she fail to meet? To what extent did
          his or her unit fulfill your performance expectations?

          Possible information sources are correspondence with the manager,
          record of performance in relation to goals or quotas such as
          Minority Hiring and Affirmative Action reports, the City Per-
          formance Report and budget reports, etc., and notes on specific
          instances where the manager exceeded or fell short of your
          expectations.
                                        —11—


The Subordinate Coaching page states:


           Describe significant achievements in the manager's work with
           subordinates. Has the manager developed subordinates to
           initiate tasks they think are important? Has the manager
           developed subordinates' job skills? Has the manager recog-
           nized and effectively utilized the individual skills of
           subordinates?

           Possible information sources are exit interviews, informal
           conversations, employee surveys, grievance sessions, etc.
           This section may not be applicable for managers who do not
           have the opportunity to supervise other employees.


The Teamwork page states:

           Describe significant achievement on the part of the manager
           in developing effective teamwork in the organization. What
           did the manager do to reinforce and upgrade the quality of
           teamwork in the office. Was the manager supportive of other
           units in achieving overall goals, standards, and objectives?

Finally, the Overall Evaluation page states:

           Considering the specific performance evaluations on the
           preceding pages, state below your overall evaluation of the
           manager's performance over the past 12 months. Think in
           terms of results achieved and new approaches that he or she
           used, not in terms of personal characteristics or other sub-
           jective factors.

In addition to providing specific examples, the reviewer is asked to rate the

manager on each of these four performance dimensions using an integer scale from

1 (unsatisfactory) to 6 (exceptional). After the feedback meeting, the reviewer's

ratings are sent to the personnel department to be added to the manager's com-

puterized personnel record.

     According to the Rating Category Description in the Reviewer's Workbook

(see page 15 below) a manager's performance rating is based on reasonable and

realistic standards for his job. Each manager's job has been described as of

the most recent change in its content in a "Management Description Position

Form." This form, which is filed by a job's immediate supervisor, reads as

follows:
                                      —12—


          PURPOSE OF POSITION —   Concisely summarize the basic function
     of the position.

          MAJOR DUTIES — In order of significance, list responsibilities
     and tasks which will require the major portion of the position's
     attention. Use action verbs; e.g., analyze, interpret, develop,
     recommend, etc. (Attach extra sheet if necessary).

          CONTACT RELATIONSHIPS — Indicate the primary positions inside
     or outside the company with which this position has regular contact
     and the reasons for this contact.

     Basic title of highest level subordinate: _________________________
     Number of individuals directly supervised at this level: __________
     number of individuals directly supervised, but at lower levels ____
     total number of individuals directly and indirectly supervised ____
     The information on the difficulty and importance of jobs obtained from the

Management Position Forms is used by the Company's personnel department in

assigning a grade level to each managerial assignment. The Company's Management

Policy & Procedure Manual describes this process as follows:

          The evaluation process generally includes an assessment of the
          relative importance of a position, the value of specific duties
          and responsibilities listed in the job description and relevant
          activitydata which demonstrate either or both quantity (i.e.,
          volume) or quality elements of the job.


The Company has five grade levels for its First Level Supervisor jobs and

fourteen levels for the other management jobs covered under its formal appraisal

program. Periodically the personnel department (with the approval of the Com-

pany's top executives) attaches to each grade level a salary range——a minimum

salary, a standard salary and a maximum salary. (The average within—grade

coefficient of variation for the sample members evaluated in 1976 was .11).

Where within this range a manager's salary falls is determined by his immediate

supervisor.

     The personnel record of each manager included in the sample to be analyzed

had information on his grade level at the time of his most recent performance

appraisal. Since grade levels are attached to jobs in accordance with the
                                       —13—


responsibilities, tasks arid   importance of the positions, each manager's per—
forinance rating is taken as conditional on his grade and therefore as

relative only to other individuals who are in positions that the Company's

personnel department considers comparable. Because of the procedure used to

assign grade levels to positions, the limited number of distinct managerial

functions and the large number of grade levels, it seems very unlikely that

employees within the same grade have jobs that are significantly different

from one another.

     Treating the six potential ratings for each dimension of performance at

each grade level as dichotomous variables would have substantially increased

the complexity of the analysis. For this reason, the set of 1 to 6 ratings for

each performance dimension at each grade level was transformed into a set of

unit normal (z) scores. These transformations could take place under the

assumption that the "true" unobserved distribution of each performance dimen-

sion among sample members at each grade level is normal. This assumption is

justified by first observing that each performance dimension represents the

combined effect of a large number of independent factors, and then appealing

to the central limit theorem. Under the normality assumption, it was possible

to calculate a mean z—score for sample members at each grade level with each

rating on a given performance dimension.

     To do this, within—grade level cumulative frequency distributions were

calculated for each performance dimension giving the fraction of all sample

members at each grade level evaluated in 1974, 1975 or 1976 (along the relevant

dimension) who had a rating (r.) less than or equal to each of the possible six.

Since the underlying density functions are assumed to be normal, it was possible

to use the within—grade cumulative frequency at each rating {F(r)} on a given

performance dimension, in conjunction with tables on the cumulative normal
                                         —14—


distribution and on the ordinates of the normal density function, to determine

the density {f(r.)] at the rating. With F(r.) and f(r.) the mean z—score

[(r)] between ratings r. and r.1 on a given dimension could be calculated

for each grade. It is shown in Johnson and Kotz (p. 81) that


                 çz(r)      /              =
                                                [f(r.1)   —
                                                              f(r.)]/[F(r.)   —
                                                                                  F(r.1)].
                jzf(z)dz / Jf(z)dz
                 z(r.1) I       z(r.1)
Each sample member at a given grade with a rating of r. on a given performance
dimension received the unit—normal score

     Table 1 gives the cross—grade level average relative and cumulative fre-

quencies at each r. of the most recent Overall Evaluation ratings received by

sample members appraised during the 1974 to 1976 period. For expositional

purposes, it is assumed that these are the frequencies for one grade level, say,

grade—level k. The table also gives the corresponding unit—normal density and

mean z—score for grade—level k. As can be seen from the final column, the z—

score transformation imposes a meaningful metric with which the "distance"

between two rating categories can be calibrated for sample members at grade—

level k. With this metric, someone at grade k who received an Overall Evalua-

tion that placed him in, say, rating category 4 would be given an Overall

Evaluation rating score of —.50, while someone at k placed in, say, category

5 would receive a score of .75.


Other data. In addition to the data discussed above, the Company provided

information on the earnings and demographic characteristics of each manager.

The 1974, 1975, and 1976 annual taxable remuneration (referred to below as

"earnings") received by each individual came from the Company's computerized

file of Internal Revenue Service W—4 forms. In the statistical analysis, the
                                                                           TABLE 1

earnings measure used is 1974 to 1976 average annual earnings in 1976 (CPI—

inflated) dollars.

     The data on race, sex, date of birth, and geographic location of assignment

came from each individual's "current" personnel record (i.e., his record as of

December 1976). The sample chosen for this study was limited to white male U.S.

nationals who were managers at the time of their most recent performance evalua-

tion, who were with the Company from January 1974 until December 1976, whose

educational background and pre—Company work experience met the additional sample

inclusion criteria described on pages 3 to 7, and for whom all of the requisite

data were available.13


III. Results

     This section first presents findings concerning the relationship between

schooling, work experience and earnings in the sample of managers under analysis.

These results are quite consistent with those presented in the myriad other

studies of the earnings function. It then offers results on the relationship

between schooling, work experience and within—grade level performance, which

can be compared with results concerning the determinants of within—grade level

earnings.


Earnings. The 1974 to 1976 mean annual earnings (in 1976 dollars) of managers

grouped by their graduate school backgrounds and pre—Company work experience

appear in Table 2.   These mean earnings indicate a number of interesting rela-

tionships. First, managers with masters degrees earned 14 percent more than

managers who went to work immediately after completing college. Second, managers

with masters in business earned 16 percent more than managers without masters

and about 7 percent more than managers with masters in a nonbusiness area.

Third, the few managers with masters from top 15 business schools had earnings

29 percent above those of managers without masters and 16 percent above those

managers with masters from nonelite business schools. Fourth, managers with

pre—Company experience in the military or in the nonairlines portion of the

transportation sector earned virtually the same as other managers, while those

with experience in airlines earned 3 percent more than the all management

average.

     The regressions presented in Table 3 permit comparisons of groups of

managers stratified by both educational background and work history. Regres-

sions 1 to 4 are based on a standard earnings function of the form:


           lny=c+x+,                   -




where y represents mean 1974 to 1976 annual earnings, x is a vector whose

elements represent various dimensions of educational background and work

experience,   is an error term, and        and   are the parameters to be estimated.

Regressions 5 to 8 also include sixteen grade—level dummies (two grades in-

cluded no members of the sample) and two yrar—of—eva1uation dummies. These

eighteen dummy variables, which must be included in the performance regressions

since an individual's rating is assumed to be relative to others at the same

grade—level and since a rating could be affected by the overall well—being of

the Company at the time of the evaluation, are included in earnings regressions

5 to 8 so that comparisons of the same individuals will underlie the estimates

of both within—level earnings and performance differentials. Regressions 1 to

8 also include twenty—four dummy variables which capture the state in which each

sample member works. These controls are meant to hold constant for salary differ—

entials that might reflect (among other things) geographic differentials in the

cost of living. The fact that the residual         is likely to be correlated with the

elements of x (especially within grade levels) does not create a problem for a com-

parison of the earnings and performance differentials of individuals stratified by
                                        —19—


schooling and work history, which is the focus of this study. Bias attributable

to, say, an omitted unobserved ability variable or sample selection would be

a problem only if the issue at hand was the effects of schooling and experience

on earnings and within—level performance)4

      Regression 1 in Table 3 indicates that managers within the Company who

have a masters receive earnings that are about 15 percent higher than those

received by managers without a masters who attended college for the same length

of time, have the same pre—Company work history and have been with the Company

for the same duration. Regression 2 demonstrates that managers with masters

in business earn about 10 percent more than do managers with similar backgrounds

who have received nonbusiness masters, who in turn earn about 7 percent more

than do comparable managers who did not obtain a masters after completing

college. Regression 3 implies that there is a differential of about 19 percent

in   the earnings received by individuals with a masters degree from a top 15
business school   and individuals with similar backgrounds who have a masters in

business from a nonelite institution.

      Regressions 1 to 3 also include a years of college variable. The estimated

coefficients of this variable indicate that managers with an additional year of

college earn about 2.2 percent more than do managers whose backgrounds are other-

wise similar. Regression 4 is identical to regression 1 except that it includes

variables that are meant to describe the nature of the undergraduate institutions

attended. As discussed above, these variables are: the combined SAT scores of

entering freshmen in 1971/100, the 1970 to 1972 average institutional expendi-

tures per student/l0,000, and the fraction of the relevant students' families

earning $12,000 or more in 1974. The estimated coefficients and standard errors

indicate that only the aptitude of the studentbody(ies) at the college(s)

attended is significantly associated with earnings in the group of managers
                                    —20—


under analysis. The results imply that individuals who attended colleges

where the average combined SAT score was 100 points higher (the mean [S.D.] of

this variable is 974 [115]) than at the colleges attended by individuals with

the same work history and an otherwise—similar educational background have

earnings that on average are about 2.8 percent higher.

     Regressions 1 to 4 in Table 3 include variables that equal Company service!

10 and its square!l00. The Company service coefficient estimates indicate that

real earnings grow with firm tenure at an annual rate of about 1 percent. The

Company service squared coefficient estimates, while extremely imprecise, sug-

gest that this annual rate does not diminish by a meaningful amount as one's

time with the Company grows.

     Regressions 1 to 4 also include variables describing the extent and location

of pre—Company work experience. The estimated coefficients of the "total years

worked prior to Company!lO" variable indicate that an additional year of this

construct yields about 44 percent as much earnings as does an extra year of

Company service. The estimated coefficients of the variables capturing the

location of pre—Company employment, while unfortunately too imprecise to be

the basis for firm conclusions, do suggest that years of Pre—Company employ-

ment in transportation—related industries are worth more in terms of earnings

than years of employment outside the transportation sector.

     Regressions 5 to 8 include dummy variables that place each individual at

the relevant grade level in the year of his most recent performance appraisal

and dummies that indicate the year in which he was appraised. Since much of

the return to degrees takes the form of assignments to positions with higher

grade levels attached to them, the estimated coefficients of the masters

variables in regressions 5 to 8 are substantially smaller than those in

regressions 1 to 4. Nevertheless, regression 5 indicates that even within—

grade levels, individuals with masters earn about 4.3 percent more than similar

individuals without them. This implies that about 29 percent of the earnings

differential associated with a masters degree occurs within the seventeen grade

levels.

     The estimated coefficients of the Company service variable in regressions

5 to 8 are from 40 to 51 percent of what they were in regressions 1 to 4.

Hence, even within jobs classified by the Company as being the same, real

earnings grow with Company service at an annual rate of slightly more than

.4 percent, which does not appear to diminish meaningfully with additional

service. The "age minus schooling minus Company service minus five" construct

has statistically significant estimated coefficients in the ln earnings regres-

sions controlling for grade level that are from 44 to 59 percent as large as in

the regressions which did not control for position in the managerial hierarchy.

     Table 4 presents the results of the overall evaluation rating regressions.

These regressions include grade—level and year of evaluation dummies because

of the nature of the performance rating process. If the estimated coefficient

of x in a Table 4 regression is, say, .5, then all else the same, an additional

unit of x. is associated with performance .5 z—score units above the relevant
          1

grade—level sample average (not 50 percent above average). Thus, having an

additional unit of x. places an average member of the sample under analysis at

the F(.5)l00    69th percentile of the performance distribution of sample

members in the same grade level instead of at the F(0).l00 =   50th   percentile.

     The estimated masters coefficients in regressions 1 and 4, while very

imprecise, suggest that individuals with masters degrees outperform by a very

small amount individuals without them, who are in the same grade level and have

the same work history. Regressions 2 and 3 indicate with little precision that

managers with masters from nonelite business schools perform slightly better on

their jobs than do managers with the same work history who did not obtain a

masters, obtained a nonbusiness masters, or a masters from a top 15 business

school.

     In the Table 4 regressions, the "age minus schooling minus Company service

minus five" or "total years worked prior to Company" construct has a statisti-

cally significant negative estimated coefficient. In addition, within—grade

level performance appears to decrease with Company service although this

finding is not significant.

     To test the sensitivity of these results concerning the relationship

between educational background, work history, and within—grade level managerial

performance to the assumption that the underlying performance distribution

among sample members at each grade is normal, it was assumed instead that the

underlying distribution is uniform (a very nonnorinal distribution). Under the

uniform distribution individuals at a given grade level placed in performance

evaluation category r. were given a cardinal score equal to the within—grade

cumulative frequency at r.1 plus one—half the amount by which the within—grade

cumulative frequency at r. exceeds the within—grade cumulative frequency at r.1.

Reestimation of the Table 4 regressions using this construct instead of the mean

z—score did not significantly alter any of the conclusions drawn above.

    As stated earlier, each manager receives a rating along specific dimensions

of performance (Unit Achievement, Subordinate Coaching (if applicable), and

Teamwork) in addition to receiving an Overall Evaluation, which was the basis

of the preceding analysis. The results of regressions in which the dependent

variables were ratings in z—score units along the specific dimensions of per-

formance are presented in Table 5. As was the case with the Overall Evaluation

ratings, the strongest predictor of the dimensions of performance is the "total

years worked prior to Company" or "age minus schooling minus Company service

minus five" variable, which has a statistically significant negative effect on

each dimension.

     To ascertain whether the apparent divergences between the within—grade

level performance and earnings differentials associated with some of the

variables of interest are statistically significant, earnings and performance

must be in comparable units, so that the estimated coefficients of the rele-

vant variables in earnings, and performance equations can be compared. To do

this, the natural logarithm of the earnings of each individual at a given grade

level was transformed into z—score units in a manner which made these scores

comparable to those calculated for the limited number of possible Overall

Evaluation ratings (the ri). This was done by determining the in earnings

(E(r.)) at the cumulative frequency of the ln earnings distribution correspond-

ing to the cumulative frequency of the appropriate Overall Evaluation distri-

bution at each r.,.   Sample members with ln earnings between E(r.) and E(r.1)

were given the unit—normal score (r), whose derivation was discussed on pp.

13—15 above. A regression of the same form as number 5 in Table 3 was fit with

the ln earnings z—score as the dependent variable. The estimated coefficients

(standard errors) in this regression (which also included 16 grade—level, 2

year—of—evaluation and 24 state dummies) were: Masters degree .324(.137), Years

of college .O16(.038), Company experience/iO .528(.l94), Company experience

squared/lOO —.O6O(.053), Total years worked prior to Company/iO .208(.079),

Years worked in airlines prior to Company/b .258(.470), Years worked in trans-

portation excluding airlines piror to Company/1O .673(.562) and Years in military!

10 —.082(.284).

     The first step in testing whether an estimated coefficient or group of

coefficients was statistically different in this earnings regression from

what it was in performance rating regression 1 in Table 4 involved fitting a

model (with the Time Series Processor's (TSP's) LSQ procedure) under which

the relevant estimated coefficients in the two equations were constrained to

be equal. This is equivalent to constraining a (set of) variable(s) to on
                                      —27—


average move an individual the same distance from the sample means of the

relevant within—management level performance and earnings distributions. The

second step involved doing a likelihood ratio (LR) test of whether the restric-

tion(s) is (are) rejected.

     This two—step procedure yields the following conclusions:

     1. The restriction that the estimated masters coefficient be the same

     in the performance and earnings regressions cannot be rejected at a

     conventional level of statistical significance (LR =   1.40).
     2. The restriction that the estimated coefficient of the Company

     service variable be the same is rejected at about the .01 level of

     significance (LR =      6.58).
     3. The restrictions that the estimated coefficients of Company service

     and its square be the same are rejected at the .005 level (LR =   75.28).
     4. The restriction that the estimated coefficient of the "Total years

    worked prior to the Company" or "age minus schooling minus Company

     service minus five" construct be the same is rejected at the .005 level

     (LR =   27.48).
     5. The restrictions that the estimated coefficients of the two schooling

     and six work experience variables be the same are rejected at the .005

     level (LR =   94.24).

V.   Implications



      The within—grade level divergence between the earnings and performance

differentials of workers with different amounts of "human capital" might not be

easily swallowed by those who believe that individuals with more work experience

and schooling receive higher earnings solely because they have more productive

capacity. One way of attacking the result is to argue that the performance

ratings used in the analysis are not valid indicators of productivity, primarily

because   of their "subjective" nature. While "objective" measures of managerial
performance would be most valuable, it is important to remember that (as can be
seen on page 10 above) the Company's Reviewer Workbook instructs the reviewer
to focus on "what the manager has accomplished" and to "not think in terms of
personal characteristics or other subjective factors" (italics in original).
In particular, the reviewer is supposed to base his assessment on "objective"
factors   like city performance reports, budget reports, exit interviews,

employee surveys, and grievance sessions. Thus, while the appraisals of

managerial performance are done by supervisors, and in this sense are subjec-

tive, they are at least supposed to be based on "objective" variables that

clearly belong in an index of managerial productivity.

      A second attack on the apparent divergence might run as follows: even

though the within grade—level human capital earnings differential cannot be

explained by a within—grade level performance differential, most of the total

earnings differential is between grade levels and can be explained solely by the

fact that individuals with more human capital have more productive capacity than

those. with less. While the glimpse under discussion most certainly takes place

only within grade levels, it should be pointed out again that about 29 percent of

the total estimated earnings differential associated with a masters, 44 to 59

percent of the differential associated with an additional year of the "age minus
                                     —29—


schooling minus Company service minus five" construct, and 40 to 51 percent of

the differential associated with an additional year of Company service occurs

within grades. It would seem that these percentages are much too large to be

dismissed as unimportant. Furthermore, it would seem that direct evidence on

how staffing decisions are made is needed to justify the claim that the between—

grade level earnings differentials between those with different amounts of work

experience, and schooling solely reflect differentials in productive capacity.

     Assuming that the performance ratings do reflect performance differentials

and that the fraction of total earnings differentials occurring within grades

is nontrivial, the comparisons of within—grade earnings and performance differ-

entials presented above yield a number of puzzles for theories of wage determina-

 tion that ignore labor market institutions. The first involves the within—

grade level relationship between Company experience, performance and earnings.

The ragressions presented above indicate that while earnings increase (in

real terms) with each year of Company service by a nontrivial amount within—

grade levels, job performance does not. To understand this finding it is important

to realize that while management employees do not usually get pay increases that

are labeled "service" increases their "merit" increases do not depend only on

performance. As Sayles and Strauss (p. 379) write in the recent revision of

their text on personnel administration, "most executives will receive an increase

at least approximating the change in the cost of living since the previous

review," which, as the BNA survey discussed on p. 9 above indicated, will most

likely have been done one year earlier. The fact that "most" executives get

relatively automatic annual increases in their real earnings, in conjunction

with the result that within—level management performance does not appear to

increase with Company service, make it difficult to argue convincingly that

the within—level relationship between Company service and real earnings is due

to the growth of employee productivity over time.
                                       —30—


        It is much more likely that management employees and the Company enter

into an implicit contract under which each managerT s real earnings will grow

annually by at least a minimal amount regardless of the growth in his produc-

tivity. While the Company could increase its short—run profits by violating

this contract, its reputation as a trustworthy employer would most likely

suffer, causing its long—run labor costs to rise and its long—run profits to

fall.

        A second, but related, puzzling finding for a theory of wages not grounded

in institutional reality involves the within—grade earnings and performance

differentials associated with the "age minus schooling minus Company service

minus five" or tipre_Company experience" variable. The fact that an additional

year of this construct is associated with higher earnings within levels of

management is consistent with the claim that there is a very general productive

skill produced, sold and used by all firms. However, this interpretation is

completely at odds with the fact that individuals with more "pre—Company

experience" and, hence, more of this skill perform significantly worse within

levels of management than comparable individuals with less. The opposite

signs of the statistically significant estimated coefficients of the "age minus

schooling minus Company service minus five" variable in the performance and

earnings equations reflect the difficulty of trying to untangle this variable

from age, the real earnings growth that occurs almost automatically for most

employees with the passage of time, and the fact that a key determinant of the

salary of a newly hired manager coming from another firm is the individual's

salary on his or her last job.

    Unlike the comparisons involving Company service and "age minus schooling

minus Company service minus five," the within—grade level earnings differential

associated with a masters degree does not appear to diverge significantly or
                                    —31—


substantially from the within—grade differential in performance. The ratio of

the estimated coefficients of the masters variable in the unit—normal performance

and earnings regressions presented above indicates with little precision that

about 37 percent of the within—grade level masters—nonmasters earnings differ-

ential can be explained by a performance differential. This implies that the

unexplained within—grade level earnings differential is ((1— .37)4.3 ) 2.7

percent, a small number with a large standard error. However, it should be

pointed out that neither this study nor any other has presented direct evidence

on the extent to which differences in productive capacity are likely to explain

the 71 percent of the total earnings differential attributable to the way in

which those with and without masters are assigned to different positions.

     As its title indicates, this econometric case study is only a glimpse and

thus obviously cannot come close to giving a full picture of what lies inside

the black box called the earnings function. Nevertheless, the study has found

a number of anomalies for an interpretation of this relationship which explains

earnings differentials solely in terms of productivity differentials. While

these findings may be the exception to the rule, it would seem that this should

be demonstrated and not just asserted. As more studies like the present one

are undertaken and as some direct evidence on why individuals with different

characteristics are assigned to different jobs is obtained, it will become

possible to determine what is and what is not an aberration and, thus, what

really lies behind the statistical phenomenon called the earnings function.

11The Company's aggregate category "business" includes the following subjects:

 accounting, advertising, air transportation, banking, business administration,

 commerce, economics, finance, foreign trade, industrial management, journalism,

 marketing, personnel administration, statistics, and transportation. Because

  it is not possible to differentiate MBA's from other masters degrees or dif-

  ferentiate business schools from universities at which they are located, it

 is possible that an individual with a masters degree in "business" as defined

 by the Company   did   not attend what is normally referred to as a "business

  school." In the discussion below, it will be assumed that a business masters

 degree was received at a "business school."


12Because each of the major    branches   of the military has an air corps and because

  only some of the respondents gave a description of what they were doing within

  a branch, the years military variable could not be very cleanly split into

  years in air— and nonair—related military variables.


13The few employees in the Company's special category "Flight Operations Manage-

 ment" were excluded from the sample analyzed since these individuals were

  pilots who maintained their union membership with the Airline Pilots Associa-

  tion (and sometimes served on flights) and, unlike all other "management," had

  earnings that were contractually determined.
