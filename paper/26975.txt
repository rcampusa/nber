Relief Rally: Senators As Feckless As the Rest of Us at Stock Picking
William Belmont, Bruce Sacerdote, Ranjan Sehgal, and Ian Van Hoek
NBER Working Paper No. 26975
April 2020
JEL No. G0,G12,G18

                                            ABSTRACT

We examine the stock trading behavior and returns of U.S. senators from 2012-March 2020. Stocks
purchased by senators on average slightly underperform stocks in the same industry and size (market
cap) categories by 11 basis points, 28 basis points and 17 basis points at the 1, 3, and 6-month time
horizons. Stocks sold by senators underperform slightly for the first three months and then outperform
slightly (a statistically insignificant 14 basis points) at the one year mark. We find no evidence that
senators have industry specific stock picking ability related to their committee assignments. Neither
Republican nor Democratic senators are skilled at picking stocks to buy, while stocks sold by Republican
senators underperform by 50 basis points over three months. Stocks sold following the January 24th
COVID-19 briefing do underperform the market by a statistically significant 9 percent while stocks
purchased during this period underperform by 3 percent. Our findings contrast somewhat with recent
news reports and studies of pre-STOCK Act (2012) returns, though are consistent with Eggers and
Hainmueller (2013).

           In April of 2012, the United States Congress passed the Stop Trading on Congressional

Knowledge Act (STOCK Act, "the Act") which prohibits members of Congress and their staff

from leveraging non-public information to make investment decisions. The Act also requires the

President, Vice President, and all members of their staff to report any trades that exceed $1,000

within 45 days of the transaction. The Act made it clear for the first time that the laws against

insider trading also apply to members of Congress and their staff. This prevents them from

leveraging information gleaned from their official capacities as market regulators. The Act also

established additional public disclosure requirements for security trading activities of members

of Congress in order to help monitor their compliance with the new insider trading laws. The Act

was celebrated with great fanfare during its signing ceremony and was seen as a pivotal step in

addressing public skepticism about an unequal system. As President Obama put it, the STOCK

Act was meant to address a "deficit of trust" between the American people and their lawmakers.

           A year after the STOCK Act was passed, the bill was quietly amended, reversing major

pieces of the law. Fast-tracked using a process known as unanimous consent, the amendment

repealed the mandate for congressional aides and staffers to disclose their trading activities

online (Lowder and Cowan 2013). Senators and congressmen/congresswomen now have the

option to disclose their trades through an electronic system or through paper filings. For

members of Congress, these trades are now available on two websites (one for the House and

one for the Senate). 1 Disclosures by congressional staffers are not made available by website.

           Recently, the STOCK Act again made headlines when at least four senators avoided large

losses by selling ahead of the COVID-19 stock market crash. 2 The selling took place after a

January 24 briefing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on the

severity of the coming COVID-19 related health crisis 3. Commentators have suggested that

senators frequently use their private information both to aid in stock selection and market timing.

We do not find evidence that senators are successful stock pickers. Our tests for market timing

(not reported here) are not particularly well powered, but we do not find evidence of market

timing either; upweighting (downweighting) stock holdings in months when senators are buying

(selling) leads to lower returns than a simple buy and hold strategy.

          Existing research has demonstrated that prior to the passage of the STOCK Act,

portfolios that mimic senators outperform the market by approximately 12 percent annually,

(Ziobrowski, Cheng, Boyd, and Ziobrowski 2004) and investments by members of the U.S.

House of Representatives outperform the market by approximately 6 percent annually

(Ziobrowski, Boyd, Cheng, and Ziobrowski 2011). The literature supports the hypothesis that

prior to the passage of the STOCK Act, members of Congress were leveraging their privileged

positions in order to achieve superior financial returns. Other research finds that senators achieve

positive abnormal returns by avoiding annualized losses from sold stocks of 5.4 percent (Cherry,

Heitz, and Jens 2017). Analyzing the executive branch, Acemoglu et. al finds that companies

with a prior connection to Timothy Geithner experienced abnormal returns of 6 and 12 percent

after 1 and 12 full days of trading, which may be due to the perceived benefit of personal

connections in times of financial crisis.

          However, more recent literature finds no evidence of a congressional trading advantage

in the years 2004-2008 (Eggers and Hainmueller, 2013). By reconstructing actual portfolios of

congressmen, Eggers and Hainmueller find that the average portfolio underperformed a passive

portfolio by 2-3 percent per year. It is possible that the publication of Ziobrowski, Boyd, Cheng,
3
    There were numerous other related Senate briefings in Feburary.

                                                     3
and Ziobrowski's research in 2004 curbed congressional trading on privileged information.

Eggers and Hainmueller also note that the reported 12 percent outperformance of senators in the

earlier work represents only the excess return of a specific trade weighting criteria. Other

possible weighting approaches do not yield economically or statistically significant results. In

further research, Eggers and Hainmueller find that politicians tend to hold stocks in campaign

contributors and local firms that tend to outperform; their other investments are responsible for

their overall underperformance (Eggers and Hainmueller, 2014). Akey finds that when

comparing firms who donate to winning and losing congressmen, firms donating to the former

experience abnormal equity returns 3 percent higher than the those who donate to the

unsuccessful candidate. These findings support the hypothesis that firms with political

connections outperform, but does not support the hypothesis that congresspeople are otherwise

skilled stock pickers.

       Other research reaffirms that congressional ownership is linked to greater future business

performance. Huang and Xuan (2019) find that companies with members of Congress as

shareholders earn Carhart alphas of 9.5 percent per year and were more likely to be acquired or

report earnings and revenue surprises. Companies owned by congresspeople are more likely to

receive government grants and contracts (Tahoun 2014). Research post STOCK Act shows that

in the three years leading up to 2012, senators' financial transactions spiked, with a maximum

transaction value of $1,495,559,000 across 7,582 transactions in 2010 (Holman 2017). In 2015,

three years after the passage of the STOCK Act, there was a maximum transaction value of

$337,480,000 across 2,475 transactions, demonstrating a 77 percent reduction in the nominal

value of senators' trades and a 67 percent reduction in the number of transactions made by

senators (Holman 2017). The evidence points to a twofold conclusion: First, the STOCK Act



                                               4
significantly reduced the amount of financial activity in the Senate. Second, prior to passing the

Act, senators were inclined to make many high-nominal value trades. Since passing the Act,

there have been calls to further tighten the regulations on legislators' trading rights (Nagy, 2013).

Legislators' financial holdings could likely influence their voting decisions.

       Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2013) find that votes from senators with significant holdings

in a particular industry are predictive of future returns. They first determine whether a senator

has a vested interest in a given industry based on the amount of economic activity from that

industry in her state. They then label each bill as favorable or not for an industry given the

voting of interested senators. Constructing a portfolio which is long firms in industries in which

favorable bills have passed and short firms in industries in which unfavorable bills have passed

yields four factor alpha's of 92 basis points per month.

       Our paper examines the buy and hold abnormal returns of senators' picks from 2012-

March of 2020. Senators' purchases underperform the industry-size benchmark at the one

month, three month, and six month horizons by 11 bps, 28 bps and 17 bps respectively, but only

the six month horizon impact is statistically significant. Stocks sold by senators also show little

evidence of stock picking ability underperforming the industry size benchmark insignificantly at

the six month level and outperforming insignificantly (14 bps) at the one year level. We confirm

these results using four other benchmarks consisting of the CRSP Value Weighted index, the

Daniels Greenblatt Titman Wermers (DGTW) portfolios, the Fama-French three factor model,

and the Carhart four factor model. We also construct calendar time portfolios and find similar

results. We do not find evidence that Senate committee assignments lead to stock picking or

industry picking skills within industries that are related to the committee assignment or under the

committee's purview.

                                   I.    Data and Methodology
A. Sample Construction

        The STOCK Act requires all members of Congress and those running for Congress to

publicly disclose their trades of $1,000 or more online within 45 days from the transaction date.

Using    the    United    States    Senate's    Electronic    Financial    Disclosures     database

(efdsearch.senate.gov/) we hand-collect senators' financial transactions, logging each trade's

transaction date, security, and nominal value. We include reports that stem from both electronic

and paper filings. Both types of filings are known collectively as "periodic transaction reports."

        We include all periodic transaction reports of both current and former senators, resulting

in 1,861 periodic transaction reports. Each periodic transaction report discloses all financial

transactions made by the senator, their spouse, or any of their dependent children over the last 45

days. The reported transactions span all classes of securities, public and private, including

exchanges of public equities, options, bonds, private bonds, municipal bonds, mutual fund

stakes, and hedge fund stakes. We record all transactions of publicly listed securities including

stocks, over-the-counter stocks, stock options, bonds, index funds, and mutual funds, but exclude

private and non-publicly listed securities. This paper limits the sample to publicly listed stocks

for which returns are available in the CRSP database.

        Table 1 shows a frequency tabulation of number of trades by year, buy versus sell, and

electronic versus paper filing. These are only the trades for publicly listed common stock for

which we can obtain return information on CRSP. Most years have between 400 and 700 buy

trades and a similar number of sell trades. 2014 is notable for an unusual amount of trading

activity and we are still looking for explanations for this phenomenon. Overall we have 4378



                                                 6
buys and 3881 sells. Electronic filing is rarely used in the first two years of the program (2012-

2013) but becomes common thereafter.

       The nominal value of each trade is reported in one of 11 buckets, each capturing a range

of possible weights for the transaction. Specifically, these buckets are: 1) $1,001 to $15,000; 2)

$15,001 to $50,000; 3) $50,001 to $100,000; 4) $100,001 to $250,000; 5) $250,001 to $500,000;

6) $500,001 to $1,000,000; 7) "Over $1,000,000"; 8) $1,000,001 to $5,000,000; 9) $5,000,001 to

$25,000,000; 10) $25,000,001 to $50,000,000; and 11) "Over $50,000,000."

       We combine (add together) transactions from the same senator on the same date in the

same security. In adding, we assume that the transaction is at the low end of the range of the

above buckets. Due to the small number of very large trades, we consolidate the combined trades

into 5 buckets representing trades of $1000-$9999, $10k-49k, 50k-99k, 100k-249k, 250k plus.

We use these categories in calculating weighted returns. This methodology downweighs a

handful of multi-million dollar trades but does not alter our main conclusions.



       Measuring Buy and Hold Abnormal Returns

       We report results for buy and hold abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns over

various time periods. Buy and hold abnormal returns (BHARS) are calculated by compounding

daily returns on the stock and subtracting compounded daily returns on one of three benchmarks:

the CRSP Value Weighted Index, an industry size matched portfolio, and the Daniels Greenblatt

Titman and Wermers size-value-momentum matched portfolio.             The industry-size matched

portfolio matches firms by four digit SIC codes and five quintiles of NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ

market cap using the market cap six months before the event. For the purposes of compounding,

if a stock disappears from the CRSP data set for a given day, we replace its return with the return



                                                7
on the benchmark. This has the effect of assuming that any money remaining in that position is

reinvested in the benchmark if a stock disappears.

         Our Cumulative Abnormal Returns takes a slightly different approach. We use the

Wharton Research Data Services' (wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) U.S. Daily Event Study tool

to measure daily abnormal returns for each reported stock. The Event Study tool calculates factor

loadings for each stock using pre-event window data and provides a daily abnormal return

relative to either the Fama French three factor or Carhart four factor model. We then calculate

(compound) cumulative abnormal returns from the daily abnormal returns. We set the period to

calculate factor loadings at 200 days before our event windows of -100 to +255 days.

         Our concern with this approach is that in modest sized estimation periods, many stocks

have large positive or negative loadings on the Fama French factors which can lead to volatility

when calculating the stock's abnormal returns relative to its FF Benchmark Portfolio.

Specifically, some stocks end up with six-month cumulative abnormal returns of -230 percent or

lower.

                                           II. Results

         A.     Mean Buy and Hold Abnormal Returns

         We show returns both graphically and in tables. Figures 1a-1c show the evolution of buy

and hold abnormal returns over time. Figure 1a is for all trades while Figures 1b and 1c are for

electronically reported and paper reported trades. We graph results for buy and hold returns

relative to the industry-size benchmark which serves as our baseline calculation. Figure 1a

shows that over the 6 month time horizon both stocks bought and stocks sold underperform

slightly by about 30 basis points. During the second six-months this reverses bringing the




                                                8
purchases to modest outperformance and the sales to 0 outperformance. Abnormal returns are

statistically insignificant throughout most of the event window.

       Figures 1b and 1c show comparable graphs separated by electronically reported and

paper reported trades. Electronically reported purchases have some tendency to outperform

during the second six months of the period.

       Table 2 reports our main results for our five methods of calculating buy and hold

abnormal returns or cumulative abnormal returns. Each cell reports the mean return, the standard

error and the associated t-statistic. We report returns at the 1,3,6 and 12 month time horizons.

       Table 2a is for all purchases. Generally we find very little evidence for outperformance of

stocks purchased. Using the CRSP value weighted index as the benchmark (row 1), stocks

bought underperform by about 30 basis points at the three, six, and twelve month horizons, but

only the three month effect is statistically significant. Switching to industry-size portfolios as the

benchmark does not change this conclusion. One anomalous finding is that when we use the

Fama French model, stocks purchased outperform at the one year level. This appears to be due

in part to a few unusually high negative factor loadings (for specific stocks) in the Fama French.

The finding goes away when we use the Carhart model.

       Table 2b shows results for all sales. In the first row which uses the market as the

benchmark, stocks sold appear to underperform slightly at all time horizons. However, this

result may be in part due to the smaller size and negative momentum of stocks that senators tend

to trade. When we use industry-size portfolios, DGTW portfolios, or Carhart cumulative

abnormal returns, the finding of underperformance goes away.

       Tables 2c (purchases) and 2d (sales) repeat the analysis but split the sample by electronic

versus paper reporting of the trade. Our hypothesis was that senators would use the more arcane



                                                  9
paper reporting for trades where they wish to minimize scrutiny. We expected paper trades to

outperform electronic trades. Tables 2c and 2d do not support this hypothesis. Abnormal returns

are very modest whether we look at paper or electronic purchases. One mild exception is that

electronically reported buys outperform by 83 bps at the one year level (using industry size

adjustment). This result goes the "wrong way" from our hypothesis. We have a similar finding

for sales in Table 2d. Using industry-size adjustment, stocks sold underperform modestly in

cases of electronic reporting. This amounts to about 50-60 basis points whether we look at the

one, three, or six month level.

       Table 5 tests the electronic-paper reporting difference more formally using OLS. The

industry-size adjusted BHAR is the dependent variable. We include dummies for purchase,

electronically filed, and purchase*electronically filed. Paper sales are the omitted category.

Table 5 confirms what we saw in Table 2d. Electronically reported sales (the coefficient in row

2) have statistically significantly lower returns than paper reported sales.        This difference

increases when we weight by the value of the trade in columns 2, 4, and 6.

       Table 3 examines industry-size adjusted buy and hold abnormal returns (BHAR) by size

of trade. Table 3a is for purchases and Table 3b is for sales. If senators are skilled stock pickers,

we would expect the larger buy trades to have more significant outperformance. We find the

opposite. The largest two categories of trades (those that are $100k - $249k or $250k plus) have

meaningful underperformance. For example, at the six month time horizon, the second largest

category of purchases underperforms by 2.4% and the largest category underperforms by 3.9%.

       Table 3b looks at performance of stocks sold by trade size. The most notable effect is at

the three month level where the largest sales (those $250k or greater in size) underperform by




                                                 10
2.9%. However, throughout the rest of the table there does not appear to be much of a pattern in

which stocks sold perform poorly after the sale.

       In summary, we find no evidence that the stocks purchased outperform; these stocks

slightly underperform. On average, stocks underperform slightly after a sale. However, this is

only driven by electronically reported sales which underperform in some models by about 50 bps

at the six month level; the effect goes away at the one year level.




       B.      Impact of Committee Membership

       We now look for evidence that senators' stock picks perform differentially well or poorly

based on Senate Committee membership and specifically the interaction between committee

assignment and the industry of the company. For example, do senators assigned to the Energy

and Natural Resources Committee perform particularly well when trading drilling companies

(SIC code 1381) or natural gas extraction companies (SIC code 1311)? We match Senate

committees to SIC codes and trades as shown in Appendix Table 2. Here we show the number

of trades by SIC code cross tabbed with the trading senator's committee. Only 6.5 percent of

trades feature a match between company industry and committee membership. We consider all

of the committees on which a senator serves during the calendar year of the stock trade.

       Our results are shown in Table 4. We regress industry size adjusted returns on a dummy

for a match between the company industry and the senator's committees. Panel A reports

unweighted regressions and Panel B weights by amount of the trade. For the unweighted results,

not much is going on. Having the committee match (senator to industry) results in insignificantly



                                                 11
higher buy and hold returns for stocks purchased. "Committee Match" increases six month buy

and hold returns for purchases by a statistically insignificant 56 basis points. There is a slight

positive and insignificant relationship between "Committee Match" and the subsequent

performance of stocks that are sold.

       The weighted regressions are slightly more interesting. For purchases, Committee Match

remains positively associated with one year buy and hold returns though only the one month

effect is significant (at the 10 percent level).      However, Committee Match is now also

significantly negatively associated with the one year returns for stocks that are sold. Such stocks

underperform by 5.7 percent over the year following the sale (adding the constant and the

Committee Match effect). This does appear to be evidence in favor of informed stock trading and

avoidance of losses. However, this finding is tempered by the fact that we are relying on a small

sample of 240 sells (and 300 buys) in which the Committee matches the industry and we are

conducting 24 separate tests within Table 4.



               B.      Calendar Time Portfolio Returns

       We now turn to calendar time returns on portfolios of the stocks selected by senators.

For each day we construct a portfolio of stocks bought (sold) by a senator in the past year. We

weight by the size of the trade. This daily rebalancing is not terribly realistic but is the simplest

approach given that we are already working with daily data and we have the precise day on

which the trade was made. In the portfolio approach we control for the contemporaneous returns

to Fama French factors and thereby examine systematic risk that senators may be taking.

       Results are shown in Table 6. The first two columns are for purchases and the second

two for sales. Columns 1 and 3 use the Fama French three factor model while columns 2 and 4



                                                 12
add the Carhart momentum factor. Interestingly, the market beta for both the purchase and sale

portfolios is close to one. Senators exhibit a modest tilt towards value and small stocks. Stocks

bought and sold by senators have negative loading on momentum. We noticed this in the raw

data-- stocks bought by senators tend to underperform for the 100 days prior to the purchase.

          The daily alphas on both the buy and sell portfolios are statistically insignificant. The

Carhart alpha for the purchases is -.35 basis points. Cumulated over six months this equates to -

44 basis points which is similar to the results from Table 2. Carhart alpha for the sales is positive

.14 basis points which suggests that stocks sold outperform by 18 basis points over a six-month

period.

          In Table 7 we stratify by returns for Republicans versus Democrats. We run OLS

regressions. The outcome is the industry size adjusted return at the one, three, six and twelve

month horizons. To emphasize the mean returns for each category relative to 0 (rather than

relative to an omitted category), we depart from standard practice and use four non-overlapping

(mutually exclusive) categorical variables: buys or sells for Republicans or Democrats. We

include trades from independent Senator Angus King with the Democrats. The patterns of the

coefficients are not particularly striking. The data suggest that Democrats may have some slight

skill in picking stocks to buy while Republicans are skilled at picking stocks to sell. However,

this conclusion is tempered by the fact that Republican purchases underperform by as much as

Republican sales. A more accurate description of the results is that, on an industry-size adjusted

basis, Republicans pick stocks that do somewhat poorly when bought and even after when sold.



                 B.     Recent Returns and The January 24th Briefing




                                                 13
       As noted above, recent stock sales timed with the COVID-19 crisis have attracted

significant media attention. In particular four senators are likely to be investigated for sales they

made following a January 24th briefing of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee.

We compile all trades since Dec 1 2019 and examine average returns from the time of the trade

to March 27, 2020. We allow the holding period time to vary. In Table 8A we report the

holding period returns on recent buys and sells both before and after the January 24th briefing.

The bottom row shows average returns. After the briefing there were 121 sales versus 61 buys.

These sales underperformed the purchases by a statistically significant -9.4 percent.

        In Table 8B we report market adjusted returns. Here the market adjustment compensates

for the different lengths of the holding periods. Sales post-briefing underperform the market by

9.2 percentage points and purchases underperform by 3.6 percentage points. In unreported tests

we find that this underperformance is statistically significant.



                                              III. Conclusion
       Using a novel dataset of the financial transactions of United States senators, we calculate

short and medium run buy and hold abnormal returns for the publicly-listed securities that

senators buy and sell. Perhaps not surprisingly, we find only limited evidence that senators

display stock picking prowess. The average stock purchased slightly underperforms the market at

the one and three month level. This remains true even after adjusting for the Carhart four factor

model. Stocks sold also underperform the market on average by roughly 30 basis points in the 1

and 3 months following the sale. Senators' committee assignments do not correlate with excess

returns to their trades in related industries. Use of paper filings (relative to electronic) is not

correlated with abnormal returns in the way we expected. Buys filed in paper or electronic form

have similar returns. Sales filed electronically have slight negative abnormal returns while sales

                                                 14
filed by paper have insignificant positive abnormal returns. There is some modest evidence that

the most recent trading showed both a market timing and a stock picking component; sales

outnumbered buys by 2:1 and the stocks sold underperformed the market by 9 percent.

                 Table 2c: Estimation Table Electronic and Paper Purchases
          We calculate abnormal returns to all stocks purchased by Senators over 1,3,6,12 month time periods. We
          divide the sample by trades reported electronically versus on paper. Returns are from the day of the trade.
          Abnormal returns are calculated 5 different ways. In the first three rows we calculate the stocks buy and hold
          return relative to 1) the CRSP Value weighted index, 2) an industry-size benchmark using 4 digit SIC and
          quintiles of lagged 6 month market cap, 3) the DGTW benchmark using quintiles of momentum*size*book-
          market. In the final two rows we cumulate abnormal daily returns using the Fama French and Carhart
          models. We use the WRDS event tool to calculate factor loadings using pre-event window data.

We calculate buy and hold abnormal returns (relative to the industry-size matched portfolio) for all purchases.
We report by the dollar amount of the trade listed on the report (which uses eight coarse categories for dollar
value of trade which we consolidate)

We stratify by whether the trade was reported electronically or on paper. Buy and hold returns on the stock
are cumulated using daily data. We subtract the buy and hold return on the CRSP value weighted index to
arrive at buy and hold abnormal returns. 2A is for all purchase. 2B all sales. 2C: purchases reported on
paper records. 2D: sales reported on paper records. 2E and 2F are for purchases and sales reported on
electronic records. Each cell shows mean returns (unweighted), standard error of the mean, t-statistic.

arrive at buy and hold abnormal returns. 2A is for all purchase. 2B all sales. 2C: purchases reported on
paper records. 2D: sales reported on paper records. 2E and 2F are for purchases and sales reported on
electronic records. Each cell shows mean returns (unweighted), standard error of the mean, t-statistic.

           Table 4: Buy and Hold Abnormal Returns By Whether Senator is On A
              Committee That Has Direct Oversight for Companies' Industry
    We match company primary SIC codes to Senate Committees using the correspondence between committee
    and industries show in Appendix 2. We regress buy and hold abnormal returns (industry and size adjusted)
    on a dummy for whether the Senator's committee has some oversight or responsibility for the company's
    industry. A typical example would be an energy company and the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources
    Committee. The constant term represents returns for those companies industries that do not match to the
    Senators committee.

      The dependent variable is the Buy and Hold Abnormal Return (relative the industry size matched portfolio)
      on the stock. We calculate (cumulate) buy and hold returns on the individual stock using daily data. We then
      subtract the corresponding return on the industry size adjusted portfolio. The constant term represents
      BHARs for sales filed in paper form. We include dummies for purchases, electronic filing, and the
      interaction of the two.

 Table 6: Regression with Calendar Time Portfolio Returns
 We run "calendar time" portfolio regressions on Fama French Factors. The dependent variable is the mean
 portfolio return for the day minus the daily risk free rate. We include in each day's portfolio all stocks that
 were bought (sold) within the prior 255 trading days. In constructing the day's portfolio we weight by dollar
 amount of the trade. We run this at the daily level mostly for convenience. The reported alpha is the daily
 alpha.
