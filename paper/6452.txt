Transparency and Credibility: Monetary
Policy with Unobservable Goals

                                            ABSTRACT


       We define and study transparency, credibility, and reputation in a model where the central

bank’s characteristics are unobservable to the private sector and are inferred from the policy outcome.

A low-credibility bank optimally conducts a more inflationary policy than a high-credibility bank, in

the sense that it induces higher inflation, but a less expansionary policy in the sense that it induces

lower inflation and employment than expected. Increased transparency makes the bank’s reputation

and credibility more sensitive to its actions. This has a moderating influence on the bank’s policy.

Full transparency of the central bank’s intentions is generally socially beneficial, but frequently not

in the interest of the bank. Somewhat paradoxically, direct observability of idiosyncratic central bank

goals removes the moderating incentive on the bank and leads to the worst equilibrium.
