Health Capacity to Work at Older Ages in France

                                         ABSTRACT

France stands out as a country with a low labor force attachment of older workers. A reversal in
the trend of French labor participation rates over 50 is under way, partly due to the pension
reforms that took place since 1993. The French ageing process is driven by large gains in life
expectancy and Pension reforms allocate part of these gains to work rather than to retirement. The
implicit assumptions guiding the reforms have been that additional years of life are years with a
health status that can be considered reasonably compatible with work. If this is not the case, the
idea of sharing these additional years of life between work and retirement is questionable.

Considering mortality and health status, we question the fact that the reforms may have gone too
far in increasing the retirement age. To tackle these issues, we rely on two different
methodological approaches developed in the economic literature: one based on the gap in
employment rates across time for given mortality rates; the other using the work/health
relationship measured at certain ages to predict the health-related work capacity of older age
groups at the same period of time. Both methods aim at providing measures of additional work
capacity. This capacity may be defined as a measure of the distance between current retirement
ages and what we call the “health barrier”, i.e. the age at which health prevents people from
working longer.

Both methods predict high average levels of additional work capacity. However, the picture
becomes somewhat different when disaggregating the results by social groups or education. Our
results emphasize the idea that policies aiming at activating any estimated additional work
capacity should take into account, when possible, the heterogeneity of health conditions in the
population. Moreover, additional work capacity cannot be a general indicator of how much
seniors should work. The methods used here indeed leave aside many factors that determine the
employment rate of older workers.

1. Introduction

       Among comparable countries, France traditionally stands out as one of those where
the labor force attachment of older workers is the lowest. This has been especially the case
from the mid-80s to the beginning of the 2000s (Figure 1). The employment rate for the 60-64
age group was only 10% in 2000, 25 points below the OECD average, following a period of
continuous decline that had started early in the 1970s. The decrease has been more limited for
the 55-59 age group but nonetheless substantial. It has been concomitant with the shift of the
legal retirement age from 65 to 60 which took place during the first half of the 1980s and
favored a phase of rapid expansion of preretirement policies targeted to this 55-59 age group.
This expansion was rapidly interrupted, but employment rates for male workers aged 55-59
then remained as low as about 60% throughout the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s, more
than 10 points below the equivalent OECD average over the period.

       Yet, the long run view provided by Figure 1 also shows that low employment rates for
the 55 and above cannot be seen as a constant and irreversible feature of the French labor
market. First of all because preexisting historical levels were not low at all: the decrease that
occurred until the 1990s started from initial values that, in 1975, were close to OECD
standards. And second because employment rates have entered a new ascending phase over
the last fifteen years. Concerning the 55-59 age group, the average employment rate for both
genders has already reincreased from 50% in 2000 to 66% in 2013, above its 1975 value and
in line with the OECD average. Part of this trend stems from increased labor force attachment
by women of all ages, rather than from a tendency to work more at older ages. But the
movement is also very significant for men, whose employment rate has increased by 10 points
since 2008, despite the adverse economic conditions. Concerning the 60-64 age group, the
change is more progressive but not less substantial: employment rates have regained 15
percentage points, for both men and women. This is still much below the OECD average, but
the convergence is real since the trend in France is steeper than for the OECD as a whole.
                                                                                               1

       A reversal is therefore undoubtedly under way, partly due to tighter preretirement
policies, and partly to the pension reforms that took place since 1993. According to the latest
pension projections published by the Conseil d’Orientation des Retraites (Pensions Advisory
Committee), if things go on as currently expected, this upward trend in employment rates
should persist over the next decades, leading by 2040 to levels close to the ones that were
observed in the early 70s.

       The fact that most of the French ageing process is driven by large gains in life
expectancy has been particularly helpful in preparing this reversal: allocating part of these
gains to work rather than to retirement has been presented by policy makers as a natural and
relatively acceptable way to contain the progression of pension expenditures.

       In such a context, arguing both in favor of the possibility and the need to increase
retirement ages and older workers' employment appears to be much less necessary than it used
to. Yet some questions and doubts remain. An implicit hypothesis of all past reforms has been
that additional years of life are years spent in good health, or at least with a health status that
can be considered reasonably compatible with work. If this is not the case, the idea of sharing
these additional years of life between work and retirement becomes much less self-evident.


                                                                                                 2
       There is even the view that pension reforms themselves could widen the gap between
global and healthy life expectancies, if they induce people to work at ages where work
constraints strongly deteriorate health. In other words, a question that can be asked is whether
reforms have not gone “too far” in activating the retirement age variable. Are we approaching
a “health barrier” to longer working lives that would have been too rapidly ignored by past
reforms? This question can be asked “on average” but also, and probably more interestingly,
separately by occupations or socio-professional groups, thus questioning the adequacy of
excessively uniform policies that pay too little attention to differential exposures to morbidity
or mortality risks.

       To tackle these issues, we rely on two different methodological approaches currently
developed in the economic literature. Both methods and their variants aim at providing
measures of additional work capacity. This capacity may be defined as a measure of the
distance between current retirement ages and what we call the “health barrier”, i.e. the age at
which health prevents people from working longer.

       We first implement the method developed by Milligan and Wise (2012), denoted
thereafter MW, using mortality as a proxy of health. These authors compute a measure of
additional work capacity for older workers (aged 55-69), based on the gap in employment
rates across time for given mortality rates. With the increase in longevity over time, the same
mortality rate corresponds to different ages at different years. We extend the standard MW
method, on the one hand, taking into account intra-generational mortality differentials and, on
the other hand, using direct indicators of health status rather than the mortality proxy.

       Second, as the MW method remains highly dependent on the reference period, we
complete the study considering an alternative method, developed by Cutler, Meara and
Richards-Shubik (2013), denoted thereafter CMR, that does not require any comparison over
time. The approach becomes synchronic, using the work/health relationship measured at
certain ages to predict the health-related work capacity of older age groups at the same period
of time.

       Both methods and their variants aim at providing measures of additional work
capacity, i.e. measures of the existing distance between current retirement ages and our
suggested concept of “health barrier”. However, they do not tell us by how much retirement
ages should be increased. Individual and/or social choices concerning retirement ages need to
consider many other parameters, both on the supply and the demand side of the labor market.


                                                                                               3
What is at stake here is only one very specific aspect of the global optimization problem that
would consider all these variables at the same time: it entails no message about how far
policies should go in “exploiting” the employment reserve measured by additional work
capacity. Evaluating where the health barrier is standing is one thing, making
recommendations about how close to this barrier one should come is another thing, that is
clearly out of the scope of the present paper.

       Section 1 will present the application of the MW method in its original form, using
long-run series of mortality rates as proxies of health status, with an extension taking into
account intra-generational mortality differentials. This extension is made possible for France,
thanks to a long tradition of production of life tables for major socio-economic groups.
Section 2 will explore the possibility to adapt the MW method using direct indicators of
health status rather than the mortality proxy, relying on the Enquête Santé et Protection
Sociale (ESPS) conducted by IRDES from 1992 to 2010. The CMR method will be discussed
at last in Section 3. Section 4 will conclude with a short discussion of the limitations to
increasing retirement ages that are not covered in the present paper.


       2. Employment rates and mortality: the Milligan-Wise approach

       The Milligan-Wise methodology consists in using mortality as a proxy of health and
then compute a measure of additional work capacity for older workers (aged 55-69), based on
the gap in employment rates across time for given mortality rates. Data on mortality come
from the French Statistical Institute, INSEE. We match them with employment rates by age
computed using the French Labor Force Surveys (Enquête Emploi) over 1977-2012.

       The main advantage of this approach is that the results are easily comparable across
countries since mortality and employment are defined in a consistent way across national
data. In contrast, it cannot be extended to women in a meaningful way over the period we
consider because of the large shift in female labor force participation across cohorts. So, the
focus of this section will be on men only.

       Employment vs mortality over time

       The starting point of the MW methodology is the observation that in all advanced
countries, both mortality and employment rates have substantially declined over the past forty
years. France is no exception to these trends with male death rates at 55, 60 and 69 going
down from 1.13% (resp. 1.67% and 3.45%) in 1977 to 0.62% (resp. 0.86% and 1.67%) in

                                                                                             4
2012. Over the same period, employment rates of men have gone down from 90.1% at age 55
(resp. 75.1% at 60 and 15.4% at 69) in 1977 to 82.9% at age 55 (resp. 57.3% at 60 and 4.3%
at 69) in 2012.

       A more telling way of presenting these changes is provided on Figure 2. We graph
employment rates as a function of death rates for three different years: 1977, 1995 and 2012.
For given death rates, employment has strongly decreased over time. The death rate of
individuals aged 59 in 1977 (i.e. 0.0169) was reached at about 68 years old in 2012, while the
corresponding employment rates are hugely different: 75.1% for the 59 year olds in 1977 as
compared to only 4.3% for the 68 year olds in 2012. The changes that have taken place have
generated an inward shift in the mortality–employment schedule.

       This suggests that if bad health conditions – as captured by mortality – were the main
obstacle to employment, older workers – aged 55 and above – could be working much more
than they actually do.

                                Figure 2 - Employment vs Mortality - Men




       Measuring mortality-based work capacity

       To get a precise measure of this additional work capacity, we proceed in the following
way: for each level of death rate, we consider what the employment rate would be at any year
t if the relationship between employment and mortality were the same at t as in a reference
year – taken here to be 1977. We cumulate this calculation over age 55-69. This gives us the
number of additional years French men could have worked between 55 and 69 if the


                                                                                            5
employment-mortality relationship had not changed since 1977 – see Figure 3. The additional
number of years of work computed in this way is referred to as "additional work capacity".



                      Figure 3 - Mortality-based additional work capacity
                     Men 55 to 69, 1978 to 2012, using 1977 as reference year




       According to this calculation, the additional work capacity strongly increased from 0.4
years in 1978 to a peak of 8.3 years in the mid-2000s. The trend started to revert in 2009 and
the additional work capacity was back to 7.7 years in 2012.

       Given that we compute the additional work capacity on the basis of the gap in
employment rates between year t and a reference year, it heavily depends, by construction, on
the reference year that is chosen: the higher the employment rate in the reference year, the
higher the additional work capacity we obtain. Since employment rates have steadily
decreased in France until 2010, the additional work capacity mechanically increases with the
time distance to the reference year. For year 2012, for example, it ranges from 7.3 years if the
reference year is 1977 to -0.2 years if the reference year is 2010 – see Figure 4.




                                                                                              6

                               using 1977 to 2011 as reference years




       The limitations of the mortality-based Milligan-Wise approach

       The MW estimates deliver extreme upper bounds for potential increases in labor force
participation rates, i.e. evaluations of ages beyond which health limitations definitely preclude
further prolongations of working lives, according to some conventional historical standards
corresponding to the reference year. To interpret the results, we must bear in mind some
limits of the method. The first one is that (a) it is based on a proxy of health status whose
relevance is not warranted: if past declines in mortality rates have not been accompanied by
equivalent declines in morbidity, the MW method will overestimate the margin that is
available for increasing employment rates of older workers. A second limit (b) is the
intrinsically relative character of the results: as illustrated above, they are completely
dependent on the reference period used for assessing the current level of additional
employment capacity. A third limit (c) is the aggregate nature of the method: it is based on
average values of age-specific mortality rates, thus ignoring the strong heterogeneity of
mortality risks in the population.

       Limit (a) will be addressed in the next section when we examine whether the MW
method can be made more to the point by using true measures of health, rather than the
mortality proxy. The last section of this chapter will try to overcome limit (b): the Cutler et al.
(2013) method that will be used will avoid comparisons over time, replacing them by

                                                                                                 7
comparisons at time t across age groups. These two sections will also address limit (c), by
looking at differentials in health status as observed by education level or other descriptors of
socio-economic status. But a first look at the heterogeneity issue can already be provided
here, without exiting the strict MW framework, thanks to the availability, for France, of
mortality data by social group.

          Heterogeneity in mortality-based work capacity: managers and professionals vs blue-
collars

          Disaggregating life tables according to socio-economic status has a relatively long
tradition in France since first systematic attempts go back to the 60s and 70s (Calot and
Febvay, 1965; Desplanques, 1976). The approach combines civil registration data with
information collected at successive censuses: although civil registration data provide exact
age at death, they do not contain any reliable information on social status, which can be
retrieved from individual census bulletins. The first studies of this kind used one-shot ad hoc
confrontations of both pieces of information. Nowadays, the Echantillon Démographique
Permanent (Permanent Demographic Sample), maintained at the French Statistical Institute
INSEE, systematically matches both kinds of information for a 1% representative sample of
the French population. Thanks to this panel, life tables disaggregated by social group are
available off-the-shelf for the following aggregate time periods 1976-1984, 1983-1991, 1991-
1998 and 2000-2008 (Blanpain and Chardon, 2011).

          In these data, social stratification is described on the basis of the 7-digit French socio-
economic classification. We shall focus here on managers/professionals and blue collars. In
1976-1984, life expectancies at age 35 were 41.7 years for the former group and 35.7 for the
latter, i.e. a six-year gap. In 2000-2008, the corresponding figures were 47.2 and 40.9, i.e. a
6.3 year gap. At age 55, values for 1976-1984 were 23.3 and 19.2, i.e. a 4.1 year gap. For
2000-2008, they were respectively 28.4 and 23.5, i.e. a 4.9 year gap. Absolute differences are,
of course, smaller at 55 than at 35 but this is only due to the fact that life expectancy
decreases with age. Reevaluated in relative terms, in 2000-2008, the gap was 14% at age 35
and close to 19% at age 55.

          How can such a feature be incorporated into the MW framework? The procedure we
propose here fully respects the general spirit of the method and does not make use of socio-
economic mortality differentials for remote time periods: only data for the most recent years
are sufficient. We keep the hypothesis that average mortality-employment relationships of all

                                                                                                   8
past periods can be used as benchmarks, and apply these successive benchmarks to mortality
rates currently observed in the two social groups we consider. The counterfactual employment
rates that are produced on the basis of these group-specific mortality rates are then compared
to the true employment rates observed for the same groups. The period of interest is the
median year of the latest time period for which differential mortality is available, i.e. year
2004. More precisely, we use mortality rates for 2000-2008 as proxies of mortality rates by
social group in 2004 and, concerning employment rates, we average them over a three-year
period centered around 2004, i.e. 2003-2005.

       Another option would be to compute MW additional work capacities for each of our
social groups using group-specific employment/mortality relationships. Yet this would only
give a measure of how much blue collars (resp. managers/professionals) may work
considering their own mortality and employment rates in the reference year, with little or no
insight into the differential between them. For instance, in case of perfectly parallel changes
in mortality and employment for the two groups, the result would be identical levels of
additional work capacities for both, whatever the level of cross-sectional inequality between
them. Put differently, this would consider that the differential gap in the reference year is also
a reference and can be considered as “normal”. With our methodology, we consider that the
reference is the link between employment and mortality in the average population, and this
sheds a better light on the situation of disadvantaged social groups.

       The resulting additional work capacities of managers/professionals and blue-collar
workers for year 2004 are shown on Figure 5 using 1977 to 2004 as successive reference
years. This figure also replicates the previous computation for the general population, with
2004 rather than 2012 as the new year of interest. Understanding the results in figure 5 also
requires looking at figure 6, which provides the apparent mortality-employment relationship
for managers/professionals and blue collars in 2004, as well as the same relationship for the
general population both in 2004 and 1977.




                                                                                                9

       Results using 2004 as the reference year are instructive in that they reveal the current
state of inequalities in terms of employment-mortality relationship. If the 2004 relationship is
taken as a reference, the average additional work capacity is zero by construction, but it is as
high as +5.1 years for managers and professionals whereas it is negative for blue collars,


                                                                                             10
equal to -0.9 years. Managers and professionals work much less than they could do –
according to the MW a priori –, while blue-collar workers work slightly longer than what they
should be asked to. Another way to look at these figures is to note that blue-collar workers
aged 55 had a rate of employment of 70% in 2003-2005, while managers and professionals
the same age had a rate of employment of 87.9%. Over this time period, the former had a
mortality rate of .0091 while the latter reached this mortality rate at only 65 or 66 years old,
i.e. ages at which their employment rates were around 10%. This means that, if we consider
2004 managers and professionals as the reference group, blue-collar workers suffer from a 60
percentage-point «excess» work duration. Such considerations raise the question of
differentiating the efforts in additional years of work that could be demanded to the different
groups, in view of their current mortality levels.

       In principle, the same message should remain valid when pushing the reference year
backward in the past, with parallel increases of the indicators of additional employment
capacity for managers/professionals and blue collars. Figure 5 suggests that this is not the
case since the additional work capacities of both groups seem to be much closer to each other
when 1977 is taken as the reference year – 7.6 years and 8.9 years, respectively. However,
this paradoxical result is due to an artifact generated by the way the MW method is
implemented, i.e. imposing an arbitrary upper limit at 69 for the age bracket over which
counterfactual employment rates are simulated. The consequence of this arbitrary limit can be
understood looking at figure 6: as the method is applied here, the difference between the
upper 1977 schedule and the bottom schedule for managers and professionals in 2004 is
integrated only until about half way through the figure. Abandoning such a convention, the
MW approach would reveal a considerable amount of additional work capacity for managers
and professionals on the right-hand side of the graph. The impact of removing the 69 year-old
age constraint is expected to be much more modest for blue-collar workers since, when
integrating for them within this limit, we go up to values of mortality rates for which
employment rates were already low – typically below 20% – in 1977. This is confirmed by
figure 7, equivalent to figure 5 after removing the 69 year-old limit for computing
counterfactual employment rates: an almost complete parallelism is restored between the
profiles of additional work capacity for managers/professionals, blue-collar workers and the
average population.

       Of course, this generates levels of additional work capacity for managers and
professionals that look highly implausible – up to 13 years with 1977 as the reference year. It
incidentally highlights a limit of the MW method. This generates estimates of additional work
capacities that remain within a plausible range only thanks to the choice of an arbitrary upper
age limit until which the methodology is considered valid.

       Mortality-based work capacity: what have we learnt?

       The MW approach based on mortality yields very high estimates of additional work
capacity. This does not mean that all this capacity should actually be used. It only suggests
that, on average, health does not appear to be a major limiting factor to the increase in labour
force participation of older workers. However, one has to go beyond averages and take into
account the very uneven levels of mortality rates across social groups. This point is clearly
supported by the analysis carried out using the data on mortality by social status available for
France. Moreover, as already underlined, mortality remains a very crude proxy of health. The
next sections try to overcome this drawback.




                                                                                             12
       3. Employment rates and self-assessed health implementing the Milligan-Wise
approach

       This section addresses the concern that mortality could be a poor proxy of health by
considering a more direct measure of it, i.e. self-assessed health (SAH).

       The data on SAH for France are provided by the ESPS (Enquête sur la Santé et la
Protection Sociale) Survey. This survey was conducted yearly from 1992 to 1997 on a rather
small sample of individuals (about 1,000 per year) and every other year from 1998 to 2010 on
a larger sample (about 2,000 respondents per year). SAH is measured consistently since 1992
on a 0-10 scale and we define poor SAH as a dummy variable equal to 1 if reported SAH
scores below 8 (which corresponds to the first quartile of the distribution both for men and
women in 1992) and 0 otherwise.

       Trends in SAH over time

       Figure 8 (resp. 9) shows the relationship between poor SAH and age, on the one hand,
and mortality and age on the other hand for men (resp. women). Both figures provide
evidence of an age gradient in SAH and mortality, although the relationship is less smooth for
SAH because of small sample size. The proportion of men reporting poor SAH in 2010 is
almost three times as large at age 75 as at 50 – 70% as compared to 25%. Age trends are less
pronounced for women since the proportion reporting poor SAH is equivalent to men at age
75 – 70% – but is much higher at age 50 – 40%. This is consistent with the difference we
observe across gender in the age gradient in mortality, the latter being larger for men than for
women.

       Yet, contrary to what we might expect – and to what is observed for mortality for men
above 55 and for women above 70 –, we do not see any steady improvement in SAH over
time whatever the age group we consider – see Figures 10 and 11 below. After a decline in
the proportion of men and women reporting poor SAH in the first half of the 1990s, the trends
revert at the beginning of the 2000s and SAH appears to deteriorate for both men and women,
at least until the very last years of the decade.




                                                                                             13

       The lack of clear improvement in self-assessed health over time in our data raises the
issue of potential declaration biases. There is evidence in the literature that, when asked about
their health, individuals in various subgroups of the population use different threshold levels
to assess it, although having the same "true" health level. This gives rise to reporting
heterogeneity which varies according to the type of health outcome that is considered (Tubeuf
et al, 2008). As regards SAH, low-income and low-education individuals tend to over-report it

                                                                                              15
(Bago d'Uva et al, 2011; Etilé and Milcent, 2006; Johnston et al, 2009), while women tend to
under-report it as compared to men (Bago d'Uva et al, 2008). As regards age, Lindeboom and
van Doorslaer (2004) find that older adults are more inclined than younger ones to report
good health for a given health status. If this happens to be the case in our data, the age-
gradient evidenced in Figures 8 and 9 must be considered as a lower bound since it is
negatively affected by this declaration bias. However, in order for declaration biases to
account for the lack of improvement in SAH over time, it would have to be the case that,
within age groups, individuals tend to under-report their health status to a larger extent than
they used to in the past. This may be the case if, as health systems become more efficient,
individuals raise their health expectations. However, to our knowledge, there is no evidence
of such trend in the literature.

       A competing explanation of why time trends in poor SAH do not look more downward
sloping may be that they are quite heterogeneous across social groups, with health getting
better for some groups while it may have worsened for others.

       Trends in SAH by education

       One of the most obvious social classification to look at is the one based on education.
This can be done using the ESPS Survey which contains information on educational levels
grouped into 5 categories until 2006 and into 8 and 9 groups in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

       In order to compute meaningful changes in SAH by education level over time, we
need to take into account the upward shift that has taken place in the educational composition
of the population. One of the consequences of this shift is that low-educated workers are more
selected in recent years than they were in the past. To account for this change, we first
compute the distribution of years of education by cohort and gender – see Figures 12 and 13
for men and women, respectively; the distribution for the whole population is shown on
Appendix Figure AA0.




                                                                                            16
            Figure 12 - Distribution of years of education completed by cohort - Men
                                (year each cohort attained age 50)




          Figure 13 - Distribution of years of education completed by cohort - Women
                                (year each cohort attained age 50)




       As can be seen on Figure 12, the proportion of men having completed at least some
higher education increased substantially between the cohorts who reached 50 in 1960 and in
2010. The same goes for the proportion with upper secondary education and for those with
lower secondary education. In contrast, the share of men with only primary education has
sharply declined. Those who never attended school represent a small share of the cohort who
reached 50 in 2010 but it was already low for the 1960 cohort. Similar trends are observed for




                                                                                           17
women – see Figure 13 – although the proportion that attains higher education in the 2010
cohort remains slightly lower than for men.

           As a second step, we sort individuals by education in each age*year cell with random
ordering of individuals within each level and define four education quartiles. Over the 40
years considered here, the educational level of the median male and female increased from
primary to lower secondary education. The first quartile did the same while the third one
moved from lower secondary education to upper secondary education.

           The proportion of individuals reporting poor SAH is then computed for each single
age over 50-75 in each education quartile and eventually aggregated over two time periods:
1992-1998 and 2000-2010.

                                          1992-2010




       As evidenced in Figures 14 and 15 above, higher-educated men and women are on
average in better health than their low-educated counterparts. This is particularly true for both
men and women in the fourth quartile of the education distribution. However, we find no
evidence of a substantial improvement in SAH over time except at very old ages – for men in
the upper half of the education distribution and for women in the first and third quartiles. This
result has to be interpreted with caution though since individuals in very bad health above 70
years old are likely to be underrepresented in the ESPS survey if they are hosted in
specialized institutions since the latter are not included in the sample. If the proportion of
unhealthy older people in such institutions has increased over time, the group of older
individuals in the ESPS survey is increasingly selected in terms of health, which may account
for the trend observed in our data at very old ages.

       Overall, we do not see very different trends in health conditions over time within age
and education groups. So, the lack of steady improvement in self-assessed health observed in
the French data cannot be accounted for by the fact that health conditions would improve for


                                                                                              19
some groups of individuals while worsening for others, at least when these groups are defined
on the basis of education.

        Additional work capacity: the Milligan-Wise approach based on SAH

        We repeat the analysis carried out for employment rates and mortality using SAH. As
for mortality, we do so for men only since the strong increase in female labor force
participation would generate some confusion in the interpretation of the results. To reduce the
noise in the data, we average the information on SAH over two years when it is available
yearly, so that what is indicated as 1992 is actually computed as the average over 1992 and
1993. In addition, we linearly adjust the age profiles of self-assessed health. The
corresponding employment-health profiles are presented in Figure 16.



                               Figure 16 - Employment vs Poor SAH - Men




        We graph employment rates as a function of the proportion of individuals reporting
poor SAH for three different years: 1992, 2000 and 2010. For given shares of men in poor
health, employment rates decreased substantially between 1992 and 2000, before re-
increasing sharply in the 2000s. Whatever the share of men reporting poor SAH, employment
rates are higher in 2010 than in 2000 and in a number of cases, they are even higher than in
1992.




                                                                                            20
       This suggests that the additional work capacity of men aged 55 to 69 as measured in
2010 is likely to be very small if not negative for a large number of years. This is what is
evidenced on Figure 17 below.



           Figure 17 -SAH-based additional work capacity for men 55-69 in 2010
                          using 1992 to 2010 as reference years




       According to the reference year, the additional employment capacity as measured in
2010 varies between 0 and -3.6 years. The only reference year for which it is positive is 2008
and, even in this case, it amounts to less than 1 year. These results are due to the fact that over
the 1992-2010 period, employment rates varied very little and that the proportion of men
reporting poor SAH first decreased before increasing again in the second half of the period –
see Figure 10. For some age groups, it is even higher at the end than at the beginning of the
period. Given such trends, there cannot be, by construction, any positive additional work
capacity as measured in 2010.

       This result is in sharp contrast with what we obtained when using mortality as a proxy
of health. As measured in 2012, the mortality-based additional work capacity varied between
0 and +3.2 years according to the choice of the reference year in the 1992-2012 range. This
gap in estimates with the SAH-based additional work capacity is due to the diverging trends
in mortality and SAH over the period: while death rates have steadily decreased, SAH
reported by men first improved before deteriorating again. One explanation for these


                                                                                                21
differences in trends is that mortality and SAH do not capture the same thing. Mortality is
actually a very peculiar measure of health. It captures the fact that individuals are still living,
rather than dead – which is, of course, positive! –, but it does not take at all into account that
individuals may be living in poor health conditions. Recent work by Sieurin et al. (2011)
suggests that, in France, male life expectancy at 50 increased by about 22% between 1999 and
2008, whereas life expectancy without functional limitations increased by only 0.6% over the
same period. When decomposing this trend for various types of limitations, they find that
although life expectancy without physical functional limitations increased over time for men
aged 50, their life expectancy without sensory and cognitive limitations actually decreased
(by 3 to 8%). If SAH reported by men partly reflects these limitations, it is no surprise that its
trend might substantially differ from that of mortality.

       Overall, the results presented in Sections 2 and 3 suggest that one has to be very
cautious when considering our estimates of additional work capacity. Their magnitude much
depends indeed on the reference year that is chosen but, more importantly, their sign reverts
when considering SAH rather than mortality as the relevant measure of health because the
time trends in both variables do diverge. To overcome the problems raised by comparing
different time periods, the Cutler et al. method, used in the next section, relies on comparisons
across age groups rather than over time.



       4. Simulating employment rates at older ages: the Cutler et al. (2013) approach

       The method

       The method proposed by Cutler et al. (2013) to estimate the employment capacity
consists in two steps. They first estimate individual labor force participation as a function of
health for individuals in a younger age group (57-61) and then use the estimated coefficients
to simulate what labor force participation would be for an older age group (62-64) if the
health-participation relationship remained stable across ages. The advantage of this method is
that it does not require comparing labor market outcomes and health at different points in
time. The model is estimated for one age group at one period and is used to simulate the
contemporaneous work capacity of another age group. The key assumption underlying the
method is that the impact of health on individuals' working capacity is the same in the various
age groups.



                                                                                                22
           In what follows we apply the Cutler et al. method to employment rates rather than
labor force participation. We estimate employment rates separately for men and women in the
51-54 year-old group as a function of education, marital status,1 the type of job (employee,
civil servant, self-employed) and an indicator of health. We then simulate employment rates
for men and women and by education level separately in the 55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70+ age
groups. Of course, the ideal methodology would require estimating separate regressions by
education level. Unfortunately, we do not have enough observations in our data to do so.

           The data

           The data we use come from the French section of the Survey of Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe. SHARE is a panel database containing individual information on
health, socio-economic status and social and family networks for more than 85,000
individuals aged 50 and over in 19 European countries. The sample size for France is around
3,000 households per wave. The survey was carried out in 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013.
We pool all available waves except SHARELIFE (wave 3) which has data on individuals' life
histories.

           Our main health index is the same as in Behaghel et al. (2014). Its computation
follows the methodology developed by Poterba, Venti and Wise (2010, PVW) using the
American Health and Retirement Survey data. The authors assume that latent health is
revealed by responses to the long list of questions asked in the survey relative to health status
and changes in health status. The PVW health index is then defined as the first principal
component of these selected health measures. It is a weighted average of the health indicators
with weights chosen to maximize the proportion of the variance of the individual health index
that can be explained by this first principal component. This methodology has been replicated
on the 25 health questions of the SHARE questionnaire. Details on the selected questions and
the weights are provided in Behaghel et al. (2014). The index is decomposed in percentiles
with percentile 1 corresponding to the worst health status and percentile 100 to the best.
Unsurprisingly, the PVW index decreases with age – see Figure 18. It is also lower for
women than for men at all ages except above 93, which is consistent with widespread
evidence in the literature according to which women report worse health than men do even if
they have longer life expectancies – see Case and Paxson (2005).

              As robustness checks, we consider alternative health measures. The first set includes
self-assessed health and the subset of variables contained in the PVW index which capture the
lack of personal autonomy suffered by individuals. Self-assessed health is captured by a
dummy variable equal to 1 if individuals report that their health is either fair or poor and 0 if
they report that it is excellent, very good or good. We also include dummy variables for any
difficulty walking, limitations in the activities of daily living2 and any limitation in
instrumental activities of daily living.3 On the graphs, all values are averaged over the four
waves of SHARE that we use. Figures AA1 and AA2 in the Appendix report age gradients for
these variables.

              In a third model, we include a subset of health indicators corresponding to the most
severe conditions (heart problems, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, lung disease and
cancer) as well as arthritis to the extent that it is highly incapacitating with respect to

       As expected, the PVW health index is positively correlated with employment rates for
both men and women, suggesting that individuals in better health conditions have a higher
probability of being in employment. Consistent with the evidence in the literature, we also
find that lower educated individuals are less likely to be in employment: the effect is
significant for both men and women with no diploma or only primary school, and for men


                                                                                            25
with at most with at most lower secondary education. Other control variables are found to
have a differential impact on genders: civil-servant males have a higher probability to be in
employment than employees, whereas the effect is not significant for females. In contrast, in
the 51-54 year-old group considered here, married women are more likely to be employed
than non-married ones, which is not the case for men.

       Following the Cutler et al. (2013) methodology, we use the coefficients estimated in
Table 1 to simulate employment rates for men and women in older age groups. The
corresponding results are shown in Table 2.

       These estimates yield large additional work capacities on average. Considering
individuals aged 55-59, who are the most comparable to those on whom employment rates are
estimated – who are aged 51-54 – work capacity ranges between 9% and 19% for men. It
increases with the level of education except for the most educated group – those with high-
school diploma or more – whose actual employment rate is already quite high (about 80%).
This is consistent with the fact that, although low-educated workers exit the labor force before
highly-educated ones, they tend to be in worse health, thus having lower predicted
employment rates. As regards women of the same age, their additional work capacity is much
lower since they work even more than men in that age group. For women with no diploma or
only primary education, it is about 3%, even slightly negative for those with lower secondary
education and no more than 12% for those with higher secondary education. This suggests
that in the 55-59 year-old group, there is not much room for maneuver to increase
employment rates of females.

       The estimated work capacities are much larger in the 60-64 year-old group for both
men and women, ranging from 46 to 69% for the former and 49 to 65% for the latter. This is
due to the fact that predicted employment rates are close to those of the 55-59 age group
whereas actual employment rates precipitate: they go down to no more than 30% for men and
26% for women. This is no surprise given that, during most of the period we consider here
(2004-2013), legal retirement age was 60 in France, thus generating a spike in exit rates from
employment at this age. The results presented in this table suggest that if health were the only
limitation to the employment of senior workers, both men and women could work much more
than they actually do in the 60-65 age group.

       These results are robust to using alternative health measures. The first set we consider
includes poor SAH, as well as any limitation in ADL or IADL and difficulty walking. As
evidenced in Appendix Table A1, all these variables reduce the probability of being in
employment with the effect being significant at least at the 5% level – except for IADL for
women which is significant only at the 10% level. Using this specification to simulate
additional work capacity, the magnitude we get is very close to that in Table 2, although
marginally larger – see Table A2 –: it ranges from 5% to 20% (resp. 52% to 71%) for men
aged 55-59 (resp. 60-64) and from 5% to 12% (resp. 72% to 87%) for women aged 55-59
(resp. 60-64).




                                                                                            27
       When using our second set of alternative health measures based on the most severe
health conditions and arthritis, the impact on employment rates gets more variable across
genders – see Table A3: women are negatively affected by strokes, diabetes, arthritis and
cancer, whereas men's employment rates are reduced by strokes, lung problems and arthritis
only. When simulating additional work capacity on this basis, the results are very similar to
those in Table 2 – see Table A4.

       As evidenced in Table 2 – and confirmed in Tables A2 and A4 – the magnitude of the
work capacity estimated with the Cutler et al. method gets substantially larger as age
increases. It reaches 61% to 81% for men in the 65-69 age group – according to their
educational level – and 65 to 79% for women before declining slightly at older ages – but still
ranging between 50% and 80% for both men and women. These figures are extremely high.
Taken at face value, they suggest that health is in no way a limiting factor to increasing
retirement ages for both men and women in France, whatever their educational attainment. If
poorer health at old ages were the only limitation to employment, employment rates could be
much higher than they actually are, even for low-skilled (low-educated) workers who have
often spent a large part of their career in jobs characterized by high physical strain.

The issues raised by the Cutler et al. approach
       The very high values of work capacity generated by our estimates, in particular at old
ages – above 70 – raise a number of issues about the method. It indeed relies on two strong
assumptions.

       The first one is that a given health problem has exactly the same impact on the
probability of being in employment (or the work capacity) at all ages. This assumption does
not necessarily hold for a couple of reasons. Despite the large number of questions in
SHARE, the health indicators that we have are quite crude so that we are likely to mismeasure
"true health". In particular, a given reported health symptom (say arthritis) may correspond to
a better or worse "true" health status according to the intensity of the pain it generates. If this
intensity tends to grow over age, the same symptom will not affect the probability of being in
employment in the same way across ages. A second issue has to do with the fact that the
impact of a given "true" health problem may affect productivity in a different way across
ages. Older workers may, in particular, be less versatile than younger ones thereby having
more difficulty to develop strategies that would allow them to circumvent a temporary
physical handicap. If this is the case, the direct impact of health on the probability of being in
employment is not constant across ages. More specifically, if given health conditions, as we
                                                                                                28
measure them, have a more negative impact on older workers than on younger ones, this will
generate an upward bias in our estimates of additional work capacity, with this bias increasing
as the individuals we consider get older.

       Of course, the simplifying assumption according to which a given health problem has
exactly the same impact on the probability of being in employment (or the work capacity) at
various ages is more or less acceptable according to the age gap between the group on which
the estimates are run and the group for which the simulations are made. If both groups are
very similar in terms of age, the assumption may be considered reasonable. If, in contrast,
they are very far apart, it is unlikely to hold. This suggests that the results we obtain for
individuals aged 70 and above (or even 65-69) using estimates run on individuals aged 50-54
should be interpreted with great caution.

       The second assumption underlying the Cutler et al. method is that there is no reverse
causality from employment to health. If, in contrast, being in employment affects health and
this effect varies across ages, the estimates run on the 50-54 year-old group are biased and the
simulations carried out on the older age groups yield a biased measure of the work capacity at
old ages. In particular, the latter will be overestimated if work negatively affects health at old
ages. The literature on the health effects of retirement suggests that this may be the case. Most
papers indeed find a positive impact of retirement on physical health, whereas the results are
more mixed for mental health, and even negative for cognitive outcomes – see Bassanini and
Caroli (2014). This reverse causality effect is hard to take into account since it would require
instrumenting health levels. Nonetheless, it cannot be ruled out and calls, here again, for
caution in interpreting the results. The same remark applies to the MW methodology as well.


Conclusion
       In the first part of this chapter, we have estimated additional work capacity using the
standard MW method where health is proxied by mortality. According to this approach,
health does not emerge as a key limiting factor to higher employment rates in the 55-69 age
groups. This result comes as no surprise. As recalled in the introduction, the fact that gains in
life expectancy are good news that provide a natural solution to pension problems has been
regularly underlined in the French pension debate over the last two decades. It paved the way
to reforms whose expected effects on retirement ages are not marginal at all. The MW method
just confirms how large the window potentially opened by these gains is. Yet, this mortality-
based approach already required one first qualification, i.e. the need to incorporate socio-

                                                                                               29
economic mortality differentials. Accounting for these differentials did not fully revert the
message that had been obtained on average: there remains some additional work capacity in
the MW sense of the term for all social groups. This work capacity nevertheless displays
strong variations across social groups: depending upon the reference that is chosen, the gap
ranges from 4 to 6 years between the two extreme cases of blue collars and
managers/professionals.

       When considering SAH, which is a less crude proxy of health than mortality, our
estimates of additional work capacity are substantially modified. As measured in 2010, the
SAH-based capacity indeed varies between 0 and -3.6 years, thus being consistently negative.
The gap in estimates between mortality and SAH-based capacity is due to the diverging trends
in both variables over the period. A natural explanation for this is that mortality and SAH do
not capture the same thing. As a matter of fact, the mortality proxy does not take into account
that individuals may still be alive although in poor health conditions.

       This result is not sufficient to invalidate the idea that the financial equilibrium of
pension systems can be reached by increasing retirement ages. Its significance is indeed
limited by the fact that it has been established over a relatively short time period over which
employment rates have been re-increasing and SAH has had a U-shaped profile without any
clear long-run trend. What would be needed is an assessment of this trend over a longer time
period, typically from the mid-70s onward. But, even if such an exercise should confirm a
total lack of health improvement over the long run, the MW approach would still predict a
current positive additional work capacity. This would indeed mirror the global decline of
senior employment rates that has been observed since the 70s, and this precisely corresponds
to the kind of increases expected from pension reforms that have already been implemented. It
would however mean that these reforms have come relatively close to the health barrier we try
to measure here and that there is not much scope for going further than what these reforms
have already planned to do.

       Comparing health (or mortality) at different time periods, as required by the MW
approach, raises a number of methodological problems, in particular the dependence of the
results on the reference year we choose. To circumvent such problems, the last part of the
chapter uses the Cutler et al. method that relies on comparisons across age groups rather than
over time. Here again, the corresponding estimates yield large additional work capacities on
average, with significant variation across social groups, now identified through education


                                                                                            30
levels: low-educated individuals tend to be in worst health at older ages so that their predicted
employment rates are also lower.

       Overall, both the mortality-based MW approach and the CMR method predict high
average levels of additional work capacity. However, the picture becomes somewhat different
when disaggregating the results by social groups or education. So, our results emphasize the
idea that policies that would aim at activating any estimated additional work capacity should
take into account, when possible, the heterogeneity of health conditions in the population.

       Moreover, as mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, additional work capacity
cannot be a general indicator of how much more seniors should work. The methods used here
indeed leave aside many factors that may play a role in determining the "optimal"
employment rate of older workers. The fact that leisure has a positive value is the first of
these factors: individual and collective choices regarding retirement ages are the result of a
tradeoff between income and leisure. Workers that are fully employable and in perfectly good
health may very rationally choose to allocate a large share of their “work capacity” to
retirement rather than to work if they consider that they can afford to do so. Next and last,
even if we restrict the question to the assessment of work capacity stricto sensu, without any
message concerning how far it must be exploited, there remains the fact that health is only
one of the factors that limit this work capacity. The economic literature has shown that senior
workers suffer from low levels of labor demand, in particular when they are low skilled. This
may be caused by health limitations if they have spent most of their careers in high-strain
jobs, but it may also be the consequence of skill obsolescence (Aubert and al, 2006). Recent
prospective studies have highlighted the fact that many jobs are likely to be affected by
automation in the near future (Frey and Osborne, 2013). Tasks that escape automation include
creative intelligence, social intelligence and perception and manipulation tasks. It is difficult
to foresee the impact of age on the ability to carry out such tasks; yet it is not implausible that
labor demand continues to shift towards young and middle ages, thus increasing the difficulty
for older workers to stay in employment.
