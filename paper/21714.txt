Prescription Drug Advertising and Drug Utilization: The Role of Medicare Part D

                                              ABSTRACT

Pharmaceutical firms currently spend over $4 billion on direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of
prescription drugs, a nearly 30-fold increase since 1993 that has led to much debate about its value
to patients. We examine how DTCA influences drug utilization along the extensive and intensive margins
by exploiting a large and plausibly exogenous shock to DTCA driven by the introduction of Medicare
Part D in 2006. Using data on advertising for local media markets from Nielsen, we show that Part
D led to large relative increases in DTCA in geographic areas with a high concentration of Medicare
beneficiaries compared to areas with a low concentration. We examine the effects of this sudden differential
increase in advertising on non-elderly individuals to isolate the effects of advertising on drug utilization
from the direct effects of Part D. Using data from pharmacy claims, we find substantial differential
increases in drug utilization that mirror the increases in DTCA after Part D. These effects are driven
both by increased take-up of treatment and improved drug adherence. Our results imply significant
spillovers from Medicare Part D onto the under-65 population and an important role for non-price
factors in influencing prescription drug utilization.

1. Introduction


    Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs in the U.S. has
increased dramatically in the last two decades from $150 million in 1993 to over $4 billion in
2010 (Dave, 2013; Dave and Saffer, 2012). This rise was precipitated by a 1997 FDA policy
change that relaxed restrictions on drug advertising.1 Most drug advertising occurs on television,
where pharmaceuticals represented the third highest category of advertising expenditures in 2014
(behind automotive and fast food restaurant advertising).2 Nielsen estimates that an average of
80 pharmaceutical ads air every hour on American television.3 Given that adults ages 50+, a
population with a high rate of prescription drug use, watch an average of more than 40 hours of
live television per week (Nielsen, 2014), the pervasiveness of pharmaceutical advertising could
have large effects on prescription drug use. Indeed, Figure 1 shows that the dramatic rise in
advertising that occurred over the last two decades has coincided with a striking increase in
spending on prescription drugs. Per-capita spending on prescription drugs increased five-fold
between 1990 and 2010, following decades of little spending growth (National Health
Expenditure Accounts, 2015).               While the coincidence of these trends suggests a strong
relationship between advertising and spending, the causal channel could go in both directions.
The unprecedented number of blockbuster drugs introduced in the 1990s could have induced
greater advertising as well as greater drug spending. This, along with other confounding factors,
makes it difficult to isolate the independent effect of DTCA.
    The rise in the level of DTCA has generated much debate about its effects on patient welfare.
Most countries (with the exception of the U.S. and New Zealand) ban this type of advertising.
On the one hand, DTCA may be informative if it educates patients about available treatments,
encourages individuals to seek care for underdiagnosed conditions, and improves communication
between patients and physicians. Advertisements may also serve to remind patients to take their
existing medications and influence their perception of the benefits of treatment, promoting better
drug adherence (Holmer, 2002; Donohue et al., 2004; Wosinska, 2005). On the other hand, the

  Prior to 1997, ads were required to include essentially all of the information on the product label (which is unlikely
to fit in a 30-second television or radio spot), but after 1997 only the major risks and benefits needed to be included.
Before 1997, most advertising was in print and it was limited.

persuasive and product differentiation aspects of DTCA may lead to unnecessary treatments and
excessive drug spending. There is a lack of consensus on whether DTCA serves primarily to
inform or persuade, which matters for assessing its value to patients. This distinction hinges
partly on the extent to which DTCA impacts drug utilization and the mechanisms underlying
advertising’s impacts, such as whether the effects of DTCA stem from changes in the take-up of
therapy versus changes in adherence and whether there are spillovers of advertising on non-
advertised drugs.        However, identifying DTCA’s causal effects on utilization has been
challenging empirically, since demand factors could influence both the amount of advertising
and the timing of advertisements. Some studies have tried to address these endogeneity concerns
with instrumental variable strategies, though it is difficult to find appropriate instruments given
the close relationship between demand and advertising decisions.
    We address these challenges by providing one of the first quasi-experimental studies on the
effects of DTCA on drug utilization. We exploit a large and plausibly exogenous shock to DTCA
driven by the introduction of Medicare Part D in 2006. We focus on drugs that treat five chronic
conditions that account for a large share of advertising spending—depression, diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and osteoporosis4—and estimate effects along both the intensive
and extensive margins to examine the causal pathways through which DTCA influences drug
utilization. Our instrumental variable strategy exploits variation across geographic areas in the
share of the population that is covered by Medicare (ages 65+) to predict changes in advertising
exposure across areas. We show that there was a large relative increase in advertising exposure
immediately following the introduction of Part D in geographic areas with a high share of elderly
compared to areas with a low elderly share. Prior to Part D, both the levels and trends in
advertising exposure across high and low elderly share areas were nearly identical.
    Since advertising cannot be perfectly targeted to the elderly, we exploit the sudden
differential increase in advertising exposure for non-elderly that live in elderly-dominated areas
to estimate the effects of advertising on drug utilization. This strategy hinges on the observation
that non-elderly individuals are exposed to the increase in DTCA but do not receive Part D
insurance coverage, which may independently impact drug utilization. Our focus on the non-

expenditures (Kantar Media, 2011).

                                                                                                           3
elderly allows us to isolate the effects of advertising on drug utilization from the direct effects of
Part D.
          This paper makes four main contributions. First, we exploit a major policy change to
identify the effects of DTCA on drug utilization.                   The use of policy shocks as natural
experiments has been scarce in the existing advertising literature, although it is a promising
approach for obtaining variation in advertising that is unrelated to individual demand and health
status. Second, we use this empirical framework to estimate the effects of DTCA not only on
overall drug utilization but also separately on the extensive and intensive margins—i.e., higher
take-up of drug treatments versus better drug adherence by existing patients. We tease apart the
contributions of these component effects to the total relationship between advertising and
utilization to explore welfare implications of advertising. The prior literature has primarily
focused on overall utilization.          Third, we use data from two novel sources. We measure
pharmaceutical advertising using data on Nielsen ratings in local media markets that we observe
separately for the non-elderly (under 65) and the elderly (65+). While most of the DTCA
literature uses advertising expenditures or the volume of ads to quantify advertising, ratings are a
more direct measure of actual advertising exposure.5 This measure is more often used outside of
the DTCA literature to measure exposure to other types of television programming (e.g.,
Kearney and Levine, 2014; Kanazawa and Funk, 2001). We obtain measures of drug utilization
using administrative pharmacy claims from a database of over 40 large national employers
covering about 18 million person-years. Finally, a fourth contribution of our study is to quantify
spillover effects of Part D on the non-elderly population. Numerous studies have examined the
effects of Part D on the elderly but few have considered the effects on the non-elderly.6 One
important mechanism through which Part D may have an effect on the non-elderly is through
advertising, and we find strong evidence of these spillovers.
          We find that drug utilization is highly responsive to advertising exposure. Following Part
D, there was a 6 percent increase in the average number of prescriptions purchased by the non-
elderly in areas with high elderly share, relative to areas with low elderly share. Event study
results using quarterly utilization data show that this differential effect coincided precisely with


5
  To our knowledge, Saffer et al. (2007) – which studies advertising for nicotine replacement therapy – is the only
other pharmaceutical advertising study to use Nielsen ratings data.
6
  Part D may also have spillover effects on the non-elderly through pharmaceutical R&D investments (Blume-
Kohout and Sood, 2013) and negotiated drug prices (Duggan and Scott Morton, 2010; Lakdawalla and Yin, 2015).

                                                                                                                      4
the implementation of Part D in 2006 and persisted through the end of our study period in 2010.
The event study also confirms that there were no differential pre-trends in utilization across
higher and lower elderly share areas, providing support for the identifying assumption that the
trends would have continued to be the same in the absence of Part D. Our results imply that a 10
percent increase in advertising views leads to a 5.4 percent increase in total prescriptions filled
for advertised chronic drugs. Our estimate of the elasticity with respect to views exceeds prior
estimates of the elasticity with respect to advertising expenditures, which most DTCA studies
estimate. This is consistent with prior evidence that an increase in advertising expenditures leads
to a less than proportional increase in advertising views (Sethuraman et al., 2011).
        We find that advertising increases the take-up of drug treatments and improves
compliance for existing patients. Expanded take-up of prescription drugs accounts for about
70% of the total effect of advertising, while increased use among existing patients accounts for
the remaining 30%. As an important component of this latter effect, we estimate that a 10
percent increase in advertising views increases adherence to a drug therapy by 1 to 2.5 percent.
Finally, we assess whether the increase in advertising led simply to substitution from non-
advertised to advertised drugs or whether it generated a net increase in drug utilization for drug
classes. We find evidence that advertising also increased the use of non-advertised drugs in the
same therapeutic class as an advertised drug. This suggests substantial positive spillover effects
on the use of non-advertised drugs within the same drug classes.
        The utilization results are robust to geographic area-specific trends, sample restrictions,
and alternative specifications of the instrument. We also find little evidence in favor of alternate
causal channels. First, Part D did not differentially reduce out-of-pocket drug prices in high
elderly share areas, ruling out concurrent price effects that could independently impact drug
utilization.   Second, changes in direct-to-physician advertising after Part D appear to be
unrelated to elderly share. Finally, in a placebo test estimating the differential effects of Part D
on drug utilization for classes of drugs that do not advertise, we find effects that are very small or
null relative to the effects for classes of drugs that do advertise, providing support that the
observed changes in utilization are due to advertising and not driven by other potential spillovers
of Part D on the non-elderly (e.g. through changes in physician prescribing behavior).
        While the literature on prescription drug demand has focused heavily on the importance
of prices and insurance status in explaining utilization patterns, we generate estimates of the

                                                                                                    5
responsiveness of drug demand to a non-monetary factor and find economically important
effects. Using the range of price elasticities in the literature (Goldman, Joyce, and Zheng, 2008)
combined with our main results, our estimates imply that a 10 percent increase in advertising
exposure generates a change in prescription drug utilization equivalent to a 9 to 27 percent
reduction in out-of-pocket price. This paper also shows that by increasing insurance coverage
for one population, Part D had the effect of generating additional demand for individuals outside
of the Medicare program. These demand increases were themselves large and economically
important.
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents background on Part D and
the mechanisms for its effect on advertising, as well as a review of the related DTCA literature.
Section 3 describes the data sources. Section 4 outlines the empirical framework. Section 5
presents the results. Sections 6 and 7 provide a discussion and conclude.


2. Background and Related Literature


2.1. Why Should Medicare Part D Increase Advertising Exposure?
    Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance to the elderly, ages 65 and
over, and to qualifying non-elderly disabled individuals.       On January 1, 2006, Medicare
expanded to include coverage of outpatient prescription drugs through the introduction of Part D.
Part D was enacted as a provision of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), which was signed
into law in December of 2003, and represented one of the largest expansions of the Medicare
program since its inception. Part D substantially increased the proportion of elderly with drug
insurance and as a result lowered average out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.
Previous research has shown that this price reduction increased drug utilization among the 65+
population (e.g. Ketcham and Simon, 2008; Yin et al., 2008; Lichtenberg and Sun, 2007).
    The widespread changes brought about by Part D may have significantly altered
pharmaceutical firms’ incentives to advertise. As shown in earlier theoretical work (Lakdawalla,
Sood, and Gu, 2013), insurance expansions such as Part D can influence the return to advertising
through two mechanisms. First, both theory and prior empirical literature suggest that more
profitable markets generate greater returns to capturing new consumers, and in turn stimulate
more intense advertising effort. Thus, the returns to advertising are higher when there are more

                                                                                                6
insured consumers in the market, because insured consumers face lower out-of-pocket costs that
induce greater use and spending. Second, insurance coverage might alter the responsiveness of
consumers to advertising at the margin. If insured consumers are more responsive, firms will
face greater incentives to advertise. Indeed, prior empirical studies suggest that better insured
consumers are more responsive to advertising (Wosinska, 2002). Intuitively, an undecided
consumer might be more likely to try a new drug after being exposed to advertising if the cost of
trying the new drug is lower.       Taken together, these two effects suggest that insurance
expansions strengthen incentives for advertising and we show that this prediction is borne out in
the data.
    Given this result, we would expect drug advertising to increase more in geographic areas
with a higher share of elderly individuals (relative to areas with a low share of elderly), which
experienced a greater expansion in insurance coverage. Consistent with this idea, previous
research (Lakdawalla, Sood, and Gu, 2013) found that Part D led to a large relative increase in
national DTCA spending for drugs differentially used by Medicare beneficiaries. That paper,
which focused primarily on the effects of Part D on advertising, also suggested scope for
utilization effects of advertising using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We build
on this previous work, by exploiting a new strategy based on geographic variation in elderly
shares. The geographic variation allows us to control for drug-specific shocks, which is of
particular importance during our study period given a wave of patent expirations and black box
warnings. We also use health insurance claims data to better identify and characterize the causal
effects of advertising along both the intensive and extensive margins.


2.2. Previous Literature on Advertising Effects
    Our paper contributes to a large literature on the impacts of DTCA on drug utilization (see
Dave, 2013 for a recent survey). The majority of studies in this literature find positive demand
effects of advertising.   Although studies consistently find evidence of significant market
expansion effects from advertising (e.g. Rosenthal et al., 2003; Iizuka and Jin, 2005; Bradford et
al., 2006; Shapiro, 2015), evidence of market stealing—gaining market share from
competitors—is mixed. Some studies find no effect, and others find small but statistically
significant effects (e.g. Wosinska, 2002; Dave and Saffer, 2012).         In general the market
expansion effects appear to dominate.

                                                                                                7
        Evidence from consumer and physician surveys find that advertising increases the likelihood
that a patient initiates a request for a specific drug treatment and the likelihood that physicians
fulfill these requests (Hollon, 2005). In one randomized controlled trial, actors are sent to
doctors’ offices presenting symptoms of depression. Those who asked for a specific drug
treatment or general treatment for depression related to an ad they saw on television were
significantly more likely to be prescribed an anti-depressant relative to those who did not request
treatment (Kravitz et al., 2005). The magnitude of the effects ranged from 53-76% for those
requesting treatment relative to 31% for those not requesting treatment.
        A persistent challenge for the literature on the impact of advertising on drug utilization has
been in identifying a source of variation in advertising that is orthogonal to demand factors.7
Our study overcomes this problem by using a natural experiment—the introduction of Part D—
to study the effects of DTCA on drug utilization among those unaffected by the insurance
expansion. To our knowledge, the only other study that provides natural experiment evidence
using policy variation is a working paper by Sinkinson and Starc (2015), which exploits changes
in advertising due to political election cycles (which temporarily displace DTCA), to examine
the effects of own and rival advertising on firm revenue. The estimated elasticities in our study
tend to be larger. This may be partially explained by the differences in identification strategies,
with Sinkinson and Starc (2015) exploiting temporary reductions in advertising and our study
exploiting a permanent increase. Given the long-lasting effects of advertising, we might expect
that temporary reductions in advertising intensity would lead to smaller effects on use. In
another related working paper, Shapiro (2015) uses variation in advertising expenditures at
discrete television market boundaries to estimate the effects of changes in advertising on drug
utilization.     This strategy assumes that trends in utilization across border-counties are not
systematically related to advertising changes and that demand shocks that drive advertising
differences are not disproportionately located along one border—assumptions that are difficult to
test.



7
  Most previous studies of DTCA have had to rely on cross-sectional or time-series variation in advertising
expenditures to identify the effect on drug utilization. Studies that attempt to address the endogeneity concern have
instrumented for DTCA using variables such as the age of the drug, time until patent expiration, advertising
expenditures by the same company in an unrelated drug class, and national advertising costs.



                                                                                                                    8
    Our study offers several other innovations over the prior literature. First, we use data that
measure actual exposure to advertising using Nielsen ratings (discussed below) rather than
relying on proxies such as advertising spending or number of ads aired. Nearly all DTCA
studies use advertising expenditures or volume to quantify advertising. One exception is Avery,
Eisenberg, and Simon (2012), which uses survey data from Simmons National Consumer Survey
and Kantar/TNS Media Intelligence to construct individual-level exposure to ads for anti-
depressants. In contrast to that paper, which uses self-reported anti-depressant use in the past 12
months, we have administrative pharmacy claims that enable us to construct comparatively rich
measures of utilization such as total prescriptions and days supplied.
    Second, we estimate the effects of advertising on take-up of treatment and medication
adherence, and evaluate how these component effects independently drive the overall
relationship between advertising and drug utilization.       Since much of the pharmaceutical
advertising literature has focused on total utilization effects, little is known about the
mechanisms that underlie the relationship between drug utilization and advertising. Specifically,
there is little empirical evidence on the effects of advertising on drug adherence and the few
existing studies find very small or null effects (Donohue et al. 2006; Wosinska, 2005).
Understanding the components of the drug utilization effect is needed to begin to assess whether
the increase in use induced by DTCA is welfare enhancing.
    Finally, we estimate the effects of DTCA for a large number of brand-name drugs across
several conditions. Prior studies often focus on a single drug class or a small subset of brand-
name drugs. Given that FDA policy tends to consider all types of prescription drugs uniformly,
our estimates are likely more generalizable for such policy considerations.


3. Data Sources


3.1. Advertising Data
    The data on viewership of pharmaceutical ads in local media markets come from the Nielsen
Ad*Views™ database from 2001-2010. We focus on television advertising, which accounts for
more than two-thirds of total DTCA expenditures (Avery, et al., 2012). Nielsen collects data on
the universe of television commercials shown in 210 “Designated Market Areas” (DMAs) that
span the entire United States. Each DMA is comprised of one or more counties in which the

                                                                                                 9
home market television station holds a dominance of total hours viewed.8                           Nielsen viewing
stations located in each DMA record all commercials shown and can identify “national” ads
shown in all 210 DMAs and “local” ads shown in a subset of these markets. We use data on
local ads since there is scope for targeting different amounts of advertising to different markets.
Local ads can be shown during network programming (e.g. NBC), syndicated programming, or
local television programming (e.g. local news). We obtained local advertising data for the top
100 DMAs (86.5% of TV viewers) and the top 200 advertised brand-name prescription drugs
from 2001-2010, which account for more than 96% of advertising spending.
     Our measure of DTCA exposure is Nielsen rating points. Rating points are derived from
data collected on actual viewership of television commercials for a sample of television-owning
households in each DMA. Using meters attached to participants’ televisions or paper diaries,
Nielsen records who in the household is watching and what they are watching 24 hours a day.
“Rating points” are simply the fraction of the sample that watched a particular commercial. In
our data, we observe rating points for each brand-name prescription drug, DMA, quarter, and for
two age groups (ages 2-64 and ages 65+), which is defined as follows:

                                        # 𝑜𝑓 𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤𝑠 𝑗𝑚𝑎𝑡
    (1) 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑗𝑚𝑎𝑡 =                               x 100
                                       #𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑡



Where 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑗𝑚𝑎𝑡 are computed as the total number of views of commercials for brand-
name drug 𝑗 in market (DMA) 𝑚, in age-group 𝑎, and in quarter 𝑡 divided by the total number of
individuals in the sample in market (DMA) 𝑚, in age-group 𝑎, and in quarter 𝑡, multiplied by
100. We divide rating points by 100 in order to interpret this measure as average views per
person. Rating points for a brand can increase if the number of commercials increases, the
commercials become better targeted (e.g. primetime vs. late night), and/or more individuals in
the market watch television.            Nielsen rating points are the industry standard for measuring
television viewership and have the advantage of being a more direct measure of advertising
exposure than total advertising expenditures or the number of ads, which have been the
predominant measures of advertising in the DTCA literature to date.9

8
  For example, the Los Angeles DMA contains 8 counties in the surrounding area which have relatively
homogeneous television programming.
9
  Nielsen collects very limited data on advertising expenditures at the local level. Expenditure data is not available
for local commercials shown during network or syndicated programming, which comprise the majority of local

                                                                                                                     10
        While in recent years, a variety of alternative methods for watching television
programming have been introduced—such as time shifted viewing (e.g. DVR) and Internet
viewing— traditional live television still remains the dominant medium. In the third quarter of
2014, adults ages 50-64 watched on average 43.2 hours of television programming per week, of
which only 3.8 hours were time-shifted and an additional 1.2 hours were spent watching video
on the Internet (Nielsen, 2014). Since most of our study period from 2004-2010 precedes the
widespread adoption of time-shifted viewing and the introduction of Netflix, YouTube, Hulu,
and other Internet streaming services, we expect that the share of our sample that is not watching
television live is very small. Moreover, Nielsen does account for most time-shifted viewing in
its rating points by including views of all recorded programming watched within seven days of
its initial release.


3.2. Drug Utilization Data
     We construct measures of drug utilization using a database of insurance claims from more
than 40 large national employers, including many Fortune 500 companies, for 2004-2010.10
These data were compiled by a prominent health benefits consulting company and cover
approximately 18 million person-years during the study period. The claims dataset is described
in more detail in several previous studies (e.g. Goldman et al., 2004; Goldman and Joyce, 2007;
Joyce et al., 2007).
     The pharmacy claims include detailed information about all outpatient prescription drug
purchases including the drug name, National Drug Code (NDC), days supplied (e.g. 30 days, 60
days, etc.), and payments. We link the claims data by NDC with data from IMS Health to obtain
consistently defined drug names and therapeutic drug classes for each prescription. Limited
demographic information is provided on the claims, including gender, age, marital status, and the
three-digit ZIP code of residence.
     We restrict our analysis to individuals with full-year insurance coverage and aged 40-60.11
This group is closer in age to Medicare eligibility and thus more likely to be using similar types


commercials. Only commercials shown during “local television” programming (e.g. local news) have expenditure
data. For this reason, we do not use expenditure data in this study.
10
   Data from this company prior to 2004 is not defined in a consistent way with data from 2004 onwards, thus we
cannot use it in our analysis.
11
   We exclude ages 61-64 out of concern that individuals close in age to Medicare eligibility may change their drug
utilization behavior in anticipation of future Part D coverage (Alpert, 2015).

                                                                                                                 11
of prescription drugs as Medicare beneficiaries. We only include individuals who live in the top
100 Nielsen DMAs, which represents about 95 percent of pharmacy claims.
     We use the three-digit ZIP code to match the claims data with the Nielsen advertising data.
Each person in the claims data is assigned to a local advertising market (DMA) based on their
ZIP code of residence to determine their potential advertising exposure in each quarter. One
limitation of our data is that Nielsen DMAs are defined in terms of five-digit ZIP codes, while
we only observe individuals’ three-digit ZIP codes in the claims. Some three-digit ZIP codes
overlap multiple DMAs, so it is not possible to assign these individuals to a single DMA with
certainty. Instead we assign these individuals the population-weighted12 average of advertising
exposure (rating points) across all of the possible DMAs where they could reside. About 30
percent of the individuals in the claims data receive this probabilistic measure of advertising
exposure. Consequently, we use the three-digit ZIP code as the effective advertising market
rather than the DMA, since advertising exposure is constant within three-digit ZIP codes for all
individuals in the sample. As we will show below, effects are similar if we restrict the data to
the subsample with a single DMA match.
     We initially focus on two variables: total number of prescriptions purchased and total days
supplied. We aggregate these measures to quarterly totals for each person by drug. For most
analyses, we focus on drugs that treat five chronic conditions:                       depression, diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and osteoporosis. There are 50 drugs for these conditions that
were advertised during our study period and are contained in the Nielsen top 200 (see list of
drugs in Appendix Table B.1). We collapse the data to the three-digit ZIP code level by
condition, to conduct our analyses at the level of variation in advertising exposure. Since Part D
affected advertising incentives for all drugs and due to the possibility of spillovers across drugs
treating the same condition, we do not conduct a drug-level analysis and instead perform our
analysis at the condition-level.         This results in 107,345 ZIP code-by-condition-by-quarter
observations. In computing mean prescriptions purchased and mean days supplied within a ZIP
code and condition, zeros are included for individuals who were enrolled in a health insurance




12
  Population weights for the 5-digit ZIP code level come from the 2000 Decennial Census. In the Census,
population estimates are aggregated by ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and we use a 5-digit ZIP code to
ZCTA crosswalk to obtain the 5-digit ZIP code population estimates.

                                                                                                            12
plan but did not purchase any drugs for the condition.13 Separate means are computed for
advertised and non-advertised drugs14 within each of the five chronic conditions. We focus
primarily on advertised drugs and use non-advertised drugs in select specifications.
     We also construct a measure of drug adherence for individuals who filled at least one
prescription for any of the five chronic conditions. We measure adherence between the quarter
of the individual’s first drug claim through the quarter of their last drug claim for that
condition.15 We consider adherence as receiving continuous treatment for a condition, 16 rather
than for a specific brand since this is the more relevant dimension from a policy and welfare
perspective. Adherence is measured quarterly and separately for each condition as the
medication possession ratio (MPR), which is a widely used method for measuring medication
compliance with claims data (Peterson, et al., 2007; Hess, et al., 2006). The MPR is calculated
as the number of days with drug on-hand (i.e. days supplied) divided by the number of days in
the quarter.
     We adjust the numerator of the MPR to account for claims with overlapping days supplied.
For example, it is typical to refill a prescription before finishing the days supplied for the initial
prescription. The extra days supplied during the overlap period may not indicate better drug
adherence. If overlapping claims have the same active ingredient,17 we assume that the person
finishes the days supplied in the first claim before starting the days supplied in the second claim.
A refill of an existing medication or a switch from a brand name to generic product would fall
under this category. For overlapping claims with different active ingredient names (for the same
condition), we assume that patients start using the days supplied for the second claim on the fill
date and throw away the remaining days supplied for the first claim. This case likely represents a
drug switch that resulted from an unsatisfactory response to the initial medication. Since




13
   In other words, in the individual-level data, each person gets 5 observations for each of the conditions in each
quarter whether or not they were diagnosed with the condition. If they do not use a drug for that condition, the
observation is zero. We do not condition on having a diagnosis as advertising might affect the rate of diagnosis.
14
   Non-advertised drugs (typically off-patent brands or generics) are drugs that belong to the same therapeutic drug
classes as the 50 advertised chronic brand-name drugs, but do not advertise during our study period.
15
   In some specifications, we account for discontinuation by computing an alternative measure of adherence where
we assume that a person is non-adherent after their last observed drug claim.
16
   Specifically, we combine utilization for advertised drugs with the non-advertised drugs in the same therapeutic
classes as the advertised drugs.
17
   Combination drugs are viewed as a unique combination of two or more active ingredients.

                                                                                                                   13
advertising may lead to more drug switching, it is especially important to account for this case to
avoid overstating the effect of advertising on adherence.18
     After constructing the quarterly MPR for each individual by condition, we also create a
binary indicator for individuals who had MPR ≥80%, which is considered high adherence and is
the threshold most commonly reported in the pharmaceutical literature (Andrade, et al., 2006).
As before, we collapse the data by three-digit ZIP code, condition, and quarter, computing the
mean MPR and the proportion of individuals with MPR ≥80% in each cell.


3.3. Population Data
     We compute the share of the population that is 65 and over (i.e. eligible for Medicare) in
each local advertising market (DMA) using the 2000 Census. From the advertiser’s perspective,
the DMA is the relevant market. For individuals who cannot be matched to a single DMA, they
are assigned the population-weighted average of the elderly share across all possible DMAs
where they could reside. There is substantial heterogeneity in the share of the population that is
65+ across markets, ranging from 8% in the Houston DMA to 26% in Fort Myers-Naples DMA
(see Table 1). The elderly share is used to construct the instrument. This share is held constant
at the DMA’s 2000 value so that no identification originates from changes in the elderly share.


3.4. Descriptive Statistics
     In Table 2, we present sample means for the advertising variables by elderly share for 2005
and 2007, before and after Part D. For each year, we split the 100 DMAs into above-median
elderly share markets and below-median elderly share markets. Average views per person of
pharmaceutical ads are much greater for elderly viewers (ages 65+) relative to non-elderly
viewers (ages 2-64). For example, in low elderly share markets in 2005, elderly viewers saw on
average 1,184 pharmaceutical ads per year compared to 387 ads for non-elderly viewers. This
difference is likely driven by the targeting of pharmaceutical ads to programming that elderly
viewers watch, as well as the fact that older viewers watch more hours of television per year.
Comparing the change in views per person from 2005 to 2007 across market types, we observe a



18
  Days in the hospital were assumed to be fully compliant and patients resumed their prescriptions after they were
discharged.

                                                                                                                 14
three to five times larger increase in ads viewed in high elderly share markets for elderly and
non-elderly viewers following Part D.
     Table 2 also reveals differences in the average population size across high and low elderly
share markets. High elderly share markets tend to be less populated than low elderly share
markets. This may be partially due to retiree preferences for less urban areas. This result
suggests that it will be important to include market fixed effects in all of our analyses.


4. Empirical Strategy


     To understand the impact of DTCA on drug utilization, we exploit quasi-experimental
variation in advertising exposure after the introduction of Part D for non-elderly adults living in
high elderly share areas. Specifically, we capture the differential change in DTCA exposure
across high and low elderly share areas by estimating the following difference-in-difference
equation, our first-stage relationship:


     (2) 𝐷𝑇𝐶𝐴𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 = 𝛽(𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒65𝑚 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝜇𝑚 + 𝛼𝑐 + 𝜖 𝑚𝑐𝑡


Where 𝐷𝑇𝐶𝐴𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 is average views per person (rating points) for non-elderly individuals ages
2-64 in market 𝑚 in quarter 𝑡 for ads related to condition 𝑐. The market 𝑚 is the three-digit ZIP
code.19 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒65𝑚 is the share of population 65+ in market 𝑚 in 200020, and 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 is an
indicator that equals 1 in the post-Part D period (2006-2010). Thus 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒65𝑚 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 is our
instrument for DTCA exposure for the non-elderly. In some specifications we use an alternative
form of this instrument, 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝐸𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑚 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 , where 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝐸𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑚 is an
indicator that equals 1 if the market 𝑚 has an above-median elderly share. This instrument does
not restrict the impact of elderly share to have a linear relationship with advertising but, instead,
considers the possibility of non-linear effects. We use the share of the population 65+ rather


19
   As discussed in Section 3.2, we collapse the data to the 3-digit ZIP code level rather than the DMA-level, since a
subset of the sample resides in 3-digit ZIP codes that cross multiple DMAs and cannot be matched to a single DMA.
We assign these individuals the population-weighted average advertising exposure across all the DMAs where they
might reside. Thus, our constructed advertising exposure measure is constant within 3-digit ZIP codes, but not
always within DMAs.
20
   The 65+ share is also computed at the DMA level since this is the relevant market from the advertiser’s
perspective. For individuals whose 3-digit ZIP code cannot be matched to a single DMA, they receive the
population weighted average of the 65+ share across all the DMAs where they might reside.

                                                                                                                  15
than the level 65+ as our instrument to reflect advertising incentives. The cost of advertising is
based on the total number of viewers in a market, so the cost per elderly viewer is lower in
markets with a high elderly share. Thus, we would expect that firms targeting elderly viewers
would advertise more in high elderly share markets.                      Since geographic areas with a high
concentration of elderly are potentially different from areas with a low concentration, all of our
analyses condition on market fixed effects, which account non-parametrically for cross-sectional
differences by elderly share. We also include time fixed effects to account for secular time
trends and condition fixed effects to account for differences in utilization and returns to
advertising across conditions. Standard errors are clustered at the three-digit ZIP code level
(market 𝑚) to account for serial correlation within areas as well as correlation across conditions
within areas.
         Next, we estimate a reduced form equation comparing changes in drug utilization for the
non-elderly across areas with a high elderly share relative to a low elderly share. By focusing on
the non-elderly population, we can isolate the effects of advertising on drug utilization from the
direct effects of Part D on utilization. The equation for the reduced form is as follows:


     (3) 𝑌𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 = 𝜃(𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒65𝑚 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝜌𝑡 + 𝜎𝑚 + 𝜏𝑐 + 𝜖 𝑚𝑐𝑡


Where 𝑌𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 is mean total prescriptions or days supply for non-elderly individuals in market
𝑚 in quarter 𝑡 for advertised drugs that treat condition 𝑐. We also use this reduced form model
to estimate effects on other measures of drug utilization including prescriptions purchased (or
days supplied) conditional on use, the probability of any drug use, and drug adherence. We scale
the reduced form effect by the first stage to obtain the 2SLS estimate: the effect of advertising on
prescriptions purchased.21




21
  It should be noted that the Nielsen data on advertising exposure is available for the 2-64 age group, while we
select on ages 40-60 (individuals who are likely to be using similar drugs as Medicare beneficiaries) in the
utilization data. Our advertising elasticity estimates will not be biased by this age-group selection if the proportional
change in advertising exposure after Part D is the same across ages. As shown below, individuals 2-64 and 65+
have the same proportional change in advertising exposure after Part D, which supports this assumption.

                                                                                                                      16
5. Results


     Our analysis proceeds in three steps. We first provide evidence that our instrument predicts
changes in advertising exposure, a necessary condition for identifying the impact of advertising
on drug utilization. Second, we estimate the causal impact of advertising exposure on total drug
utilization for the non-elderly using two-stage least squares. Third, we investigate the causal
pathways along which advertising operates by decomposing the total utilization effect into
intensive and extensive margin effects including drug adherence and take-up.


5.1. First-Stage Effects of Part D on Advertising Exposure


5.1.1. Overall Sample of Drugs
         We begin by showing graphically that the share of the population that is 65+ in an area is
strongly predictive of differential changes in advertising exposure after Part D. Figure 2 plots
mean annual views per person (rating points) of ads for the top 200 brand-name pharmaceuticals
from 2001-2010, comparing DMAs with above-median and below-median elderly shares. The
figures show views by the non-elderly under age 65. Prior to 2006, both the levels and trends in
advertising exposure for the non-elderly are nearly identical across geographic areas. However,
after Part D was implemented in 2006, advertising exposure increases sharply for non-elderly
living in areas with a high elderly share relative to those living in areas with a low elderly share.
This difference persists through the end of the study period.22
         Since we are following a balanced panel of 200 brand-name drugs, there is a secular
downward trend in overall advertising over this time period due to the “aging” of these drugs.
This pattern mimics the decline in national advertising expenditures shown in Figure 1. Several
of the drugs in our sample lost patent protection over the study period.23 Since off-patent drugs
typically do not advertise (Dave, 2013), patent expirations reduce aggregate advertising
expenditures. If we exclude drugs that lost patent protection during this period (see Panel B of

22
   The patterns in advertising exposure are similar for elderly viewers, as seen in Appendix Figure B.1. Prior to Part
D, the trends are parallel but there is less advertising exposure in high elderly share areas, perhaps due to the lower
rates of drug insurance coverage (and income) in these areas. After Part D, the pattern flips with an immediate
relative increase in advertising exposure in areas with a high elderly share.
23
   Notably, there were 4 major patent expirations that occurred around 2006 for four of the top 200 drugs (Pravachol,
Wellbutrin XL, Zocor, and Zoloft) as well as a wave of other major patent expirations during the late 2000s.

                                                                                                                    17
Figure 2), we instead find an upward trend in overall advertising views. We assume that markets
with a low-share of elderly and a high-share of elderly are similarly affected by common
nationwide shocks such as those driven by drugs losing patent protection. Given the similar pre-
trends in advertising exposure across markets, this assumption likely holds.
         We estimate the magnitude of this differential change in advertising exposure using a
difference-in-difference model similar to Equation 2 at the DMA level (see Appendix Table
B.2). Comparing non-elderly individuals in areas with high elderly share to their peers in low
elderly share areas, we find that Part D generated an additional 25 ads viewed per year, or about
one additional ad every other week.             This represents a 6 percent increase from the mean
                                24
advertising exposure level.          As a point of comparison, we estimate the change in advertising
exposure for elderly viewers (ages 65+). For the elderly, the effect of Part D on the number of
ads viewed is much larger, as expected, since Medicare beneficiaries are likely the intended
target audience for these ads. We find that Part D generated an additional 72 ads viewed per
year, or an additional ad every 5 days, for elderly viewers in high elderly share markets relative
to their peers in low elderly share markets (see Column 2 of Appendix Table B.2). This
represents a 6.3 percent increase relative to the mean for this group.
         These results confirm that the introduction of Part D is associated with a large relative
increase in advertising exposure for the elderly in high elderly share areas and that there are
substantial spillover effects on exposure for the non-elderly. This result is consistent with the
hypothesis that Part D increased the returns to advertising more in areas with higher elderly
share.


5.1.2. Chronic Drugs
         While the above results verify a strong relationship between the instrument and
advertising exposure for all drugs in our sample, we also assess the predictive power of the
instrument for our primary analysis sample of chronic drugs for five conditions (depression,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis) that are prevalent among Medicare
beneficiaries25 and account for a large share of advertising, as described in Section 3.2. Since


24
   Using the coefficient from the binary instrument in Appendix Table B.2 and the annual mean for views per person
in high elderly share markets in 2005 in Table 2, we calculate the percentage change as (6.233*4)/413=0.06.
25
   These five conditions are among the most common conditions for Medicare beneficiaries: 58% have hypertension,
45% hyperlipidemia, 28% diabetes, 14% depression, 7% osteoporosis (CMS, 2012).

                                                                                                               18
these drugs are predominantly used by the elderly, they would likely experience the largest
increase in advertising from Part D.
        First, we replicate the graphical evidence from above for the chronic drugs sample. In
Panel A of Figure 3, we plot mean views per person of ads for the selected brand-name chronic
drugs. The data are plotted at the quarterly level and for 2004-2010, which corresponds to the
quarterly claims data. Although the quarterly data are somewhat noisier, the patterns are the
same as they were for the full sample of drugs. Levels and trends in non-elderly advertising
exposure are nearly identical across high and low elderly share areas prior to Part D and then
diverge sharply in 2006. In fact, advertising exposure for the non-elderly is greater in high
elderly share areas compared to low elderly share areas in every quarter after Part D.
        We estimate the analogous difference-in-differences regression model shown in Equation
2. This specification represents the first-stage in our research design.                  Panel A of Table 3
presents the first-stage results using the “Post” variable interacted with Share 65+ as the
instrument, while Panel B interacts “Post” with a binary indicator for above-median elderly share
(mirroring the graphical evidence). Consistent with the full sample of drugs, we find a strong
relationship between the introduction of Part D and differential changes in advertising of chronic
drugs across geographic areas. Using the continuous instrument in Panel A, the results show that
a geographic area with a one percentage point higher elderly share experienced an increase in
quarterly advertising exposure of 0.06 views per person after Part D (significant at the 1% level).
Panel B compares above-median to below-median elderly share areas and shows markedly
similar results.26 Comparing high to low elderly share areas, ads viewed for chronic brand-name
drugs increased by 8.1 percent relative to the baseline mean.               Additionally, the F-statistics for
the binary and continuous instruments are 30.86 and 32.69, respectively, which are well above
conventionally accepted levels (Stock, Wright, and Yogo, 2002), confirming the power of the
instruments.


5.1.3. Validity of the Instrument
        As evidence that there are no other differential shocks to advertising incentives occurring
around 2006, we implement a simple placebo test for our research design by estimating the effect

26
  Considering the mean difference between high and low elderly share areas, the continuous instrument estimate
implies that moving from an average low to high elderly share area would lead to an increase of 0.25 (4*0.06358)
views per quarter. This is similar to the estimate using the binary instrument in Panel B which is 0.35.

                                                                                                                   19
of Part D on exposure to advertising for contraceptive drugs. Since contraceptives are unlikely
to be used by the elderly, their advertising should be unaffected by Part D. In fact, we find no
differential effect of Part D on advertising exposure for the non-elderly across high versus low
elderly share markets, as shown in Figure 4. The levels and trends of advertising exposure for
contraceptives across areas are virtually identical before and after Part D. This finding is
consistent with Lakdawalla, Sood, and Gu, (2013), who find larger relative increases in national
advertising expenditures for drugs with a higher Medicare market share following Part D.
Moreover, as we showed above, changes in advertising exposure after 2006 were larger for the
elderly compared to the non-elderly, as would be expected if the change in advertising were due
to Part D.       Taken together, this evidence provides reassurance that Part D, not another
confounder, is driving the differential changes in advertising. We provide further evidence that
the corresponding estimated utilization effects are not driven by other factors in Section 5.2.


5.2. Second-Stage Effects of Advertising Exposure on Drug Utilization


 5.2.1. Baseline Estimates
         Having shown that Part D had a substantial differential impact on advertising exposure
for high elderly share markets, we next analyze how non-elderly drug utilization responded to
this shock to advertising. First, we graph the trends in total prescriptions purchased by the non-
elderly across above-median and below-median elderly share areas in Panel B of Figure 3. We
continue to focus on the sample of brand-name chronic drugs. Prior to Part D, drug utilization
trends track each other very closely in high and low elderly share areas, but then diverge
precisely in 2006 with a relative increase in utilization for non-elderly living in high elderly
share markets.27 This graph mirrors the patterns in advertising exposure, and provides visual
evidence of strong effects of advertising on utilization.
         Next, we estimate the reduced form difference-in-differences specification in Equation 3
using the total number of chronic prescriptions purchased by the non-elderly as the outcome
variable.    The effect of Part D on non-elderly drug utilization is positive and statistically


27
   Again, the overall reduction in brand-name chronic drug prescriptions in 2006 is due to patent expirations for
these drugs, as patients switched to generic versions. In results not shown, when we exclude the 4 major drugs that
went off patent in 2006 (Pravachol, Wellbutrin, Zocor, and Zoloft) from the analysis sample, we find a flatter overall
trend in utilization across the period and a similar divergence in trends across high vs. low elderly share in 2006.

                                                                                                                   20
significant at the 1% level for both the continuous and binary measures of elderly share. Column
2 of Table 3 shows that the number of chronic prescriptions filled increased by 4.5 percent after
Part D in high elderly share markets relative to low elderly share markets.
           We also assess the timing of the utilization effect as well as the common trends
assumption, by estimating an event-study regression where the outcome variable is the number
of chronic prescriptions purchased. The event-study replaces the 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒65𝑚 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 variable in
Equation 3 with a full set of quarter dummies interacted with the elderly share measure. Each
coefficient estimate gives the difference in prescriptions purchased in high elderly share versus
low elderly share areas relative to the omitted reference period: quarter 4 of 2005 (the quarter
before Part D begins). These coefficients are reported in Table 4 for both the continuous and
binary measures of elderly share. High and low elderly share areas had the same pre-trends in
prescriptions purchased, as reflected in the statistically insignificant (and close to zero)
coefficients prior to 2006. The coefficients then immediately become positive and statistically
significant in quarter 1 of 2006 when Part D begins. The effect persists through the end of the
study period and remains relatively constant. These patterns hold for both versions of the
instrument.         Since these results show that there was an immediate differential utilization
response to Part D across areas, any alternative explanation for the utilization effect would need
to coincide precisely with the introduction of Part D.
           In Column 3 of Table 3, we present instrumental variable estimates for the effect of
advertising exposure on total prescriptions filled for brand-name chronic drugs. Panel A shows
the 2SLS estimate using the continuous elderly share instrument, while Panel B shows results for
the binary instrument. The results suggest that an additional ad viewed would lead to an increase
of 0.014 to 0.017 prescriptions filled for a chronic condition among the entire sample of non-
elderly individuals. In other words, if an ad were viewed by 59 to 71 individuals, it would result
in one additional prescription being filled.28 Using the mean for prescriptions filled and ads
viewed, the implied elasticity of demand with respect to advertising for chronic drugs is 0.54.
           This estimate cannot be directly compared to previous elasticity estimates in the literature
because it measures the responsiveness to advertising exposure, whereas most studies measure
responsiveness to advertising expenditures. We would expect that the expenditure elasticities
would be smaller if there were diminishing returns to advertising. In this case, additional

28
     The estimates are for the continuous and binary instruments, respectively (1/0.017=59 and 1/0.014=71).

                                                                                                              21
increases in advertising dollars would lead to less than proportional increases in views. Indeed,
in a review of the literature on advertising elasticities for a wide range of consumer products,
Sethuraman et al. (2011) show that elasticities measured with respect to advertising views are on
average 2.3 times larger than elasticities measured with respect to advertising expenditures.
Applying this “conversion factor” to our estimate implies an advertising expenditure elasticity of
0.23, which is within the range of prior estimates in the DTCA literature.29


 5.2.2. Robustness Tests
        Our baseline estimates are not sensitive to trends and sample restrictions, which we show
through a series of robustness tests. First, we add ZIP code specific linear trends as an additional
test for differential pre-trends across areas. Second, as a sensitivity analysis, we restrict our
sample to 2004-2007 in order to exclude the years during and after the 2008 Great Recession.
This addresses potential composition changes from layoffs or reduced insurance offerings and
take-up. Third, we include only the employers that were continuously in the claims data for all
years. Fourth, we test for differential changes in the demographic characteristics of enrollees
across high and low elderly share areas.
        The results of these robustness tests are presented in Table 5. Each cell represents a
separate regression where the reported estimate is the coefficient on the instrument (either the
continuous or binary version). We report the reduced form and 2SLS estimates separately. The
first row in Table 5 repeats the baseline estimates. In the second row, we add interactions of ZIP
code fixed effects and a linear time trend to the model in Equation 3. This specification allows
for systematically different trends in drug utilization across higher and lower elderly share
markets. Since the results remain quite similar in magnitude and are highly significant, such
trends appear not to be exerting substantial influence on our results.                    This reinforces our
descriptive figures and event study analysis, neither of which showed evidence of pre-existing
differential trends across high and low elderly share areas.
        We also test for whether the composition of the claims sample changed before and after
Part D differentially across areas with high and low elderly shares. Differential composition
changes that are correlated with drug utilization would bias our estimates. We implement three


29
  See for example, Berndt et al., 1995; Rosenthal et al., 2003; Kalyanaram, 2009; Dave and Saffer, 2012; Sinkinson
and Starc, 2015.

                                                                                                                22
tests for sample composition changes. First, we consider changes in the composition of the
claims data due to the 2008 Great Recession. We observe a decline in the number of firms and
the average number of employees in each firm beginning in 2008, which suggests that firms are
laying off workers, discontinuing health insurance benefits, and/or workers are reducing their
take-up of insurance.          Workers remaining in our sample during the recession may be
observationally different than those in the pre-recession sample. However, this is only a concern
to the extent that these composition changes are differentially occurring across high versus low
elderly share markets. Row 3 of Table 5 shows the reduced form and 2SLS estimates excluding
the recession years 2008-2010. The results are robust to this exclusion verifying that changes in
the composition of the sample were not differential by elderly share.
        Second, we evaluate the effects of firm churn in the claims data more generally. Out of
the 41 firms that we observe in the claims data, 13 firms are observed (i.e. were clients of the
health benefits consulting firm) in all seven years of the study period. These firms account for
about 50 percent of drug claims. On average, we observe firms for five (typically) consecutive
years. In row 4 of Table 5, we re-estimate the drug utilization results using only the firms that
were continuously in the sample in all years. The results are very similar to the baseline
estimates, although the precision is reduced slightly due to the smaller sample size.
        Third, we examine whether individual characteristics change around Part D differentially
across high and low elderly share markets.               Given the lack of detailed information about
demographic characteristics in the claims data, we assign each person the average characteristics
of their three-digit ZIP code of residence using the 2000 Decennial Census.30 In Appendix
Figure B.2, we plot average demographic characteristics (median income, percent black, percent
with high school education, and percent with more than high school education) for the entire
non-elderly sample across high and low elderly share markets. 31                      While there are small
composition changes throughout the time period, we do not observe any large differential
changes in the demographic characteristics of the sample, and especially not around the



30
   We obtain census characteristics at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level. Average characteristics at the 3-
digit ZIP code level are the population-weighted average across the ZCTAs within the 3-digit ZIP code.
31
   The average characteristics for each ZIP code are held constant at 2000 levels, so any observed changes in
characteristics over the sample period come from shifts in the sample towards more or less disadvantaged ZIP codes.
Also, given the sample restriction that we only include individuals with full-year insurance coverage, the average
characteristics are constant within a year.

                                                                                                                23
introduction of Part D. Together, these three tests strongly suggest that composition changes in
the claims data are not driving the observed differential changes in drug utilization.


 5.2.3. Alternative Explanations for Utilization Effects
        In this section, we assess the significance of possible alternative explanations for the
observed trends in drug use for the non-elderly. Specifically, we test whether Part D led to: 1)
differential reductions in drug prices across high and low elderly share areas; 2) differential
changes in physician prescribing behavior for non-elderly patients; and 3) increased detailing
efforts that were differentially targeted across DMAs. As shown below, we do not find any
evidence to support these alternative hypotheses.
        We first examine whether pharmaceutical firms lowered drug prices more in areas with a
higher elderly share after Part D, which could lead to a differential increase in drug utilization.
Previous studies found that national retail prices declined after Part D for drugs that are most
commonly used by Medicare beneficiaries due to the increased bargaining power of insurers
(Duggan and Scott Morton, 2010; Lakdawalla and Yin, 2015). However, it is not known:
whether these retail price reductions were passed along to patients in the form of lower copays,
which is ultimately what determines consumer drug demand; whether out-of-pocket price
reductions for the elderly “spilled over” to the non-elderly; and whether out-of-pocket prices
declined more in areas with a higher elderly share.                 Our main specification (Equation 3)
presumes that any price effects did not disproportionately affect high elderly share areas, and we
can test this assumption explicitly in our data.
        Using the claims data, Figure 5 plots trends in average out-of-pocket prices for the non-
elderly across high and low elderly share areas. We compute the average out-of-pocket price for
each advertised chronic brand-name drug in each ZIP code and quarter at the level of the
National Drug Code (NDC).32 Using the NDC ensures that the features of the product remain
constant over time. It appears that there is a slight overall increase in out-of-pocket prices after
Part D, though there is no differential effect across geographic areas around the implementation




32
  The NDC is a unique eleven-digit identification number assigned by the FDA to every drug product in the United
States. The digits correspond to the manufacturer ID, strength, dosage, and formulation of the product, and the
package size. Each brand-name drug is typically associated with multiple NDCs.

                                                                                                              24
date.33 Since we observe out-of-pocket prices only for drugs that are purchased, it is possible
that the price trends reflect movements in the composition of drugs purchased towards newer,
more expensive, products. To address this, in Panel B, we restrict the sample to a balanced panel
of NDCs that are observed in every quarter.34 Again, we observe an increasing trend in out-of-
pocket prices and, importantly, no differential trends across high and low elderly share areas.
Thus, we find little evidence that the drug utilization patterns can be explained by price changes.
         Second, we consider the possibility that there were other spillovers of Part D on the non-
elderly, unrelated to advertising, such as changes to physician prescribing behavior. Part D
increased the volume of prescriptions written for the elderly, which may influence prescribing
habits, leading physicians to write more prescriptions for their non-elderly patients as well.35 To
test for this possibility (and other types of spillovers from Part D on the non-elderly), we
compare drug utilization across areas for drug classes that advertised during the study period
relative to drug classes that did not advertise.           If increased utilization by the non-elderly were
driven by spillovers unrelated to advertising, we would expect to see increases in utilization for
all drug classes (whether or not they advertised).
         Figure 6 compares non-elderly drug utilization before and after Part D across high and
low elderly share markets for both advertised and non-advertised drug classes. For this test we
draw from the full sample of drug classes, not only the five chronic conditions we analyzed
previously. We identify 43 drug classes that had a positive amount of advertising36 during the
study period, and the remaining 52 drug classes did not advertise.37 We restrict the sample to the
top 10 most widely used advertised drug classes and top 10 non-advertised drug classes among



33
   The sawtooth pattern in the figure results from non-linear insurance contracts, which generate higher cost-sharing
at the beginning of the year and lower cost-sharing at the end of the year, once deductibles and stop-loss thresholds
have been met.
34
   We restrict the sample to 2004-2007 to maximize the number of NDCs that we can include in the balanced panel.
35
   For example, by prescribing more drugs to elderly patients, a physician may learn more about the drugs’
therapeutic benefits, leading to more prescribing of successful treatments to all patients. Physicians might also
develop prescribing habits based on the increased volume of elderly prescribing which spills over to other patients.
36
   We use the first two digits of the GPI code (available from IMS Health) to identify major classes of drugs. The
advertised drug classes are those associated with the 200 advertised brand-name drugs included in our Nielsen
sample. Since these 200 drugs represent 96% of local advertising spending, this represents a virtual census of
advertised drug classes.
37
   Advertising is related to the amount of generic penetration in the drug class. For example, among anti-
hyperlipdemics, a widely advertised class of drugs, 26 percent of the claims in our sample are for generics. On the
other hand, diuretics, which have been available for decades and have almost a 100 percent share of generic claims,
saw no advertising during the study period.

                                                                                                                   25
individuals ages 40-60 in order to ensure that the drugs classes are relevant for the non-elderly
population (see Appendix Table B.3 for the list of included drug classes).
       We find a large relative increase in the use of advertised drugs in high elderly share
markets immediately following Part D, but we observe only a very slight increase in the use of
non-advertised drugs. Using a triple-difference regression which is analogous to the graph (see
Table 6, Panel B), we find that the utilization effect for non-advertised drugs is in fact close to
zero and statistically insignificant. Meanwhile, the effect for advertised drugs is large and
statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Using the continuous instrument for the elderly
share in Panel A of Table 6, we find a small positive effect of Part D on utilization of non-
advertised drugs, but the effect for advertised drugs is more than five times as large. Even the
proportional change relative to the mean is much smaller for non-advertised drugs.              The
substantially larger effects of Part D on utilization for advertised drug classes compared to non-
advertised drug classes, suggests that the observed increase in utilization is driven by advertising,
rather than other types of spillover effects, such as physician prescribing behavior, which would
lead to increases in the use of advertised and non-advertised drugs alike.
       Finally, we assess whether pharmaceutical “detailing” (promotional activity directed to
physicians) may have increased differentially across areas after the introduction of Part D. Since
Part D increased the returns to advertising to both consumers and physicians, it is possible that
there was also an increase in detailing efforts in DMAs with a high concentration of elderly.
Depending on whether detailing is a substitute or complement for direct-to-consumer
advertising, this could bias our findings towards or away from zero. A previous study showed
that detailing and direct-to-consumer advertising are not geographically correlated. Shapiro
(2015) found, in the context of anti-depressants, that DMA-level direct-to-consumer advertising
was uncorrelated with detailing in 2001-2003. Moreover, he found that the large and sudden rise
in direct-to-consumer advertising following the 1997 change in FDA regulations did not lead to a
trend break in detailing at the national level. We reach similar conclusions in our setting.
       While we are unable to directly observe detailing data at the DMA level, we conduct an
indirect test for Part D’s effect on detailing by exploiting within DMA variation in elderly shares.
Direct-to-consumer advertising does not vary within a DMA, because local television station
signals reach all households. Detailing, however, is more localized since pharmaceutical sales
representatives can target individual physicians or practices. In other words, detailing efforts are

                                                                                                  26
not constrained by DMA boundaries and should respond to more local demand shocks. If
detailing responded to Part D, we would expect to observe a larger increase in detailing, and
consequently, utilization, in localized areas (e.g. ZIP codes) with a higher share of elderly within
a DMA. Thus, if utilization increases due to Part D operates partially through detailing, we
would expect changes in utilization within the DMA to be correlated with local elderly shares.
         To test this hypothesis, we estimate the reduced form Equation 3 with elderly shares
computed at the three-digit ZIP code level, instead of the DMA level, and include DMA x
quarter fixed effects so that identification originates only from variation in elderly share within
DMAs. If within-DMA variation plays no role, then inclusion of the DMA x quarter fixed-
effects should wipe out the estimated effects on utilization. This test is meaningful because
within-DMA variation in elderly share is significant. For example, in the Tampa-St. Petersburg
(Sarasota) DMA, the three-digit ZIP code elderly share ranges from 11% to 27%.
         The results of this test are presented in Table 7. Column 1 reproduces the baseline
reduced form results (computing elderly share at the DMA level) using only ZIP codes that can
be uniquely matched to DMAs. The results are very similar to the main results in Table 3.
Column 2 reproduces our results using elderly share computed at the three-digit ZIP code level
instead of the DMA level. The effects of ZIP code-level elderly share on total prescriptions are
of a roughly similar magnitude as the effects of DMA-level elderly share.38 Since DMA and ZIP
code elderly shares are correlated, the consistency of these results is not surprising. The main
test is presented in Column 3, which adds DMA x quarter fixed effects. Here, the effect of the
ZIP code-level elderly share goes to zero and becomes statistically insignificant for both
instruments.39 This shows that utilization did not respond to Part D differentially by elderly
share within DMAs, which is suggestive evidence that detailing did not change after Part D or, at
a minimum, that detailing responses were unrelated to elderly share.
         This lack of a response is consistent with the nature of detailing, which may be more
“sticky” than direct-to-consumer advertising. An increase in detailing requires an increase in
physicians’ time allocated to sales calls, hiring additional sales representatives, and/or displacing
promotions for other pharmaceutical products. In contrast, additional direct-to-consumer ads can


38
   Column 2 is using a noisier measure of the relevant elderly share variable and, indeed, we find that the estimate is
attenuated in Panel A. The Panel B instrument is dichotomous so classical measurement error results do not apply.
39
   The standard errors in Columns 2 and 3 are nearly the same such that the absence of an estimated effect in
Column 3 is not due to increased noise or a relative lack of intra-DMA variation.

                                                                                                                     27
be purchased almost instantaneously.40 While we cannot eliminate the concerns about detailing
entirely, we find it reassuring that detailing changes after Part D appear to be unrelated to elderly
share.


5.3. Potential Welfare Implications
     Given the substantial effect of advertising on total drug utilization, we decompose the
overall utilization effect to quantify the various causal pathways from advertising to utilization.
These results have important welfare implications from both the consumer and firm perspectives.
We conduct three analyses. First, we decompose the total utilization effect into the extensive
and intensive margins to understand advertising’s role in inducing take-up of drugs versus
greater use among existing users. Second, we examine the effects of advertising on drug
adherence, a special case of the intensive margin effect. Third, we estimate whether there are
positive spillovers of advertising on non-advertised drugs in the same drug class.


 5.3.1. Extensive vs. Intensive Margin Effects
         In Table 8, we present 2SLS estimates for extensive and intensive measures of
prescription drug use for chronic drugs. We estimate each specification separately for the full
sample and the pre-recession years 2004-2007. We estimate three margins of adjustment for
drug utilization: extensive margin effects (any prescription drug use), intensive margin effects
(number of prescriptions or days supplied conditional on use), and total effects combining both
margins. Columns 1-4 estimate total effects. Columns 1 and 2 repeat the baseline estimates
from Table 5 of total prescriptions purchased (including zeros for those who do not purchase any
chronic drugs). In Columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is days supplied of the prescription
(e.g. 30 days, 60 days, etc.), including zeros. Days supplied provides a more standardized
measure of the units of a prescription across different types of drugs. In Columns 5 and 6, we
estimate extensive margin effects as the probability of any use of a chronic drug. Finally, we
also estimate intensive margin effects in Columns 7-10: total prescriptions purchased and days
supplied, conditional on use. We find positive effects of advertising for all of the outcome
variables. The coefficients are statistically significant at the 1% or 5% level in all but two


40
  The fact that we observe an immediate utilization response after Part D also suggests that direct-to-consumer
advertising is the main driver of the effect, since detailing would be expected to adjust with a lag.

                                                                                                                  28
specifications.   The positive intensive margin effects suggest an effect of advertising on drug
adherence, which we explore more explicitly below. We perform a decomposition exercise to
compare the relative magnitude of intensive and extensive margin effects (the details of this
decomposition are in Appendix A), finding that about 70 percent of the total advertising effect
for prescriptions purchased is driven by extensive margin effects. Thus, a substantial proportion
of the utilization effect of advertising appears to come from promoting take-up among new users.


5.3.2. Effects on Drug Adherence
       We extend the above analysis of intensive margin effects by looking specifically at the
effects of advertising on drug adherence. Poor adherence to prescribed drug regimens for
chronic conditions reduces their effectiveness, leading to worse health outcomes (summarized in
DiMatteo, et al., 2002) and greater healthcare costs on the order of $100 to $289 billion annually.
Noncompliance is common with an estimated 50 percent of patients with chronic diseases not
following treatment regimens as prescribed (Viswanathan, et al., 2012). While it is difficult,
using claims data, to definitively interpret rising drug utilization due to advertising as appropriate
use, increasing drug adherence has clearer positive welfare implications because it has been
shown to improve health. Adherence is also a channel through which advertising may directly
impact consumer prescription drug behaviors independent of physician decisions. Advertising
may increase adherence if it serves as a reminder to take medication, makes the chronic
condition more salient (especially for asymptomatic diseases such as hyperlipidemia), or
increases the perceived benefits of treatment. It may also reduce adherence if it enhances
awareness of harmful side effects.
       First, we present the results for drug adherence graphically in Figure 7. This figure is
analogous to the previous figures showing the trend in drug utilization across high and low
elderly share areas, using as the outcome the proportion of non-elderly individuals with “high
adherence” (defined as MPR≥80%). Similar results for the continuous measure of MPR are in
Appendix Figure B.3. Adherence is mechanically very high in the first few quarters of the study
period because we start following patients in the quarter of their first observed drug treatment




                                                                                                   29
and most individuals in these early quarters have just initiated treatment by construction.41 This
mechanical relationship in the data is uniform across geographic areas, as is visible in Figure 7,
and should not impact our results. Additionally, we will show that excluding these early quarters
from the analysis has little effect on the results. Once the adherence measure has stabilized in
2005, we find that the proportion of non-elderly with high adherence is nearly identical across
high and low elderly share areas, but then immediately diverges in 2006. There is an absolute
and relative increase in adherence in high elderly share areas and this effect is persistent.
         To estimate the magnitude of this effect we present the corresponding regression results
for the reduced form and 2SLS estimates in Panel A of Table 9. We present results separately
for the full sample period (2004-2010), excluding the recession years (2004-2007), and
excluding the first year when adherence is mechanically high (2005-2007). The results are
qualitatively similar across samples. In the full sample, we find that comparing high elderly
share areas to low elderly share areas, Part D led to a 0.4 percentage point increase in the
proportion of individuals with high adherence (or about a 1 percent increase relative to the 2005
mean of 56%).          When restricting the sample to 2005-2007, the estimate increases to 1.2
percentage points. Only the latter estimate is statistically significant at conventional levels. The
2SLS estimates are also positive and largely significant. Given an 8.1% increase in advertising
exposure after Part D, these estimates imply an adherence elasticity with respect to advertising
ranging from 0.09 to 0.25 depending on the sample. At the high end, the number of ads viewed
would need to increase by 40 percent in order to increase adherence by 10 percent. In the full
sample, the elasticity for adherence is roughly one-sixth the size of the elasticity for total
utilization. Using the continuous MPR as the outcome variable instead of the proportion with
high adherence produces very similar estimates (see Appendix Table B.5).
         In our baseline results, we compute the MPR between a person’s first and last drug claim.
However, inappropriate discontinuation of treatment is also an important dimension of non-
adherence. In Panel B of Table 9, we compute an alternative measure of MPR where we assume
that the MPR equals zero after the last observed drug claim.42 With this measure, MPR reflects

41
   For example, in the first quarter, everyone in the sample has filled at least one prescription, so their adherence will
be atypically high. In the second quarter, everyone has filled at least one prescription in that quarter or the previous
quarter, and so forth. In later quarters, the sample composition becomes more balanced.
42
   This assumption is most appropriate for chronic conditions that require lifetime treatment. Of our five conditions,
depression may be an exception to this because treatment guidelines recommend that a patient receives treatment
until the symptoms have been alleviated and then continued only for a short time thereafter to prevent relapse, which

                                                                                                                       30
both compliance with an ongoing prescription and the rate at which medication is discontinued.
The 2SLS results using this alternative measure of MPR (Row 2) are slightly larger in both
absolute and relative terms in most samples. This is suggestive that advertising may also reduce
the rate of treatment discontinuation.
         The changes in adherence represent a combination of behaviors from both existing and
new drug users. In particular, the increase in advertising after Part D may have caused more
people to initiate drug treatment. These new entrants into the sample may have had different
underlying compliance behavior (i.e. higher or lower adherence). To isolate the adherence
responses of the existing patients from the new initiators, in Table 9 Panel B (Rows 3 and 4), we
replicate the previous table using only the sample of individuals who initiated drug treatments in
2004 or 2005, before the introduction of Part D. When we exclude the new initiators, the results
become larger for both measures of MPR. This suggests that the marginal person who initiates
treatment because of advertising is on average less compliant. A back-of-the-envelope
calculation suggests that those who initiate treatment due to advertising are about half as likely to
have high adherence (MPR≥80%) relative to existing patients.43 There are a few possible
reasons for this. The marginal person might have a less severe condition or advertising may
attract people who are less attached to treatment (e.g. someone impulsively trying something
new they saw on television only to quickly discontinue its use).                         Thus, while increasing
adherence among existing users may be welfare enhancing, the welfare effects of new initiation
due to advertising are less clear. Advertising appears to be capturing some individuals for whom
treatment is marginally less appropriate and less beneficial, or new initiators may simply comply
less with prescribed treatments. Thus, some of this additional drug use could represent wasteful
spending since initiating chronic treatments without adhering to them does not improve health.


5.4. Spillover Effects to Non-Advertised Drugs
         Finally, we analyze whether there were spillover effects of advertising on non-advertised
drugs to test for market expansion effects of advertising. While a brand’s advertising may also

could be as little as 4 months of treatment (Donahue et al., 2004). Our baseline MPR measure is conservative as it
does not assume that lifetime treatment is clinically necessary.
43
   The total effect of advertising on adherence is 0.017, which is a weighted average of the effect for new initiators
and existing patients. The adherence effect for existing patients is 0.022. The probability of drug take-up increased
by 0.001 after Part D in high elderly share areas from a baseline of 0.06. Using this estimate, combined with the
adherence effects, we estimate that the proportion of non-elderly individuals with high adherence after Part D is
0.632 for existing patients and 0.319 for new initiators.

                                                                                                                    31
have spillovers on the use of other advertised brands, we can identify only the net effect on the
overall demand for advertised drugs within a condition. Thus, we focus on identifying spillovers
on non-advertised drugs, which is one component of the overall market expansion effect.
Positive spillover effects could occur if a person viewing an ad for a brand name drug requests
this drug from her doctor, but the doctor then prescribes another therapeutically similar drug.
Insurance formularies that cover only certain drugs or offer preferential cost-sharing for certain
drugs could also induce spillovers. We test for spillover effects by re-estimating Equation 3,
replacing the outcome variable with the total prescriptions purchased for non-advertised drugs
belonging to the same therapeutic drug classes as the 50 advertised chronic drugs.
       We show the results graphically in Figure 8 comparing the trends in average prescriptions
purchased across high and low elderly share markets for advertised drugs (repeated from Figure
3), non-advertised drugs, and both types of drugs combined. For non-advertised drugs, we see
nearly identical trends across markets prior to Part D and then both an absolute and relative
increase in utilization in high elderly share markets immediately after the introduction of Part D.
This provides strong evidence of a market expansion effect. The secular increase in utilization,
which differs from the declining trend we see for advertised drugs, reflects the fact that non-
advertised drugs are typically generics or off-patent brands and that there is substitution from the
brand-name drugs to generics after brands lose patent protection. We also observe a large
differential effect of Part D on total utilization. Thus, the effect cannot be driven purely by
substitution from non-advertised drugs to advertised drugs. The regression analogs in Table 10
show that these effects are all positive and statistically significant. Consistent with the previous
advertising literature, we find large positive spillovers from advertising.      This has welfare
implications for both consumers and firms. From the consumer perspective, the spillovers may
be welfare enhancing as this suggests at least some role for informative, rather than market-
stealing advertising. In contrast, had we found a complete shift from non-advertised to advertised
drugs, this would have represented little welfare gain since advertised drugs may not be
significantly superior to non-advertised drugs.




                                                                                                 32
6. Discussion


         Our results demonstrate that DTCA has large causal effects on drug utilization and drug
adherence. We study the effects of a market-wide shock to advertising, which allows us to
identify the net impact on drug use.44 Other work in the literature focuses on how advertising
affects an individual firm’s own revenue (e.g. Sinkinson and Starc, 2015, Shapiro, 2015). Our
interest is in how public policy influences market-wide incentives for DTCA, and in the resulting
implications for patients. To inform the debate over whether DTCA should be encouraged,
limited, or banned, the aggregate effect of expanding advertising for all drugs is the relevant
policy parameter.        Other policies that stimulate DTCA might have different local average
treatment effects (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). However, our policy experiment bears directly on
policies expanding public insurance. It may also correspond closely to other broad-based polices
that affect a large fraction of drugs (especially drugs for our five chronic conditions).
         Our estimates can also be used to consider the contribution of DTCA to the overall
growth in drug spending since the FDA relaxed its advertising restrictions in 1997. To recover
this parameter, we begin by estimating the advertising elasticity for total drug spending
(including spillover effects on non-advertised drugs) in Appendix Table B.6. Our results imply
that a 10 percent increase in advertising views increases total drug spending by about 4 percent
(using the more conservative binary instrument). We deflate this estimate by a factor of 2.3 to
account for the relationship between advertising expenditures and advertising views (Sethuraman
et al., 2011), since we only know time series growth in advertising expenditures. Based on this
estimate, we predict that drug spending would increase by 59% in response to the increase in
national DTCA expenditures from 1997-2010.                  Comparing this to the actual increase in national
drug spending (193%), DTCA accounts for about 31% of the recent growth in drug spending.
While one must exercise caution in extrapolating our estimates to the national historical trend,
our results are suggestive that DTCA is a significant, though not primary, contributor to the rapid
rise in drug spending in the U.S.
         Evaluating the welfare consequences of the rise in drug utilization and spending, requires
an understanding of the benefits and value of DTCA. We find that a large share of the utilization


44
 Since Part D affected advertising incentives for all drugs, it does not serve as an appropriate instrument to test for
market stealing between one advertised brand name drug and another.

                                                                                                                     33
response to advertising is driven by take-up of treatment. Given that the five conditions we
study are generally considered to be under-treated and under-diagnosed (e.g. Hirschfeld, et al.,
1997; Majumdar et al., 1999), increased take-up is likely to lead to improved health, representing
a welfare gain for consumers. However, we find that individuals who initiate therapy due to
advertising have lower rates of treatment compliance, which could mitigate some of these health
gains. For patients who are less attached to treatment regimens or for whom treatment is
marginally less appropriate, increased spending may lead to little health improvement.
Furthermore, if advertising serves primarily to persuade, rather than to inform, we may observe
distortions in use towards the newest, most expensive drugs, irrespective of their quality. Our
evidence on spillover effects suggests that a significant share of the increase in utilization comes
from non-advertised drugs which tend to be lower cost off-patent and generic drugs. We also
find effects of DTCA on improving drug adherence.              This has clearer positive welfare
implications. Although, a small proportion of the adherence effect is mitigated by a composition
change towards new initiators who appear to be less compliant. Our estimates provide a rich
picture of the utilization responses to DTCA by examining numerous mechanisms explaining the
overall increase and provide an important step in understanding advertising’s welfare effects.
Ultimately, an analysis of the health benefits as well as other perceived utility gains from the
additional treatments induced by DTCA would be needed to characterize the full welfare effects.
This goes beyond the scope of the current analysis, given the limited measures of health
available in our claims data, but represents a potentially important area for future research.


7. Conclusion


       This paper provides one of the first natural experiment studies of the impact of direct-to-
consumer advertising on drug utilization and sheds light on the causal mechanisms for the
advertising effect. We exploit variation in advertising driven by the introduction of Medicare
Part D by comparing changes in drug utilization for the non-elderly before and after Part D in
markets with high versus low elderly share.
       The results of this study show that advertising exposure for the non-elderly increased
differentially in high elderly share markets immediately following the implementation of Part D.
This pattern is mimicked by our drug utilization outcomes along both the extensive and intensive

                                                                                                 34
margins. While drug utilization pre-trends tracked each other closely prior to Part D, we find a
differential increase for the non-elderly following Part D. Decomposing the total utilization
effect, we find that the effects are driven both by increased take-up and drug adherence.
Increased take-up accounts for about 70% of the total utilization effect.
        The utilization results are robust to trends and alternative specifications of the instrument.
Also, we find that the results are not sensitive to changes in the composition of the sample due to
firm and employee churn in the claims data. We find no evidence to suggest that the utilization
patterns are driven by changes in prices, physician prescribing behavior, or detailing that is
differentially occurring in high elderly share areas. We also find large spillover effects of
advertising on utilization of non-advertised drugs, leading to overall market expansion effects.
        Overall, we find substantial responsiveness of prescription drug demand to a non-price
factor. Based on the review in Goldman, Joyce and Zheng (2007), estimates of the price
elasticity of demand for prescription drugs range from -0.2 to -0.6. Using this range of estimates,
our results imply that a 10 percent increase in advertising exposure produces the same increase in
prescription drug utilization as a 9 to 27 percent reduction in out-of-pocket price.45                        The
substantial spillover effects of Part D on the non-elderly population may also warrant
consideration by policymakers.            These unintended behavioral responses to the policy by
individuals outside of the Medicare program may have considerable welfare consequences.




45
  Using our estimated elasticity of demand with respect to advertising of 0.54, we compute the corresponding price
elasticity equivalent to a 10% change in advertising exposure as: (0.54/.2)*10=27 or (0.54/.6)*10=9.

                                                                                                                35

Appendix A

A.1 Decomposition of Extensive and Intensive Margin Effects

     The increase in total drug utilization we observe due to advertising is driven both by
increased take-up of treatment (extensive margin) as well as increased use among existing drug
users (intensive margin). In this section we decompose the overall effect of advertising into the
extensive and intensive margins. We re-estimate the main 2SLS regression for total
prescriptions shutting down the extensive margin effect (i.e. we hold the take-up rate constant at
pre-Part D levels). This allows us to estimate the proportion of the total effect that is due to
intensive margin changes. The remaining proportion of the total effect is then due to extensive
margin changes. We estimate:
                            (A1) 𝐴𝑛𝑦𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 = 𝜎𝑚 + 𝜏𝑐 + 𝜖 𝑚𝑐𝑡
Where 𝐴𝑛𝑦𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 is the proportion of non-elderly individuals with any use of prescription
drugs for condition 𝑐 in market 𝑚 and quarter 𝑡. We estimate this equation for the pre-Part D
                                                                        ̂ 𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 for the
period from 2004-2005. We then use the estimated parameters to predict 𝐴𝑛𝑦𝑈𝑠𝑒
                                     ̂ 𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 varies only by condition and market, the
entire sample from 2004-2010. Since 𝐴𝑛𝑦𝑈𝑠𝑒
proportion that takes-up prescription drugs (i.e. extensive margin) is held constant over time.
         Next we construct a counterfactual measure of total prescriptions purchased which holds
                                            ̂ 𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 ∗ 𝑌𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 , where 𝑌𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 is the
the extensive margin constant: 𝑌̂𝑚𝑐𝑡,<65 = 𝐴𝑛𝑦𝑈𝑠𝑒
average number of prescriptions purchased conditional on use. We use this constructed outcome
variable to estimate the 2SLS model as before. The 2SLS results are presented in Columns 3 and
4 of Appendix Table B.4. The estimates using the counterfactual outcome, representing the
intensive margin, are less than one-third the size of the baseline total effect (Columns 1 and 2).
Using the preferred continuous instrument specification, this implies that extensive margin
changes explain 71% to 73% of the total utilization effect. A straightforward back-of-the-
envelope calculation using the pre-Part D take-up rate and estimated intensive margin effect
from Table 8 produces similar estimates of the extensive margin effect.46

  Using the continuous instrument, the change in prescriptions purchased is 0.017 for one additional ad viewed.
The change in prescriptions purchased along the intensive margin is predicted to be the fraction of the sample that

                                                                                                                      57

Notes: Sample means from Nielsen Ad*Views in above median elderly share markets relative to below median
elderly share markets. The vertical lines represent the dates when Part D was signed into law (December 2003) and
was implemented (January 2006). In Panel A, means are plotted for a balanced panel of the top 200 advertised
brand-name drugs. There is a secular downward trend in overall views per person due to patent expirations of
several of these drugs over this time period (in particular, four of the top 200 drugs went off patent around 2006:
Pravachol, Wellbutrin XL, Zocor, and Zoloft). The downward trend in views matches the pattern in national
advertising expenditures shown in Figure 1.




used chronic drugs prior to Part D (0.063) x the estimated change in prescriptions purchased among users (0.057).
Subtracting this from the total effect, we get the predicted extensive margin effect: 0.013 (or 76% of the total effect).
