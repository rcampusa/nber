                           AND REAL HOUSE PRICES

                                    ABSTRACT

        Real house prices are directly determined by the willingness of
    households to pay for (and willingness of builders to supply) a
    constant-quality house. Changes in the quantity of housing demanded will
    affect real prices only to the extent that the long-run housing supply
    schedule is positively sloped. In this paper we use 1980 census data to
    measure the impact of the age structure and real income per household on
    the willingness of households to pay for a constant quality house.
•
    Extrapolating these variables forward to 2010, we conclude that evolving
    demographic forces are likely to raise real house prices, not lower them.

DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND REAL HOUSE PRICES
       Richard K. Green and Patric H. Hendershott


       The roughly 20 percent increase in real house prices in
the 1970s and the recent forecast of plunging real house prices
in the 1990s (Marikiw-Weil, 1989) has generated substantial
research on the movement in and determinants of real house
prices. There are two broad strands to the research on
determinants. The first is the structural model approach,
where multiple equations are specified and estimated, with
house prices being simultaneously determined with housing
production and future house prices depending on forecasts of
multiple relationships [Topel and Rosen (1988) and
DiPasquale and Wheaton (1990)]. The second is a reduced-
form single equation approach, where supply and demand
factors together explain prices [Abraham and Hendershott
(1992), Peek and Wilcox (1991) and Poterba (1991)].
       Mankiw and Weil's particular innovation was to link
demand directly to demographic factors (age) by first
estimating a cross-section demand equation on data from the
1970 census. They then constructed a time series age-demand
variable to use in the explanation of real house prices. In
contrast to the other single-equation models, Mankiw and
Weil do not allow for separate influences of real income, real
construction costs, and the rental or user cost of housing.
                                                               2
         We follow Mankiw and Weil in the micro-based single-
equation tradition, using 1980 census data to explain housing
demand. Our analysis differs from theirs in three ways. First,
we link demand to numerous economic and demographic
variables, rather than just age. Second, we allow for supply
influences by estimating a hedonic function, while Mankiw and
Well work solely with the demand equation. Third, we focus
on a constant quality house. If real prices are to rise in
response to an increase in real income or an aging of the
population, people must be willing to pay more for a constant-
quality house (or builders must be willing to supply new units
only at higher prices). A general increase in the quantity of
housing demanded per household would cause the prices of
higher quality houses to rise relative to prices of lower quality
house, but the increase will not necessarily raise constant-
quality prices, on average.
         The differences in analyses seem to matter a great
deal.1     While Mankiw and Weil find age, and thus
"demographics," to be a major determinant of real house


   1 In fact, the differences probably don't matter that much.
Hendershott (1992) shows that the Marildw-Weil equation
doesn't explain real prices in the 1970s and 1980s and that the
negative time trend in the M-W equation, not the age-demand
construct, is the variable responsible for the large forecasted
drop in real prices.
                                                                3
prices and forecast plunging real house prices in the 1990s, we
find only a modest impact of demographic factors and a barely
perceptible one of age. Mankiw and Weil have hugely
exaggerated the impact of demographic factors.
       Our paper begins with a statement of our general
framework and its implementation. The cross-sectional results
for 1980 are then reported and the sensitivity of housing
demand to demographic factors and real income is discussed.
We conclude that changes in demographic factors did not
contribute to the rise in real house prices during the 1970s and
are unlikely to cause significant changes over the next two
decades.
                I. The General Framework
       Rosen's (1974) well-known model relates the demand
for housing characteristics to (among other things)
demographic factors. The model requires three steps. First,
we establish a relationship between the real flow of (real
expenditures on) housing services provided by a house and the
characteristics of the house

                          q    f(2)                       (1)

where q is the flow of housing services consumed (the "user
cost" times the asset price) and Z is a vector of n hedonic
characteristics of the house, z1, z2, ..., ;. Second, we obtain
                                                                4

the real marginal implicit price of each hedonic characteristic
by taking derivatives of (1):

                             =                            (2)


Third, we relate these marginal prices to: the hedonic
characteristics of the house, the demographic characteristics of
the household, and the household's real income (Y)

                         = g1(Z,     A, X, ii             (3)


where Z and the q are as before, A is the household's age
and X is a vector of m other demographic characteristics, x1,
   •..,
          To estimate (1), we use Christensen, Jorgensen, and
Lau's (1975) Translog function:

   lnq =         + tcz1nz1
                   1=1
                                ÷   O.St tB1j1nz11nz + e
                                       2—lj=1
                                                         (1')

where      is independently and normally distributed, We use
the Translog because it will approximate any arbitrary
functional form and imposes fewer restrictions than many
                                                                 5
other functional forms that are homogeneous of degree one.2
We impose homogeneity and symmetry upon the translog
through the following restrictions:

                            A                        (4)
                            La1            1
                            1=1




                                       =             (5)



                                   =                 (6)
                            B11


That is, we estimate (1') subject to (4)-(6). By restricting (1)
to be homogenous of degree one, Euler's Theorem allows us
to compute the aggregate quantity of housing services from a
specific house as:

                                  12                       (7)
                         q= 1=1
                             Lq1z1

We obtain the q by taking partial derivatives of q with respect
to the z1 in the estimated (1'):


    2 For example, while a linear functional form is
homogeneous of degree 1, it imposes for each hedonic
characteristic a common price for each household. This would
defeat our ability to derive a relationship between a
household's demographic characteristics and its demand for
housing.
                                                                    6



                   =                             q-          (2')
                          = (a1÷E I311nz)

         The form of the inverse demand functions for housing
characteristics is not specified by theory. Ideally we would
estimate the effect of every characteristic on every implicit
price. As a practical matter, we haven't sufficient instrumental
variables to do so. We therefore regress the q on only their
corresponding characteristic and on the demographic and
economic variables:

          =   a0 + a1z1 + E aaAa + JiX +                 +
                                                8YaYAa

                                                             (3')

where the A2 are 0-1 dummies for each five-year age class
running from 0-5 to 81-85, Y is the income of the household
head, the a's are individual coefficients, T is a coefficient
vector for the other demographic variables denoted by X, and
p. is   independently and normally distributed. We anticipate
that the a1 will be negative for characteristics yielding positive
utility (e.g., the number of rooms) and positive for
characteristics with negative utility (e.g., age of house).
                                                                  7
                II. Implementation and Results
        We estimate equation (1') for the 1980 census year.
The hedonic characteristics are house age, numbers of
bedrooms, of bathrooms, and of other rooms, whether the
house has central air, gas heat, sewer and water hookup,
whether it is a condominium or is in an urban area, and which
of nine census regions it is in. All data come from the public
use micro-data series, Because we do not have a direct
estimate of either the quality or quantity of land, we include
a variable for whether the household is an owner as a crude
proxy for the land attribute.
        For renters, q is gross rent as reported by renters to the
census. For owner-occupiers, q is the product of a user cost
measure and the house price as reported by owner-occupiers
to the census. We estimate the user cost of housing capital in
period t for each owner from

                                                            (8)
          uc    r(1-m) +        p +   t(1—m)    +    —




where r is the nominal interest rate, p is a risk premium, r
is the property tax rate, m is the marginal tax rate, S is the
rate of depreciation and/or maintenance, and g is the
expected capital gain. We set r equal to the 1980 ten-year
Treasury rate (0.1146) and set p = 0.04, 6 = 0.03 and g =
0.06.   We determine the marginal tax rate for each household
                                                                8

by calculating a taxable income based on total income, marital
status and number of dependents as reported to the census
and then associating with that taxable income a marginal tax
rate as based upon 1980 tax law.3 We take property taxes as
reported to the 1980 census.
       Using ordinary least squares to explain the service flow
provided by 65,622 houses, we obtain an R-squared of 0.40.
In Table 1 we report the own-quantity coefficients on the 18
characteristics, their standard errors, and the partial
derivatives with respect to the own quantity. As can be seen,
15 of the 18 own coefficients are statistically different from
zero at the 5 percent level, and all partial derivatives, with the
possible exception of gas heat, have the expected sign. Of the
139 coefficients on the interactive terms, 95 are statistically
different from zero at the 5 percent level, none with
unexpected signs.
      We then estimate (3') for each of the 18 characteristics
using two-stage least squares as prescribed in Bartik (1987).
For the demographic vector, we include the relevant 0-1 age-
dummy for each household member (and therefore implicitly,
each household's size), the household head's marital status,
the race, gender, and educational attainment (one of five


      The data are not sufficiently complete to allow us to be
precisely sure of each household's taxable income.
                                                              9

categories ranging from no high school to post college) of the
household's highest earner.
       We expect the coefficient on the own housing
characteristic ("z") to have a sign. opposite the average "q" of
the characteristic (see Table 1). That is, we expect normal
goods to have downward-sloping demand curves. As indicated
in the first colunm of Table 2, with two exceptions, the
coefficient on the own housing characteristic is statistically
significant at the 1 percent level with the expected sign. The
exceptions are the age of the house and region 2, and the
magnitudes of these average prices are quite small.
       Also shown in Table 2 are coefficients on selected
other variables. To conserve space, we report coeffjcients on
only two of our 17 age-class dummy variables, 21-25 and 41-
45; one of our 17 age-income variables, (3135)*income; and
the single and black identifiers. These coefficients begin to
provide a sense about how various income and demographic
characteristics affect the demand for housing. Note, for
example, that between ages 21-25 and 4 1-45 the willingness to
pay rises for all housing characteristics except sewer hook-up
and central air conditioning. Moreover, the willingness to pay
for "newness," other rooms, and home-ownership (land?) rises
significantly with income (the age 36-40 interaction with
                                                             10
income is fairly typical. The one mystery is the decreasing
preference for bathrooms as income rises.
       Singles value new houses and more rooms of all types
less than do married couples. They also value urban settings
and homeownership (land) less and condominiums more.
These results seem sensible. Finally, black preferences are
quite mixed when compared with others. The willingness of
blacks to pay for bedrooms, bathrooms, unbanness, and
condos is less than the willingness of others, but blacks pay
more for other rooms.
       Precise estimates of how the willingness to pay varies
with age, income, household type and race are obtained by
selecting a housing quality mix (specifying Z), computing the
implicit prices from (3') and solving equation (7)•4 Figure 1
shows how this willingness to pay for our constant-quality
house varied with age in 1980, from two perspectives. In the
first, all the average characteristics (education, income, etc.)
associated with age are varied with age. That is, the plotted
age relationship is a total derivative. The second holds real



      Our constant-quality house is 20 years old and owner-
occupied, has three bedrooms, one and one-half bathrooms,
three other rooms, central air conditioning, and central heat.
Our house is hooked up to city sewer and water, and is in an
urban area in Region 9, the Pacific Division of the United
States.
                                                              11

income and all nonage demographic variables constant. That
is, we show the partial derivative with respect to age. We do
the calculations for a white married couple who have attended
college and had a real 1980 income of $25,000.
       Both curves rise sharply from the early 20s to the late
30s, when children are leaving the parental home. The total
derivative is then basically flat. The partial age derivative, in
contrast, jumps in the 60s by a little over 10 percent. All else
being equal, older households are willing to pay a premium
for housing; in spite of empty nests and lower income, many
retirees do not leave the homestead.
       Figure 2 shows the large effect of marital status and
race on the willingness of owning households with $25,000 real
income to pay for the constant-quality house. The effects are
large: blacks are willing to pay only half as much for housing
as whites and singles half as much as marrieds. (Single males
and females of the same race pay similar amounts.) The
explanation for these differences is conjectural? We know
that singles and blacks are more apt to live in central cities
than married couples and whites. Because land is more
expensive in central cities than in suburbia, singles and blacks



     Married couples will have slightly more after-tax income
than singles, but they must spend more of their income on
food, clothing, medical expenses and so on.
                                                             12

may be acting as a proxy for a hedonic attribute -- land quality
or "neighborhood amenities" -- not in our data set [Brown and
Rosen (1982)J. While we attempted to "instrument out" this
problem by performing two-stage least squares on our demand
for amenities equations, we may not have been completely
successful.   Another possible explanation for the black
differential is racial discrimination: if blacks are constrained
to live in less desirable neighborhoods than whites, it will
appear that blacks are unwilling to pay as much as whites for
the "same" quality house. In any event, households in the
central city consuming less land and poorer quality housing is
in the spirit of Alonzo (1960).


    IlL The Importance of Age and Other Demographic
                       Characteristics
       A controversial question is what impact have
population growth and changes in its age distribution since
1970 had on real house prices in the 1980s and l990s? A
further question is what impact might further growth and
changes be expected to have in the next two decades?
According to Mankiw and Weil (1989), population growth and
changes in age structure in the l970s contributed significantly
to the observed 20 percent increase in real prices, and
                                                              13

expected population evolution in the next two decades will
almost halve real prices.
       Comparing our Figure 1 with their Figure 2 suggests a
strong likelihood that we wilt answer these questions
differently than they did. The age-"demand" relationships for
the two studies are similar through age 40, but differ markedly
thereafter.   For 1980 data, Mankiw and Weil have a
nunotonic demand decline after age 40 that cumulates to 50
percent by age 90. When only age is varied, we have about a
15 percent increase after age 40; when all variables related to
age are also varied, demand is basically flat after age 40. The
baby-boomer bulge is now aged 30 to 45. According to
Mankiw and Weil, the shift to ages 50 to 65 will significantly
lower housing demand and cause a collapse in real house
prices. By our estimates, demand (willingness to pay) and real
prices will be either flat or increase in response to that shift.
       To indicate the impact of demographic changes implied
by our estimates, we have computed the average service flow
provided by a constant-quality house in 1970, 1980, and 1990.
To do this, we use equation (3') to measure the implicit price
of the ith characteristic for a household in the jth age class
                                                              14


          = a0 + a1z1 +                    +   +
                                                   dyYjAja

and then sum over the age classes and then the housing
characteristics


                       q   =                           (13)
                               i=1   fri
where   w is the proportion of households in the jth age class.
Table 3 provides the age-class weights, and Table 4 presents
the amiual average demographic and real income
characteristics for 1970, 1980 and 1990. Demographic and
real income data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Population Reports, Series P-20, P-25, and P-60.
      We first compute the service flow for 1970 data and
then repeat the calculation twice for 1980 data and again for
1990 data. In the first repetition, we vary only the age class
weights. The result is a 3.6 percent decline in the 1970s and
a 1.7 percent rebound in the 1980s, leaving real demand
(willingness to pay) 1.9 percent lower in 1990 than in 1970.
Looking forward, the aging of the baby-boomers should raise
real demand by 3 percent between 1990 and 2010. Allowing
for all the changes accompanying the variation in age
(calculating the total derivative), willingness to pay fell by
almost 7 percent in the 1970s, predominantly due to the shift
                                                               15

from married to single households, and was flat in the 1980s.
Looking forward, willingness to pay should rise by about 2.5
percent between now and 2010.
          We do not mean to emphasis our exact estimates of
demographic effects. Rather, we feature two of their general
characteristics. First, both the age shifts and the reduced
tendency to marry in the 1970s lowered, not raised, the
willingness to pay for constant-quality housing.6 While an
increased quantity demanded may have raised prices by
shifting the economy along a rising supply curve, the direct
demand effect was negative. Second, the aging of the baby
boomers between now and 2010 will increase both the
willingness to pay for housing and the quantity demanded.
Both increases will raise real house prices, not lower them.
While demographic forces undoubtedly affect real house
prices, the effect is both more complicated -- the prices of
houses at different quality levels will be affected differently --
and   weaker in the aggregate than some recent research has
suggested. And, of course, real prices will be affected by
changes in willingness to supply as well as willingness to
demand.


      6
      Peek and Wilcox (1991) attribute the rise to increases in
