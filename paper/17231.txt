The Land that Lean Manufacturing Forgot? Management Practices in Transition Countries

                                            ABSTRACT

We have conducted the first survey on management practices in transition countries. We found that
Central Asian transition countries, such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, have on average very poor
management practices. Their average scores are below emerging countries such as Brazil, China and
India. In contrast, the central European transition countries such as Poland and Lithuania operate with
management practices that are only moderately worse than those of western European countries such
as Germany. Since we find these practices are strongly linked to firm performance, this suggests poor
management practices may be impeding the development of Central Asian transition countries. We
find that competition, multinational ownership, private ownership and human capital are all strongly
correlated with better management. This implies that the continued opening of markets to domestic
and foreign competition, privatisation of state-owned firms and increased levels of workforce education
should promote better management, and ultimately faster economic growth.

1 Introduction

Firms in transition countries were generally not exposed to market forces until the beginning
of the 1990s and in some transition countries the state still accounts for over 50 per cent of
GDP (for example, Belarus, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan). Therefore the obvious question
arises: what do management practices in these countries look like? Have they been
modernised by the Lean manufacturing wave hitting Europe, the United States and Asia, or
are these firms still operating using communist-era low quality mass production? And
moreover do Western definitions of “good management” even apply in the ex-communist
countries? For example, if corruption is widespread maybe it is best not to monitor the
production process to minimise the availability of information on which officials can extract
bribes.


Anecdotal evidence suggests that while there are many well-managed firms in transition
countries, many firms are also operating with extremely old-fashioned management practices.
For example, when we visited some of these countries we came across some well managed
firms (for example Exhibit 1), but also firms without any formal maintenance programme,
inventory or quality control system, or factory organisation (for example, Exhibits 2 to 3).
More generally, it appeared that decades of central planning had left many managers in small
and medium-sized firms with no vision of how to develop their company, how much
investment they need, and weak financial management.


Several studies on firm productivity in transition countries allude to the lack of appropriate
managerial skills as a possible explanation for lower productivity found among state-owned or
formerly state-owned firms (see, for example, Estrin et al. (2009), Steffen and Stephan (2008),
Brown et al. (2006), Zelenyuk and Zheka (2006), Yudaeva et al. (2003)). But until now actual
data on management practices were not available for transition countries.


So in 2008 and 2009, the EBRD in cooperation with the World Bank conducted a new survey
– the EBRD-WB Management, Organisation and Innovation (MOI) survey - the first
management survey in transition countries. The survey adopted the approach of Bloom and
Van Reenen (2007), focusing on core manufacturing management practices around




                                              2
operations, monitoring, targets and incentives. The survey ran 1,874 face-to-face interviews
with factory managers in 10 transition countries (Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Lithuania,
Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia (excluding Kosovo), Ukraine and Uzbekistan) as well as
Germany as an advanced country benchmark and India as a developing country benchmark.
We also matched our data to independently collected accounting data, and compared
management scores to other surveys on other countries as in Bloom and Van Reenen (2010).
We found several striking results. First, we found widespread variation in management
practices both within and across countries. In particular, firms in Central Asian transition
countries, like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, often operated with extremely poor management
practices. Their firms were worse on average than those in developing countries like Brazil,
China and India. In contrast, the central European transition countries like Poland and
Lithuania operate with practices which are only moderately worse than those of European
countries like the United Kingdom, France and Germany.


Matching our management data up to company accounts data enables us to evaluate to what
extent management is linked to firms’ productivity and profitability. Similar to Bloom and
Van Reenen (2010) for non-transition countries, we find that good management is also
strongly linked to better firm performance in transition countries. This suggests that poor
management practices may be impeding the development of Central Asian transition
countries.


Finally, we investigate the factors that may account for poor management in many transition
countries. We find that factors that matter in non-transition countries matter in transition
countries as well. Stronger product market competition, higher levels of multinational
ownership, and greater employee education are all strongly correlated with better
management. We are also able to show that higher levels of private ownership are strongly
correlated with better management, something that was not previously documented in work
on management practices. This suggests that the continued opening of markets to domestic
and foreign competition, privatisation of state-owned firms, and increased levels of workforce
education should promote better management, and ultimately higher national productivity.
Section 2 explains how we measure management practices, section 3 describes the pattern of
management practices we see across transition countries, while section 4 related management




                                              3
practices to performance, and section 5 investigates the factors accounting for differences in
management practices across firms and countries. Finally, section 6 concludes.




2 Measuring management practices

2.1 Scoring management practices
The concept of “good” or “bad” management needs to be translated into a measure applicable
to different firms across the manufacturing sector in various countries. In contrast to previous
questionnaires on management practices, the MOI survey consisted mostly of closed-ended
questions, in which the options offered to interviewees were based on the responses from
Bloom and Van Reenen (2010). Bloom and Van Reenen in turn used a practice evaluation
tool developed by a leading international management consultancy firm. One could argue that
what constitutes “good” management practices in the sense of getting things done in eastern
Europe and central Asia differs from what constitutes “good” management practices in other
parts of the world, in particular western Europe, due to a different business environment. So
we focused on practices that we believe are clearly “good”, such as monitoring production to
identify and fix repeated problems, making promotion decisions based on employees'
performance (rather than, for example, family connections), and retraining or moving
incompetent employees (rather than leaving them in post). As we show, these management
practices are unsurprisingly strongly correlated with superior firm performance.


Management practices were grouped into four areas: operations (one question), monitoring
(seven questions), targets (one question) and incentives (three questions). The operations
question focused on how the establishment handled a process problem, such as machinery
breakdown. The monitoring questions covered collection, monitoring, revision and use of
production performance indicators. The targets question focused on the time-scale of
production targets and the incentives questions covered promotion criteria, practices for
addressing poor employee performance, and rewarding production target achievement. We list
the questions we used for each management practice and the scoring we assigned to answers
in Appendix A.




                                               4
As the scaling varied across management practices, the scores were converted to z-scores by
normalising each practice (that is question) to mean zero and standard deviation one:
         mi  mi
z mi                                                                   (1)
            m    i



where zmi is the z-score of management practice mi in firm i , mi is the unweighted average

of management practice mi across all observations in all countries and  mi is the standard

deviation of management practice mi across all observations in all countries. To avoid putting

the most emphasis on the monitoring aspect of management practices (which had the most
underlying questions), an unweighted average was first calculated across z-scores for a
particular area of the four management practices:
              1
mi , A 
           nmii , A
                      z
                      mA
                            mi                                          ( 2)

where mi , A is the unweighted average of management practices belonging to an area of

management A (operations, monitoring, targets or incentives) in firm i , and nmii , A denotes the

number of observations for which the measures are available. Lastly, an unweighted average
was then taken across the scores for the four practices, and finally a z-score of the measures
obtained was calculated:1

M i  mi ,operations  mi ,monitoring  mi ,t arg ets  mi ,incentives 
 ~       1
         4
              ~       ~
              M  Mi
z M~ i  M i  i                                                          (3)
                         M~     i



This means that the average management practices across all firms in all countries in the
sample are equal to zero, and the actual management practices of the firm deviate from zero
either to the left (“bad” practices) or to the right (“good” practices).


Firm-level performance data – balance sheets and income and loss statements – were obtained
from Bureau Van Dijk’s Orbis database for the countries covered and matched to the sample
of completed interviews. These data come from a source independent of the survey and allow

    This is an accepted way of calculating index numbers – see Bresnahan et al. (2002).




                                                                5
us to examine the external validity of our measures of management practices by examining
whether the data we collect are correlated with external measures of firm performance.


2.2 Collecting accurate responses
MOI interviews were conducted face-to-face and the interviewers were recruited by the local
survey companies. This makes the MOI survey different from the Bloom and Van Reenen
(2007, 2010) management practices surveys, which were conducted by phone from London
with MBA students as interviewers. We took several steps to increase the accuracy of
answers.


First, the interviewers were trained to not lead the managers to a particular answer. As part of
this process the options offered to the managers to choose their answer from did not always
follow the same pattern from, say, worst practices to best management practices.2


Second, the interviewers did not have access to the firm’s financial information or
performance in advance of the interview. They only received firm names and contact details.
While they – as locals – may have by chance been familiar with the performance of a couple
of larger firms they interviewed, they would not know that for all of them, and they had no
interest in spending time researching the firms’ performance prior to the interview. We
selected medium-sized manufacturing firms (the median size was 130 employees – see Table
2), which would in general not be known by name.


Third, we collected a detailed set of information on the interview process (local time of day,
date, duration of the interview), on the manager (gender, seniority, nationality, company and
job tenure, location), and on the interviewer (gender, age and highest education level
achieved). By including this information in the analysis, we explicitly controlled for at least
part of interview bias.


The questionnaire comprised seven sections organised by topic. The first asked questions
about the characteristics of the firm, such as legal status, ownership and number of years in
operation. This was followed by sections on management practices, organisation of the firm,

    The actual questions used and the scoring we assigned to answers can be found in Appendix A.




                                                        6
innovation and R&D, degree of competition and labour. The MOI questionnaire was
developed and tested in two pilot surveys prior to its implementation in the field.3


2.3 Correlation of management scores across different surveys
The EBRD survey deliberately re-interviewed 404 firms that were interviewed in 2006 for the
Bloom and Van Reenen (2010) survey (henceforth the BvR survey) in Germany, India and
Poland. We did this to enable us to directly compare across the two different surveys of
management practices. We found a correlation of 0.298 between the two surveys, which was
significant at the 1% level. This correlation is high given that: (i) two to three years have
passed between the two sets of interviews, (ii) the surveys asked a different set of questions
and were scored using a different approach (open-ended questions for BvR and multiple
choice for the EBRD survey), (iii) the surveys typically asked different people (most firms
have several factory, production or operations managers), (iv) the interviewers were different
(MBA students working in London for BvR and local survey agents for the EBRD interview),
and (v) the survey approach was different (phone survey versus face-to-face survey). As a
benchmark, in Bloom and Van Reenen’s work the correlation between the 2006 and 2010
rounds of their survey is 0.427 when different managers were interviewed. This indicates the
correlation of about 0.298 between the MOI and BvR scores is high given the inherent noise
in measuring management.


2.4 Obtaining interviews with managers
From October 2008 to April 20104 the EBRD conducted the first MOI survey in collaboration
with the World Bank. The survey was primarily targeted at factory, production or operations
managers, who are close to the day-to-day operations of the firm but are at the same time
senior enough to have an overview of management practices.5 In reality, the respondents often
included more senior managers (CEOs, Vice Presidents, General Directors) because they said
they are ultimately responsible for production and wanted to be the ones providing the

took place in the United Kingdom.

  Fieldwork in Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia (excluding Far East), Serbia,
Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Germany took place between October 2008 and March 2009. Fieldwork in India took
place between August 2009 and October 2009 and in the Russian Far East between February 2010 and April
2010. For more details, please refer to the Technical Report available on the EBRD’s website.

  Factory managers are usually responsible for the efficient operation, maintenance and budgetary control of
production. Production/operations managers ensure that goods are produced efficiently, at the right quality,
quantity and cost, and that they are produced on time.




                                                       7
answers. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in the manager’s native language by
interviewers employed by the market research companies hired to implement the MOI survey.
Each interview took on average 54 minutes.


The average response rate to the survey was over 40 per cent and this appeared to be
uncorrelated with productivity or profitability. There was some evidence that larger firms
were more likely to respond, which is why the regressions typically control for this variable to
offset any potential sample selection bias. In the initial contact with the firm, the interview
was introduced as part of a study that would not discuss the firm’s financial position or its
accounts, making it relatively non-controversial for managers to participate. As in Bloom and
Van Reenen (2007, 2010), management practices were ordered to lead with the least
controversial (operations management) and finish with the most controversial (promotions
and firings). In several countries, we have also provided a letter from the EBRD and the
World Bank confirming that the local survey company was doing the survey on their behalf.


2.5 Characteristics of chosen countries
The survey covered 1,874 manufacturing firms with between 50 and 5,000 employees in 10
transition countries, Germany and India. The transition countries were chosen to cover a range
of progress in transition. Germany was chosen as a developed country benchmark – only the
United States superseded it in terms of average management practices in Bloom and Van
Reenen (2010). India was chosen as a developing country benchmark, and is in some respects
similar to the transition countries. India became independent in 1947. From the 1950s, a
"License Raj" was in operation: a rigid and stern licensing regime which restricted entry into
the manufacturing industry and put several microeconomic restrictions on licensed firms (see
Sharma (2008)). Some of these were similar in spirit to the command economy in transition
countries. There was initial deregulation in the 1980s and trade reforms in the 1990s and this
has transformed India into one of the fastest growing economies.


Table 1 shows selected indicators for these countries. Germany had the highest GDP per
capita in 2008 among the selected countries and Uzbekistan the lowest (in constant 2005
international US$ PPP terms). Private sector share of GDP ranged between 30 per cent in
Belarus and 75 per cent in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Poland. EBRD transition index in the area

of governance and enterprise restructuring, which measures the absence of soft budget
constraints and effective corporate governance, was lowest in Belarus and Uzbekistan (2-) and
highest in Poland (4-). Value added in manufacturing as a percentage of GDP varied between
12 per cent in Uzbekistan and 33 per cent in Belarus.

2.6 Sampling frame and additional data
The sampling frame, from which these firms were picked in main cities randomly with equal
probability, was based on Bureau Van Dijk’s Orbis database (as available in August 2008)
with the exception of India, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The sampling frame in Kazakhstan
was the official list of establishments obtained from the Agency of Statistics of the Republic
of Kazakhstan,6 and in Uzbekistan the Uniform State Register of Enterprises and
Organisations published by the State Department of Statistics of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In the Russian Far East, Orbis database was augmented with BCD (business card database).7
In Poland and Germany, as well as in India, several establishments that participated in a

  At the time of fieldwork preparation, Bureau van Dijk’s Orbis had very little data on manufacturing firms in
Kazakhstan. They have since improved the coverage, but no financial information is available so far.
7
  BCD includes systematised statistical and other information on manufacture and infrastructure of area, region,
and the country as a whole.




                                                       9
previous survey on management practices were re-interviewed as well. All regions within a
country had to be covered8 and the percentage of the sample in each region was required to be
equal to at least one half of the percentage of the sample frame population in each region.9


Comparison of the responding firms with those in the sampling frame revealed that
responding firms tended to be slightly larger, but no evidence could be found of the
responding firms being systematically different from the non-responding firms on any of the
performance measures.


2.7 Summary statistics
Table 2 shows the summary statistics for the firms that participated in the MOI survey. With
the exception of Belarus,10 the median number of employees in firms in all countries was less
than 250, which means that most firms participating in the MOI survey were medium-sized
firms. Share of foreign-owned multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the sample ranges from 0
in Ukraine to 15.8 per cent in Romania, while the share of privatised firms ranges from 0 in
India to 47.8 per cent in Serbia. Belarus had the highest share of firms that are still state-
owned, 78.4 per cent, while none of the firms interviewed in Romania was still state-owned.

   Far East in Russia was covered in a subsequent wave of the MOI survey, which took place from February to

    Orbis tends to cover larger firms in Belarus (25th quartile of the number of employees in manufacturing firms
in 2008 is 211, median 350 and 75th quartile 721 employees), and since our sample frame was based on Orbis,
firms in Belarus were on average larger.

Note: Summary statistics for the variables from Orbis (number of employees, operating revenue, return on total assets, profit margin and
EBITDA margin) refer to 2008. Data on these variables may not be available for all companies in the sample, which is why there can be
significant discrepancies between the median number of employees based on the survey and based on Orbis. EBITDA stands for earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. MNEs are multinational enterprises.

3 Patterns of management practices in transition countries


Patterns of management practices in developed and developing countries have been
documented in Bloom and Van Reenen (2010). We find that their main findings hold for
transition countries as well. Chart 1 shows the average country-level management practice
scores from 1,874 interviews. Germany has the highest management practice scores on
average (as we expected), followed by Lithuania and Poland, with Uzbekistan in last place.


Looking at Chart 1 we see that, first, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have on average worse
management practices than India, a developing country whose GDP per capita was slightly
higher than Uzbekistan’s. Russia’s management practices are at about the same level.11 This
is potentially because of India’s more pro-multinational climate. India scored much better on
getting credit and protecting investors as well as trading across borders in World Bank’s
Doing Business 2011, which indicates that it is a more open economy and more attractive for
foreign investors, who tend to bring better management practices with them. On the
Economic Freedom of the World 2007 Index India also has fewer restrictions on foreign
ownership and investment than any other transition country in the sample (Gwartney et al.
(2009)). These three countries are also rich in natural resources, while India is not. Russia and
Kazakhstan are major oil and gas producers. Extraction accounted for 8 per cent of GDP in
Russia and 18.7 per cent of GDP in Kazakhstan in 2008, but only about 2.5 to 3 per cent of
GDP in India.


This cross-country ranking approximates the cross-country productivity rankings, though not
perfectly. The correlation coefficient between PPP GDP per capita at constant 2005
international $ in 2008 and average country-level management score is 0.69, significant at the
5 per cent significance level (p-value 0.013). However, a better measure may be
manufacturing value added per employee in manufacturing, since our survey covers only
manufacturing firms, but unfortunately data on manufacturing value added per employee are
only available for a subsample of the countries included in our analysis.12


11
   It should be noted that differences in average management scores between Germany and Lithuania and
between India and Kazakhstan are not statistically significant.
12
   Approximate data are available for Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Uzbekistan
which have data on manufacturing value added and percentage of employment in industry. Manufacturing value




                                                     12
The overall management scores can be separated into four areas: operations, monitoring,
targets and incentives. Chart 2 shows the country-level average scores for each of them. In
line with the overall rankings, Germany is in the top four in three out of the four categories,
while Uzbekistan is consistently in the bottom two. However, there are also some interesting
differences across categories. While many firms interviewed in Belarus and Bulgaria, for
example, excel at monitoring – that is, frequently collecting data on several production
performance indicators, showing it to factory managers and workers, and regularly reviewing
the production performance indicators – they are less adept at translating monitoring into
operations. Firms in Ukraine tend to be good at targets management, but bad at operations
management. It is interesting to note that firms in Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan do not
tend to be good at targets management and to some extent monitoring management, opposite
to what one might expect given the legacy of meeting planned production targets in these
countries. The most eclectic ranking emerges on incentives management, although differences
across countries are smaller in this category than in others and often not statistically
significant.13


The data in Chart 2 also describe how management styles differ across countries. Relative to
the average, the use of incentives is greater than the use of monitoring in Ukraine, Serbia and
Romania. However, in Lithuania and Germany the use of monitoring and target management
(relative to the average) exceeds their use of incentives (relative to the average). In Belarus,
the managerial use of monitoring (relative to the average) is far greater than the operations
management (relative to the average).




added per capita is available for more countries, but still missing for Romania, Russia and Serbia. The
correlation coefficient between manufacturing value added per capita (where available) and average country-
level management score is positive, but insignificant (0.66, p-value 0.1089), but the Spearman (rank) correlation
coefficient is highly positive and significant (0.68, p-value 0.0938). However, the correlations with GDP per
capita are also higher in this subsample (correlation: 0.81, p-value 0.0257; rank correlation: 0.82, p-value
0.0234).
13
   Differences in average incentives management scores are not statistically significant between Serbia and
Ukraine, between Germany, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Poland and Uzbekistan, and between Belarus, Bulgaria,
Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Poland, Romania and Russia.

There could be many reasons for this pattern of specialisation across countries, one of them
being the business environment. For example, countries with less stringent labour market
regulations may use incentives more as it is easier to remove poor performers and to reward
high performers. In the EBRD and World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey (which was in the field during a similar period as the MOI survey),
inadequately educated workforce was one of the top two business environment obstacles in all
transition countries included except Bulgaria (see EBRD 2010, Chapter 5). Labour
regulations tended to be in the bottom half of the business environment obstacles, but in
general a bigger obstacle in the EU-10 than the rest of the transition countries.

The fact that Germany is among the top four countries on three out of four management areas
and Uzbekistan among the bottom two on all four management areas does not mean that there
are no firms with bad management practices in Germany and no firms with good management
practices in Uzbekistan. What it does indicate, though, is that the proportion of firms with
good management practices in Uzbekistan is lower than the proportion of firms with good
management practices in Germany. Chart 3 illustrates this by looking at the firm-level
histogram of management practices by country. The bars show the actual data in each
country.


Countries can improve average management practices in two ways: (i) by promoting factors
that increase average management quality in each firm (through better business education, for
example) and (ii) through improved reallocation across firms (for example, letting efficient
firms grow larger). The first option aims at increasing productivity within the average firm,




                                                                             15
while the second improves the allocative efficiency.14 We look at both factors in turn in the
next section.

4 Management quality and firm performance


4.1 Management and Firm Performance
To estimate how firm management practices relate to firm performance in the MOI survey
sample, we estimated the following firm-level performance regressions:


                         y itc   l litc   k k itc   n nitc  M i  Z itc  uitc                (1)


where y is a measure of firm performance, l the logarithm of labour, k the logarithm of
capital, and n the logarithm of material inputs of firm i in country c at time t . The Z s are
all other controls that will affect productivity, such as workforce characteristics (employees
with a completed university degree and the average weekly hours worked), firm
characteristics (firm age and whether it is listed on the stock market), a set of three-digit
industry dummies and country-year (or only country) dummies. M represents average
management quality, calculated based on a scoring of each of 12 individual management
practices, averaged over the variables included in each of the four core areas of management
practices, and finally averaged over these four areas (as explained in section 2).


In terms of performance metrics we looked at operating revenue, profit margin (sum of
operating profit and financial profit divided by total operating revenue), EBITDA margin15
and return on total assets (ROTA) for a subset of firms with available company accounts.
We estimate equation (1) by running OLS on the repeated cross-section (unbalanced panel)
with standard errors clustered by company, and assume that all the correlated heterogeneity is
captured by the control variables. The sample consists of all firms with available accounts
data at some point between 2003 and 2008. The maximum number of years for which we
have data is thus six years, and the average number of years used in the estimation is close to
five years.

  EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It is equal to the sum of
operating profit and depreciation.

4.2 Production Functions
Table 3 looks at the association between firm performance as measured by operating revenue
and management practices. This means the relationships we uncover are not necessarily
causal – we can only identify conditional correlations between our variables. In recent work
Bloom et al. (2011a) have run management field experiments in India, identifying a causal
impact of these types of management practices on firms’ productivity and profitability.


Column (1) of Table 3 includes only industry and country by year dummies as additional
controls. The management score is strongly positively and significantly associated with higher
operating revenue (sales) and coefficient suggests that firms with one point higher average
management score have about 19 log points (almost 21 per cent) higher sales. Column (2)
includes employment as an additional control so the coefficient of management can be
interpreted as the “marginal effect” on labour productivity. This reduces the coefficient on the
management score, but it remains positive and significant. Column (3) includes controls such
as average hours worked, firm age, listing status, education and a set of interview noise
controls, which reduces the coefficient on management score further, but it remains
significant. The other coefficients take intuitive signs. For example, as shown in the table,
firms with more human capital (as proxied by the proportion of employees with a college
degree) have higher productivity. In column (4), we add fixed capital so the coefficient on
management can be interpreted as the effect on total factor productivity. This significantly
reduces the coefficient on management score, suggesting that firms with one point higher
average management score have about 8.5 log points (about 8.8 per cent) higher productivity.
In the final two columns we control for materials. Since this variable is only available for a
subset of the sample, we first confirm that the results are robust to estimating on this smaller
sample in column (5). The management coefficient is actually somewhat larger. Finally, in
column (6) we add materials, which results in a smaller coefficient on management score but
it still remains positive and highly significant, suggesting that firms with one point higher
average management score have about 6 per cent higher total factor productivity. Note that
the coefficients on the factor inputs are approximately equal to the revenue share of the
relevant factors of production, which is reassuring. Overall, Table 3 suggests that the average
management score is positively and significantly correlated with total factor productivity.




                                              18
4.3 Profitability and Management


In Table 4 we look at various measures of profitability. The first three columns look at the
profit margin (operating and financial profit divided by total operating revenue). The
management score is strongly and positively associated with the profit margin, suggesting that
firms with one point higher average management score have about 0.9 percentage points
higher profit margin, which is substantial given that the average profit margin in the sample
used for estimation is 2.2 per cent. In column (4) we look at the EBITDA margin (EBITDA
divided by total operating revenue). The sample is somewhat smaller than in the previous
columns, but the association between the management score and EBITDA margin is positive
and significant. It suggests that firms with one point higher average management score have
about 1.9 percentage point higher EBITDA margin (where the sample average EBITDA
margin is 6.3 per cent). Lastly, we look at return on total assets (ROTA, defined as earnings
before interest and taxes (EBIT) over total assets). It is an indicator of how effectively a
company is using its assets to generate earnings before contractual obligations must be paid.
ROTA indicates a firm’s ability to efficiently allocate and manage its resources (but it ignores
the firm’s liabilities). We find that ROTA is about 0.8 percentage points higher for every one
point increase in the management score (and average ROTA in the sample used for estimation
in column (5) is 6.3 per cent). Overall, Table 4 suggests that the average management score is
positively and significantly correlated with profitability measures.


The coefficients in tables 3 and 4 are of quantitative as well as statistical significance. While
we cannot establish causality between the management scores and firm performance, the
association between the two is quite strong, as shown in Chart 4. A movement from the lower
quartile (-0.66) to the upper quartile (0.70) of management scores between firms is associated
with an increase in operating revenue of between 9 (Table 3, column (6)) and 29 per cent
(Table 3, column (1)), an increase in profit margin of about 1.2-1.3 percentage points (Table
4, columns (1) to (3)), an increase in EBITDA margin of about 2.6 percentage points (Table 4,
column (4)) and an increase in return on total assets of about 1.1 percentage points (Table 4,
column (5)). These results imply that the MOI survey tool is not simply measuring statistical
noise.

      4.4 Other Performance Results
      Another dimension of performance is firm size. As with column (1) of Table 3, we found that
      in most countries large firms have on average better management practices than SMEs (small
      and medium-sized enterprises);16 the exceptions were Kazakhstan and Ukraine. One possible
      explanation is of course that good management enables firms to grow. Under this
      interpretation, reallocation effects may be weaker in the Kazakh and Ukrainian economies
      than elsewhere. But a second explanation may be that there are scale economies with

      16
           We define SMEs as establishments with fewer than 250 employees.




                                                           22
management practices. For example, SMEs may find the fixed costs of hiring management
consultants too large to justify given their scale of production (alternatively SMEs may not
have access to management consultants or are not aware of how they could help them). MOI
data suggest that large firms are more likely to have used an external consultant to help them
improve an area of management than SMEs.


We also investigated disaggregating the management scores into their component questions
(results available on request). Answers to individual questions on management practices tend
to be positively correlated: if a firm is good at one dimension of management, then it tends to
be good at all of them. Transition countries are no different from non-transition countries
covered by Bloom and Van Reenen (2010) in this respect. Because of this, identifying if some
practices matter more than others for firm performance is difficult. The only exception is the
promotions policy which is not significantly correlated with most other management
practices.




5 Factors explaining differences in management practices


As shown in Chart 3, there is a lot of heterogeneity in management practices within each
country, with firms spread across most of the distribution. Country fixed effects explain less
than 5 per cent of the differences in management practices in our sample, while 2-digit
industry effects account for only 1.3 per cent of the differences. The proportion of explained
differences is larger in non-transition countries (Germany and India) than in transition
countries, but still relatively low. Together, country and 2-digit industry effects account for
5.6 per cent of the differences in management practices in transition countries in our sample
and for 10.0 per cent of the differences in management practices in non-transition countries in
our sample (see Table 5).

Several factors may help to explain the difference in firm-level management scores, among
them product market competition, ownership, and education of employees. Charts 5-8 look at
average management scores by some of these factors in the raw data.


5.1 Product market competition
First we look at product market competition. The importance of competitive intensity in
improving productivity and management is a robust finding from a wide range of economic
studies. Stronger competition can drive out poorly managed firms but can also change the
behaviour of incumbent managers who have to lift their performance in order to survive and
prosper. Firms where the number of competitors as perceived by managers is higher, have
better management practices on average (Chart 5). We also look at this in a regression format
in Table 6, creating two dummy variables, one for firms with 2 to 5 competitors and another
for firms with more than 5 competitors. The omitted category is firms with zero competitors
or one competitor. In column (1) of Table 6, we see that better management practices are
positively and significantly associated with the managers’ own self-reported measure of the
number of competitors they face. The estimated coefficient on the dummy variable for firms
with more than 5 competitors is 1.59-times larger than the estimated coefficient on the
dummy variable for firms with 2 to 5 competitors. Increasing the number of competitors from
0-1 to 2-5 is associated with a management z-score increase of 0.150 (not significant), and
increasing the number of competitors further above 5 is associated with an additional increase
in management z-score of 0.088.




                                                24
Competition has of course been found to play an important role in determining management
practices in other contexts (Bloom and Van Reenen, 2010) and total factor productivity more
generally (Syverson, 2011).

5.2 Management practices and firms belonging to foreign-owned multinational
Prior to the start of transition, firms were mostly state owned and separated from the outside
world, and their objective was not profit maximisation. At the beginning of transition, there
were a lot of potential investment opportunities in transition economies, which were
industrialised and had cheap but highly educated workforces. However, the technologies they
were using were behind the technology used in the developed world and the managers of
firms had little experience of “working with clients, marketing their products and reacting to
demand changes” (Yudaeva et al., 2003, p. 384). Foreign direct investment (FDI) was
perceived as a catalyst because it could bring “…technology and managerial know-how
necessary for restructuring firms” (Campos and Kinoshita, 2003, p. 3).




                                             25
We find that management scores of firms belonging to foreign-owned multinational
companies are on average significantly higher than the management scores of firms belonging
to domestically owned firms (including domestically owned multinationals). The difference is
particularly striking in Lithuania and Romania (Chart 6). Furthermore, firms with foreign
owners from non-transition countries have on average higher management scores than firms
with foreign owners from transition countries and domestically owned firms (Chart 7). More
specifically, firms with foreign owners from non-transition countries have on average
statistically significantly better management practices than the other three groups (p-value for
the first pair is 0.00), and domestic private or privatised firms also have statistically
significantly better management practices than domestic state-owned firms (p-value is 0.04).


We examine this in a regression format in Table 6 columns (2) and (3). We look at foreign-
owned multinationals regardless of the country of origin, splitting these into foreign-owned
multinationals from transition and non-transition countries. A Russian owner of a Kazakh
firm may not implement much better management practices than a Kazakh owner would, but
a German owner might. The estimated coefficient on the indicator for the foreign-owned
multinationals is always positive, but as Chart 6 hinted, this effect appears to be driven by
foreign-owned multinationals with owners from non-transition countries. The coefficient on
the latter is namely statistically significant, while the coefficient on the foreign-owned
multinationals with owners from transition countries is not. However, this is probably due to
the low incidence of foreign-owned multinationals with owners from transition countries in
our sample – only 0.5 per cent of the companies in our overall sample fall into this category,
and this makes it difficult to estimate the coefficient more precisely.


Again these results reflect the results for foreign multinationals using better management
practices in other countries (Bloom et al., 2011b) and operating with higher productivity
(Syverson, 2011).

5.3 Management practices and state ownership
We also look at ownership of firms from another angle: namely, we compare currently state-
owned firms with firms that were always private or that were privatised. Chart 8 shows that
firms that have always been privately owned have on average the best management practices,
and firms that have been privatised do not differ much from them (the null hypothesis of no
differences between the two groups cannot be rejected at conventional levels of significance),
while the still state-owned firms have on average the worst management practices
(statistically significantly worse than always private firms at p-value 0.01 and privatised firms
at p-value 0.05). This suggests that privatisation is an effective medium-term means of
improvement – an encouraging result, given the importance of privatisation in transition
countries.


We look at this in a formal regression format in Table 6, column (4). The estimated
coefficient on the indicator for currently state-owned firms is negative, but it is not
significant. It is, however, negative and statistically significant at the 5 per cent level when we
do not control for 2-digit industry fixed effects (not reported here). Estimating each regression
by industry we found that the state ownership variable is negative and statistically significant
at the 5 per cent level in a large number of sectors.17 About 64 per cent of currently state-
owned firms are in one of the industries where the estimated coefficient is statistically
significant (and always negative), and they represent 16 per cent of all firms in these
industries (compared to 8 per cent in the remaining industries). All these industries taken
together have on average a lower management practices score than the other industries.
Within this group of industries, currently state-owned firms have on average statistically
significantly worse management practices while the same is not true for the group of other
industries. Hence, some of the variation in management practices due to state-owned firms is
picked up by the industry effects.

5.4 Management practices and human capital
Average education level of employees may also be correlated with the quality of management
practices. We have included percentage of employees with a completed college degree among
the controls in all of our estimations and the estimated coefficient is always positive and
significant at the 1 per cent level of significance. This could be because such employees are
more familiar with the best practices used in their line of work and are more supportive to
implementing them in their workplace.


We have shown that competition, belonging to foreign-owned multinationals, and average
education level of employees are (positively) associated with management scores on their
own. We also estimate the association between management scores and these factors jointly in
columns (5) to (8) of Table 6, finding our results robust to this and a variety of samples and
controls.




                                             30
6 Summary and concluding remarks


We have shown that management practices differ across countries and across firms within
countries. They are positively associated with various measures of firm performance, such as
productivity, profit margin, EBITDA margin and return on total assets: an improvement in
management practices scores from the lower to the upper quartile of their distribution is
associated with around 9 per cent increase in operating revenue, an increase in profit margin
by more than 85 per cent, an increase in EBITDA margin by more than 55 per cent and an
increase in the return on total assets by almost 20 per cent. Given that they are associated with
firm performance, they may also be an important explanation for the differences in
productivity between firms and countries.


Several factors seem important in influencing management quality, in particular product
market competition, ownership and level of human capital. Important policy implications or
lessons can be drawn from all of these. Stronger competition can drive out poorly managed
(and performing) firms, but also change the behaviour of incumbent managers who have to
improve their performance in order to survive and prosper. Aghion et al. (2010) show that
levels of product market competition in transition economies (measured in terms of average
profit mark-ups) have increased substantially since the beginning of the 1990s, but they
remain below the OECD average and there is in general less competition the further east you
go (also EBRD 2008, 2009). The level of product market competition of course varies by
sector, reflecting the stages of development of industries, but it is primarily determined by the
efficiency and effectiveness of competition policy.


Ownership matters as well. Our analysis shows that firms belonging to foreign multinationals
with owners from non-transition countries have the best management practices. There is also
some evidence, albeit weaker, that state-owned firms tend to have the worst management
practices. The good news is that privatised (formerly state-owned) firms do not differ
significantly from firms that were privately owned from the beginning in terms of the quality
of management practices. This suggests that privatisation is an effective medium-term means
of improvement (the actual result is likely to depend on the new owners and possibly the




                                               31
transparency of the privatisation process), and that openness to foreign investment is key to
spreading best practice.


Finally, management practices are also positively associated with the level of human capital,
as measured by the percentage of employees with a completed college degree. It is plausible
that it might be easier to implement the best management practices when the workforce is
more knowledgeable and may even suggest initiatives to improve the operational process.
Inadequately educated labour force was consistently named as one of the top three business
obstacles in virtually all transition countries covered by BEEPS in 2008-09, which indicates
that businesses are becoming more aware of the importance of suitable education and are
hitting on a serious constraint in developing their businesses further. More basic business
education and better, more effective education in general could help to improve management
practices and foster growth of businesses.
