Analytical General Equilibrium Effects of Energy Policy on Output and Factor Prices

JEL No. H2,Q5

                                             ABSTRACT

Using an analytical general equilibrium model, we find closed form solutions for the effect of energy
policy on factor prices and output prices. We calibrate the model to the US economy, and we consider
a tax on carbon. By looking at expenditure and income patterns across household groups, we quantify
the uses-side and sources-side incidence of the tax. When households are categorized either by annual
income or by total annual consumption as a proxy for permanent income, the uses-side incidence is
regressive. This result is robust to sensitivity analysis over various parameter values. The sources-side
incidence is also regressive, but this result is sensitive to parameter values. Incidence results across
regions are also presented.

       Energy is an integral input to nearly all aspects of our economy. Energy policies,
especially policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy
consumption, thus have sizable effects on nearly all participants in our economy. The
distribution of these effects, both costs and benefits, across participants is an important
consideration of policy design.
       The incidence of the costs of energy or climate policy manifests itself in at least two
major ways. First, policy affects the “uses side” of income, through product prices. A carbon
tax may disproportionately increase the price of gasoline and electricity, two goods that represent
a higher share of expenditure for poorer households. The uses side incidence is then regressive.
Second, policy affects the “sources side” of income, through factor prices. A carbon tax may be
more burdensome to capital-intensive industries and disproportionately reduce the return to
capital. If so, and if capital provides a higher share of income for richer households, then the
sources side incidence may be progressive.
       Many studies of the distributional impacts of climate or energy policy focus on the uses
side only, through a partial equilibrium approach. The purpose of this paper is to analyze both
the uses side and the sources side incidence of domestic climate policy using an analytical
general equilibrium model with closed form solutions that highlight conceptual issues by
showing the general effects of each parameter on each result.
       Our model is based on the standard (Harberger 1962) tax incidence model, with two
factors of production (labor and capital) and two sectors of production (a "dirty" or non-polluting
sector and a "clean" sector). We add pollution, modeled as a third input to production in the
dirty sector. In earlier papers, we show analytically how output prices and the returns to capital
and labor are affected by changes in several types of pollution policy, including a pollution tax,
tradable permits, performance standards, or technology mandates.
       In this paper, we quantify those analytical results numerically. We calibrate the model to
the US economy, and we consider effects of carbon policy. We solve for the impacts on the
prices of carbon-intensive goods relative to clean goods, and on the wage and the capital rental
rate. Then, using data on households' expenditure patterns and income sources, we use these
solutions to calculate the distribution of uses side and sources side costs across income groups
and regions.

        When families are categorized either by annual income or by total annual consumption,
the uses-side incidence of a carbon tax is regressive. Lower-income households spend a higher
fraction of their expenditures on carbon-intensive goods than do higher-income households.
This result is robust and corroborates many other papers (Burtraw, Sweeney and Walls 2009),
(Hassett, Mathur and Metcalf 2009). On the sources side, the incidence results are sensitive to
the chosen parameter values. In particular, the regressivity or progressivity on the sources side
depends on the elasticities of substitution in production for polluting industries. These
elasticities have not been estimated, and thus we present incidence calculations for several
alternative values. When categorized by region, the uses-side incidence is again robust; regions
that spend more than average on carbon-intensive goods bear a disproportionately high burden
(especially the Midwest and the South). The sources-side incidence again depends on
substitution elasticity values.
        A disadvantage of our methodology lies in its aggregation to only two sectors and two or
three factors of production. A more disaggregated model could be more realistic and could be
used to calculate more specific effects on prices of each different good and factor. However,
more disaggregation and other features would require a computer to solve for results
numerically. For us, the aggregation and other simplifications provide the advantage that we can
derive analytical solutions for general equilibrium effects on both output and factor prices that
hold for any parameters in the model, not just for particular numerical implementations.
        The next section presents the model and analytic solutions. Section 2 describes the
calibration, and section 3 presents the simulation results.

1. Model

        This model is based on an earlier one (Fullerton and Heutel 2007), which itself is an
extension of Harberger (1962). We briefly summarize the model here.
        The economy consists of two sectors producing two different final goods. One sector, X,
uses only capital KX and labor LX as inputs; it is labeled the clean sector. The dirty sector, Y,
uses both capital and labor (KY and LY) and a third input, pollution (Z). Production functions
have constant returns to scale, but otherwise no particular functional form:

                                           X = X(KX, LX)
                                          Y = Y(KY, LY, Z).
                                                           4


Total capital and labor resources are fixed:

                                                  KX + KY =            ,
                                                  LX + LY =            .

By totally differentiating these two constraints, we get:

                                                  λKX +        λKY = 0,                                           (1)
                                                  λLX +        λLY = 0,                                           (2)

where variables with a hat denote a proportional change (e.g.                          = dKX/KX), and where λij
denotes sector j's share of factor i (e.g. λKX = KX/               ).
       Producers of the clean good X face a rental price for capital (r) and a wage price for
labor (w). Their factor demand choices are defined by their elasticity of substitution in
production, σX:

                                                 –       = σX(             –    ).                                (3)

Producers of the dirty good Y face prices for all three of their inputs. Their factor demand
choices can be defined in terms of Allen elasticities of substitution between their inputs, eij , and
revenue shares of inputs, θYK = rKY/pYY. These relationships follow (Mieszkowski 1972) and
(Allen 1938):

                         –      = θYK(eKK – eZK)         + θYL(eKL – eZL)             + θYZ(eKZ – eZZ)    ,       (4)
                         –     = θYK(eLK – eZK)          + θYL(eLL – eZL)             + θYZ(eLZ – eZZ)   .        (5)

       Assuming perfect competition and constant returns to scale in production yields zero
profit conditions that can be differentiated to get:

                         +     = θXK(     +       ) + θXL(         +           ),                                 (6)
                     +        = θYK( +          ) + θYL(       +           ) + θYZ(    +    ).                    (7)

       Totally differentiating each sector's production function and using the assumption of
perfect competition yields:

                             = θXK      + θXL        ,                                                            (8)
                         = θYK       + θYL        + θYZ .                                                         (9)
                                                           5


           Lastly, we model consumer preferences for the two goods with the elasticity of
substitution in utility, σu:

                              –     = σu(      –     ).                                                        (10)

           These ten equations constitute the model. Because the model has eleven unknowns, we
choose good X as numeraire, setting                 = 0. Then, the system of equations can be solved to
consider how an exogenous change in the pollution tax τZ affects factor prices w and r and
output prices, given by pY. The choice of normalization means that all price changes are relative
to the price of X. Thus, if            > 0, the price of good Y increases relative to the price of good
X, so consumers who spend more than average on good Y are burdened relatively more than are
other consumers on the uses side. Furthermore, the normalization implies that                      and      are
always of opposite sign (subtract equation (8) from equation (6)). Sector X has only two inputs,
so if one input price rises then the other must fall for those firms to break even, with no change
in output price. Yet, this does not imply that owners of one factor will gain and owners of the
other will lose. Rather, if          > 0 and        < 0, it means that the burden on capital is
proportionally greater than capital's share in national income.
           The model's solution for output and factor prices is presented below. 1 See our earlier
paper for the steps to derive this solution (Fullerton and Heutel 2007).




These equations use several additional definitions for convenience. Let γK ≡ λKY/λKX = KY/KX
and γL ≡ λLY/λLX = LY/LX, A ≡ γKγL + γLθYK + γK(θYL + θYZ), B ≡ γKγL + γKθYL + γL(θYK + θYZ), and
D ≡ (θXKγK + θXLγL + 1)σX + A[θXKθYL(eKL–eLZ)–θXLθYK(eKK–eKZ)] – B[θXKθYL(eLL–eLZ)–θXLθYK(eKL–
eKZ)] – (γK – γL)σu(θXKθYL – θXLθYK).
           We briefly identify and interpret the effects present in these rather complex equations. In
the equations for the factor price changes,               and     , the last term in the bracket, (γK – γL)σu,

1
    We omit closed-form expressions for the remaining seven endogenous variables, including the change in pollution
(    ), since our focus here is on incidence through price changes.
                                                            6


represents the "output effect." The expression (γK – γL) is positive whenever the dirty sector is
capital-intensive. If so, assuming the denominator is positive (D > 0), then an increase in the
pollution tax (         > 0) will tend to decrease the return to capital r relative to the wage w. The
extent to which capital is burdened depends both on (γK – γL), the degree of capital intensity, and
σu, the consumer’s ability to substitute away from the taxed sector’s output.
           The first two terms in the bracket of the equations for factor price changes represent
"substitution effects." The sign of these terms depends on the values of the Allen elasticities eij.
In the case of equal factor intensities where the output effect disappears, it can be shown that the
substitution effect burdens capital more than it burdens labor whenever eLZ > eKZ, that is,
whenever labor is a better substitute for pollution than is capital. When the price of emissions
rises, and a firm wants to reduce emissions, it may do so and retain the same output level by
altering its labor and capital inputs. If it increases labor more than it increases capital, then we
say that labor is a better substitute for pollution than is capital. For example, a firm may switch
from operating capital machinery that creates pollution and toward using more relatively clean
labor inputs.
           In the equation for        , the final term is          . This term represents a "direct" effect
from an increased pollution tax: the increased cost of the pollution input is passed into the output
price in proportion to pollution's share in production, θYZ. The rest of the expression represents
all of the general equilibrium effects, or "indirect" effects, affecting the output price, including
output effects and substitution effects described above.

II. Calibration

           We now calibrate this model to the US economy in a way that allows us to consider a tax
on carbon dioxide (CO2). Our model only has two sectors, so we must decide which industries
of the economy are aggregated under the dirty sector and which under the clean. Because CO2 is
emitted in the generation of electricity, an intermediate input used by all industries, no output is
completely "clean" as is output X in this model. Instead, we choose to label as the dirty
industries those that emit the most CO2 relative to their output.
           For information on factor intensities by industry we use data from Jorgenson, et al
(2008). 2 These data divide the US economy into 35 sectors (roughly corresponding to two-digit

SIC codes). They present the value of capital and labor inputs for each sector through 2006.
Most CO2 emissions come from three industries: electricity generation (38.7%), transportation
(30.6%), and manufacturing (23.3%). 3 Of manufacturing industries, the highest emitter of CO2,
both absolutely and as a fraction of the value of output, is petroleum refining. 4 We use our data
to isolate this manufacturing sector, along with electricity and transportation. We include these
in the dirty sector, and all remaining industries are aggregated to the clean sector.
         These definitions give us total factor inputs of labor and capital in the clean and dirty
sectors. One more datum is needed to determine the factor intensity parameters, and that is θYZ,
the share of sector Y's output that derives from pollution. Since polluting industries do not pay
an explicit price for CO2 emissions, this parameter cannot be calibrated from data. Instead, we
calibrate it based on estimates of the optimal price on carbon from prior papers. A price of $15
per metric ton of CO2 is often recommended, and we thus use this price as a starting point
(Hassett, Mathur and Metcalf 2009). The value of θYZ is 0.0723, based on this price and our
definition of the dirty sector of the economy. 5
         That calibration and the data from Jorgenson et. al. (2008) jointly determine the factor
intensity parameters shown in Table 1. Without loss of generality we define a unit of each good
as the amount that sells for $1 in the initial equilibrium. The total factor income of the economy
(𝐾𝐾 + 𝐿𝐿) is also normalized to one. Using these parameters, the clean sector represents about
93% of factor income of the economy. The dirty sector is relatively capital-intensive. Labor
accounts for about 61% of total factor income.

126.0 million metric tons. As a fraction of output, the petroleum industry's emissions are 30% higher than the next
highest industry (primary metals).

  Total U.S. GNP in 2008 is $14.3 trillion. Our definition of the dirty sector accounts for 6.7% of total factor
income, or $0.954 trillion. Annual carbon dioxide emissions from the dirty sector total 4.589 billion metric tons. At
$15 per metric ton, the value of these carbon emissions is $68.8 billion, or 7.23% of the value of the dirty sector.

           The elasticity of substitution in production for the clean sector, σX, is set to one. This
value is consistent with estimates of the economy-wide elasticity, and since the clean sector is
93% of the economy, it is a decent approximation of the elasticity we seek. In the “base case”,
we also set the elasticity of substitution in consumption, σu, to one.
           The last set of parameters needed are the Allen elasticities of substitution in production
for the dirty sector, eij. Only three of these can be set independently; the rest are determined by
these three values and the factor intensities, using equations from Allen (1938). We know of no
studies that have estimated these cross-price elasticities directly. Some studies, however, have
estimated elasticities between inputs of capital, labor, and energy inputs (including fossil fuels).
Using data from Western European countries and reviewing the literature, (de Mooij and
Bovenberg 1998) find preferred estimates of eKL = 0.5, eKZ = 0.5, and eLZ = 0.3. These suggest
that capital is a slightly better substitute for pollution than is labor. We use these values in our
base case, and we vary them to test the sensitivity of results.
           Our aggregated model gives us the change in input and output prices for any given policy
change. We want to translate those aggregate price changes into effects on real people, to
calculate the uses- and sources-side incidence of the policy. To do so, we gather data on the
expenditure and income of households with various demographic characteristics. For example,
we divide all households into ten deciles by income. For each decile, we calculate the fraction of
expenditures on clean vs. dirty goods, and we calculate the fraction of income from capital vs.
labor. We can then quantify the burden of this policy change on each group.
           We use expenditure and income tabulated data from the 2008 Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CEX). 6 The CEX data come from a representative sample of the U.S. population.
These micro-level data provide information on expenditures and income sources. We can define
groups numerous ways, such as by annual income, race, and region of residence. For each group
(say, the lowest income decile), we can calculate the average expenditure on fairly detailed
categories, including foods of various types (beef, pork, etc.), housing (mortgage interest,
property tax, rent, etc.), and clothing (mens, womens, footwear, etc.). We also can calculate for
each group the distribution of income sources, including income from wages and salaries, self-
employment, and interest, dividends, rental income, and other property income. We do not

directly know capital gains income, but we know changes in the values of securities, which may
proxy for realized and unrealized capital gains.
          Table 2 summarizes the distribution of income and expenditures by annual income decile.
Columns two through four present the distribution of income between wage, capital, and transfer
income. Wage and salary income are directly reported. Capital income is the sum of income
from interest, dividends, rental income, other property income, and net change in securities (to
measure capital gains). Wage and capital income sum to less than 100% because of transfer
income sources: Social Security, unemployment and workers' compensation, and other public
assistance. We omit the categories "other income" and self-employment income, because we
cannot identify their mix between capital and labor income (they account for a total of about 5%
of income).

          Overall, about 89% of consumer income is from wages, 3% from capital, and 9% from
transfers. This varies somewhat by income group. The fraction of income coming from
transfers is declining from the first to the last income decile. For all households above median
income, we see a slight positive correlation between income and the fraction of income from
capital. For poorer households, however, no such pattern emerges; the capital share of income
bounces around from 6% to 2%. Column 5 presents averages for the capital-wage income ratio,
excluding any income from transfers. Even this ratio is not monotonic.
                                                        10


        The column for capital income indicates one major problem with using annual income to
categorize families from rich to poor: the group with the lowest annual income has the highest
fraction of income from capital (6%). This group includes a lot of retired individuals who have
no labor income and are living off their retirement savings. These individuals may not really be
"poor" on a lifetime basis. In other words, we would like to classify households by the stock of
lifetime wealth, but instead we are classifying them by a flow of annual income. If individuals
smooth consumption over their lifetime, as pointed out by Poterba (1989), then total annual
consumption might be a good proxy for lifetime income (or at least, a better proxy than annual
income). We investigate this alternative below.
        The final two columns in Table 2 present a distribution of expenditures between the clean
and dirty outputs. Unfortunately, our earlier distinction between clean and dirty production
sectors does not present us with an immediate mapping into the distinction between clean and
dirty consumption goods. Some of the outputs of the industries defined as dirty are used as
inputs to industries defined as clean. A complete analysis would account for these inputs, for
example by using Input-Output matrices as in Hassett, Mathur and Metcalf (2009). Here, we
simply assign final consumption goods into either a clean or dirty category. Four categories of
expenditures (out of the 74 total) are labeled as dirty: electricity, natural gas, fuel oil and other
fuels, and gasoline. These are the goods whose consumption directly involves the combustion of
fossil fuels (save for electricity, some of which is generated by nuclear or renewable sources).
This choice is justified by a more complete analysis considering the pass-through of costs
through intermediate goods (Hassett, Mathur and Metcalf 2009). For a $15 per metric ton of
carbon tax, they find that the prices of these four categories of goods increase by 8-13%, while
no other category of goods sees a price increase of greater than 1%. 7
        Overall, 9% of expenditures go toward these dirty goods. The pattern of expenditures for
income groups is smoother than is the pattern for income source. Higher income households
spend a lower fraction of their total expenditures on dirty goods than do lower income
households. The pattern is not quite monotonic, though. Households in the lowest decile spend
a slightly lower fraction on dirty goods than do those in the second and third deciles. 8 But the

7
 The exception is air transportation, whose price increases by 1.86%. The CEX tables do not list expenditures on
air transportation separately (they are lumped with public transportation).
8
 This point is made in Poterba (1991) and West and Williams (2004) who look at gasoline expenditures. The very
poorest households do not own cars.
                                                 11


very richest households spend a considerably lower fraction on dirty goods than do those middle
income households, about half of the size in percentage points.
       Because of the issues discussed earlier with measuring incidence across annual income
groups, Table 3 presents the same income and expenditure decomposition across deciles defined
by total annual expenditure. Annual expenditures can proxy for lifetime income. In Table 3, the
pattern in spending across clean and dirty goods is the same as in Table 2; richer households
spend a lower fraction of their expenditures on dirty goods. In fact, when broken up by
consumption decile rather than by annual income decile, the variance in the fraction spent on the
dirty good between groups is greater. The gap between the richest and poorest groups'
percentage spent on the dirty good is 9 percentage points in Table 3, versus 4 percentage points
in Table 2.
       This greater disparity is intuitive. Suppose that annual consumption appropriately
proxies for lifetime wealth, so that columns 6 and 7 of Table 3 describe relative spending on
clean and dirty goods for lifetime wealth deciles. As households receive annual income shocks,
some households will transition from one consumption decile to a different annual income
decile. For example, a household in the fourth decile of the lifetime consumption/wealth
distribution may in 2008 find itself in the lowest annual income decile. If this household
perfectly smooths consumption, then it will spend 13.4% of its expenditures on the dirty good.
This effect lowers the average fraction of expenditure on the dirty good for the lowest annual
income group. Similarly, a household that finds itself in a higher annual income decile than its
lifetime income decile spends a higher fraction on the dirty good than other households in that
decile, increasing the average for that annual income decile. Thus, the shocks to annual income
flatten out the between-group variance in expenditure patterns on clean vs. dirty goods.
       The implications of this phenomenon will be seen below in the simulation results.
Briefly, when a carbon tax hike increases the relative price of the dirty good, then the tax hike
appears more regressive when households are divided into annual consumption groups than
when households are divided into annual income groups.
       The relationship between expenditure decile and income source is still not monotonic,
with the exception that transfer income's share declines across the expenditure deciles. The
wage-capital ratio still shows no clear pattern. However, Table 3 does show some evidence that
                                                            12


the households in the top two expenditure deciles earn a considerably higher fraction of their
income from capital than do other households. 9

III. Numerical Results

           The base case results for changes in goods prices and factor prices are presented in Table
4. We consider the effects of doubling the carbon tax from $15 per ton to $30 per ton, that is, a
100% increase in the carbon tax rate (              = 1).


                                Table 4: Base Case Simulation Results
               Change in the price of the dirty good,             7.21%
                    Change in the wage rate,                     0.0419%
                  Change in the return to capital,              –0.0694%


           The change in the relative output price               is about equal to θYZ         , which we called
the "direct" effect from passing through the tax increase. The relative changes in the wage and
the capital rental rate are small, but we expect them to be small. They come from doubling the
9
  Annual expenditure is a proxy for lifetime income if households smooth consumption. However, households
cannot smooth their income streams; the wage-capital income ratio for any particular lifetime income decile will
vary over the lifetime. If every decile has the same distribution across ages of those within the decile, however, then
the fact that the capital-wage ratio varies with age should not create a bias in our calculation of each decile’s capital-
wage ratio. Even if a large cohort of 50-60 year olds exists in the overall sample, for example, then the calculated
capital-wage ratio of all lifetime income groups will be more similarly dependent on individuals in this age group.

price of an input that represents 7% of a sector, which itself comprises about 7% of the economy.
The change in the capital rental rate      is negative, and the change in the wage        is positive,
so capital bears a higher than proportional share of the burden of the tax increase. In our base
case parameters, capital is a better substitute for pollution than is labor (eKZ > eLZ), so the
substitution effect pushes more of the burden onto labor. However, the dirty sector is capital-
intensive, so the output effect pushes more of the burden on capital. Here, the output effect
dominates the substitution effect.
        We then use Table 2 to translate these price changes into relative uses-side and sources-
side burdens of different annual income groups. For each income group, we first calculate
times expenditures on the dirty good, plus         times expenditures spent on the clean good.
Because our numeraire used in solving the system sets          = 0, these burdens will be positive
for each group. Yet none of these results should imply anything about how much of the burden
is on the uses side compared to the sources side; that comparison depends entirely on the choice
of numeraire (or equivalently, on whether monetary policy accommodates the increase in output
prices or forces the burden to be felt by falling factor prices). Since the choice of numeraire does
not affect the real incidence of a tax, the discussion of burdens on the uses side should focus only
on who spends relatively more on each good (not on how much of the burden is on the uses
side). Similarly,the discussion of sources side should focus only on who earns relatively more
from each factor.
        For this reason, we normalize the calculated uses side burden for each group by
subtracting from it a uses side calculation based on the entire sample. Those groups with a
positive value see the cost of their expenditures increase more than the average, and those groups
with a negative value see their cost increase less than the average. The calculation is similar for
the sources-side incidence. It is       times income from wages plus        times income from
capital, minus this value calculated for the entire sample. Using this procedure, results do not
depend on the choice of numeraire. We change the sign of the sources side calculation, however,
so that those income groups whose income decrease more than the average have a positive
"burden", while those groups whose income decrease less than the average have a negative
burden (a relative gain from the carbon tax).

       These incidence results are presented in Table 5. The pattern of uses-side burdens is
clear: the highest income groups (the top two deciles) suffer a smaller than average share of this
burden. Their cost of goods decreases relative to the average, because they spend a lower than
average fraction on the dirty good. With our choice of numeraire, the average increase in overall
price is about 0.72% (a 7.2% increase in the price of the good that constitutes 10% of total
expenditure). Thus, Table 5 tells us that the highest income group's price increase under this
normalization overall is only about 0.51%, whereas the second-to-lowest income group sees an
overall price increase of about 0.87%. These results are consistent with those in Hassett, Mathur
and Metcalf (2009), who examine the uses-side incidence of a carbon tax. They find that the
relative burden is monotonically decreasing across the income deciles. Burtraw, et al (2009) find
the same result of uses-side regressivity for a cap-and-trade policy.
       The sources-side burden is also regressive; the positive values for the lowest income
deciles indicate that those households' incomes fall proportionally more than average. In the
base case simulation,     > 0 and     < 0, so earning a higher fraction of income from capital
tends to decrease overall real income. Because of transfers, however, the sources-side incidence
is not fully determined by just the capital-wage income ratios shown in Table 2. The highest
value of that ratio is for the lowest income decile, though the highest relative income burden is
for the second-to-lowest income decile. The sources-side incidence results in Table 5 derive
primarily from the increase in the fraction of income from wages across the income deciles.

       Table 6 presents the same calculations for annual consumption deciles instead of annual
income deciles. Both the uses-side and sources-side incidences are regressive. When defined by
annual consumption groups, however, the uses-side incidence is more regressive than when
defined by annual income, and the sources-side incidence is less regressive than when defined by
annual income. The lowest expenditure decile's relative price increase is greater than is the
lowest income decile's, and the highest expenditure decile's relative price decrease is greater than
is the lowest income decile's. This pattern can be seen in Figures 1 and 2. This result occurs
because the between-decile variance in the fraction of spending on the dirty good is higher across
consumption deciles than across income deciles. In addition, sources-side regressivity is lower
in Table 6 than in Table 5 primarily due to the increased fraction of income from capital as
annual consumption increases.

Sensitivity Analysis

       The results in Tables 4-6 are calculated using our base case parameter values. Some of
these parameters are based on solid information about factor shares or consumption shares, but
some of the elasticity parameters are known with little precision. Thus, sensitivity analysis is in
order. In particular, the elasticities of substitution in production for the dirty sector have not
been directly estimated. Next, we present alternative incidence calculations for two different sets
of parameter values. All of the parameters are identical to their base case values except for the
dirty sector substitution elasticities. In the first set of results (in columns 2 and 3), we set eKL =
0.5, eKZ = 1, and eLZ = –0.5. Capital is a much better substitute for pollution than is labor; in
fact, labor is a complement for pollution rather than a substitute. As we expect, under these
                                                                          16


parameters, labor ends up relatively worse off with a pollution tax increase. The resulting price
changes are        = 7.32%,           = –0.20%, and                           = 0.33%. The second set of results (in columns
4 and 5) are based on parameters where labor is a much better substitute for pollution than is
labor: eKL = 0.5, eKZ = –0.5, and eLZ = 1. The price changes under these parameter values are
    = 7.04%,       = 0.41%, and                   = –0.68%.

       Table 7 presents the resulting incidence calculations across annual income groups.
Columns 2 and 3 present the relative burdens from the uses side and sources side for the first set
of alternative parameter values, where capital is a better substitute for pollution than is labor.
The uses-side incidence results are not affected very much, even with this large change of
production substitution elasticities. The households with the lowest income tend to see higher
than average increases in their costs, indicating a regressive uses-side incidence. However,
under these parameter values the sources-side incidence results are starkly different from those in
the base case results from Table 5. Here, the richest households (those with a lot of labor
income) see their incomes decrease relative to the average, while the poorest households (those
with capital) see their incomes increase relative to the average. Under these parameters, capital
is a better substitute for pollution than is labor, so the pollution tax increase means that labor is
made relatively worse off. The highest annual income groups tend to have a higher than average
fraction of their income from labor, and thus they are worse off under this parameterization.

       Columns 4 and 5 present incidence calculations under the parameter values that make
labor a much better substitute for pollution than capital. Again, the uses-side incidence results
are virtually no different than in the base case; the burden is regressive. However, the sources-
side incidence results are the opposite to those from columns 2 and 3 but are in the same
direction as in the base case. Here, because the return to capital falls, the poorest households see
                                                    18


their income decrease relative to the average, and the richest households see their income
increase relative to the average. As in the base case results, the sources-side incidence is
regressive. Whereas the base case         was 0.042%, and        was –0.069%, these larger
elasticities yield   = 0.41%, and         = –0.68% (ten times as big). The degree of regressivity is
therefore higher than in the base case, as the magnitudes of the factor price changes are higher in
this simulation than in the base case.
        Table 8 presents the same sensitivity analysis for expenditure deciles, and it shows
qualitatively the same results. Again, uses-side regressivity is somewhat higher and sources-side
regressivity is somewhat lower compared to annual income deciles.

        In our base case and in columns (4)-(5) where the wage rises, then capital bears a
relatively higher burden than labor. Richer households bear less burden on the sources side,
because their income is labor intensive. This result may be counterintuitive, as one might expect
that richer households depend more on capital for their income than on labor. And it holds
whether households are grouped by annual income or by annual consumption as a proxy for
lifetime income – where one might expect that the problems with using annual income groups
are lessened. Yet it must be emphasized that the income data (especially capital income data) in
the CEX are very imperfect, and so these results must be cautiously interpreted. As discussed
                                                   19


earlier, the sources-side incidence is primarily driven by the share of income from wages, which
increases with both income decile and with consumption decile.
        An additional sensitivity analysis we perform involves varying the elasticity of
substitution in utility, σu. In the base case this value is one. The analytical solutions of the
model show that the value of this parameter affects the strength of the output effect. As with the
elasticities of substitution in production for the dirty sector, the true value of this parameter is not
known. We choose two alternate values for σu: 0.5 and 1.5. For each value, we calculate the
incidence across income and expenditure deciles. The substitution elasticities in production are
kept at the base case values. When σu = 0.5, the price changes are 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑌𝑌 = 7.24%, 𝑤𝑤
                                                                                   � = –0.0270%,
and 𝑟𝑟̂ = 0.0447%. When σu = 1.5, they are 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑌𝑌 = 7.18%, 𝑤𝑤
                                                           � = 0.11%, and 𝑟𝑟̂ = –0.18% (factor
price effects are reversed). In both simulations the dirty sector is capital-intensive, and so the
output effect makes capital worse off. When σu = 0.5, the output effect is small and dominated
by the substitution effect (which makes capital better off since eKZ > eLZ). When σu = 1.5, the
output effect is large and dominates the substitution effect, so capital bears relatively more of the
burden of the carbon tax increase. The uses-side incidence 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑌𝑌 does not vary much with σu.

        Table 9 presents the incidence calculations for these alternative parameter values defined
over annual income deciles, and Table 10 presents them defined over annual expenditure deciles.
As in the previous sensitivity analyses, the value of σu does not affect the uses-side incidence; it
                                                 20


is regressive for both alternate values of σu and for both definitions of deciles. The value of σu
does, however, affect the sources-side incidence. When σu is low, as in Columns 2 and 3 of
Tables 9 and 10, the output effect hurting capital is small and dominated, so the burden on
capital is low. Since the poorest households receive a higher proportion of income from capital,
they bear less of the burden in these scenarios. On the other hand, when σu is high, the burden
on capital owners is increased since the output effect dominates. Thus, poorer households bear
relatively more of the burden. All of these findings hold for both annual income and annual
expenditure deciles, although the degree of sources-side regressivity or progressivity is larger for
annual income deciles than for annual expenditure deciles.

Middle-Aged Heads of Household

       Annual income is a poor proxy for lifetime income. Annual consumption may be a better
proxy, but even this measure fails to show a consistent pattern in the capital–wage income ratio.
A large part of the problem is that individuals have different income patterns at different stages
of their lives. Retirees have low income but high savings, and college students have low income
but high borrowing. Some evidence for this pattern appears in the CEX data. The mean age of
the head of the household varies considerably by annual income decile. The overall mean age is
49.6 years. The youngest average age is in the second-richest annual income decile (45.3 years),
and the oldest average age is in the fourth-poorest annual income decile (58.9 years). The six

lowest annual income deciles all have mean ages younger than the other four income deciles.
The range of mean ages is not as large when households are divided into consumption deciles
instead of income deciles; mean age ranges from 47.2 years to 53.1 years.
             An alternative method of overcoming this life-cycle problem is by focusing on only one
age group for head of household. We choose households whose heads are 41-50 years old. 10
Table 11 summarizes the income and expenditure data across the ten annual income deciles of
these households. Overall, these households receive a higher fraction of their income from
wages and less from capital or transfers than do other households. The fraction of expenditures
on dirty goods is identical to that for all households. Across income deciles, the decreasing
fraction of income from transfers is again seen. Here, though, the dropoff is much steeper than it
is for all households; this fraction drops to single-digit percentages by the third decile. This is
likely because these households are not receiving nearly as much Social Security retirement
income as all other households. The capital-wage ratio and the fraction of income from capital
both reach their maximum in the poorest decile. Across deciles, these values do not exhibit a
clear pattern. The second-highest value in each column occurs in the richest decile.

  Another approach, which we do not pursue here, is to attempt to create a synthetic cohort of households using
multiple years of the CEX. See Jorgenson and Slesnick (2008), who create a synthetic cohort from the CEX based
on date of birth.

          Table 12 presents the incidence calculations for these households. Columns 2 and 3
present results using the base case parameters, columns 4 and 5 are from the alternative
substitution elasticity values where capital is a much better substitute for pollution than is labor,
and columns 6 and 7 are from the alternative substitution elasticity values where labor is a much
better substitute for pollution. As before, the uses-side burden is regressive and consistent across
parameter values. In the base case, the sources-side incidence is also regressive. The highest
value in the relative income burden occurs for the poorest decile. However, the pattern is non-
monotonic. The fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth deciles bear a smaller than average share of the
burden, while all other deciles bear a larger than average share. The positive value for the
highest decile arises because of that decile's higher than average income share from capital. This
represents some slight evidence that the richest households bear a higher sources-side burden
because of their larger-than-average income share from capital.

Regional Incidence
          Incidence can be defined across groups defined in ways other than annual income or
annual expenditure. We look also at incidence across regions. The CEX microdata are used to
tabulate expenditure and income data by the four census regions. Table 13 summarizes these
tabulations, breaking up the clean and dirty industries in the same way as in Table 2.
Households in the West region earn a substantially higher fraction of their income from capital
                                                 23


and less from transfers. Households in the West spend a lower fraction of their expenditures on
dirty goods, and households in the South spend a higher fraction on the dirty good, compared to
the average. A reason is that households in the South spend more than elsewhere on electricity
for their air conditioners.

        Table 14 presents the incidence calculations across regions. We present the results for
the base case parameter values (in columns 2 and 3) as well as for the two sets of alternative
production elasticities from Table 7 (in columns 4-7). Across all parameter values, the uses-side
incidence results do not qualitatively vary. Households in the Northeast and in the West bear
relatively less of the uses-side burden than do households in the Midwest and the South (since
these latter two regions spend a higher than average fraction of expenditures on the dirty good).
On the sources side, the incidence results again depend on parameter values. In the base case,
households in the West are made somewhat worse off than average, since they receive a higher
fraction of their income from capital. This disparity is even larger in the second set of alternative
parameter values (columns 6 and 7), where labor is a much better substitute for pollution than
capital. The incidence result is reversed in columns 4 and 5, where capital is a much better
substitute for pollution than is labor. Here, households in the West see an income increase
relative to the average, because they earn a higher fraction of their income from capital. The
variance in relative income burdens across regions is much lower than the variance in relative
expenditure burdens, and much lower than the variance in relative income burdens across income
or expenditure deciles.

IV. Conclusion

           We use an analytical general equilibrium tax incidence model to examine the uses-side
and sources-side distribution of burdens from a carbon tax. Our model shows that, for our base
case parameter values, the uses-side costs are relatively more burdensome on those who spend
more than average on dirty goods (electricity, natural gas, gasoline, heating oil). This reinforces
previous findings that the uses-side incidence is regressive (Hassett, Mathur and Metcalf 2009,
Burtraw, Sweeney and Walls 2009). The base case results suggest that the sources-side costs are
relatively more burdensome on those who earn a higher than average fraction of their income
from capital (because carbon-intensive industries tend to be more capital-intensive). This
implies a regressive burden when households are divided by annual income or annual
expenditure. Also, however, this result is sensitive to calibrated parameter values that are not
known.
           Many extensions to the model are possible. One could consider imperfect factor
mobility, more sectors, more final goods, intermediate goods, market power, or other
refinements. The effect of market power or industry regulation may be of particular relevance to
a carbon tax, since electric utilities are large emitters and are often highly regulated monopolists.
One could also more carefully model the policy, rather than just modeling it as a tax. 11 A more
complex CGE model may present more specific results, but at the expense of analytical solutions
that our simple two-sector model allows. 12

  See Burtraw, Walls and Blonz (2009) for an analysis of how the choice of allocation of carbon permits to the
electricity sector affects the distribution of costs across income groups and regions.
12
  For example, Rausch et al. (2009) use a CGE model with a detailed structure of the U.S. energy sector to
investigate the distributional impacts of a carbon tax.
