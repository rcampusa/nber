                                              ABSTRACT

U.S. educational and occupational wage differentials were exceptionally high at the dawn of the twentieth
century and then decreased in several stages over the next eight decades. But starting in the early 1980s
the labor market premium to skill rose sharply and by 2005 the college wage premium was back at
its 1915 level. The twentieth century contains two inequality tales: one declining and one rising. We
use a supply-demand-institutions framework to understand the factors that produced these changes
from 1890 to 2005. We find that strong secular growth in the relative demand for more educated workers
combined with fluctuations in the growth of relative skill supplies go far to explain the long-run evolution
of U.S. educational wage differentials. An increase in the rate of growth of the relative supply of skills
associated with the high school movement starting around 1910 played a key role in narrowing educational
wage differentials from 1915 to 1980. The slowdown in the growth of the relative supply of college
workers starting around 1980 was a major reason for the surge in the college wage premium from
1980 to 2005. Institutional factors were important at various junctures, especially during the 1940s
and the late 1970s.

A. Two Tales of the Twentieth Century
    1. The “best poor man’s country”
        Long ago America was deemed the “best poor man’s country.” 1 Land was plentiful in
the early nineteenth century and farming provided ample living standards and fairly uniform
incomes. But during the next hundred years the labor force became more diverse. The
population urbanized and the economy industrialized. Had we good income data for the period
we would surely observe that the income distribution had widened considerably from the early
years of the republic to the turn of the twentieth century. But income data for the full
distribution are not available until 1940. 2 We do, however, have good data on the wealth
distribution that reveals a great widening. 3 By the turn of the twentieth century the distribution
of wealth was extremely unequal.


        Despite the lack of thick income data for the pre-1940 period, we know a considerable
amount about the pecuniary returns to education and the premium that accrued to particular
occupations. In the years from around 1890 to 1910 earnings in occupations that required greater
levels of schooling were far higher than those that required little education, as shown in Chapter
2. In addition, the economic return around 1915 to a year of high school or college was
substantial. The return to education in 1915 greatly exceeded that in 1940 and was sufficiently
high that it greatly exceeded returns in subsequent years. Only recently has the college premium
approximated its value in 1915. That is, the payoff to a year of further study in 1915 was
enormously high. We do not know precisely when in the preceding century the premium to



1
  The phrase “the best poor man’s country” was initially used in the eighteenth century to describe
economic conditions in Pennsylvania but was later used to describe the entire northern part of America.
See Lemon (1972, p. 229, fn. 1) who took the title of his book on the early history of southeastern
Pennsylvania, The Best Poor Man’s Country, from several contemporary comments about the region.
The ideas are similar to those in Tocqueville’s Democracy in America (1981, orig. publ. 1832).
2
  See Piketty and Saez (2003, 2006) for data on the incomes of the top 10 percent (or 1 percent) of the
distribution from the beginning of the U.S. income tax in 1913 to the early 2000s.

  James Bryce, in his two volume work The American Commonwealth, remarked that at the time of de
Tocqueville “[s]ixty years ago there were no great fortunes in America, few large fortunes, no poverty.
Now there is some poverty, many large fortunes, and a greater number of gigantic fortunes than in any
other country of the world” (Bryce 1889, p. 600). Bryce was most certainly correct concerning the
general trend in wealth accumulation but he was clearly wrong that poverty was nonexistent in the 1830s.
On the trend in the wealth distribution from 1776 to the 1920s (1776, 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1920s), see
Wolff (1995) and the compilation of wealth data in Nasar (New York Times, August 16, 1992).


                                                   The Race between Education and Technology 1
schooling increased and whether it was as high even in 1850. But we do know that by 1900 a
year of high school or college was an extremely good investment.


        The large premium to employment in occupations that had substantial educational
requirements around the turn of the twentieth century was observed and commented on by close
contemporaries. The economist Paul Douglas, for one, noted that “during the nineties [1890s],
the clerical class constituted something of a non-competing group.” 4 Douglas’s interest in the
wage distribution was sparked by a period of great wage compression that was apparent by the
early 1920s. The astonishing change that took place in his own time prompted his comment:
“Gradually the former monopolistic advantages are being squeezed out of white-collar work, and
eventually there will be no surplus left.” 5


        According to Douglas several factors were acting in concert to compress wages. One
was the deskilling of clerical workers through the substitution of office machinery for skill.
Another was the reduction in the flow of immigration, which, to Douglas, led to an increase in
the earnings of the less educated. Finally, the supply of educated and trained workers qualified
to assume various white-collar positions greatly increased thus depressing their earnings.
Douglas was correct that there were several factors at work, but the relative increase in the
supply of skilled and educated personnel was of far greater importance than skill reducing factors
on the demand side and also more important than the decrease in immigration, as we shall soon
demonstrate. The possibility that deskilling led to the large decrease in the relative earnings of
the more educated was laid to rest in Chapter 2 when we showed the similarity of wage changes
among clerical occupations. Earnings of white-collar workers in occupations that did not
undergo much technical change were reduced almost as much as those that did undergo
considerable technical change.


        The wage structure began to collapse a short time before 1920 and continued to narrow in
various ways until the early 1950s. The earnings of the more educated were reduced relative to

  Douglas (1926, p. 719). Paul Douglas was born in 1892 and would have been in his mid-twenties just as
the returns to various skills began to be reduced and the wage distribution started to narrow. He was 34
years old when he wrote about the “non-competing” groups that had previously existed.


                                                   The Race between Education and Technology 2
the less educated. Those employed in skilled occupations saw their earnings increase less than
did those in the lower-skilled jobs. For every skilled and professional series we uncovered, the
wage structure narrowed relative to wages for a lesser skilled or lower educated group. The
series we presented included professors of all ranks, engineers, office and clerical workers, and
craft positions in many industries. We also found evidence of a substantial narrowing in the
wage distribution of production workers within each of a large group of manufacturing
industries. The returns to a year of schooling, not surprisingly, also plummeted from 1915 to the
early 1950s. Our estimates of the decrease in the pecuniary returns to a year of education are
robust to the level of schooling and also to the age and sex of the individuals. The returns to
schooling were so high prior to the narrowing that even after the initial decline, the returns to
education remained substantial.


          Our point is that inequality and the pecuniary returns to education were both
exceptionally high around the turn of the twentieth century. But America remained the
destination of choice for the world’s people, and immigration was at record high levels just
before the 1920s when Congressional legislation severely reduced the flow. 6 It was still the
“best poor man’s country,” but the moniker was no longer used because America had a narrow
income distribution. To the contrary, America’s income distribution was probably far wider than
it had ever been. The description was still applicable because America had a considerably higher
average income than did other nations. More important was the fact that the United States was a
society with fairly open educational access and had more equality of opportunity than existed in
Europe. Certain groups, in particular African Americans living in the U.S. South, remained left
out for some time. But even they gained access to improved schooling during the mid-twentieth
century and moved into higher paying jobs in the 1960s.


      2. Integrating the two tales of the twentieth century
          By the early 1970s one could say that America “had it all.” The U.S. economy had
grown at a record pace in the 1960s when labor productivity expanded at 2.75 percent average




6
    On U.S. immigration restriction, see Goldin (1994).


                                                      The Race between Education and Technology 3
annually. 7 The wage structure widened only slightly from the late 1940s and the income
distribution had remained relatively stable. Each generation of Americans achieved a level of
education greater than the preceding one, meaning that the average adult had considerably more
education than its parents. The nation’s economy was strong. Its people were sharing relatively
equally in its prosperity regardless of their position in the income distribution. Racial and
regional differences in educational resources, educational attainment, and economic outcomes
had narrowed substantially since the early twentieth century. 8 Upward mobility with regard to
education characterized American society.


        Had we continued to grow at the rate we did from the end of World War II to the mid-
1970s and had inequality remained at the level it had attained by the early 1950s, this volume
would tell a rather different story. But the American economy did not stay the course.
Inequality soared from the late-1970s to the early 2000s. Productivity, moreover, did not
continue to advance at the rate it once had. It slowed considerably beginning in the mid-1970s
and it remained low for about two decades. Although productivity growth eventually resumed
its previous rate, rising inequality magnified the impact of the sluggish economy on the vast
majority of Americans.


        The full twentieth century contains two inequality tales—one declining and one rising.
These tales can be seen in the almost century-long view of key components of wage inequality in
Figure 1, which shows the college graduate wage premium (relative to those who stopped at high
school) and the high school graduate wage premium (relative to those who left school at eighth
grade) from 1915 to 2005.

  Growth is given by productivity trends using output per hour in the non-farm business sector from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (series PRS85006093 from http://www.bls.gov/lpc/home.htm).

  The black-white schooling completion gap narrowed from 3.84 years for those born in 1885 (25 years
old in 1910) to 1.35 years for those born in 1945 (25 years old in 1970), based on tabulations from the
1940 and 1970 IPUMS. The cross-state standard deviation of mean years of schooling narrowed from
1.60 years for those born in 1885 to 0.62 years for those born in 1945. On the evolution of racial and
regional differences in school resources, see Card and Krueger (1992a, 1992b); on regional income
convergence, see Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991); and on racial income convergence, see Donohue and
Heckman (1991).


                                                    The Race between Education and Technology 4
        The college wage premium shows a sharp decline from 1915 to 1950, jaggedness from
1950 to 1980, and a rapid increase after 1980. At century’s end the premium to college
graduation was about the same as at century’s beginning. The wage premium for high school
graduates shows an equally sharp decrease in the pre-1950 era but less of an increase during the
rest of the century. We will discuss why interest should center on the college premium for most
of the century and the high school premium for only the first half. The premium to education,
therefore, came full circle in the twentieth century and by 2005 had returned to its high water
mark at the beginning of the high school movement in 1915.


        We will now complete the task we began in Chapter 3 and decompose the change in
relative wages by education for the 1915 to 2005 period into its sources. Why did education
returns fall in the first half of the twentieth century but rise at the end of the second half? One
factor that is common to both parts of the century is technological change that increased demand
for skilled and educated workers. But vicissitudes in the rate of growth in the supply of educated
labor, we will soon demonstrate, played a key role in altering inequality trends. The race
between technological change and education resulted in economic expansion and also
determined who received the fruits of growth.


        Several empirical and conceptual problems arise in integrating the inequality facts from
the early part of the twentieth century with those from the latter part. Although we have good
data on income and wages by education since 1940, we know far less about the period before
1940. We have already mentioned our exceptional data for 1915 Iowa on earnings by education
and we use them in the construction of Figure 1. Thus the returns to education, but not the full
distribution of income, can be analyzed in a consistent manner for the entire period from 1915 to
2005. The returns to education and other components of wage inequality do not always move in
lock step, but we do know that in recent decades the lion’s share of rising wage inequality can be
traced to an increase in educational wage differentials. 9 A conceptual issue we will face is that
although we have a reasonably good understanding of what a more-educated worker is today, we


9
  Lemieux (2006a) finds that 60 percent of the increase in overall wage inequality (using the variance of
log wages) from 1973 to 2005 is accounted for by the expansion in educational wage differentials,
especially the rise in the return to post-secondary schooling.


                                                    The Race between Education and Technology 5
must decide on a standard for the more distant past. We will discuss how we surmount these
hurdles and offer a fuller analysis of inequality trends in the twentieth century.


B. The Supply, Demand, and Institutions (SDI) Framework
       The framework we employ to decompose the impact of various factors influencing the
returns to education is an extension of that introduced in Chapter 3. The two most important
forces in the framework concern the change in the relative supply of more-educated workers,
which has mainly occurred through changes in schooling, and the change in the relative demand
for more-educated workers, which has been driven by skill-biased technological change. We
also incorporate institutional factors, such as changes in union strength and the effects of war-
time wage-setting policies. In this sense we combine the usual supply and demand framework
with institutional rigidities and alterations. As we will see, the broader framework is most
important in understanding changes during the 1940s and the late 1970s to the early 1980s. It is
likely, for example, that the wage compression of the 1940s went far beyond what can be
accounted for by market forces alone and was driven, as well, by institutional factors of the
World War II era, such as the greatly expanded role of unions and the residual impact of the
wartime wage setting policies.


       We construct a formal supply-demand framework that will guide the empirical analysis
of the factors that altered the returns to education during the past century. The framework rests
on the central finding in Chapter 3 that skill-biased technical change advanced rapidly
throughout the twentieth century and thus that the relative demand for skill increased at a fairly
steady rate. Our approach will be to determine how much of the evolution in educational wage
differentials we can explain by fluctuations in the growth rate in the supply of skills combined
with smooth trends in relative demand growth. We will then search for institutional factors that
can reconcile patterns in the skill premium that are not well explained by our simple supply-
demand framework.


       We use a labor demand framework where the aggregate production function depends
only on the quantities of skilled and unskilled workers. Skilled (S) workers are defined as those
with some college and the unskilled (U) are those without any college. The aggregate production



                                                  The Race between Education and Technology 6
function is assumed to be CES (constant elasticity of substitution) in skilled and unskilled labor
with an aggregate elasticity of substitution between the two types of labor given by σ SU .
Unskilled labor itself is assumed to be a CES sub-aggregate that depends on the number of high
school graduates (H) and those without a high school diploma (O), also called “dropouts,” with
an elasticity of substitution of σ HO .


          The framework can be summarized by the following two equations:
                                                        1

                        [
          Qt = At λt S tρ + (1 − λt )U tρ           ]   ρ
                                                                                              (1)
                                                1

                    [
          U t = θt H tη + (1 − θt )Otη      ]   η
                                                                                              (2)


where eq. (1) is the aggregate production function and eq. (2) is the sub-aggregate for unskilled
labor. In eq. (1) Q is output, A is total factor productivity, S is units of skilled or college labor,
and U is units of unskilled or non-college labor. In eq. (2) H is units of high school graduate
labor and O is units of high school dropout labor. The parameters λt and θt give the shares of the
different types of labor and will be modeled as technology shift parameters. 10 The CES
parameters ρ and η are related to the elasticities of substitution, such that σ SU =        1
                                                                                           1− ρ   and

σ HO =    1
         1− η   .


          Wages for the three skill groups of workers (S, H, O) are derived using the familiar
condition that a competitive equilibrium occurs when wages equal marginal products. Relative
wages for college to high school workers and for high school graduates to dropouts are given by:
              ⎛ wS          ⎞       ⎛ λ ⎞       1      ⎛S ⎞
          log⎜⎜ t           ⎟⎟ = log⎜ t ⎟ −         log⎜ t ⎟                                  (3)
              ⎝ wU t         ⎠      ⎝ 1 − λt ⎠ σ SU    ⎝ Ut ⎠

and
              ⎛ wH          ⎞       ⎛ θ ⎞       1      ⎛H ⎞
          log⎜⎜ t           ⎟⎟ = log⎜ t ⎟ −         log⎜ t ⎟                                  (4)
              ⎝ wOt          ⎠      ⎝ 1 − θt ⎠ σ HO    ⎝ Ot ⎠

10
  Differential effects of changes in the prices or quantities of other production inputs (e.g., capital and
energy) on the demands for different types of labor are subsumed into λt and θt. The total factor
productivity parameter At implicitly includes technological progress and physical capital accumulation.

Thus, relative wages depend on the demand shifters (λt and θt), the relative supply of the more
and less educated groups, and the relevant elasticity of substitution between the two groups ( σ SU
and σ HO ). The framework is constructed so that changes in the relative supply of college to non-
college labor do not affect the premium to high school graduates relative to high school dropouts.
The restriction does not imply that college supplies are unimportant for the wages of the
unskilled, but it does mean that the supply of the more educated labor equally affects the wages
of the high school graduates and the dropouts. Another key assumption of the framework is that
relative skill supplies are taken as predetermined and thus that, in the short run, labor supply for
each skill group is inelastic.


C. Why the Premium to Skill Changed: 1915 to 2005
    1. College wage premium
        a. Applying the framework
        We apply the framework first to changes in the college wage premium. The facts that
need to be explained and reconciled are easily summarized and are given in Table 1 (see also
Figure 1). The college wage premium (col. 1) collapsed from 1915 to 1950 but subsequently
increased, especially after 1980. By 2005 the college wage premium was about back at its 1915
level. As we noted in describing Figure 1, the returns to college have come full circle.


        Because the premium to education at the end of the century was approximately equal to
its level at the start, our supply-demand framework implies that the relative demand for skill
across the entire century must have grown at about the same rate as the relative supply of skill.
The relative supply of college workers (Table 1, col. 2) grew rapidly for much of the period,
although a slowdown of critical importance is apparent toward the end. For the full period,
growth in relative supply was at a fairly rapid clip—on the order of 2.87 percent per annum.
Even though the race between technology and education over the long run was about even, the
long run hides crucial short run changes. What changed across the past century that caused the
returns to education to decline and then rise?




                                                  The Race between Education and Technology 8
        We will soon see that fluctuations in the supply of college workers, relative to other
workers, together with stable demand growth can explain the shorter-run movements in the
college premium to a substantial degree. We obtain that result when we estimate a version of eq.
(3) across the 1915 to 2005 period using data for all the available years: 1915, 1940, 1950, 1960,
and annually from 1963 to 2005. 11 The dependent variable is the wage premium of those with at
least a college degree (16 or more years of schooling) to those with exactly a high school degree
(12 years of schooling). The relative skill supply measure is the supply of college equivalents
(those with a college degree plus half of those with some college) to high school equivalents
(those with 12 or fewer years of schooling plus half of those with some college). 12 Our
empirical specification includes a linear time trend to allow for secular growth in the relative
demand for college workers and interactions with specific years to allow for changes in the
demand trend. In most of the specifications we add a term to allow the demand trend to change
with 1992, following our earlier findings in Chapter 3 concerning a slowdown in demand growth
beginning in the early 1990s. 13 The results are provided in Table 2 and graphed in Figure 2.


        The most important result from the analysis is that changes in the relative supply of
college workers had a substantial and significant negative impact on the college wage premium
across the entire period. Most of the specifications yield similar coefficients for the relative
supply variable (Table 2, line 1). That for col. (3), our preferred specification, implies that a 10
percent increase in the relative supply of college equivalents reduces the college wage premium
by 6.1 percent and translates into an elasticity of substitution between the skilled and
unskilled, σ SU , of 1.64 (= 1/0.61, see eq. 3). The rapid growth of the supply of college
equivalents from 1915 to 1980 operated to depress the college wage premium despite strong

11
   The wage and skill supply data are actually for the years 1914, 1939, 1949, and 1959 but for simplicity
of presentation we will refer to these dates as 1915, 1940, 1950, and 1960, which are the years of the
censuses (state and federal) from which these data were collected. See Acemoglu (2002) for a related
time series analysis of the college wage premium and the relative supply of college skills using data for
1939 to 1996 (1939, 1949, 1959, and 1963 to 1996).
12
   Our empirical specification and measurement choices follow Katz and Murphy (1992) and Autor, Katz,
and Kearney (2005a). The empirical findings are similar for alternative measures of the skilled-unskilled
wage premium, such as a fixed-weighted average of wages of all workers with some college or more to
all workers with no college. The basic results are also robust to the use of different relative supply
measures (such as workers with any college versus those with no college) and to adding controls for
cyclical factors (such as the unemployment rate).

secular growth in the relative demand for college equivalents. The sharp slowdown in the
growth in the supply of college workers since 1980 has been a driving force in the rise in the
college wage premium.


          Overall, simple supply and demand specifications do a remarkable job explaining the
long-run evolution of the college wage premium. The predictions from specifications (2) and
(3), graphed in Figure 2 alongside the actual values for the college wage premium, show that
most of the shorter-run fluctuations can be tracked as well. But two short-run fluctuations are
more complicated. One is the 1940s and the other is the late 1970s.


          The specifications in cols. (1), (2), and (3) present different methods to account for the
1940s within our general framework. The col. (1) specification allows trend demand to differ
between the first and second halves of the twentieth century by including an interaction with
1949. The trend estimates show slow demand growth for college workers in the first half of the
twentieth century, a sharp acceleration after 1949, and a somewhat slower change after 1992.
The model over-predicts the decline in the college wage premium from 1915 to 1940 and under-
predicts the sharper decline in the 1940s. The specification in col. (2) allows the demand trend
shift to occur after 1959, rather than 1949. Figure 2 shows that this specification does a fine job
fitting the 1915 to 1940 decline but not the sharp decline in the college premium of the 1940s
and the strong rebound of the 1950s.


          Institutional and cyclical factors are, most likely, responsible for the difficulty in
predicting the short-run changes for the 1940s and 1950s. The residual effects from the wage
policies of World War II, industrial union strength that increased the bargaining power of the
lower-educated, the strong demand for production workers during the war, and the post-war
boom in consumer durables acted to reduce the relative wages of college workers below their
long-run market equilibrium values of 1950. 14


          The decrease in the college wage premium of the 1940s, it appears, overshot changes in
the fundamentals and the increase of the 1950s, in consequence, brought the system back into

14
     See Goldin and Margo (1992) for a detailed analysis of these factors in the 1940s wage compression.


                                                      The Race between Education and Technology 10
sync. We explore that possibility by including a dummy variable for 1949 to allow temporary
institutional factors to impact wage setting in the 1940s (Table 2, col. 3). The estimation implies
that institutional factors, or temporary demand factors, lowered the college wage premium by 14
log points in 1949. As shown in Figure 2, the col. (3) predictions fit the data extremely well and
that is our preferred specification. The flexible time trend given by the col. (4) specification
demonstrates the robustness of the coefficient on relative labor supply across the entire period.


       Another briefer period that is not captured well by the specifications in Table 2 is the
decline in the college wage premium in the mid to late 1970s. The period was complicated by
the post-1973 productivity slowdown and severe oil price and inflation shocks. Many unions,
such as in steel and automobiles, whose members were disproportionately in the non-college
group, had wage contracts that were fully indexed to inflation and geared to provide real wage
increases that tracked expected national productivity growth. Because union settlements in the
late 1970s had not yet adjusted to slower productivity growth, they produced a relative increase
in the wages of the non-college workers. But the deep recession of the early 1980s and changes
in employer attitudes towards unions, particularly following Reagan’s stand-off with air traffic
controllers, led to concession bargaining in the early 1980s and set the stage for the spectacular
rebound of the college wage premium.


       Thus various institutional factors may have led to a larger decline of the college wage
premium in the 1970s than warranted by the supply and demand fundamentals and, in
consequence, to a catch-up increase in the early 1980s. The continued decline of unions and the
erosion of the real value of the federal minimum wage in the 1980s may have increased the
college wage premium by more than was justified by market factors alone. 15


       Demand growth for college workers appears to have slowed in the1990s, as indicated by
the negative coefficient on the trend interacted with 1992. Given the rapid spread of information
technology and work-place reorganization in the 1990s and beyond, this finding would appear to
be at odds with the skill-biased technological change explanation. But a resolution exists. As


15

institutions in the growth of wage inequality in the 1980s see DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996).


                                                  The Race between Education and Technology 11
the college educated group became a larger share of the labor force, it also became more
heterogeneous. Demand for those who graduated from more selective institutions as well as
those with post-B.A. degrees is still soaring and they are doing spectacularly well. But demand
for the remaining group is less strong and they are not doing as well. 16


        b. Computing supply and demand shifts
        To understand more about the race between technological change and education we use
the estimated coefficients on college relative supply to compute changes in relative demand
across the entire period and for various sub-periods. The estimates are given in the last three
columns of Table 1 for three values of σ SU : 1.4 (a consensus estimate from the past literature that
we used in Chapter 3); 1.64 (our preferred estimate from col. 3 of Table 2); and 1.84 (implied by
col. 1 of Table 2). The results are fairly robust to the choice of parameter values.


        Across the entire period supply and demand forces kept pace with each other, as we noted
before. Neither education nor technology won the race. The same was true for the 1960 to 1980
sub-period. 17 But for other sub-periods it was not. Across the earliest periods listed, 1915 to
1940 and 1940 to 1960, supply ran ahead of demand by about 1 percent average annually. 18 For
the most recent period, 1980 to 2005, demand outstripped supply. Most important is that for
both the earlier and later sub-periods changes in educational supply are the tail wagging the
wage-premium dog.


16
   Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006) discuss the “polarization” of the U.S. labor market since 1990, by
which they mean that the two end of the distribution are doing better than the middle. The top is doing
well, the middle is doing poorly, and the bottom is doing fairly well. Their explanation is that demand is
soaring for those who have both technical and “people” skills and is strong, as well, for those who have
lower-skilled jobs in the service sector. Computers substitute for routine manual and cognitive tasks, thus
reducing demand for many college workers. But new information technologies complement the non-
routine analytic and interactive tasks of those with post-college training and have relatively little impact
on non-routine manual tasks of many lower-skilled service sector jobs. The growth of international
outsourcing (also known as off-shoring) appears to have had similar impacts on labor demand. See also
Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) and Levy and Murnane (2004).
17
   The 1970s contain similarities to the 1940s, as we noted in the text, in the overshooting of the reduction
in the college wage premium due to institutional factors. Thus the 1950s and the 1980s contain similar
increases in the college wage premium to offset the change.
18
   We use the entire 1940 to 1960 period rather than the two sub-decades for the reasons provided in the
text. The college wage premium in the 1940s, in would appear, decreased more than justified by
fundamentals and the increase in the 1950s brought it back to its equilibrium value.


                                                     The Race between Education and Technology 12
        The slowdown in the growth of educational attainment since 1980 is the most important
factor in the rising college wage premium of the post-1980 period. Had the relative supply of
college workers from 1980 to 2005 expanded at the rate it did from 1960 to 1980 (3.77 percent
per annum rather than 2 percent per annum), the relative wage of college workers would have
fallen rather than have increased, as it did at 0.9 percent per annum.


        To be sure, relative demand growth for college workers was more rapid in the second half
of the twentieth century, particularly in the 1980s, than the first half. But demand growth has not
been particularly rapid since 1990. 19 Technology has been racing ahead of education in recent
decades but the primary reason is that educational growth has been sluggish. We summarized
the point in Chapter 3 with the quip “it’s not technology – stupid.” We will soon demonstrate
that the inequality culprit is also “not immigration.”


        College workers were not the only well-educated group of the first-half of the twentieth
century and were not the most important quantitatively. We now turn to an understanding of
movements in the high school wage premium. A high school diploma was the mark of a well-
educated individual in the early part of the twentieth century just as a college diploma has been
from the mid-point onward.


     2. High school wage premium
        a. Applying the framework
        To understand changes in the high school wage premium we assume, as we did in the
formal statement of the framework, that those without any college can be grouped together and
are a composite of high school graduates and those who did not graduate from high school
(called “dropouts”). We compare those with exactly 12 years of schooling to those with fewer
than 12 years.




19
  The rapid implied growth of the relative demand for college workers from 1980 to 1990 in Table 1 may
have been produced by actual demand acceleration from the computer revolution as well as an
overshooting from institutional factors (declines in both union strength and the real minimum wage).


                                                  The Race between Education and Technology 13
        The high school wage premium changed in a manner similar to that of the college
premium in the first half of the period (Figure 1 and Table 3). 20 The high school wage premium
collapsed from 1915 to 1950, as did the college wage premium. But the high school wage
premium then remained quite flat from 1950 to 1980 whereas the college wage premium evolved
with more jaggedness. The big difference in the two series begins after 1980. The increase for
the high school wage premium is anemic in comparison with that for the college wage premium.
Rather than coming full circle, as was the case for the college wage premium, the high school
wage premium was far lower at the end of the twentieth century than in 1915.


        The primary reason for the collapse of the high school wage premium in the 1915 to 1950
period, we will show, was the enormous growth in the relative supply of high school graduates
ever since the high school movement was set in motion. Compared with dropouts, the supply of
high school graduates increased at 4.25 percent average annually for the full period from 1915 to
2005 and at 5.54 percent average annually during the high school movement years, 1915 to 1940
(see Table 3). The only years of marked slowness in the relative supply of high school graduates
are those in the most recent period, 1990 to 2005.


        High school graduates and dropouts are today considered close substitutes in the labor
market. But during much of the twentieth century they were not. High school graduates were
distinctly more skilled and many positions were reserved for them. Thus the vast increase in
high school graduation throughout much of the twentieth century served to reduce the high
school wage premium by increasing the relative supply of high school graduates to dropouts.


        To obtain estimates of the elasticity of substitution between high school graduates and
dropouts ( σ HO ) and to explore the role of institutional factors, we perform a time-series analysis

20
  We focus on the evolution of the wage differential between those with exactly a high school degree (12
years of schooling) and those with 8 years of schooling. Those margins are the most relevant ones for
measuring the full returns to high school in the first-half of the century since the majority of workers had
8 or fewer years of schooling in 1915. In contrast, almost no U.S. born workers today have less than 9
years of schooling (under 1 percent in 2005) and the more meaningful margin is the earnings gap between
those with a high school degree and high school dropouts (those with 9 to 11 years of schooling).
Empirically, the distinction does not matter much for the time series path of the high school wage
premium or for our analytic conclusions. These two measures of the high school wage premium are
compared in Appendix Table A8.1.


                                                     The Race between Education and Technology 14
of the high school wage premium similar to that for the college wage premium and estimate a
version of eq. (4). The setup for the high school wage premium is similar to that for the college
premium, and the details of the regressions are given in Table 4. In the case of college
equivalents versus other workers, the elasticity of substitution ( σ SU ) was extremely stable
throughout the period. But, in the case of high school graduates versus dropouts, the elasticity of
substitution ( σ HO ) shifted substantially around 1950. The shift can be seen by adding an
interaction between the relative supply term and a dummy variable for the post-1949 period
(Table 4, col. 4). In the absence of the interaction the elasticity of substitution is substantial in
magnitude (around 5) for the entire period. But the interaction shows that the elasticity of
substitution is high only in the post-1949 period and is low (around 2) in the previous years. The
large and significant coefficient on the interaction should be contrasted with that for the college
wage premium for which there is virtually no impact of adding a similar term (Table 2, col. 5).


        The point we are making is that before around 1950 the elasticity of substitution between
high school graduates and dropouts was low (around 2), but after 1950 it was high (about 5).
High school graduates and dropouts are close substitutes today but were less substitutable prior
to the 1950s. Changes in relative supply of high school graduates to dropouts today will have
smaller effects on the high school wage premium than in the past.


        These findings accord well with the discussion in previous chapters about the reasons for
the high school movement. Earlier in the century firms sought high school graduates as office
workers and also as blue-collar production workers in many of the high-tech industries of the
day. Those hiring employees described certain jobs as requiring a high school diploma or
particular high school courses and they viewed high school graduates as vastly superior to those
without secondary school training. But today’s high school graduates and dropouts are perceived
as far closer substitutes. In fact, the specifications in Table 4 that do not allow for a break in the
elasticity of substitution in 1949 (cols. 1, 2, and 3) give the implausible result that there was
essentially no trend increase in the demand for high school graduates relative to dropouts during
the pre-1950 period. The historical facts and our estimates speak to a change in the distinction
between a worker with a high school degree and one who is a high school dropout.




                                                   The Race between Education and Technology 15
       As in the case of the college premium, there is an appearance of some overshooting of the
high school premium in the 1940s and a catch-up in the 1950s. But institutional factors appear
far less important in the case of the lower-educated group than they were for the college wage
premium. The 1949 year dummy, for example, is insignificant in the high school wage premium
regression (Table 4, col. 3).


       b. Computing supply and demand shifts
       We use three values of the elasticity of substitution (2, 3, and 5) that span our estimates to
compute demand shifts and to calculate the relative impact of supply and demand in changing
the high school wage premium (see Table 3). As opposed to the case of the college wage
premium, our preferred estimate of the elasticity of substitution varies over time. We prefer an
elasticity of substitution of 2 for the pre-1950s and 5 for the post-1950s.


       The central finding is that the decrease in the high school wage premium from 1915 to
1940 was due mainly to the rapid growth in relative supply. By the calculations in Table 3,
relative supply increased by 5.54 percent average annually. Although relative demand also
increased greatly, it grew at a slower pace. The decrease in the wage premium from 1940 to
1950 was even larger than that from 1915 to 1940. But the overshooting of the wage premium in
the 1940s suggests using the full 1940 to 1960 period. Once again, relative supply increased at a
rate exceeding relative demand, but the precise difference will depend on whether one uses the
larger value for the elasticity or the smaller one.


       Also of importance is the moderate increase in the high school wage premium from 1980
to 2005. A major reason for the increase is a slowdown in the relative supply of high school
graduates. Although relative demand growth also moderated, supply growth slowed
considerably more.


       We have, thus far, emphasized changes in the educational attainment of successive
cohorts of the U.S. born in affecting the relative supplies of skilled labor. But the foreign born
may have been an important contributing force. For the 1980 to 2005 period, for example,
immigration may have greatly increased the supply of those without a high school diploma, thus



                                                      The Race between Education and Technology 16
reducing the relative supply of high school graduate labor. Similarly, immigration may have
reduced the relative supply of college workers, thus serving to increase the premium to
education. Earlier in the twentieth century legislative restrictions greatly reduced immigration
flows and potentially served to increase the relative supply of more educated workers. In all
cases, immigration forces could have acted in concert with education forces to change the
premium to skill. We turn now to a direct estimate of the influence of immigration on skill
supplies and their changes during the 1915 to 2005 period.


      3. Role of immigration
          a. Immigration and the labor force
          In the early years of the twentieth century immigrants were an enormous source of labor
force growth. By 1915 the foreign born share of the U.S. labor force (18 to 65 years old)
exceeded 21 percent. 21 After the immigration restrictions of the 1920s, immigrants declined as a
fraction of the labor force and their share reached a twentieth century low of 5.4 percent in 1970.
More recently, and especially after legislation in 1965 ended national-origins quotas,
immigration surged again and the foreign born share of employment rose to 15 percent in 2005.
The national-origin composition of immigration has shifted in recent decades and the share of
immigrants coming from Latin America, especially Mexico, and Asia has increased. In our
exploration of the impact of immigration on the skill premium we will concentrate on the earlier
and the later decades in our period when the contribution of immigration to labor force growth
was large.


          Because immigrants have generally come from the lower part of the education
distribution relative to U.S. natives, large changes in immigration flows during the twentieth
century altered relative skill supplies and thus potentially impacted the premium to education. In
our first sub-period, 1915 to 1940, the slowdown in immigration would have served to increase
relative skill supplies. Had immigration continued at its previous rate, there would have been a
larger supply of those with less education since the United States was undergoing its high school
movement and Europe, the largest sending region at the time, had not yet had one. Immigration
today, it is often claimed, is flooding America with workers who compete for jobs at the bottom

21
     The 21 percent figure is an average from the 1910 and 1920 U.S. population censuses.


                                                     The Race between Education and Technology 17
of the education and skill ladder. In the more recent of the sub-periods, 1980 to 2005,
immigration is presumed to decrease relative skill supplies.


       The question we ask is how much of the change in skill supplies that we detailed in the
previous sections came from changes in immigration and how much was due to changes in the
education of the native-born population. The presumption of many observers of both the earlier
and the later periods has been that immigration greatly impacted the premium to skill. We
directly confront the effect of immigrants on relative skill supplies and on the premium to skill.


       Our answer will be that immigration had a far smaller effect on relative skill supplies in
all periods we examine than is generally presumed and thus it had a smaller impact on changes in
the premium to education than is often asserted. Changes in the recent period, 1980 to 2005, are
larger than during earlier periods particularly for the supply of those without a high school
diploma. But even for the recent period, our estimates are that immigration can explain only 10
percent (about 2.4 log points) of the total increase in the college to high school wage premium
(23 log points).


       The reason for the relatively small impact of immigration in the post-1980s is that
immigrants have been bimodal with regard to their educational attainment. Large numbers have
arrived at the very bottom of the education distribution and large numbers have arrived with
college degrees. In 2005 17 percent of the foreign born population had fewer than nine years of
education whereas less than 1 percent of native-born Americans did. At the other end of the
spectrum immigrants in 2005 were more likely to have an advanced (post-college) degree and
had about the same likelihood of having at least a four-year college degree as did native-born
Americans. 22


       Early in the twentieth century, according to Table 5 col. (1a), immigrants expanded the
labor supply of dropouts by 22 percent as compared with 20 percent for high school equivalents
and 11 percent for college equivalents. These 1915 data come from our Iowa sample and would


22
  These estimates are based on tabulations from the 2005 CPS MORG sample for those aged 18 to 65
years in the civilian work force.


                                                 The Race between Education and Technology 18
be somewhat larger for the entire United States. But the differential impact of immigration on
labor supply across skill groups was likely to have been quite similar for Iowa and for the United
States. 23 In 1940, after immigration restrictions were in place for nearly two decades, the
fractions in each education group had declined substantially.


        For much of the post-World War II period, the foreign born remained a small fraction of
the workforce and were fairly balanced relative to the native-born with regard to education. The
foreign born, in other words, increased the less-educated group about as much as they increased
the more-educated group and they did not have a large impact on any of the groups. For the
most recent years, however, immigrants have had a much larger impact on skill supplies. In
1990 they increased the number of dropouts by 29 percent, but they increased the number of high
school graduates by just 7.5 percent. In 2005 they increased the number of dropouts by an
astounding 76 percent and increased the supply of high school graduates by almost 15 percent.
The increase in the immigrant share for high school and college equivalents are substantial, but
the two have tended to be fairly balanced.


        b. Immigration and the skill gap
        The contribution of immigrants to the skill gap is summarized in Table 5 by a construct
called the “log gap.” 24 The “log gap” gives the fraction of the log difference between the
supplies of the unskilled and skilled group (e.g., high school dropouts to high school graduates)
accounted for by the presence of immigrants. 25 The fraction is 14.4 percent in 1915, decreases to
1970 when it was 2.9 percent, and then increases for the remainder of the period. In 2005
immigrants expanded the dropout to high school graduate ratio by 43 percent (log points). On
the other hand, the immigrant contribution to the ratio of high school to college equivalents is
modest in all years and is greatest for 1915. Given the contribution of immigration to the level



23
   The immigrant employment share in 1915 Iowa was 15.6 percent (Table 5) but around 21 percent for
the entire United States. Information on educational attainment in the U.S. population census does not
exist until 1940. The data on educational attainment in 1940 of older immigrant birth cohorts (those who
arrived by 1915) and the U.S. born in the same cohorts confirms that the contribution of immigration to
skill supply gaps for the United States in 1915 is well-approximated by our direct estimates for Iowa.
24
   The “log gap” term is borrowed from Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1997).
25
   The derivation of the “log gap” is provided in the notes to Table 5.


                                                   The Race between Education and Technology 19
of the skill supply gap it would appear that immigration would have been particularly important
at the lower end during the early and late sub-periods.


          We previously saw that there was a large slowdown in the growth of the relative supply
of the college educated in the post-1980s and that slowdown accounted for much of the increase
in the college wage premium. But how much of the slowdown in skill supplies was due to the
increase in immigration? The answer is that not much was due to immigration and the details are
contained in Table 6. Just 14 percent of the supply slowdown was due to the increase in the
foreign born. The 14 percent figure is derived as follows. The relative supply of the college
educated expanded at 3.89 percent per year from 1960 to 1980 but at just 2.27 from 1980 to
2005, for a decrease of 1.62 percent per year. Of that decrease, 1.40 percent (= 3.83 – 2.43) or
86 percent of the total (= 1.4/1.62) was due to the slowdown in the relative supply of the college
educated among native-born Americans, and so 14 percent was due to immigration.


          The picture for the less educated is a bit different since, as we just saw, immigrants
comprised a very large fraction of all dropouts in 2005 but far less before 1980. Immigrants
relative to the native born are disproportionately in the lower tail of the education distribution.
But even in the case of the less educated, the impact of immigration on relative skill supply was
of less quantitative significance than was the slowdown in high school graduation among the
native-born population. 26 The relative supply of high school graduates increased by a whopping
5.61 percent per year from 1960 to 1980 but then at a sluggish 2.49 percent per year from 1980
to 2005, for a decrease of 3.12 percent per year. Of that rather large decline, 1.79 percent (= 5.74
– 3.95) or 57 percent of the total (= 1.79/3.12) was due to the slowdown in the relative supply of
U.S. high school graduates. The increase in the foreign born concentrated in the low-end of the
education distribution contributed the remaining 43 percent of the change.


          Our point is that immigration had but a minor impact on the growth in the relative supply
of the college educated and a moderate effect on the supply of high school graduate workers
relative to dropouts for the 1980 to 2005 period. Consequently immigration played only a
modest role in the surge in the skill premium during those years. Immigration decreased the

26
     The slowdown in the U.S. high school graduation rate will be discussed in Chapter 9.


                                                      The Race between Education and Technology 20
relative supply of college equivalents by 3.9 log points from 1980 to 2005 (col. 3b of Table 5).
Using our preferred estimate of σ SU (1.64), the change in relative supply implies an increase in
the college wage premium of 2.4 log points or only about 10 percent of the overall increase, a
statement we made earlier.


        In contrast to the impact of immigration, the slowdown in the growth rate of the relative
supply of college-equivalents among the native born was of monumental importance in
increasing the college wage premium after 1980. The slowdown of 1.4 percent (log points) per
year from the 1960-80 to the 1980-2005 periods decreased the overall relative supply of college
equivalents by 34.9 log points and led to a 21.3 log point increase in the college wage premium.
Thus, the slowdown in the growth of relative college supply from the native-born was nine times
more important than was new immigration in the rise of the college wage premium from 1980 to
2005. An analogous calculation implies that the slowdown in the relative supply of high school
graduates to dropouts among U.S. natives had a larger impact than the surge in low-skilled
immigration in contributing to the widening of the high school wage premium since 1980. 27


        We turn now to the early part of the twentieth century when immigrants were a large
fraction of the U.S. labor force and were far less educated than native-born Americans. Even
though the sharp reduction in immigration starting in the 1910s increased the relative supply of
educated workers, the increased schooling of the native-born was by far the stronger factor in the
rapid relative growth of skill supplies and thus the decrease in the skill premium.


        The reason for the greater impact of educational advance of the U.S. born than
immigration in the 1915 to 1940 period is contained in Table 6. Of the 4.8 percent annual
growth in the relative supply of high school graduates to dropouts from 1915 to 1940, 4.41
percent per year was from the increased educational attainment of the native-born and just 0.39
percent per year was from the decline in immigration. Therefore, the curtailment of immigration

27
  Our implicit assumption that immigrants and the native-born are perfect substitutes within education
groups may slightly overstate the impact of immigration on the wages of the U.S. born. Estimates of the
wage impacts of immigration also tend to be smaller in local labor market analyses than in our approach
of looking at skill supplies at the national level. See Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1997), Borjas (2003),
Card (2005), and Ottaviano and Peri (2006) on alternative approaches and estimates of the impacts of
immigration on recent U.S. labor market outcomes.


                                                    The Race between Education and Technology 21
accounted for less than 10 percent of the expansion of the relative supply of high school
graduates during this period. Similarly less than 9 percent of the increase in the ratio of college
to high school equivalents from 1915 to 1940 was due to immigration restrictions.


D. Non-competing Groups: 1890 to 1930
   1. The premium to skill and the relative supply of educated workers
       The previous sections analyzed the impact of education, immigration, demand, and
institutional factors in altering the returns to skill over the long-run from 1915 to 2005. We
selected 1915 as the starting date because we were able to compute reasonably comparable
estimates of relative skill supplies and skill returns over that long period. In this section we use a
somewhat different measure of skill returns to consider an earlier moment in history. The
moment includes the period from 1890 to around 1915, which Paul Douglas termed the era of
non-competing groups, as well as the period from around 1915 to 1930 when non-competing
groups began to fade.


       The measure of skill returns that we will use is one that we introduced in Chapter 2—the
ratio of the wage in an occupation that required some secondary school or higher to the wage in
an occupation that did not. We can more finely track the movement of occupational wage ratios
prior to 1930 than the returns to education. We showed in Chapter 2 that the premium to various
types of office and professional work declined starting around 1914 to the early 1920s. Although
the ratio for some of the series increased a bit at the end of the 1920s, the wage premium for
white collar work never returned to the levels that existed before 1914. We ask what factors
were responsible for the high levels of the premium to skill and education in the period of non-
competing groups and for the sharp and persistent decrease after 1914.


       To understand what caused the skill premium to decrease, we must provide estimates of
the change in wage ratios by skill and also in the supplies of educated workers. We divide the
entire period from 1890 to 1930 into two sub-periods of equal length: 1890 to 1910 and 1910 to
1930. Rather than using just one of the wage series from Chapter 2, we aggregate various series




                                                  The Race between Education and Technology 22
using employment weights. 28 The wage premium for white-collar work computed in this fashion
was fairly steady during the first two-decade period, from 1890 to 1910, but decreased by 25.7
log points (or about 23 percent) during the second two-decade period. That is, from 1910 to
1930 the wage premium fell by 1.28 percent per year on average.


        Several methods exist to construct the stock of high school graduates prior to 1940. Our
preferred approach is to use the administrative data from Chapter 6 on the annual flow of new
high school graduates at the national level. In constructing the stocks of high school graduates in
each year from 1890 to 1930 using the administrative data, we make a starting assumption that
the high school graduate share of the work force was 4 percent in 1890. We then add the flows
of new high school graduates each year to the existing stock. Based on tabulations from the
1915 Iowa State Census and the 1940 IPUMS for the relevant cohorts, we assume that the labor
force participation rate for male high school graduates was the same as the overall male labor
force participation rate and that it was 40 percent higher for female high school graduates than
for females without a high school degree. We then compare these figures to the overall adult
labor force data from the U.S. population census. 29


        The implied estimates from administrative data of the high school graduate share of the
U.S. labor force are displayed in col. (1) of Table 7. The stock of high school graduates in the
United States increased very slowly to 1910, when they were 5.4 percent of the U.S. labor force.
But after 1910 the stock increased at a much faster clip. None of these changes should be
surprising given the advances of the high school movement during the post-1910 period. From
1890 to 1910 the change in the relative supply of high school graduates to those with less than a
high school degree in the labor force was 31.5 log points and from 1910 to 1930 it was 89.9 log
points, almost three times as large. These data translate into a 1.57 percent per year average
annual increase in the relative supply of high school graduates during the first period and 4.49
percent per year increase during the second. An alternative approach to estimating the high

28
   We use the following four groups to measure the white collar wage premium with the 1910-30 change
in the log wage premium and the weight for each group given in parentheses: male clerks (-0.379, 0.3),
female clerks (-0.229, 0.2), associate professors (-0.247, 0.25), and starting engineers (-0.143, 0.25). The
rationale for the weights is that white-collar work was about 50 percent clerical at the time and males
were about 60 percent of clerical workers. See Goldin and Katz (1995, tables 1 and 10).
29
   See Goldin and Katz (1995, table 8) for further details on the methodology.


                                                     The Race between Education and Technology 23
school graduate share of the labor force from 1890 to 1930 is to use data on educational
attainment by birth cohort from the 1915 Iowa State Census and the 1940 U.S. population
census. The estimates from this approach are shown in col. (2) of Table 7.


        The census-based and administrative-based estimates imply similar growth rates in the
relative supply of high school graduates from 1910 to 1930, but the census-based estimates of
relative supply growth are considerably faster for 1890 to 1910. Both approaches imply a sharp
acceleration in the growth of the relative supply of high school graduates after 1910. Because
high school graduation rates probably advanced faster in Iowa than in the rest of the United
States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we place more confidence in the
administrative-based than the census-based estimates for the period prior to 1910. 30


     2. Explaining the skill premium decline: education, immigration, and demand
        Douglas had suggested several possible factors that could account for the decrease in the
skill premium: a relative increase in educated workers; a decrease in immigration (thus fewer
less-educated workers); and a decrease in the relative demand for skill due to the “deskilling” of
various office positions. We assess each of these explanations using our aggregate measure of
the change in the skill premium, changes in the stock of educated workers including immigrants,
and our estimate of the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers, σ SU
(which implies that the wage elasticity of demand for skill = − 1 σ SU ). 31


        Because there was no change in the premium to skill from 1890 to 1910, relative supply
and demand must have been changing at the same rate. The relative supply of high school
graduates increased by 31.5 log points during those decades (using the administrative data
estimates in col. 1 of Table 7) and thus demand must have increased by the same rate. But
during the next period, from 1910 to 1930, the premium to skill decreased by 25.7 log points.
Given our preferred estimate of σ SU = 1.64, the acceleration in relative supply growth of 58.4

30
   The census-based estimates of the high school graduate share in col. (2) of Table 7 are much higher
than the administrative-based estimates in every year from 1890 to 1930. See Goldin (1998) on the
overstatement of high school graduation rates of older cohorts in the 1940 census.
31
   Recall that the inverse of the elasticity of substitution, − 1 σ SU , is ∂ log( wS wU ) ∂ log( S U ) , the
slope of the relative demand curve.


                                                        The Race between Education and Technology 24
log points can explain a 35.6 log point decline in the white collar wage premium from 1910 to
1930. 32 These estimates imply that the increased rate of growth in the relative supply of high
school graduates after 1910 more than fully explains the decline in the white-collar wage
premium from 1910 to 1930. In fact, our estimates imply that the relative demand for high
school graduates actually accelerated after 1910 growing by 16.3 log points (or 0.82 percent per
year) more rapidly from 1910 to 1930 than from 1890 to 1910. 33


        Immigration was almost 22 percent of the U.S. workforce during the 1890 to 1910
period. With the passage of immigration restrictions in the 1920s, and the substantial cessation
of international labor mobility during World War I, the foreign born became a smaller fraction of
the labor force. By 1930 they were about 16 percent of the labor force. The decrease in
immigration would have served to increase the fraction of the labor force with high school
education since immigrants were less well-educated than the native-born workforce. But what
was the actual impact?


        The actual impact of the large change in immigration was much smaller than one might
have imagined. We simulate the impact of immigration on the supply of high school graduates
from 1910 to 1930 by asking what would have happened if the immigration share remained
constant at 22 percent from 1910 to 1930 rather than declining to 16 percent. We use data from
our 1915 Iowa sample showing that immigrants had, on average, one-third the high school
graduation rate of the U.S. born. We find that the high school graduation expansion of the
native-born was more than ten times larger than immigration in the growth of the high school
graduate share of the workforce from 1910 to 1930. The immigrant decline explains only a 0.5
percentage point increase in the growth of the high school graduate share of the workforce from
1910 to 1930 using our administrative data as compared with a 5.9 percentage point increase
from the rising educational attainment of the U.S. born. 34


32
   The calculation assumes that demand continues to increase at its previous rate (31.5 log points) but that
relative supply shifts out by 58.4 log points. Relative wages, therefore, would have to fall by 35.6 log
points (= 58.4 × –0.61, the relative wage elasticity).
33
   If relative wages decreased by 25.7 log points rather than by 35.6 points, then demand had to accelerate
by the difference divided by the relative wage elasticity, which is approximately 16.3 log points.
34
   Using our census-based estimates of the labor force share of high school graduates (from col. 2 of Table
7), we find that immigration accounts for a 0.9 percentage point increase in the high school graduate share


                                                     The Race between Education and Technology 25
        The increase in the education of native-born workers from 1910 to 1930 was so great that
even had immigration remained at its 1910 level during those two decades, the relative supply of
educated workers would have increased by 85.2 log points as compared with its actual increase
of 89.9 log points from 1910 to 1930. Thus, schooling gains among the U.S. born were more
than eleven times larger than immigration in the faster skill supply growth after 1910 and
consequently for the collapse in the white collar wage premium from 1910 to 1930. 35


E. Recapitulation: Who Won the Race?
        Technological change is the engine of economic growth. Yet, it also has a potentially
dark side. We do not mean pollution, crowding, and other disamenities. Rather we mean that
technological change creates winners and losers and can sometimes have adverse distributional
consequences that may foment social tension. Such distributional problems are more likely
when technological change is skill biased, that is when new technologies increase the relative
demand for more skilled and more advantaged workers.


        A nation’s economy will grow more as technology advances, but the earnings of some
may advance considerably more than the earnings of others. If workers have flexible skills and
if the educational infrastructure expands sufficiently, then the supply of skills will increase as
demand increases for them. Growth and the premium to skill will be balanced and the race
between technology and education will not be won by either side and prosperity will be widely
shared. External factors can also alter the demand and the supply of skills. The immigration of
workers who are disproportionately at the bottom of the skill distribution could greatly impact
the earnings of those who are their closest substitutes. Globalization factors affecting
international trade patterns and off-shoring opportunities can also alter skill demands.




of the labor force from 1910 to 1930 as compared with a 10.1 percentage point contribution from the U.S.
born.
35
   More precisely, the growth in the relative supply of high school graduates increased by 58.4 log points
from 31.5 log points for 1890-1910 to 89.9 log points for 1910-30. The rising high school graduation rate
of the U.S. born accounts for 53.7 log points of this acceleration and declining immigration explains the
remaining 4.7 log points.


                                                    The Race between Education and Technology 26
       In this chapter, we have summarized the estimates we presented in Chapter 2 on the
returns to skill and education. The premium to skill first decreased from its very high level in the
late nineteenth century. By the 1960s America was growing rapidly and the fruits of economic
growth were being shared fairly equally across the income scale. But the story quickly and
abruptly changed in the late 1970s and early 1980s when rapidly rising inequality took hold and
productivity growth was sluggish at best. The twentieth century, then, contains two inequality
stories. What can explain why that has been the case?


       In search of an explanation, we have used our estimates of relative skill supplies provided
in Chapter 1 to uncover why the relative premium to skill changed. We did so by estimating the
elasticity of substitution between various groups of workers by skill or education. We then used
these estimates to compute the degree to which relative labor demand and supply shifted.


       The supply and demand framework we employed does an extremely good job in
explaining changes in the premium to skill. There are times in the analysis when we have
appealed to institutional changes and rigidities. But, by and large, the framework allows us to
tell a consistent and coherent story to reconcile the two inequality tales of the twentieth century.
We will summarize the major findings of that analysis and begin with the college wage premium.


       Over the very long run, from 1915 to 2005, the college wage premium has remained the
same. Thus, over the very long run supplies and demands for relative skill were balanced. But
that does not help us understand the two tales. Only a detailed analysis of the sub-periods will.
From 1915 to 1980 education raced far ahead of technology and that served to reduce skill
premiums and to lessen the economic power of Douglas’s non-competing groups. From 1915 to
1940 supply outstripped demand by 1.41 times (3.19 versus 2.27); from 1940 to 1960 it did so by
1.47 times (2.63 versus 1.79). In both periods supply increased by about 1 percent per year more
than demand. In Section II we discussed the many reasons for the surge in education including
the high school movement in the pre-1940 era and the increase in college going in the post-
World War II period.




                                                  The Race between Education and Technology 27
       But a big reversal occurred around 1980. Had the relative supply of college workers
increased from 1980 to 2005 at the same rate that it had from 1960 to 1980, the college premium,
rather than rising, would have fallen. The race had been lost to technology.


       Similarly for the high school graduate premium, we found that from 1915 to 1940 supply
raced ahead of demand, again by about 1 percent per year (5.54 versus 4.79 with σ HO = 2) and
considerably more from 1940 to 1960 (3.55 versus 1.79 with σ HO = 3). The rapid increase in high
school graduates caused the high school graduate premium to plummet in the pre-1950 period.


       We questioned whether some of the supply changes we measured were really due to
changes in immigration rather than to education. The issue is most important for the earliest of
the periods we studied, when immigration was high and then restricted, and also for the most
recent period, when immigration surged again.


       We noted that during the critical period 1980 to 2005, when the college premium
increased by an astonishing 23 percent, immigration could account for only 10 percent of the
surge or just 2.4 log points. Most of the increase was due, instead, to the slowdown in college
going among the native-born population. In fact, educational changes to the native-born
population were nine times more important than was immigration for the rise in the college wage
premium.


       Immigration was more important for the relative decline at the bottom end of the skill
distribution. But even in that calculation, educational slowdowns among the U.S. born were
more important quantitatively.


       Earlier in the century, the high school movement was considerably more important than
immigration restrictions to the reduction in the skill premium. Had immigration remained at its
high early twentieth century level but the high school movement had occurred as it did, the
relative supply of educated workers would have grown at 95 percent of its actual rate (85.2
versus 89.9 log points) from 1910 to 1930.




                                                The Race between Education and Technology 28
       We noted that the wage structure and the returns to skill have exhibited important
discontinuities. Most of the narrowing in wage differentials, for example, took place in the
1910s and the 1940s, periods close to or coinciding with the two world wars. They were times of
increased demand for the lower skilled, great innovation, and union activity. But although the
discontinuities in the wage structure suggest a structural change, the fact that the wage structure
remained in place though the institutions changed suggests the importance of fundamental
changes in both education and technology.


       Our central conclusion is that when it comes to changes in the wage structure and returns
to skill, supply changes are critical, and education changes are by far the most important on the
supply side. The fact was true in the early years of our period when the high school movement
made Americans educated workers and in the post-World War II decades when high school
graduates became college graduates. But the same is also true today when the slowdown in
education at various levels is robbing America of the ability to grow strong together. We now
address what it takes to win the race for the long run.

Sources and Notes:
College Graduate Wage Premium: The plotted series is based on the log college/high school
wage differential series in Appendix Table A8.1. We use the 1915 Iowa estimate and the 1940
to 1980 census estimates for the United States. We extend the series to 1990, 2000, and 2005 by
adding the changes in the log (college/high school) wage differentials for 1980 to 1990 for the
CPS, 1990 to 2000 from the census, and 2000 to 2005 from the CPS to maintain consistency in
the coding of education across pairs of samples used for changes in the college wage premium.

High School Graduate Wage Premium: The plotted series is based on the log (high school/eighth
grade) wage differential series in Appendix Table A8.1. We use the 1940 to 1980 Census
estimates for the United States. To maintain data consistency, we then extend this series
backwards to 1915 using the1915 to 1940 change for Iowa and forward to 2005 using the 1980
to 1990 change from the CPS, the 1990 to 2000 change from the February 1990 CPS to the 2000
CPS, and the 2000 to 2005 change from the CPS.

Sources: The underlying data are presented in Appendix Table A8.1 and are derived from the
1915 Iowa State Census, 1940 to 2000 Census IPUMS, and 1980 to 2005 CPS MORG samples.

Notes: The “relative wage” is the log (college/high school) wage differential, which is the
college wage premium. The underlying college wage premium series is plotted in Figure 1. The
relative supply and demand measures are for college “equivalents” (college graduates plus half
of those with some college) relative to high school “equivalents” (those with 12 or fewer years of
schooling and half of those with some college). The log relative supply measure is given by the
log relative wage bill share of college equivalents minus the log relative wage series:
            ⎛ S⎞       ⎛ wS S ⎞      ⎛w ⎞
         log⎜ ⎟ = log⎜        ⎟ − log⎜ S ⎟
            ⎝U⎠        ⎝ wU U ⎠      ⎝ wU ⎠
where S is efficiency units of employed skilled labor (college equivalents), U is efficiency units
of employed unskilled labor (high school equivalents), and wS and wU are the (composition-
adjusted) wages of skilled and unskilled labor. The log relative wage bill is based on the series
for the wage bill share of college equivalents in Appendix Table A8.1. The relative demand
measure log( DSU ) depends on σ SU and follows from equation (3) in the text:
                        ⎛ S⎞          ⎛ wS S ⎞
        log( DSU ) = log⎜ ⎟ + σ SU log⎜      ⎟
                        ⎝U⎠           ⎝ wU U ⎠
To maximize data consistency across samples in the measurement of education changes from
1980 to 1990 use the CPS, changes from 1990 to 2000 use the census, and changes from 2000 to
2005 use the CPS. The changes for 1915 to 1940 are for Iowa. See Autor, Katz, and Krueger
(1998) for details on the methodology for measuring relative skill supply and demand changes.

Sources and Notes: Each column is an OLS regression of the college wage premium on the
indicated variables using a sample covering the years 1914, 1939, 1949, 1959, and 1963 to 2005.
Standard errors are given in parentheses below the coefficients. The college wage premium is a
fixed weighted average of the estimated college (exactly 16 years of schooling) and post-college
(17+ years of schooling) wage differential relative to high school graduates (those with exactly
12 years of schooling). (College/high school) supply is the log supply of college equivalents to
high school equivalents both measured in efficiency units. The data for 1963 to 2005 are from
the 1964 to 2006 March CPS samples. The college wage premium and relative supplies in
efficiency units for 1963 to 2005 use the same data processing steps and sample selection rules
as those described in the data appendix to Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2007). The college wage
premium for 1963 to 2005 uses the log weekly earnings of full-time, full-year workers. The
college wage premium observations for 1914, 1939, 1949, and 1959 append the changes in the
college wage premium series from 1915 to 1970 (actually 1914 to 1969) plotted in Figure 1 to
the 1969 data point from our March CPS series. The log relative supply observations for 1914 to
1959 similarly append changes in the relative supply of college equivalents from 1914 to 1939
for Iowa and for the United States from 1939 to 1949, 1949 to 1959, and 1959 to 1969 from the
Census IPUMS samples using the efficiency-units measurement approach of Tables 5 and 6.

Sources: The underlying data are presented in Appendix Table A8.1 and are derived from the
1915 Iowa State Census, 1940 to 2000 Census IPUMS, and 1980 to 2005 CPS MORG samples.

Notes: The relative wage is the log wage differential between those with 12 years and 8 years of
school, adjusted for demographic factors. This high school wage premium series is plotted in
Figure 1. The relative supply and demand measures compare exact high school graduates (those
with exactly a high school degree or 12 years of completed schooling) to those without a high
school diploma (0 to 11 years of schooling). The methodology for constructing the supply and
demand measures is the same as described in the notes to Table 1 with high school graduates (H)
replacing college equivalents (S) and high school dropouts (O) replacing high school equivalents
(U). Thus, the log relative supply measure is given by the log relative wage bill share of high
school graduates to dropouts minus the log high school wage premium. The log relative demand
measure log( DHO ) is based on eq. (4) in the text and given by:
                        ⎛ H⎞          ⎛ wH H ⎞
        log( DHO ) = log⎜ ⎟ + σ HO log⎜      ⎟
                        ⎝ O⎠          ⎝ wO O ⎠
To maximize data consistency across samples in the measurement of education, changes from
1980 to 1990 use the CPS MORG, changes from 1990 to 2000 use the February 1990 CPS and
the 2000 CPS MORG, and changes from 2000 to 2005 use the CPS MORG. The changes for
1915 to 1940 are for Iowa.

Sources and Notes: Each column is an OLS regression of the high school wage premium on the
indicated variables using a sample covering the years 1914, 1939, 1949, 1959, and 1963 to 2005.
Standard errors are given in parentheses below the coefficients. The high school wage premium
is the (composition-adjusted) wage differential between those with exactly a high school degree
(12 completed years of schooling) and those with 8 completed years of schooling. (High
school/dropout) supply is the log supply of those with 12 completed years of schooling to those
with 0 to 11 years of schooling measured in efficiency units. The data for 1963 to 2005 are from
the 1964 to 2006 March CPS samples. We use the same data processing steps and sample
selection rules as those described in the data appendix to Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2007) in
constructing wage series for high school graduates and dropouts and the relative supply measure
in efficiency units for 1963 to 2005. The high school wage premium for 1963 to 2005 is for the
log weekly earnings of full-time, full-year workers and compares workers with exactly 12 years
of schooling to all dropouts. We multiply this high school wage premium series for 1963 to
2005 by 1.44 to make it comparable to a series for the log wage gap between those with 12 and 8
years of schooling. The multiplier of 1.44 is the mean ratio of the log (high school/eighth grade)

changes in the high school wage premium series from 1915 to 1970 (actually 1914 to 1969)
plotted in Figure 1 to the 1969 data point from our March CPS series. The log relative supply

equivalents from 1914 to 1939 for Iowa and for the United States from 1939 to 1949, 1949 to
1959, and 1959 to 1969 from the Census IPUMS samples using the efficiency-units
measurement approach of Tables 5 and 6.

Notes: The “log gap” follows the approach of Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1997) and is derived
as follows. The ratio of unskilled (U) to skilled (S) workers can be decomposed as follows:
             ⎛ LU ⎞        ⎛ NUt    ⎞ ⎡ ⎛         M      ⎞       ⎛    M ⎞⎤
        log ⎜⎜ t ⎟⎟ = log ⎜⎜        ⎟ + ⎢log ⎜ 1 + U t   ⎟ − log ⎜ 1 + St ⎟ ⎥ ,
                                    ⎟ ⎢ ⎜                ⎟       ⎜    N St ⎟⎠ ⎥
             ⎝ L St ⎠      ⎝ N St   ⎠ ⎣ ⎝         NUt    ⎠       ⎝            ⎦
where L jt = supply of workers in skill group j in year t, and N jt ( M jt ) = supply of U.S. born
(immigrant) workers in skill group j in year t, such that L jt = N jt + M jt . The first term of the
right side of the equation is the native contribution to the ratio. The second term, in brackets, is
the immigrant contribution. We call this term the “log gap” and it is given in the table in cols.
                                                                      MUt                      M St
(3a,b). The components of the “log gap” are given in cols. (1a,b),         , and cols. (2a,b),      .
                                                                      NUt                      N St
The “skilled” groups in the table are high school graduates and college “equivalents”; the
“unskilled” groups are dropouts and high school “equivalents,” respectively. College
equivalents are those with 16 or more years of schooling plus half of those with some college.
High school equivalents are those with 12 or fewer years of schooling plus half of those with
some college. Worker supplies in cols. (1) to (3) are measured in efficiency units: the sum of
hours of work weighted by the relative wage of each individual’s demographic group in a base
year (the average of 1940, 1960, and 2005). We use 60 demographic groups (6 education groups
by 5 age groups by 2 sexes). The last column presents the immigrant employment share using
raw employment counts not efficiency units.

Notes: Each cell in the table is the annualized percentage change, from the beginning to the end
of the period, of relative skill supplies measured in efficiency units. The total column gives the
overall growth in relative skill supply. The immigrant and native-born columns decompose the
overall relative skill supply growth into the immigrant and native contributions defined in the
notes to Table 5. The immigrant column can be computed from the data in Table 5 cols. (3a.b)
“log gap,” which is the immigrant contribution to the relative skill supply. For example, from
1980 to 2005 the “log gap” for high school dropouts versus high school graduates went from
0.065 to 0.430 (Table 5, col. 3a). If there had been no foreign born in 1980, the log ratio of high
school graduates to dropouts would have increased by 6.5 log points and in 2005 it would have
increased by 43 log points. Thus, the annualized contribution of immigrants to changes in
log(H/O) from 1980 to 2005 is given by [(0.065 – 0.430) × 100/25] = –1.46. See the notes to
Table 5 for the definitions of college and high-school equivalents and efficiency units.

Sources: The estimates in col. (1) are from Goldin and Katz (1995, table 8). The estimates in
col. (2) use the 1915 Iowa State Census and the 1880 to 1940 Census IPUMS.

Notes: The relative supply measure is the ratio of high school graduates to those with less than
12 years of schooling. The col. (1) estimates use the administrative data on flows of new high
school graduates from Figure 1, Chapter 6 to build up stocks of high school graduates following
the methodology described in the notes to table 8 of Goldin and Katz (1995).

The col. (2) estimates use individual-level data on all labor force participants (those reporting a
gainful occupation) aged 14 years or older in each Census IPUMS from 1880 to 1930. We
impute the probability that a labor force participant in the 1880 to 1930 Census IPUMS is a high
school graduate based on high school graduate shares by birth cohort and sex in the 1915 Iowa
State Census (for pre-1890 birth cohorts) and the 1940 Census IPUMS (for 1890 to 1916 birth
cohorts). The Iowa estimates for pre-1890 birth cohorts are multiplied by 0.8, the mean ratio of
the high graduate share for the overall U.S. to Iowa residents for 1870 to 1890 birth cohorts in
the 1940 IPUMS. We assume that labor force participation rate from 1880 to 1930 was the same
for male high school graduates and less-educated males. We assume that the labor force
participation rate of adult female high school graduates (those 21 years and older) was 1.4 times
the rate of less-educated adult females for 1880 to 1930. These assumptions are based on the
labor force participation rates by education, sex, and cohort in the 1915 Iowa sample and 1940
IPUMS. We adjust downward the high school graduation rates of those 14 to 19 years old to
reflect the lower labor force participation rates of those continuing in school. The 1890 estimate
of the high school graduate labor force share is the average of the 1880 and 1900 estimates since
there is no 1890 Census IPUMS sample.

Sources: 1915 Iowa State Census; 1940 to 2000 U.S. Census IPUMS; 1980, 1990, 2000, and
2005 CPS MORG samples; and February 1990 CPS.

Notes:
Wage Bill Shares: Wage bill shares, defined as the share of total labor earnings paid to each
education group, are calculated for samples that include all individuals 18 to 65 years old
employed in the civilian work force at the survey reference date. Since employment at the
survey reference date is not available in the 1915 Iowa State census, we include all individuals
with occupational earnings in 1914 in our calculations of wage bill shares for Iowa in 1915. The
earnings of wage and salary workers and the self-employed are included in calculating wage bill
shares in all years and samples. In those samples for which the earnings for the self-employed
are not available (the 1940 Census IPUMS, the CPS MORG samples, and the February 1990
CPS), we impute the hourly earnings of the self-employed using the average earnings of wage
and salary workers in the same industry-education-year cell following the approach of Autor,
Katz, and Krueger (1998). High school dropouts are those with 0 to 11 years of completed
schooling. High school graduates are those with exactly 12 years of completed school and no
college. College equivalents include all of those with at least a four-year college degree (16 or
more years of completed schooling) plus one-half of those with some college.

Educational Wage Differentials: The log college/high school wage differential is a weighted
average of the estimated college (exactly 16 years of completed schooling or bachelor’s degree)
and post-college (17+ years of schooling or a post-baccalaureate degree) wage premium relative
to high school graduates (those with exactly 12 years of completed schooling or a high school
diploma) for the year given. The weights are the employment shares of college and post-college
workers in 1980.

The log (high school/eighth grade) wage differential is the estimated wage premium for those
with exactly a high school degree (12 years of completed schooling) and those with exactly 8
years of completed schooling. Changes in education coding in the census and CPS lead us to
include workers with 5 to 8 years of completed schooling in the eighth grade category for the
1990 and 2000 Census, February 1990 CPS, and the 2000 and 2005 CPS MORG samples.

The log (high school/dropout) wage differential is a weighted average of the estimated wage
premium for those with exactly a high school degree (12 years of completed schooling) relative
to 4 groups of “dropouts,” those with exactly 8, 9, 10, and 11 years of completed schooling. The
weights are the employment shares in 1980 of dropouts with 8, 9, 10, and 11 years of completed
schooling.

Educational wage differentials for the United States for 1940 to 2005 are estimated in each
sample using a standard cross-section regression of log hourly earnings on dummies for single
years of schooling (or degree attainment) categories (some schooling categories contain multiple
years with education coding changes in 1990), a quartic in experience, three region dummies, a
part-time dummy, a female dummy, a nonwhite dummy, and interaction terms between the
female dummy and quartic in potential experience and the nonwhite dummy. The educational
wage differentials are directly taken from the coefficients on the dummy variables for schooling
categories. The regression samples include civilian employees from 18 to 65 years old. The
regression specification and the specific data processing steps follow the approach of Autor,
Katz, and Krueger (1998, table 1).

Estimates of educational wage differentials for Iowa from 1915 to 1940 required a different
treatment based on our concerns with the meaning of college education for older cohorts in the
1915 Iowa state census, and difficulties in measuring the returns to education for women in the
early twentieth century given the potential importance of unpaid family work. These issues are
discussed in detail in Goldin and Katz (2000).

We use our preferred estimates of the returns to a year of college for young men (18 to 34 years
olds) in 1914 and 1939 from Chapter 2, Table 7 to estimate the change in the log college high
school wage differential from 1915 to 1940. The return to a year of schooling for young men
decreased by 0.033, from 0.148 in 1915 to 0.115 in 1940, which implies a decline in the log
(college/high school) wage differential of 0.140 from 1915 to 1940 after proportionally scaling
up the 1940 return to a year of college for young men by a factor of 4.307 to equal the 1940
national (college/high school) wage differential of 0.498 for all workers aged 18 to 65 years.

The log (high school/eighth grade) and (high school/dropout) wage differentials for Iowa in 1915
and 1940 are estimated from samples of non-farm, full-year male civilian workers aged 18 to 65

years in the 1915 Iowa State Census and from those residing in Iowa in the 1940 Census IPUMS.
These measures of the high school wage premium are taken from cross-section regressions of log
annual earnings on dummy variables for single year of schooling categories, a quartic in
potential experience, and dummy variables for nonwhites and for foreign born status. Hours and
weeks of work are not available in the 1915 Iowa State Census but information on months of
unemployment in 1914 is available. Full-year workers for 1915 are those with earnings in 1914
but no unemployment in 1914. Full-year workers in 1940 are those who worked at least 50
weeks in 1939.
