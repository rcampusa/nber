                                          ABSTRACT

We conduct experiments eliciting risk preferences with over 1,400 children and adolescents aged
3-15 years old. We complement our data with an assessment of cognitive and executive function
skills. First, we find that adolescent girls display significantly greater risk aversion than
adolescent boys. This pattern is not observed among young children, suggesting that the gender
gap in risk preferences emerges in early adolescence. Second, we find that at all ages in our
study, cognitive skills (specifically math ability) are positively associated with risk taking.
Executive functions among children, and soft skills among adolescents, are negatively associated
with risk taking. Third, we find that greater risk-tolerance is associated with higher likelihood of
disciplinary referrals, which provides evidence that our task is equipped to measure a relevant
behavioral outcome. For academics, our research provides a deeper understanding of the
developmental origins of risk preferences and highlights the important role of cognitive and
executive function skills to better understand the association between risk preferences and
cognitive abilities over the studied age range.

1. Introduction

         A large literature in experimental economics has focused on the role of risk preferences in

explaining life outcomes.1 For example, some research shows that women are less risk averse than

men, which could partly explain the gender gap in competitiveness and in labor market earnings

(Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011; Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014). It is important to document when

differences in risk preferences begin to emerge and when these differences start to make a

difference in the behaviors or skills of boys and girls. Such knowledge may inform policies to

address differences in educational performance that may, perhaps lead to a wage gap later in life.

Despite the great potential value of such understanding, surprisingly little is known about

differences in risk preferences at an early age or how these may interact with cognitive skills and

executive functions and thereby alter the life paths of students.

         To explore this question, we conduct experiments using a risk preference elicitation task

that we developed with over 1,400 children and adolescents ages 3-15. We find that by age 13-15

years old, adolescent girls display significantly greater risk aversion than adolescent boys. We do

not find the same gender gap among children ages 3-12, suggesting that the gap in risk taking

emerges in adolescence. We complement our data on risk preference with an assessment of

cognitive and executive function skills. The cognitive skills we refer to in this study are reading,

writing and math ability. Executive functions refer to planning skills, maintaining focus and

attention, following instructions, resisting distraction and temptation, and coordinating multiple

tasks. The executive functions that we measure are working memory, inhibitory control, attention

shifting, grit, self-control, conscientiousness and openness to experience. We find that cognitive

skills and executive functions are significantly related to risk preferences. Children and adolescents




1Examples include Bertrand, 2011; Dohmen et al., 2011; Insler et al., 2016; Khwaja et al., 2006; and Sutter et al.,
2013.

                                                                                                                      2
with higher cognitive skills (specifically math skills) are more willing to take risks. Children with

higher executive functions, and adolescents with more grit, self-control or soft skills, tend to be

less willing to take risks. These results are robust to the inclusion of socio-economic and

demographic controls.

         Our first contribution is to evaluate the gender gap in risk preferences. Documenting gender

disparities in risk preferences is important since this disparity can lead to many differential life

outcomes.2 A handful of papers find that adult women are more risk averse than adult men

(Borghans et al., 2009; Charness and Gneezy, 2012; Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Dohmen et al.,

2011; Eckel and Grossman, 2002; 2008).3 A few studies (discussed in Section 2) have considered

the emergence of a gender gap in risk preferences in children and adolescents, but they have either

had relatively small sample sizes or have not included cognitive controls.

         Our second contribution is to establish a connection between risk aversion and both

cognitive skills and executive functions across childhood and adolescence. It is important to

include controls for these two skills when assessing the developmental origins of risk preferences,

since there is a rapid change in these as children mature. While some related work on risk

preferences has included cognitive controls, the related work focuses on adolescents or adults and

excludes children (e.g., Eckel et al., 2012; Benjamin et al., 2013; Burks et al., 2009; Dohmen et

al., 2010; Frederick, 2005; Insler et al., 2016). Moreover, no related work that we know of also

explores the associations of executive functions with risk preferences, despite its obvious



2 We also propose that measures with children can be considered a ‘purer’ measure of time preference than most of
the literature presents with their subject pools. This contribution can be thought of in terms of measuring risk posture.
Conventional expected utility theory recognizes the important effects of background risk on risk attitudes measured
on the current choice. Harrison et al. (2007) show that background risk is important empirically. Specifically, they
find their subjects are substantially more risk averse when background risk is introduced. These results suggest the
importance of understanding the complete portfolio of risk the agent holds when making choices. As far as we are
aware however, the literature has not provided estimates of how background temporal profiles affect current choices.

  Note that surveys of the literature conclude that the gender gap in risk aversion is not apparent in all contexts (Filippin
and Crosetto, 2016). Moreover, the gender gap in risk preferences is not as robust as the observed gender gap in
competitiveness (Byrnes et al., 1999; Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011).

                                                                                                                           3
relevance.

         In what follows, Section 2 summarizes the related literature. Section 3 describes our

experimental design. Section 4 summarizes our results. Section 5 provides a discussion and

concludes.



2. Related Literature

2.1 Gender Gap in Risk Preferences of Children and Adolescents

         Harbaugh et al. (2002) were the first to explore risk preferences of young children using

an incentivized risk elicitation task. Potentially due to relatively small sample sizes4, the authors

did not find a gender gap in risk preferences in their child, adolescent, or adult subjects.

         Sutter et al. (2019) provide a summary of economic preference experiments conducted with

children and adolescents since the original Harbaugh et al. (2002) paper. Their survey concludes

that the majority of studies find that girls are more risk averse (less risk tolerant) than boys (studies

include Levin and Hart, 2003; Borghans et al., 2009; Moreira et al., 2010; Booth and Nolen, 2012;

Cárdenas et al., 2012; Eckel et al., 2012; Sutter et al., 2013; Alan et al., 2017; Deckers et al., 2016;

Glätzle-Rützler et al., 2015; Khachatryan et al., 2015; Castillo, 2017). However, some studies do

not find the gender effect (for example, Angerer et al., 2015 do not report on a gender effect;

Tymula et al., 2012; Munro and Tanaka, 2014; Deckers et al., 2017; Castillo et al., 2018 do not

find a gender effect). Since many of the above studies span short age ranges and risk elicitation

tasks vary widely across studies, it is also difficult to know at what age the gender gap emerges.

         The evidence on risk preference development across age is quite mixed, but there is some

evidence that the gender gap emerges during adolescence. Säve-Söderbergh and Lindquist (2017)




464 subjects ages 5-8 years old, 65 subjects ages 9-13 years old, 58 subjects ages 14-20 years old, and 47 subjects
ages 21-64.

                                                                                                                      4
found that while adults on the TV show Jeopardy display gender gaps in risk taking, children ages

10-11 years old do not do so. Khachatryan et al. (2015) studied children ages 7-16 in Armenia and

found an emergence of gender-disparate risk preferences for children in grade 7 or higher as

compared to younger children. One suggested reason for the emergence of the gap around

adolescence is the hormonal change that occurs during puberty (Smith et al., 2013).

         Related studies suggest that social environment influences a person’s tendency to take

risks. Gardner and Steinberg (2005) found that being surrounded by peers influenced subjects to

make riskier decisions. Booth and Nolen (2012) found that girls who attend mixed-gender schools

may be more risk averse than girls who attend all-girls schools. Cárdenas et al. (2012) found that

the gender gap in risk-taking varies across Columbia and Sweden. Andersen et al. (2013) found

the emergence of gender-disparate competitiveness in puberty in patriarchal but not matriarchal

societies. Brown and ven der Pol (2015) used survey questions measuring risk preferences and

found that adolescents’ risk preferences are associated with parental risk preferences.

         An improvement our study over related work is that we control for other age-related

changes (i.e. cognitive skills and executive functions). A second important improvement is that we

use the same task to study children and adolescents, which allows us to understand risk preferences

in both groups. A third improvement is that we study risk preferences at a younger age than most

studies (for example, in the summary by Sutter et al. (2019), the youngest children studied are 4

years old in Moreira et al. (2010) and 5 years old in Harbaugh et al. (2002), Levin and Hart (2003),

and Castillo (2017).)



2.2 Relationship of Risk Preferences with Cognitive Skills, Executive Functions and Soft

Skills

         Related work also documents relationships between risk taking, cognitive skills, executive


                                                                                                  5
functions and soft skills. We might expect a relationship of cognitive skills (specifically math

skills) with risk aversion since these skills may affect the processing of information related to

probability. We might also expect a relationship of executive functions with risk aversion since

inhibitory control or self-control might affect ability to regulate the prepotent response. That is, if

a child’s prepotent response is to take many pencils (i.e., take a higher risk), self-control ability

may allow him or her to inhibit this response and take fewer pencils. Further, the literature from

developmental science described later in this section provides theories about links between

working memory and risk taking behavior.

       Among adults, some work has found that greater cognitive skills are associated with lower

risk aversion (Burks et al., 2009; Dohmen et al., 2010; Frederick, 2005; Insler et al., 2016). Among

adolescents, risk taking and cognitive skills were assessed in Eckel et al. (2012) and Benjamin et

al. (2013). Eckel et al. (2012) did not find an association of risk preferences with cognitive skills,

as proxied by math ability. However, Benjamin et al. (2013) did find an association of risk

preferences with cognitive skills, whereby higher cognitive ability – especially in math – was

predictive of lower levels of risk aversion. To the best of our knowledge, researchers have not

assessed risk preferences and cognitive skills of children. If children are similar to adults and

adolescents, we might expect that children with higher levels of cognitive ability would also

display lower levels of risk aversion. On the other hand, if the link between risk preferences and

cognitive ability develops later in life, we may find no such association.

       Some limited related work in economics has also evaluated the association of executive

functions and soft skills with risk preferences. Eckel et al. (2012) found that high planning ability

was negatively associated with risk taking, but only among 9th grade students. Becker et al. (2012)

reviewed the role that personality has on economic preferences. The authors found a low

association between personality and economic preferences, but concluded that the two are


                                                                                                     6
complementary in predicting life outcomes and behavior.

       Developmental psychologists have also been interested in exploring associations of

executive functions with risk-taking (see Boyer, 2006, for a review). This literature has focused

on adolescents, which is an age group that is known for taking higher amounts of risk generally

(e.g., reckless driving, smoking) (Steinberg, 2008). Boyer (2006) emphasized that emotional

instability and impulsivity may be the main explanation of adolescent risk-loving preferences.

Additional related work includes Rosenbaum et al. (2017), who found some evidence that training

adolescents in working memory decreased their risk taking behavior in a hypothetical gambling

task. A potential explanation for the link between working memory and risk taking is that improved

working memory accelerates executive function development and therefore reduces risk taking.

Finally, Romer et al. (2011) found association of risk taking (as measured by surveys) with

executive functions and the tendency to act without thinking.

       A limitation of the related work is that it does not include young children, since it focuses

mostly on adolescents and adults. Our study is the first to document associations of risk preferences

with cognitive skills at an early age. Another limitation is that related work does not include

measures of executive functions and related skills together with cognitive skills as we do.

Importantly, we find that cognitive skills and executive functions matter for risk taking at all age

ranges in our study, including for children as young as age 3.



3. Experimental Design

3.1 The Pencil Task

       The risk preference task we use is a simplification of a task developed by Andreoni and

Harbaugh (2009, 2018). We here provide a simple model that illustrates the point that risk

neutrality predicts always choosing the midpoint on the budget, no matter the price. In their task,


                                                                                                   7
adult subjects choose both a probability p, 0≤p≤1, of winning a prize x if they win, where p and x

lie on a budget constraint, such as rp+x =100. In this problem, r is a price that can be any positive

number. For instance, if r=100, and an individual is risk neutral, the person will solve:

                                    !"#$,& (#         ). +. 100( + # = 100

that is, the subject will maximize expected value, choosing p=0.5 and x=50. Risk averse subjects

will prefer a higher p and lower x relative to this, while a risk loving person would prefer a lower

p. Thus, the degree of risk aversion can be measured simply by distance of the chosen p from the

expected-value-maximizing p. In this example, values of p increasingly above ½ indicate greater

risk aversion, and values of p increasingly below ½ indicate greater risk loving.

        The modification we employ in this study relies on the same principles, but is greatly

simplified. Participants were shown a fixed number of pencils in a jar (five pencils for children,

ten pencils for adolescents).5 One pencil had a red mark on the bottom. Participants were told that

they could choose to take as many pencils as they wanted from the jar. They could keep any pencils

they took out of the jar, as long as none of the pencils that they took had a red mark on the bottom.

But if any pencil had a red mark on the bottom, they had to give up all the pencils. Children made

the decision only once and then proceeded to take out the number of pencils they specified (i.e.,

the choice of pencils was not sequential). At the end of the experiment, children kept all the pencils

taken out, while adolescents could trade their pencils for U.S. dollars at the rate of 1 pencil = 25

cents.6 The analogy to the Andreoni-Harbaugh mechanism is clear. The number of pencils taken

out is the prize x, while the proportion of pencils still left in the jar indicates the probability of

winning, p percent. Since the price is 1, risk neutrality occurs at half of the pencils. Taking fewer


5 Simplifying tasks slightly for younger children is common in related work. For example, in Alan et al. (2017),
children had fewer than half as many balls as their mothers in a risk elicitation task.
6 We have successfully used similar non-monetary prizes for young children in related work (e.g., Andreoni et al.,

2019; Samak, 2013). The pencils were chosen to have patterns that appeal to this age group. Adolescents are motivated
by relatively small monetary payments. For comparison, a school lunch or breakfast costs between $2.00 and $3.00
and students can buy other snacks at their school for under $1.00.

                                                                                                                   8
than half of the pencils indicates risk aversion and taking more than half indicates risk loving.

       Our task is similar to Edwards and Slovic (1965). In their task, children were seated in

front of 10 switches and chose how many switches to pull, whereby nine switches were “safe” and

one switch was the “disaster switch.” The more “safe” switches the child pulled, the more candies

he/she received. However, pulling of a “disaster” switch resulted in loss of all candies. Our task

differs from Edwards and Slovic (1965) in that children first decide how many pencils to take out

of the box, whereas in Edwards and Slovic (1965) children are continuing to pull switches until

they stop or pull the “disaster switch.”

       Other tasks that are related to ours include the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)

(Lejuez et al., 2003) and the Bomb Risk Elicitation Task (BRET) (Crosetto and Filippin, 2013).

In the BART, children choose continuously whether to keep pumping a balloon that has an

unknown probability of popping. More pumping is associated with increasing rewards, and

popping the balloon is associated with no reward. In the BRET, subjects decide how many boxes

to collect out of 100, one of which contains a bomb. More boxes collected is associated with

linearly increasing rewards, but collecting a box with a bomb results in loss of all rewards. The

BRET task and Edwards-Slovic task are formally equivalent.

       Our pencil task has several improvements over the BART and BRET that may be helpful

for economists conducting risk elicitation experiments in the field with children. It is simple, easily

understood      by    children,     and     can     be     conducted      without     a     computer.

A limitation of the pencil task is that different from a multiple price list (e.g., Holt and Laury,

2002), we are not able to study inconsistency of choices. This is because children make only one

choice, and not many choices. Inconsistency of choices has been documented among both adults

and children, which can cast doubt on the reliability of risk preference measures (Loomes et al.,

1991; Brocas et al., 2018). Solutions for the inconsistency problem include simply dropping


                                                                                                     9
individuals who are inconsistent (Harbaugh et al., 2002) or constructing structural estimates to

correct for measurement errors and improve estimation (Castillo et al., 2018). Brocas et al. (2018)

suggest that inconsistency among children may be due to several factors, including task difficulty,

lack of ability to focus or irrational behavior. Our pencil task addresses the first two factors since

it is simple and short.



3.2 Experimental Setting

        Children were recruited from the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center (CHECC)

program. CHECC is a large-scale intervention study on the role of different early education

programs on schooling outcomes conducted in 2010-14 (Fryer et al., 2015). Adolescents were

recruited from the UProgram, a separate ongoing intervention study on the role of cognitive skills

and non-cognitive skills interventions on schooling outcomes of 7th and 8th graders.

        Table 1 (column 1) provides a summary of the background characteristics of the CHECC

sample. The CHECC sample is drawn from Chicago Heights, IL and the surrounding area. This is

a predominantly low-income and high minority area. The UProgram sample is drawn from

similarly low-income and high-minority suburbs in Illinois - Harvey, Matteson and University

Park. Table 1 (column 2) provides a description of the UProgram sample. The CHECC and

UProgram samples were similar along the dimensions of gender and census block variables.7 They

differed by race, with relatively more Hispanic students in the CHECC sample and relatively more

Black students in the UProgram sample.


3.3 Child Experiment

        Children participated about a month after the programs started, which is likely before any


7We match census block variables on address to include these controls: fraction of residents aged 25+ with HS
diploma only, 25+ with college degree only, and 25+ with more than college, and fraction of households below
twice the poverty line.

                                                                                                                10
potential impact of the programs on risk preference could be observed.8 Participating children

(ages 3-5) and their older siblings (ages 6-12) completed the experiment in 2010-2011. Younger

children participated one-on-one with a trained experimenter, while older children participated in

a group with several trained experimenters who walked around to assist. The experimenter read

the instructions out loud to the child (see Appendix I). The risk preference elicitation was part of

a larger set of assessments, including time preferences, which we report on in a separate paper

(Andreoni et al., 2019).9

         All CHECC children also participated in a comprehensive assessment of cognitive skills

and executive functions (See Appendix II).10 These were conducted one-on-one with an assessor

trained in these tasks. The cognitive skills tests were nationally normed sub-tests of the Woodcock-

Johnson III Test of Achievement (Woodcock-Johnson III, 2007), including measuring literacy

(letter-word and spelling) and math ability (applied problems and quantitative concepts). These

were supplemented with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (measuring receptive vocabulary).

         The executive function tests were taken from Blair and Willoughby (2006a; 2006b; 2006c),

and include tests of working memory, inhibitory control and attention shifting. They were

supplemented with the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment, a survey that assessors completed

after the assessment about the child’s regulation skills during the assessment (Smith-Donald et al.,

2007).

         For children, we create a “cognitive skills index” by averaging standardized scores in the

cognitive skills sub-tests, and an “executive functions index” by averaging the scores in the

  A related series of papers have reported on other characteristics of the CHECC sample which are different from
what is reported here, most notably social preferences (Cappelen et al., 2016; Ben-Ner et al., 2017; List and Samak,
2013; List et al., 2018) and competitiveness (Samak, 2013). This work also includes studies of the associations of
economic preferences, cognitive abilities and executive functions at an early age with disciplinary referrals later in
life (Castillo et al., 2018) and the development of Theory of Mind (Cowell et al., 2015; Charness et al., 2019).

executive function tasks.



3.4 Adolescent Experiment

         The adolescent experiment was conducted in a group, whereby the experimenter read the

instructions out loud while the students followed along (see Appendix I). Adolescents were seated

such that they were each doing their own work and could not copy from each other. Three

experimenters walked around to assure that children were on task and not discussing any of the

questions together. The risk elicitation task was conducted 4-6 weeks after the one-quarter program

started and was part of a larger assessment of risk, time and social preferences.11

        All adolescents also participated in comprehensive assessments of cognitive skills and

executive functions (See Appendix II). The cognitive skill scores are taken from the Measures of

Academic Progress (MAP) test that is administered annually by the school, and are split into math

and reading scores.12 The executive function scores are taken from the National Institutes of Health

(NIH) Toolbox application that we administered, including four sub-test instruments: Dimensional

Card Sort Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, List Sorting Working Memory Test,

and Picture Sequence Memory Test.13 We also collected survey data from adolescents on grit, self-

control and two components of the Big Five personality index: conscientiousness and openness to

experience.

        For adolescents, we create a “cognitive skills index” by averaging standardized math and

reading scores from the MAP and an “executive function index” by averaging the scores in the

executive function tasks (NIH Toolbox). This most closely aligns the executive functions

measured for adolescents with those measured for children. We complement this data with an

aggregate measure from the adolescent survey for “soft skills” (grit, self-control, conscientiousness

and openness to experience).

        Note that although both children and adolescents participated in comprehensive tests of

cognitive and executive function ability, none of the tests conducted with children are the same as

the tests conducted with adolescents. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the

performance of children and adolescents on the tests.


4. Results

4.1 Summary of Results

        Figures 1 and 2 provide histograms of the number of pencils taken out of the jar, by gender,

for the child and adolescent experiments. It is apparent that some children and adolescents make

mistakes by choosing zero pencils or choosing the maximum number of pencils, and therefore

having no chance at a reward. None of the 231 children chose zero pencils and 5 (7.8%) chose 5

pencils. Two of 1295 adolescents (0.15%) chose zero pencils, and 5 (0.39%) chose 10 pencils.14

Dropping children and adolescents from the regressions who made these mistakes does not affect

our main results (see Appendix III, Tables A1 and A2).

        Table 2 provides a calculation of the expected payoff for participants picking each possible

number of pencils from the jar. Expected payoff is calculated by multiplying the number of pencils

taken by the probability that none of the pencils is the one with the mark, which would lead to a

zero payoff. For example, a child who picks 3 pencils has an expected payoff of 6/5 = (3)(2/5) +

(0)(3/5). An adolescent who picks 7 pencils has an expected payoff of 21/10 = (7)(3/10) +

(0)(7/10). From this table, it can be seen that choosing more pencils in the pencil task is related to

greater risk-seeking behavior.


14In total, only 0.54% of observations were lost in the Andreoni-Harbaugh elicitation because of end-point choices.
By comparison, the popular Holt and Laury (2002) multiple price list task often loses 10% of observations because
of multiple switching. See a discussion and broader comparison in Andreoni and Kuhn (2019).

                                                                                                                 13
4.2 Gender Gap in Risk Preferences

       We now turn to understanding the gender gap in risk preferences. Patterns in Figures 1 and

2 indicate higher degrees of risk taking in adolescent boys versus adolescent girls, with no apparent

differences in younger girls and boys. Table 3 provides summary statistics for children and

adolescents, including a p-value for the t-test comparing results by gender. While we do not

observe a gender gap in risk taking among children (ages 3-12) (The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test of

equality of distribution between male and female is not statistically significant, p = 0.48), we do

observe a gender gap in risk taking among adolescents (ages 13-15) (The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test

of equality of distributions between male and female is statistically significant, p < 0.01). As shown

in Table 3, on average adolescent girls take 4.91 pencils (s.e.=0.08) while adolescent boys take

5.71 pencils (s.e.=0.08).

       The gender result is further confirmed in Tables 4 and 5, which provide Ordinary Least

Squares (OLS) regressions with number of pencils taken as the dependent variable and gender as

the independent variable for children and adolescents, respectively. Child regressions cluster at the

family level. Adolescent regressions include school-level controls (the program was run in three

middle schools) and cluster on the unit of randomization at UProgram (quarter-school-class).

Column 2 adds controls for demographic and socioeconomic status (including the variables

summarized in Table 1) , and column 3 adds controls for cognitive skills and executive functions.

Including all controls, Table 5 (column 3) shows the coefficient on Female for adolescents is -0.81

(p-value < 0.01). We do not observe a statistically significant coefficient of Female in the child

sample, as shown in Table 4 (column 3) where the coefficient on Female is -0.12 and is

insignificant (p-value 0.62).

       Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) is a concern in any experiment that attempts to compare

sub-groups (List et al., 2016). Using Holm’s adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing (with 7


                                                                                                   14
hypotheses: comparing by gender for each age group, cognitive and executive functioning for each

age group, and soft skills for adolescents) our results for the gender gap among adolescents remain

significant at the 5% level.



4.3 Association with Cognitive Skills and Executive Functions

       The regressions in Tables 4 and 5 illuminate another interesting finding: cognitive skills

are significantly positively associated with risk preferences, even when controlling for gender, age,

socio-economic, and other demographic characteristics. In Table 4, which provides the results

from the child experiment, the coefficient on the standardized cognitive ability index is positive

(0.33) and statistically significant (p-value < 0.01). In Table 5, which provides the results from the

adolescent experiment, the coefficient on standardized cognitive ability index is again positive

(0.24) and also statistically significant (p-value < 0.01). Using Holm’s adjustment for MHT, these

results remain significant at the 5% level.

       Among adolescents, the impact of cognitive ability seems to be driven by math ability. In

Tables 6 and 7, we separate out the different components of the indices for children and

adolescents, respectively. As shown in Table 7, for adolescents the coefficient on standardized

math scores is positive (0.39) and statistically significant (p-value < 0.01). These results are

remarkable in light of the fact that in our sample of adolescents, girls have higher cognitive test

scores than boys (see Table 3) — that is, cognitive ability is not the primary driver of our main

result of a gender gap in risk preferences in adolescents. This result is in line with the previous

studies where higher cognitive skills are associated with a preference for risk taking (Burks et al.,

2009; Benjamin et al., 2013; Dohmen et al., 2010; Frederick, 2005).

       The relationship between executive function and risk taking is also interesting. Among

children, risk taking is associated with statistically significantly lower executive functions (see


                                                                                                   15
Table 4 (column 3), coefficient = -0.31, p-value = 0.01). For adolescents, we split non-cognitive

skills into executive functions (the executive functions index includes the average standardized

components of the NIH Toolbox) and soft skills (soft skills include the average measures of

personality traits, grit and self-control measured by a survey). Among adolescents, risk taking is

associated with somewhat higher executive functions, but the result is statistically significant only

at the 10% level and not robust to Holm’s adjustment for multiple hypotheses. Soft skills are

statistically significantly negatively associated with risk taking among adolescents (coefficient = -

0.24, p-value= 0.02). As displayed in Table 7, this seems driven in large part by self-reported self-

control (coefficient = -0.15, p-value<0.05). Using Holm’s adjustment for multiple hypotheses, the

result for soft skills remains significant at the 10% level.

       As a robustness check for our econometric analysis, and the way we have grouped variables

between cognitive skills and executive functions, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis. We

then re-run the OLS regressions reported in Tables 4 and 5 using the indices constructed by factor

analysis (see Appendix III, Tables A3 and A4. The results we find are similar to those we get using

the indexes constructed by standardized averages.



4.4 Further Analysis

       We also have access to disciplinary referral data for the adolescent sample. Disciplinary

referrals are an important outcome variable in young-adult samples because disciplinary referrals

are a predictor of school drop-out rates, which influence educational attainment and labor market

outcomes. We use this data to verify the usefulness of our new simple risk measure at capturing a

field-relevant behavior.

       Tables 8 and 9 provide OLS regressions that use number of disciplinary referrals as the

outcome variable. In Table 8, we evaluate the binary outcome variable – any disciplinary referral


                                                                                                  16
versus no disciplinary referral. We find a small and statistically insignificant coefficient on our

risk measure (coefficient = 0.01, p-value = 0.105 (see column 2)). In Table 9, we evaluate the

number of disciplinary referrals conditional on having at least one disciplinary referral. We find

that among adolescents with at least one disciplinary referral, higher risk-taking is associated with

statistically significant increases in the number of disciplinary referrals, (coefficient = 0.21, p-

value = 0.02 (see column 2). This association holds even when controlling for cognitive skills and

executive functions (see Table 9, column 2), suggesting that risk preferences play a role beyond

that which is captured in standard measures of cognitive skills. In Tables 8 and 9 we also see that

as expected, cognitive skills, executive functions and soft skills are statistically significantly

negatively associated with disciplinary referrals.

       Related work has shown that time preferences are associated with disciplinary referrals,

with more impatient adolescents exhibiting more disciplinary referrals (Castillo et al., 2018). Our

work complements this finding by showing that risk preferences can be similarly predictive of

field behavior. Castillo et al. (2018) also use a risk preference elicitation (consisting of choosing

between 5 lotteries) in their study, but do not find an association with disciplinary referrals. We

propose that this could be because of the smaller sample in their study or because their task is more

difficult for younger populations to understand than our task.

       Finally, we need to take into account two differences between the child and adolescent

experiments. First, the adolescent sample is much larger than the child sample, which could explain

why we find a statistically significant gender gap among adolescents but not among children. To

address this concern, in Appendix III, Table A5 we conduct a bootstrap analysis on the adolescent

sample, limiting the sample size to 231. We continue to observe a statistically significant gender

gap. Second, the adolescent sample includes choices of pencils from 0-10, while the child sample

includes choices of pencils from 0-5. To address this concern, in Appendix III, Tables A6 and A7


                                                                                                  17
we rescale the adolescent sample by setting all choices of pencils 5-10 to 5 (Table A8) or setting

all choices of pencils 0-5 to 5 (Table A9). Again, we continue to observe a statistically significant

gender gap.



5. Discussion and Conclusion

        Our findings inform our understanding of the development of risk preferences as children

grow up and have implications for policy and practice. First, we find that a gender gap emerges

around adolescence, with girls displaying more risk averse behavior than boys. This gender gap

could be explained by nature, that underlying differences between male and female individuals

emerge during puberty. It could also be explained by nurture, that environment plays a role in risky

behavior—from upbringing in a single sex school to presence of peers. This result is in line with

related work.

        Our second main finding is that cognitive skills and executive functions are associated with

risk taking at all ages in our sample. This points to the importance for future work to control for

these skills when measuring changes in risk preferences over time or across sub-groups. Cognitive

skills are positively associated with risk taking in both children and adolescents. Executive

functions are negatively associated with risk taking in children, and somewhat positively

associated with risk taking in adolescents. Soft skills in adolescents are negatively associated with

risk taking.

        Our research finds that while there is no gender gap among young children, a gender gap

in risk taking does emerge during adolescence. Since risk taking is associated with

competitiveness, our results could have policy implications for decreasing the gender gap in

competitiveness Potential policy interventions could focus on increasing willingness for women

to take risks prior to adulthood, when preferences may already be ingrained. Adolescents make


                                                                                                  18
many choices—for example, choice of coursework—that affect their educational and labor market

outcomes. Related work shows that women tend to avoid more competitive fields (Buser et al.,

2014). We find that cognitive ability is associated with increased risk taking, yet girls in our sample

already display higher cognitive ability than boys, so it is unclear whether interventions that

improve math skills could lead to reductions in the gender gap. Finally, we find that extreme risk

taking preferences are associated with poorer outcomes, such as increased disciplinary referrals.

Therefore, caution should be taken when prescribing policies to increase risk taking.

        More generally, we provide a description and evaluation of a simple task that allows us to

measure risk preferences quickly and easily of a wide age range of children. The task can be used

for children as young as age 3, does not require a computer, and is associated with an expected

behavioral outcome (disciplinary referrals). We hope future researchers use this task when

evaluating preferences of young or low-literacy populations, or when time to administer the task

is limited.

pencils taken for children ranges from 1-5. The Cognitive Index for children is composed
of standardized scores on Peabody Picture Vocab, Woodcock Johnson Applied Problems,
Woodcock Johnson Letter-Word Problems, Woodcock Johnson Spelling Problems, and
Woodcock Johnson Quantitative Concepts. The Executive Functioning Index for children
is composed of standardized scores of Operation Span Task, Preschool Self-Regulation As-
sessment, and Spatial Conflict Task. The number of pencils taken for adolescents ranges
from 1-10. The Cognitive Index for adolescents is composed of standardized scores on
MAP math and reading. The Executive Functioning Index for adolescents is composed
of standardized scores on NIH Toolbox Dimmensional Change Card Sort Test, Flanker
Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, List Sorting Working Memory Test, and Picture
Sequence Memory Test. Self Control, Grit and Personality Index for adolescents is com-
posed of self-report Grit, Self-Control, Openness (Big Five), and Conscientiousness (Big
Five).
