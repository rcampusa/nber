                                         ABSTRACT

Foreign banks’ lending to firms in emerging market economies (EMEs) is large and denominated
predominantly in U.S. dollars. This creates a direct connection between U.S. monetary policy and
EME credit cycles. We estimate that over a typical U.S. monetary easing cycle, EME borrowers
experience a 32-percentage-point greater increase in the volume of loans issued by foreign banks
than do borrowers from developed markets, followed by a fast credit contraction of a similar
magnitude upon reversal of the U.S. monetary policy stance. This result is robust across different
geographies and industries, and holds for U.S. and non-U.S. lenders, including those with little
direct exposure to the U.S. economy. EME local lenders do not offset the foreign bank capital
flows, and U.S. monetary policy affects credit conditions for EME firms, both at the extensive
and intensive margin. Consistent with a risk-driven credit-supply adjustment, we show that the
spillover is stronger for riskier EMEs, and, within countries, for higher-risk firms.

1. Introduction

      For emerging market economies (EMEs), foreign bank loans are by far the most important

category of cross-border capital flows, and they are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. As of

2015, International Monetary Fund (IMF) data indicate that loans represent about half of all

external liabilities of emerging market countries. By comparison, foreign bond and equity portfolio

investments combined represent only about 20 percent. Much of the foreign lending comes from

banks headquartered in developed economies: Bank for International Settlements (BIS) data show

that roughly a third of all external liabilities of emerging market countries are held by U.S.,

European, and Japanese banks. Moreover, the volume of these claims has nearly doubled since the

onset of the global financial crisis, reaching about $7 trillion in 2016. Consistent with the general

dominance of the U.S. dollar in international trade (e.g., Goldberg and Tille 2008; Gopinath 2016)

and finance (e.g., Shin 2012), we document that over 80 percent of the cross-border loans to EMEs

are denominated in U.S. dollars. 1 This dollarization of cross-border credit prevails over time and

across different geographic regions and industries.

      Given the economic significance of U.S. dollar lending by global banks to EME firms, U.S.

monetary policy plays an important role as a “push factor” for the credit cycles in these economies

through its impact on U.S. interest rates. In particular, by setting the federal funds rate, U.S.

monetary policy sets the short end of the dollar yield curve, thereby crucially affecting the supply

of credit through banks’ dollar funding cost (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler 1995). Moreover, U.S.

monetary policy influences the yields on longer-term dollar investments due to the expectation

hypothesis and direct measures that affect the slope of the yield curve (such as unconventional

monetary policy). Fig. 1 illustrates the basic correlation between cross-border loans to EMEs and

U.S. federal funds rate from 1980 through 2015. The significant correlation—tightening/easing of

U.S. monetary policy is associated with contraction/expansion in cross-border credit to EMEs—

holds in levels and in changes.

                                              [FIGURE 1]

   The aggregate results in Fig. 1, while suggestive, could also be explained by relative changes

in investment opportunities around the world or by compositional shifts in the investor base in a

given country. Instead, in this paper, we use micro data: DealScan data on global syndicated loan

issuance covering corporate lending to firms from a wide range of countries, including 119 EMEs,

between 1990:Q1 and 2016:Q3. Consistent with the previous literature for individual EMEs—e.g.,

Ioannidou et al. (2015) evidence for Bolivia, Morais et al. (2017) evidence for Mexico, Baskaya

et al. (2017) evidence for Turkey—we find that U.S. monetary policy easing is associated with a

general increase in cross-border loan volumes by global banks. Importantly, we show that easing

U.S. monetary policy leads to a large and significant differential increase in cross-border loan

volume to EME borrowers, by the same global bank, in the same quarter, net of borrower fixed

effects. This differential effect amounts to larger lending volumes of about 2 percentage points per

25-basis-point decrease in the U.S. federal funds rate. During a typical monetary easing/tightening

cycle in our sample period, the federal funds target rate is adjusted by about 4 percentage points.

Given our estimates, this would amount to an additional increase/decline in loan volumes to

emerging market borrowers of a sizable 32 percentage points. More generally, when we look at

the underlying country-level macroeconomic variables instead of an EME indicator, we find that

cross-border bank flows to higher-yielding markets (e.g., higher GDP growth, higher interest rate

spread) are more sensitive to changes in U.S. monetary policy.




                                                                                                  2
   Global dollar bank flows to EMEs are also influenced by longer-term U.S. interest rates, which

triggers banks’ portfolio rebalancing toward riskier assets (e.g., Rajan 2005). In particular, we find

that—holding constant the level of the yield curve set by the short-term policy rate—a reduction

in the term spread (the difference between the 10-year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate)

is associated with a strong flow of dollar capital into EME credit markets. This effect holds

throughout the sample period, but is particularly relevant during the zero-lower-bound (ZLB)

period when the Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate at zero and eased monetary policy

through unconventional measures that directly impacted long-term rates. Because of the ZLB

constraint on the federal funds rate, we also show that unconventional U.S. monetary policy easing

during the ZLB period, as measured by the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate, strongly pushes dollar

capital into the EMEs. Consistent with the special role of U.S. monetary policy, we find that

changes in Eurozone interest rates have an effect on euro-denominated credit, but do not have a

significant effect on dollar-denominated credit, to EME borrowers.

   Monetary policy is intrinsically connected to economic fundamentals (Romer and Romer

2004). To show that the differential relationship identified between U.S. monetary policy and

dollar-denominated credit flows to EMEs is causal and not driven by relative or absolute changes

in investment opportunities, we proceed in several steps. First, we account for economic conditions

in the lender’s home country and its potential differential impact of EMEs vs. developed market

economies (DMEs). Second, we use the monetary policy shocks as in Gürkaynak et al. (2005) to

instrument the federal funds rate. Third, to rule out potentially different correlations between EME

credit demand and U.S. economic conditions, we confirm that the results hold for loans to EME

borrowers from (i) both non-tradable and tradable industries, (ii) sectors that produce goods and

services with a low country-level export share, (iii) economies with low international trade overall,



                                                                                                    3
and (iv) economies with weak trade ties to the United States. Similarly, the results are robust to

restricting the sample to global lenders with marginal direct exposure to U.S. economy. We verify

that the effect holds for all geographic regions.

   We further show that global bank flows driven by U.S. monetary policy affect EME credit

conditions at the firm level. In particular, we confirm that the contraction of credit by global banks

is not offset by an increase in credit by local banks, but leads to a general credit contraction,

increase in interest rate spreads, and lower probability of refinancing for EME borrowers. Our

estimates indicate that during a typical U.S. monetary policy cycle, EME borrowers experience a

14-percentage-point stronger contraction in credit volume, a 38-basis-point stronger increase in

interest rate spreads, and a 6-percentage-point lower refinancing probability than DME borrower.

To highlight the macroeconomic risks of foreign credit outflows from EMEs, it is important to

keep in mind that the average maturity of a syndicated loan is four to five years and tends to be

stable over time. This means that, on average, time to refinancing is substantially shorter than a

typical time to reversal of U.S. monetary policy stance. We also find that, within the emerging

markets, U.S. monetary policy tightening leads to higher interest rate spreads and a lower

probability of refinancing maturing loans for emerging market borrowers with a higher reliance

on foreign banks. Finally, we find that EME infrastructure financing by foreign banks is also

sensitive to U.S. monetary policy.

   Our core result establishes an economically large, supply-driven differential effect in the

spillover to high-yield, emerging markets (as compared to developed economies). There are a few

channels that lead to increased risk-taking by banks in response to monetary policy easing. First,

there is what the Federal Reserve has been calling “prudent risk-taking” or “productive risk-

taking”, a channel that is consistent with traditional portfolio allocation models: lower policy rates



                                                                                                    4
make riskier investments more attractive. Within the United States, this is an intended consequence

of U.S. monetary policy. Instead, we show that there are unintended and sizable effects outside the

United States as well; a point that has been at the core of the debate among the central bankers. 2

Second, our results could be also consistent with what is known as “reaching for yield”, that is a

shift toward riskier investments driven by frictions within financial intermediaries (here, global

banks). Third, there is the so called “risk-taking channel of monetary policy” (e.g., Adrian and

Shin 2010; Bruno and Shin 2015) which postulated that lower interest rates ease banks’ VaR

constraint, thereby increasing banks’ risk-bearing capacity. Consistent with a bank risk-taking

explanation of the differential sensitivity of cross-border bank flows across markets, we also show

that, when U.S. monetary policy eases, within a given country, foreign bank credit supply expands

more to riskier borrowers. That said, our results do not draw a sharp distinction between different

risk-taking explanations. In particular, the results in our paper are not a test of reaching-for-yield,

but instead we focus on illustrating a distinct and strong sensitivity of emerging markets to risk-

driven expansion and contraction of global dollar credit supply.

    At a high level, our paper contributes to the large economic literature on international spillovers

via capital flows, monetary policy transmission, and the role of global financial intermediaries

(e.g., Cetorelli and Goldberg 2012 or, more recently, Buch et al. 2018 and Temesvary et al. 2018).

Most directly, our work expands empirical evidence of a “global financial cycle” that is linked to

economic conditions in the “center country” (Rey 2013), and the special role that banks play in

this context. The vast empirical literature on this subject had followed two approaches. First, there

is cross-country analysis using aggregate data. In particular, using a VAR approach, Miranda-

Agrippino and Rey (2015) show the importance to global asset prices of the cross-border

transmission of U.S. monetary policy via financial intermediaries. In addition, McCauley et al.

(2015) use aggregate data to study the effect of U.S. monetary policy on global dollar credit.

Related to the special role of U.S. monetary policy, Takáts and Temesvary (2016), using aggregate

BIS data, study the role of currency denomination in the transmission of international monetary

policy. The aggregate analysis however is susceptible to several critiques. In particular, the

composition of the sample of EME borrowers is likely to be changing through the cycle. Thus, the

second strand of research referenced earlier uses micro data to study EME credit cycles, and had

relied on the credit registry data available for individual countries (Ioannidou et al. 2015; Morais

et al. 2017; Baskaya et al. 2017).

    Our study is the first to use firm-level, cross-country evidence in a sample covering more than

25 years of global loan issuance, emphasizing the differential transmission of U.S. monetary policy

for emerging and developed economies through the balance sheet of global banks, and the special

role of the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for global lending. 3 Given our focus on the

differential sensitivity of emerging market economies to the transmission of U.S. monetary policy,

this paper expands work by Forbes and Warnock (2012), Fratzscher (2012), and Ahmed and Zlate

(2014) that has highlighted the importance of U.S. economic conditions, in particular U.S.

monetary policy, for capital flows into emerging markets from a bond and equity flow perspective.

    Finally, our work contributes to the literature on credit cycles in emerging market economies

and the implications for financial stability and economic development. E.g., Acharya et al. (2015)




3
 There are two other studies using the same data, studying cross-border monetary policy transmission but focusing
on issues other than the unique role of U.S. monetary policy, and its impact on EMEs. Demirgüç-Kunt, Horväth, and
Huizinga (2017) study the role of global banks’ charters in foreign markets for the cross-border transmission of
monetary policy. Bräuning and Ivashina (2017) examine monetary policy spillovers in major developed economies,
emphasizing the interaction with the currency markets.

                                                                                                               6
and Shin (2016) highlight the risks to financial stability when emerging market borrowers sharply

increase dollar leverage during periods of strong capital inflows.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present stylized facts on

cross-border lending to EMEs. In Section 3, we establish our main result on the effect of U.S.

monetary policy on cross-border lending to EMEs. In Section 4, we discuss the consequences of

foreign bank funding dependence by EMEs. Section 5 concludes.


2. U.S. dollar cross-border lending to EMEs

    Foreign bank lending represents a significant fraction of foreign capital inflows to EMEs. As

mentioned in the introduction, according to data from the IMF International Investment Position,

loans represent about 50 percent of all EMEs’ external liabilities. 4 By comparison, Fig. 2 (a) shows

that, in 2015, portfolio (vs. direct) bond investment in EMEs represented only about 15 percent of

external liabilities, and portfolio equity investment represented about less than 5 percent (these

numbers refer to the median values across EMEs). Beyond the composition, bank and broader fund

flows display a strong correlation: from 1990 onward, the correlation of loan flows to EMEs with

equity and bond flows to EMEs is about 0.50. (This relationship is weaker in the 1980s.) This is

consistent with the fact that the core results presented in this paper hold in both the DealScan

dataset (which includes primarily data on large corporate loans) and the BIS dataset (which

includes data on all claims held by banks.)

                                                     [FIGURE 2]

    Global bank flows are particularly important for EMEs. Combining the IMF data with the BIS

Consolidated Banking Statistics, Fig. 2 (b) shows that about a third of all external liabilities of

emerging markets are held by large global banks, twice as large a proportion as claims of global

banks on developed markets. 5 Moreover, the relative importance of cross-border bank claims for

developed-market countries has decreased from 2005 (beginning of the detailed BIS data) to 2015,

but the trend has been the opposite for emerging markets. Consistent with Giannetti and Laeven

(2012), the BIS data also show that the total volume of foreign bank claims for developed market

countries increased from $12 billion in 2005 to $25 trillion in 2008, but then declined steadily to

$16 trillion in 2016. In contrast, claims on emerging market countries increased more than

threefold throughout the entire sample, from about $2 trillion in 2005 to about $7 trillion in 2016.

A similar pattern emerges from DealScan syndicated loan issuance data, the core data for our

study. Table 1 presents the sample composition by country. Throughout the period from 1995:Q1

through 2016:Q3, there is a strong and persistent reliance of EME firms on foreign bank credit

with more than 80 percent of all loan commitments to EME firms were provided by foreign banks,

while the share was below 50 percent for developed economies.

    The importance of global bank flows to EMEs points to the potential exposure of these markets

to foreign monetary policy. Moreover, because of the dollar dominance of bank capital flows to

EMEs, it is U.S. monetary policy that is likely to be most relevant due to its strong effect on

nominal U.S. interest rates. The last three columns in Table 1 show the country-level currency

composition of cross-border credit, making it clear that the dominance of dollar-denominated

credit is a global phenomenon: from 1990:Q1 through 2016:Q3, the share of dollar-denominated

cross-border loans issued to emerging market borrowers is about 87 percent for Africa, 95 percent

for the Americas, 81 percent for Asia, and 71 percent for Europe (a smaller dollar share goes hand-

                                                                                                                 8
in-hand with a higher euro share). Table 2.A shows that, for each region, the dollar dominance of

cross-border credit holds broadly across borrowers from all industries (based on the 1-digit SIC

code) and is not confined to the tradable sectors. 6

    As Table 2.B illustrates, the dollar reliance in the broader set of assets held by foreign banks

is lower than what we see for corporate loans; yet the majority of claims on emerging markets are

still denominated in U.S. dollars. Other currencies, including local currencies, the British pound,

or the Japanese yen, play a negligible role. The data come from BIS Locational Banking Statistics

and include all claims held by foreign banks including bonds, equities, and non-corporate loans.

This adds external validity to our results. For comparison, we report the stock of syndicated loans

constructed by aggregating the most recent term loans in the DealScan sample that mature after

2016:Q3. Finally, in Fig. 3, we highlight that dependence on dollar-denominated credit is a

persistent phenomenon that goes back at least two decades. Overall, the evidence presented here

substantially expands what we knew from earlier work, which was focused much smaller set of

EMEs.

3. U.S. monetary policy and cross-border lending

3.1. Data

    In our main analysis, we use Thompson Reuters DealScan database of global syndicated

corporate loan issuance covering a wide range of countries between 1990:Q1 and 2016:Q3. Deal

Scan data reports individual loan issuance, identifying individual borrowers and their home

country, lenders in the syndicate, and contractual details including the loan amount, currency

denomination, maturity and interest rate. Syndicated loans are funded by a group of lenders and


6
 Note that the same currency patterns hold for syndicated loans originated by local banks; however, while syndicated
credit is an important part of cross-border lending, it is likely to be a small fraction of domestic lending in EMEs.

                                                                                                                   9
are a good representation of loans to large corporate borrowers, since diversification (i.e., the size

of the loan) is the primary reason for loan syndication. 7 According to Gadanecz and Von Kleist

(2002), the estimated outstanding stock of syndicated loans held by foreign banks amounts to about

50 percent of all outstanding cross-border bank claims on Latin America and developing Europe,

and to around 100 percent of all outstanding cross-border bank claims on Asia and the Africa-

Middle East region. Thus, while syndicated loan data does not include small loans, it captures an

economically important share of cross-border bank credit to emerging markets. (From here, unless

stated otherwise, by referring to “loans” we will be referring to loans captured in the DealScan

data.)

    We consolidated banks at the bank-parent level, so a loan made by a local office of a Spanish

bank in Peru to a Peruvian firm is counted as a “cross-border” loan. DealScan data also captures

foreign banks engaging in direct lending (in this example, a Spanish office of a Spanish bank) in

EMEs. E.g., in the data, we see substantial lending activity by French and Japanese banks in Peru;

neither group has offices in Peru. Throughout the analysis, we consider only lenders with relatively

large commitments on a given loan. 8 The loan amount for a given bank in a given syndicate is

computed on a pro-rata basis; e.g., in a $150 million loan with three large commitments by banks,

each bank is assumed to contribute $50 million. Finally, loan issuance data are collapsed to the

quarterly frequency. About 2 percent of all borrowers have more than one loan from a given bank

in a given quarter; in such a case, we aggregate the amounts.

3.2. Benchmark results


7
  DealScan actually includes a few large bilateral loans, but the sample primarily consists of syndicated loans
(including “club deals”, the lower end of syndication).
8
  That is, we exclude lenders whose role in the syndicate is identified as merely “participant.” Having a syndicate role
other than “participant” qualifies a lender for league tables which are an important marketing tool in the market.
Ivashina (2009) provides a detailed discussion of different syndicate roles and reporting of loan commitments in
DealScan.

                                                                                                                     10
    Building on the economic significance of both cross-border bank lending and dollar-

denominated lending, we now focus on establishing across-market spillover of U.S. monetary

policy with the focus on the differential effect for EMEs. The dependent variable in Tables 3

through 5 is the logarithm of the total amount of cross-border dollar lending, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐿𝐿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ), by a bank

𝑗𝑗 to a firm 𝑖𝑖 in a quarter 𝑡𝑡.

                                                              [TABLE 3]

    Table 3 presents our benchmark results. Panel A, column (1) shows the basic relationship

between the federal funds rate and global banks’ lending abroad: the easing of U.S. monetary

policy pushes bank flows into foreign markets, while the tightening of U.S. monetary policy

reduces banks’ investment in foreign countries. Our hypothesis is that U.S. monetary policy has a

differential effect on the bank capital flows to EMEs. Column (2) reports the basic decomposition

of the total effect between developed and emerging markets, showing that, while directionally the

results are consistent across the groups, the effect on emerging markets is roughly twice as large

as the effect on developed markets. The coefficient estimates indicate that a 25-basis-point

decrease in the federal funds rate increases cross-border loan volumes to firms in DMEs by about

2.3 percent, while EME firms experience an increase of about 4.9 percent, a highly significant

differential effect of 2.6 percentage points (the t-statistic is 6.43).

    All the subsequent results in Table 3 focus on identifying the differential effect of U.S.

where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the loan amount granted by bank j to firm i in

quarter t. 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a bank*quarter fixed effects (that is, we estimate an intercept for each bank in a

given quarter), and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 is a borrower fixed effects. Inclusion of borrower fixed effects helps us

                                                                                                                               11
dealing with a demand-driven explanation of changes in credit behavior by accounting for

compositional shifts in the borrower sample, such as firms’ size group, location and industry.

Inclusion of bank-quarter fixed effects allows us to control for time-varying bank heterogeneity,

such as individual bank health, changes in business models, or macroeconomic conditions in the

lender’s home country. Bank-quarter fixed effects also net out any common time variation, e.g.,

related to global credit demand factors driven by the global business cycle, general changes in

cross-border loan volumes or changes in the value of the dollar over time. The key coefficient of

interest is β, which measures the differential change in EME loan volumes relative to DME loan

volumes (in percentage points) for a unit change in the U.S. interest rate.

   Column (3) corresponds to equation (1). As before, we find that EME loan volumes react

significantly more strongly to U.S. monetary policy changes than do DME loan volumes. In

economic terms, the coefficient in column (3) implies that a 25-basis-point easing in the U.S.

federal funds rate increases the volume of cross-border loans to borrowers from emerging markets

by an additional 2 percentage points, compared with borrowers from developed markets. Because

of the fixed effects, the identification of the effect is driven by the differential loan volumes to

borrowers from emerging and developed countries of a given bank in the same quarter, net of

borrower-specific time-invariant characteristics.

   U.S. monetary policy is typically a response to economic conditions; the Fed might ease

monetary policy precisely when economic activity in the United States and other developed

markets is low and credit demand is weak. Thus, the differential response of loan volume in EME

vs. DME countries shown in column (3) could be driven by correlated macroeconomic conditions

in the lenders’ home countries. To reflect this possibility, we add in column (4), and each

subsequent regression, the lender’s home country GDP growth, CPI inflation, and Consensus



                                                                                                 12
Economics forecasts of one-year-ahead economic growth, all interacted with the EME dummy

(since each regression includes lender*quarter fixed effects). The results are remarkably robust to

the inclusion of these additional controls, both economically and statistically.

    In column (5) and (6), we provide additional robustness checks on the effect of U.S. monetary

policy on emerging market loan volumes by instrumenting the federal funds rate with monetary

policy shocks. In particular, we use the two monetary policy shocks introduced by Gürkaynak,

Sack, and Swanson (2005), which can be interpreted as surprise components of the current federal

funds rate target and the future path of U.S. monetary policy. These shocks are identified from

high-frequency asset price changes in a narrow 30-minute window around Federal Open Market

Committee (FOMC) statements and, hence, qualify as exogenous instruments (e.g., see Gertler

and Karadi 2015; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey 2015). In particular, movements in a tight time

window around FOMC statements are likely to be unrelated to changes in both U.S. and foreign

economic conditions. In line with the rest of our data, we aggregate the monetary policy shocks to

a quarterly frequency and use these aggregated monetary policy shocks as instruments for the

federal funds rate. In column (5), we use 2 lags of the monetary policy shocks as instruments and

find that our coefficient estimate is roughly similar to our baseline specification in column (4): a

25-basis-point easing in the U.S. federal funds rate increases the volume of cross-border loans to

borrowers from emerging markets by an additional 2 percentage points, compared with borrowers

from developed markets. Column (6) shows that the finding is qualitatively robust to using 4 lags

of the monetary policy shocks. 9

  Kleinbergen-Paap LM-statistic of 9.45 (p-value of 0.05) in column (5) and 22.25 (p-value of 0.004) in column (6),
as well as the Hansen J-test statistics of 2.46 (p-value of 0.482) in column (5) and 11.52 (p-value of 0.117) in column

     Our baseline result in column (4) is based on using the federal funds rate as a measure of the

stance of U.S. monetary policy. Indeed, the federal funds rate has been the primary tool of U.S.

monetary policy for most periods in our sample. Moreover, this policy rate anchors the short end

of the yield curve, thereby having a strong impact on the dollar funding cost of global banks, which

is a key determinant of banks’ dollar lending decisions. 10 But banks lend long-term, so term spread

is important for their overall profitability. So, in column (7), in addition to the policy rate, we also

include the term spread—the difference between the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the federal

funds rate—as a direct measure of the slope of the yield curve. The coefficient estimates show that

the impact of the federal funds rate (the level of the yield curve) stays qualitatively similar, but

becomes quantitatively stronger with a differential effect on EME loan volumes of 3.9 percentage

points per 25-basis-point change in the federal funds rate. These magnitudes correspond to the

partial effects of the federal funds rate, holding constant the level of the term spread. Historically,

the term spread increased when the Fed eased monetary policy by lowering short-term rates.

Results in column (4) reflect economic magnitudes that account for the co-movement in the term

spread and the federal funds rate.

     The coefficient estimate on the term spread is negative. Hence, holding constant the level of

the yield curve (short rate), a smaller slope of the yield curve is associated with a significant

increase in EME lending volumes. This finding is intuitive and is consistent with indications of

risk-driven capital flow: when alternative returns on dollar assets are low (low longer-term yields),

bank capital is pushed into higher-yielding emerging market economies. Quantitatively, we

estimate that a 1 percentage point decrease of the term spread is associated with an additional

  If global banks have only limited access to direct dollar funding and borrow dollars in the FX swap market (synthetic
funding), the interest rates implicit in currency markets are closely linked to U.S. monetary policy (as reflected in the
covered interest parity). Even when deviations from covered interest parity exist, changes in the dollar interest rate
are strongly reflected in the price of dollar hedges.

                                                                                                                      14
increase in EME lending volumes (relative to DME lending volumes) of about 16 percentage

points; such a decline in the term spread was observed from December 2008 to June 2013, when

the Fed first indicated tapering of its asset purchases. 11

     In column (8), we confirm that the connection between emerging market capital flows and U.S.

monetary policy is not a recent phenomenon but holds throughout our sample, including the period

before the federal funds rate was pushed to zero in 2008:Q4. Note that the coefficient estimates in

this earlier part of the sample are economically and statistically smaller when compared with the

estimates for the full sample (t-statistic of 2.28). In column (9), we look at the period from 2008:Q4

to 2015:Q3 when the federal funds rate was at the zero lower bound (ZLB). During this period,

the federal funds rate was not the only tool of monetary policy, as the Fed conducted additional

monetary easing through unconventional policies, including forward guidance and large-scale

asset purchases. In fact, during this period, the Fed committed to keeping policy rates at zero for

an extended period of time. Therefore, during this period, we use the Wu and Xia (2016) federal

funds shadow rate, which provides a single measure that takes into account unconventional

monetary policy measures during the ZLB period. We find that this additional easing in U.S.

monetary policy during the ZLB period increased emerging markets lending volumes significantly

more than cross-border loan volumes to developed markets. Indeed, the coefficient estimate is

roughly similar to the estimate of the federal funds rate reported in column (4). (Results in column

(4) are similar if we replace the federal funds rate with the shadow rate during the ZLB period.)

     As we have shown, the estimates in Panel A are robust to instrumenting the federal funds rate

with monetary policy shocks and to the inclusion of lender-country macro controls (interacted with

the EME dummy). In the Internet Appendix, we take a closer look at the geographic breakdown

of emerging market countries and find that our baseline effect holds across all geographical

regions. We also replicate the result for borrowers from different industries and show that the

significantly stronger effect of U.S. monetary policy on EME lending holds for both borrowers

from the non-tradable and the tradable sectors. These results already suggest that our findings

unlikely to be driven by changes in international trade, or other region and industry-specific

elements. In Table 3.B we provide further evidence to reinforce this point by replicating the result

in Panel A, column (7), for different subsamples. In particular, we exclusively look at loans

originated by non-U.S. banks to non-U.S. borrowers. Furthermore, we consider only loans by non-

U.S. banks with a low exposure to the U.S. economy. The idea is that banks with low exposure to

the U.S. economy are serving the borrowers whose investment opportunities are not directly

affected by changes in U.S. economic conditions.

   We measure a bank’s exposure to the U.S. economy by the share of the number of cross-border

loans to U.S. borrowers relative to all cross-border loans over our sample period. (Results are

robust to measuring banks’ U.S. exposure based on a rolling window instead.) Specifically, we

define low-U.S.-exposure banks as banks with less than 5 percent (and, as a robustness check, 10

percent) of loans to U.S. borrowers. These low-U.S.-exposure banks account for roughly 10

percent of all loans in our sample (25 percent for the 10-percent-exposure cutoff). The first two

columns of Table 3.B show that, for non-U.S. banks with low direct exposure to the U.S. economy,

the significantly stronger increase of EME loan volumes continues to hold. In column (2)—loans

by non-U.S. banks with less than 5 percent of their loans to U.S. borrowers—we find a significant,

albeit quantitatively and statistically weaker (t-statistic of 2.10), differential effect for EMEs.

   In columns (3) to (6), we look at loans originated to EME firms that are unlikely to be affected

by changes in investment opportunities in the U.S. economy. Specifically, in column (3), we look



                                                                                                      16
at loans to EME firms from the non-tradable sectors based on the 1-digit SIC classification as

reported in DealScan. In column (4), we identify, for each EME country separately, borrowers that

produce goods and services that have a low export share relative to all exports of each country

(goods and services with an export share smaller than the 25th percentile of the within-country

distribution). In column (5), we look at loans to EME firms from countries with low trade (trade

relative to the country’s GDP smaller than the 25th percentile of the cross-country distribution),

and in column (6), we look at loans to EME firms from countries with low trade with the United

States (U.S. trade relative to the country’s total trade smaller than the 25th percentile of the cross-

country distribution). Country-level data on trade statistics are presented in Table 1. A decline in

economic activity in the United States (correlated with an easing monetary policy) is likely to

negatively affect U.S. suppliers and EME exporters more broadly. This suggests a positive

correlation between U.S. economic conditions and EME loan demand, which should bias our

estimates downward. The results in Table 3.B show that once we focus on loans by non-U.S. banks

with low U.S. exposure to borrowers that are unlikely to have a strong link to U.S. economic

conditions (and hence their time-varying loan demand is orthogonal to U.S. economic conditions),

we see that the differential effect of U.S. monetary policy on EME loan volumes indeed becomes

larger and statistically more significant. E.g., when we focus on loans to EME firms from countries

that have weak trade linkages with the United States, the coefficient on the federal funds rate is

over twice the size of the estimate based on the full sample of loans (column 7 in Panel A), with

the difference been statistically significant (t-statistic of 2.15). Economically, these borrowers

experience a sizable 8.7-percentage-point stronger loan volume increase when the federal funds

rate decreases by 25 basis points compared with a similar DME firm.




                                                                                                    17
   Table 3 only looks at the contemporaneous effect of the monetary policy. We have also looked

at the persistence of the differential effect for EMEs. We found that the effect indeed persists, but

gradually diminishes in the span of three quarters, a horizon that is consistent with the effect of

U.S. monetary policy on credit market conditions reported in other studies (e.g., Gertler and Karadi

2015). Our baseline specification also treats the effects of tightening and easing U.S. monetary

policy cycles as symmetric. In Fig. 4, we depart from this assumption and show response of cross-

border loan volume differentials to EME firms through a typical U.S. monetary policy easing

(Panel a) and tightening (Panel b) cycles. To examine this effect, we estimate regressions where

we model the loan volume differential as a fractional polynomial in the length of the policy cycle

(in quarters) while controlling for bank*quarter fixed effects and firm fixed effects. Panel (a)

shows that, during an easing cycle, loan issuance to EME borrowers slowly increases relative to

DME borrowers throughout the easing period. In contrast, Panel (b) shows that, during a tightening

cycle, there is a fast retrenchment of capital from EMEs resulting in a sudden decline in EME loan

volumes (relative to DME loan volume).

                                            [FIGURE 4]

   So far, we used a coarse measure to identify EME borrowers, based on the BIS classification.

In Table 4.A, we look instead at the underlying country characteristics (compiled from World Bank

information), examine how these characteristics interact with U.S. monetary policy and affect

global banks’ cross-border loan issuance across markets. In column (1), we find that borrowers

from countries with higher GDP growth receive generally larger loan volumes. Moreover, as the

negative coefficient on the interaction term indicates, borrowers in these countries are also more

sensitive to capital in/out-flows when U.S. monetary policy eases/tightens. Similarly, high-GDP-

growth countries are more sensitive to global bank flows when the U.S. term spread changes. The



                                                                                                  18
estimate on the interaction term indicates that sensitivity to the U.S. federal funds rate increases

by about 0.6 percentage points when the borrower country’s GDP growth increases by 1

percentage point. In columns (2), we show that the stronger sensitivity of bank flows to U.S.

monetary policy holds when we use another measure for a high-yield market—the difference

between the borrower country’s interest rate and the U.S. federal funds rate. The estimate on the

interaction term indicates that the sensitivity to U.S. interest rate changes increases by about 0.4

percentage points when the interest spread increases by 1 percentage point. In column (3), we

measure high-yield markets by the lagged rating for long-term sovereign debt of the borrower’s

home country collected from Fitch Ratings. The negative coefficient on the interaction term shows

that loan volumes to high-risk countries increase more strongly than loan volumes to low-risk

countries if U.S. interest rates decrease, in terms of both a lower federal funds rate and a lower

term spread. On the other hand, in column (4), we do not find a differential responsiveness when

we consider higher growth in their national stock market index as a proxy for high-yield markets.

                                                     [TABLE 4]

     In Table 4.B, we provide evidence that U.S. monetary policy does not only differentially affect

cross-border lending across countries, but also across borrowers within a given country depending

on firm risk. Specifically, we use the loan spread (relative to the 3-month LIBOR rate), and, to

remove a country-level component, we subtract: (i) the mean loan spread in the country of the

borrower during the same quarter (i.e., Spreadit − ∑I Spreadit ), and (ii) the historical annual

country risk premium obtained from A. Damodaran (i.e., Spreadit − CRPI ). Both measures are

proxies for the firm’s relative riskiness within a given country and quarter. 12 In column (1), we

  In the U.S. context, credit ratings had been shown to have a very high explanatory power for syndicated loan spreads
(e.g., Ivashina 2009).

                                                                                                                   19
find that loan volumes increase for high risk firms within a given country-quarter when U.S.

monetary policy eases. The results indicate that for a 25-basis-point decrease in the federal funds

rate, loan volumes increase by about 1 percentage point more to firms with a 1-pecentage point

higher spread (relative to the country-quarter mean spread). Similar effects are found for the U.S.

term spread. Note that we include country*time fixed effects instead of firm fixed effects because

we want to explain the variation across firms in a given country-quarter. Column (2) shows that

the estimates become quantitatively and statistically somewhat stronger when we include

industry*quarter fixed effects, thereby looking in addition to the within country also at the within

industry variation in loan volumes in a given quarter. Columns (3) and (4) show that similar results

are found if we measure firm risk as the spread to the country risk premium. (Note the change in

sample because data on country risk premia are only available as of 2000.)

3.3. Specialness of U.S. monetary policy

   U.S. monetary policy affects banks’ overnight dollar funding cost and can influence the yield

on alternative longer-term dollar investments. Given that cross-border lending to EMEs is

denominated primarily in dollars, we postulate that U.S. monetary policy plays a special role in

driving global dollar credit flows to EMEs. In Table 5, we provide further evidence on the

specialness of U.S. monetary policy by looking at monetary policy in the euro area.

                                              [TABLE 5]

   Historically, there has been strong co-movement between monetary policy decisions taken by

the Fed and those taken by the European Central Bank (ECB). Between 1999 (the introduction of

the euro) and 2016, the correlation between the euro overnight interest rate (EONIA) and the

federal funds rate is 0.81 and the correlation of the 10-year term spreads is 0.60. It is therefore not

surprising that if we just replace the U.S. variables with their equivalents for the euro area, the



                                                                                                    20
results will be economically and statistically similar, see column (1) of Table 5. Instead, in

specification (2), we expand our baseline specification (Table 3.A, column 7) to include both dollar

and euro interest rates and term spreads. We find that the estimates of the euro-related variables

are close to zero and are statistically insignificant, while the coefficients on the dollar variables

remain economically large and statistically significant. In specification (3), we exclude U.S.

lenders from the sample and show that non-U.S. banks also adjust their dollar lending to EMEs in

response to changes in U.S. monetary policy. The estimates are economically very similar to those

for the full sample. In column (4), we show that the results also hold for quarters with the opposite

movement in monetary policy stance; e.g., quarters when the United States was in a tightening

cycle and the euro area was in an easing cycle. 13 From 1999:Q1 through 2016:Q3, there are 20

such quarters when the stance of U.S. and euro-area monetary policy differed. Finally, in column

(5), we look at the euro-denominated cross-border lending of U.S. banks to non-euro borrowers

and confirm that for this currency the euro interest rate does matter. (The sample is substantially

smaller given the limited international role of euro-denominated lending and different constraints

imposed by the analysis.) This result is consistent with Ongena, Shindele, and Vonnak (2018) who,

in the European context, find that foreign monetary policy is relevant only for the loans in the

corresponding foreign currency.

     The core results of this paper are established using micro data on global syndicated loan

issuance, which allows for a narrow identification of the effects of U.S. monetary policy on global

loan issuance. While this cannot be done with aggregate BIS data, it is nevertheless informative to

examine whether a similar relationship between U.S. monetary policy and global bank capital

flows to emerging markets holds, especially given that the BIS data are not constrained to

  We define a tightening/easing cycle based on quarters when the policy rate increased/decreased and all subsequent
quarters where the rate was not decreasing/increasing until a reversal of policy occurred.

                                                                                                                21
syndicated credit, but instead include all forms of claims held by the banks. The results presented

in the Internet Appendix confirm that using the aggregate BIS data similar effects are found in

terms of economic magnitudes and statistical significance. This finding also helps to dilute the

concern that loan origination to the same firm could shift from syndication to bilateral transactions

which are not comprehensively covered in DealScan data. Also in the Internet Appendix, we

examine the role of countries’ financial openness using the Chinn and Ito (2006) index. In line

with Rajan (2014), our results show that, while financially more open countries receive generally

larger inflow of foreign bank capital, flows to these countries are also more sensitive to U.S.

monetary policy changes.


4. Consequences of foreign credit dependence

    We next analyze the extent to which the large capital inflows during periods of U.S. monetary

easing and the subsequent retrenchment of foreign capital during a U.S. monetary policy

contraction affect the credit conditions of EME borrowers at the firm level. After all, at the

individual-firm level, inflows and outflows of foreign capital may just lead to a substitution

between foreign and domestic lenders, leaving overall firm-level funding conditions unchanged.

Thus, studying substitution effects at the individual-firm level is crucial to assess the dependence

of local credit cycles in emerging markets on the stance of U.S. monetary policy.

                                                  [TABLE 6]

    In Table 6, we present the analysis of borrowing conditions at the firm level. In Panel A, we

look at the differential borrowing conditions for EME versus DME firms. The key dependent

variable is the logarithm of the total amount of dollar lending to a firm in a given quarter (that is,

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )) by (a) all foreign banks (columns 1), (b) all domestic banks (column 2), and (c) all banks

(columns 3 and 4).


                                                                                                        22
   In columns (1) through (3), we focus on firms with both foreign and local creditors in a given

quarter to estimate a substitution between foreign and local creditors. In columns (1), the estimates

show that the change in the cross-border credit volume in response to U.S. monetary policy is

stronger for firms from emerging markets than for firms from developed market economies. The

coefficient estimate indicates that in response to a decline in the U.S. federal funds rate of 25 basis

points, cross-border lending volumes to EME firms increase by 4.5 percentage points more than

the respective cross-border volumes to comparable DME firms. (This amounts to an average

reduction of $17 million.) We estimate a quantitatively similar effect for a reduction in the U.S.

term spread. On the other hand, if U.S. monetary policy tightens, local banks do not offset the

contraction in foreign bank credit by increasing their lending volumes to local EME firms (column

2). Indeed, we find that not only foreign, but also local dollar credit contracts. Our estimate

indicates that local lenders reduce their lending by 3.5 percentage points per 25-basis-point

increase in the federal funds rate, and a qualitatively similar but economically somewhat smaller

effect of the term spread. Statistically, the responses to both changes in the federal funds rate and

the term spread are not significantly different for local and foreign banks. Overall, due to the strong

reduction of foreign bank credit and the lack of substitution between local and foreign lenders,

U.S. monetary policy tightening of 25 basis points leads to a 4.2-percentage-point stronger overall

decline in dollar credit for emerging market firms (column 3) than for developed market firms.

While the lack of substitution might not be surprising in the banking context, this result is in sharp

contrast to findings that for securities markets, local investors (at least partly) offset a decline in

foreign holdings (see Forbes and Warnock 2012). The lack of substitution, in turn, magnifies the

overall effect that foreign capital withdrawal might have on the economy (Caballero and Simsek

2017).



                                                                                                    23
   In column (4), we broaden our sample and consider any firm that obtained cross-border funding

in a given quarter; that is, firms that are exposed to global bank capital flows. Also in the broader

sample, EME firms experience significantly stronger loan volume changes in response to U.S.

monetary policy than do DME firms. The estimated coefficient indicates an additional reduction

of about 1 percentage point per 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate. In columns (5),

we estimate the effect of U.S. monetary policy changes on the interest rate spread paid by firms

on their dollar borrowing, which we compute as the average all-in-drawn spread to the 3-month

LIBOR rate based on all loans taken out by the borrower in a given quarter. (The sample changes

from column (4) to (5) because the interest rate data are not available for all loans.) The positive

point estimate shows not only that EME firms face higher sensitivity of volumes than DME firms,

but also that the price of credit is more sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates for EME firms

than for DME firms. Our estimate indicates that a 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate

increases the interest rate spread by 2.4 basis points more for EME firms than for comparable DME

firms. We estimate a quantitatively similar effect of a change in the term spread.

   The results on credit volumes and spreads (columns 1 through 5) take into account only granted

loans (intensive margin of credit) and do not capture the extensive margin of credit (new loan

issuance). In column (6), we estimate the probability of refinancing maturing loans to EME firms.

More precisely, for each firm that we observe in the data, we look at those quarters where an

existing dollar loan matures. To mitigate concerns about exit of firms from the sample (e.g., due

to mergers or bankruptcy), we only consider firms which we continue to observe at a later period

in our database. (Removing this constraint does not have a material impact on our estimates.) The

dependent variable in column (6) is a dummy equal to one when we observe a new loan to the

firm, and zero otherwise. The results show that when U.S. interest rates increase, EME firms are



                                                                                                  24
significantly less likely to refinance their maturing debt compared to DME firms. The estimated

coefficients suggests that an increase in the federal funds rate by 25 basis points decreases the

refinancing probability of EME firms by 40 basis points more than for a similar DME firm.

Relative to the average refinancing probability in our sample (20 percent), this means a reduction

of additional 2 percent for EME firms compared with DME firms. Similarly, an increase in longer

term rates (term spread) strongly decrease the probability of refinancing for EME firms by 118

basis points (or 5.7 percent when compared to the mean).

   Intuitively, EME firms that are more dependent on foreign bank credit may be more affected

than other EME firms by fluctuations in cross-border capital flows triggered by U.S. monetary

policy changes. To test this intuition, we restrict our sample to EME firms and compute for each

firm its dependence on foreign bank credit. More precisely, for each firm-quarter, we compute the

number of foreign banks that lent to the firm (relative to the total number of banks that lent to that

firm) in the last quarter when the firm was obtaining a loan. The explanatory variable of interest

is the interaction term between this foreign bank-reliance measure and the U.S. federal funds rate.

The results are reported in Table 6.B.

   In columns (1), we focus on the logarithm of the total volume of dollar borrowing by an EME

firm in a given quarter. In unreported results, we verify that in the sample constrained to EME

firms—consistent with our previous results—the U.S. interest rate is negatively associated with

the borrowing amounts. Moreover, firms with more reliance on foreign banks borrow larger

amounts. Our focus is, however, on the interaction term between the U.S. interest rate and the

foreign bank-reliance variable. In column (1), we find a negative coefficient estimate indicating

that firms with a higher reliance on foreign- bank credit experience a larger decline in lending

volumes when U.S. monetary policy tightens than similar firms with a lower reliance on foreign



                                                                                                   25
banks. However, the estimated coefficient is not significant at the 10 percent level. In columns (2),

we analyze the interest rate spreads of EME firms, depending on their past foreign bank reliance.

The point estimates indicate that in general EME firms with higher foreign bank reliance pay

smaller interest rate spreads (a one-standard-deviation larger foreign bank share reliance is

associated with a 25-basis-point lower spread). However, they also experience a larger sensitivity

of spreads with respect to both changes in the federal funds rate and the U.S. term spread. E.g., if

the federal funds rate increases by 25 basis points, we estimate that a firm with a one-standard-

deviation larger foreign bank reliance would face a 1.2-basis-point larger increase in spreads

(14.43*0.32*0.25), while a similar increase in the term spread would lead to a 1.9-basis-point

larger increase in spreads (25.392*0.32*0.25).

   Finally, in column (3), we find that if U.S. monetary policy tightens, EME firms with higher

foreign bank reliance also face a significantly lower probability of refinancing their maturing loans

relative to other EME firms. A 25-basis-point increase in U.S. interest rates lowers the probability

of refinancing by about 60 basis points for each standard deviation (0.29) increase in foreign bank

reliance (-0.090*0.25*0.29). This corresponds to a 2 percent reduction when compared with the

average probability of refinancing of 31.9 percent in our sample. Moreover, we also find that

changes in the term spread transmit differentially to EME firms’ probability of refinancing,

depending on their past foreign bank reliance, with a quantitatively similar effect than what we

found for the federal funds rate.

   As a final reflection, in the Internet Appendix, we look at the financing of large infrastructure

projects, that is, projects related to the provision of essential services that are relevant for the

broader economic development and growth of an economy. The idea is to look at lending to a

segment that has an unambiguous impact on the real economy. It is also a segment that is likely to


                                                                                                  26
be very sensitive to the availability of foreign bank financing (e.g., Ehlers 2014, World Bank

2016). Indeed, the alternative to privately syndicated credit is loans from multinational institutions,

which tend to follow a very different and intense compliance process. 14 It is also broadly

acknowledged that global infrastructure needs largely exceed infrastructure investments, a gap that

is anticipated to increase in the future. 15 So, whereas some skepticism might remain as to how hard

it is to find alternative financing for corporate investing or whether this type of credit is beneficial

in first place, infrastructure investment is high-impact investment for which it is very difficult to

find a substitute for global banks’ funding. Infrastructure lending is an important part of our

sample: DME banks have increased investment in infrastructure projects in EMEs during the last

25 years, rising to a total volume of $25.8 billion in 2014, which equals 13.5 percent of all new

loan volumes committed to EME borrowers. In the Appendix, we show that an easing of U.S.

monetary policy increases loan origination of infrastructure projects in EMEs to a significantly

greater degree than in developed markets.


5. Conclusions

     The mandates of central banks are typically focused on domestic economic conditions and do

not account for potential international spillovers. There are some isolated examples of

collaboration among monetary authorities of major currency areas, but EMEs remain outside of

these coordination efforts. Following the 2008 financial crisis, this issue has resurfaced in the

public debate in the context of large capital inflows into EMEs associated with unprecedented

monetary policy accommodation in major currency areas, through both conventional and


14
   As an example, failure to close a private syndication due to the unravelling of the 2008 financial crisis led to a
roughly two-year delay in raising debt funding from multinationals for a construction project of the Egyptian Refinery
Corporation.

unconventional measures. Rajan (2014) postulates that emerging market countries wish for stable

global capital inflows instead of flows pushed in by foreign monetary policy and points that is

unlikely that local policy measures will be effective to counteract the global forces. But substantial

skepticism about whether a global macro-prudential approach to monetary policy is necessary still

remains among economists and monetary authorities (e.g., Bernanke 2013).

   In this paper, we provide evidence on the dominance of dollar-denominated credit in cross-

border lending. Outstanding shares of foreign banks’ dollar credit for African, American, and

Asian emerging economies are over 90 percent. Even for emerging Europe, this number is 60

percent. This point highlights the special role that U.S. monetary policy plays in the formation of

credit cycles in EMEs (and the limited role of the local monetary policy). We also show that the

availability of foreign bank credit to EME firms—by far the largest category of foreign capital

channeled through financial intermediaries into EMEs—is strongly connected to U.S. monetary

policy. This effect disproportionately affects EME borrowers as compared with borrowers in

developed markets. We estimate that, during a typical monetary easing cycle over which the Fed

cuts its target rate by about 4 percentage points, the increase in loan volumes to emerging market

borrowers exceeded the flow into developed markets by 32 percent. On the flip side, a monetary

policy tightening would pull out bank flows from emerging markets and lead to a strong

contraction of foreign credit in emerging markets. The granularity of the data allows us to control

for borrower time-invariant characteristics as well as for bank-quarter level effects in lending. We

show that the effect holds for non-U.S. banks, for banks with very small exposure to the United

States in their portfolio, for EME borrowers in the non-tradable industries, for borrowers in

countries with limited trade linkages to the United States, and overall—and only for U.S.-dollar-

denominated credit.

Fig. 4. Foreign credit supply response through the easing and tightening cycle of U.S. monetary policy.
The solid line represents the predicted log loan volumes differential of EME borrowers (relative to DME
borrowers) for the corresponding quarter of easing (panel (a)) and tightening (panel (b)) cycle of the U.S.
monetary policy. The estimated regression is a fractional polynomial where the optimal polynomial degree
is selected based on lowest deviance model (Stata default setting). The regression is estimated separately
for U.S. easing and tightening cycles and controls for bank*quarter and firm fixed effects. Dashed lines
represent 95 percent confidence bounds.

Notes: The table is based on syndicated cross-border loans issued from 1990:Q1 to 2016:Q3. Country groups are based on the BIS
classification. Offshore centers are excluded from the sample. We also exclude countries with only non-repeat borrowers and four
countries with missing trade data. Currency shares are based on loan counts. Trade is the average value of the sum of imports and
exports of goods as a percentage of GDP. U.S. Trade is the average value of traded goods (imports plus exports) with the United
States as a percentage of total traded goods. Data on trade and GDP are compiled from the IMF.

Notes: Country groups are based on the BIS classification. Offshore centers are excluded from the sample. Industry
classification is based on the 1-digit SIC code as reported in DealScan. Figures in Panel A are based on all loans issued
between 1990:Q1 and 2016:Q3 and reported in DealScan. In Panel B, we report figures computed from our DealScan
sample, and, for comparison, figures compiled from BIS data. DealScan tracks loan issuance; thus, statistics reported
in the first five columns of Panel B are based on the estimated volume of outstanding claims as of 2016:Q3. Note that
the BIS data include all outstanding cross-border claims held by banks (including equities and bonds).

 Notes: The dependent variable is the logarithm of the dollar loan amount originated by a bank j to a firm i in a quarter t. U.S. Interest
 Rate is the federal funds rate (in percent). U.S. Term Spread is the difference between the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the
 federal funds rate (in percentage points); that is, the slope of the yield curve. Shadow Rate is a single measure of monetary policy
 during the zero-lower bound period constructed by Wu and Xia (2016). EME is a dummy variable that equals one if the firm is
 located in an emerging market country (as defined by BIS), and zero otherwise. DME is a dummy that equals one if the borrower
 is located in a developed market country, and zero otherwise. The sample in Panel A, columns (1)–(4) and (7), and all columns in
 Panel B covers the period from1990:Q1 through 2016:Q3. Panel A, Columns (5) and (6) show the results when the federal funds
 rate is instrumented by 2- and 4-lags of monetary policy shocks as in Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) for the period from
 1992:Q1 through 2015:Q4; see text for details. The sample in Panel A, column (8) covers the pre-ZLB period from 1990:Q1 through
 2008:Q3. Panel A, column (9), shows that our main result holds during the period when the federal funds rate was at the zero lower
 bound (2008:Q4–2015:Q3). Panel B replicates the results in Panel A, column (7), while focusing on non-U.S. lenders and non-U.S.
 borrowers that are unlikely to be connected to the U.S. economy. Non-U.S. banks with low U.S. exposure are identified based on
 the number of loans to U.S. borrowers in the entire sample (relative to all loans). Column (3) contains only EME borrowers from
 the non-tradable sectors based on the SIC 1-digit classification as reported in DealScan. Column (4) contains only EME borrowers
 from sectors that produce goods and services with an export share below the 25th percentile (based on the distribution of export
 shares of all goods and services for each borrower country). Column (5) contains only loans to EME borrowers from countries with
 an average total trade-to-GDP share below the 25th percentile of the cross-country distribution (see Table 1). Column (6) contains
 only loans to EME borrowers from countries with the average U.S. trade share (relative to total trade) below the 25th percentile of
 the cross-country distribution (see Table 1). Bank-Country Macro Variables are as in Panel A and include inflation, GDP growth,
 and Consensus Economics 1-year ahead forecast of GDP growth in the lender’s home country. Robust t-statistics are in parentheses.
 Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level,
 respectively.

Notes: As in Table 3, the dependent variable is the logarithm of the dollar loan amount originated by a bank j to a firm i in a quarter
t. In Panel A, GDP Growth, Interest Rate Spread, Country Rating, and Equity Returns describe the home country of the borrower
and correspond to lagged values of GDP growth, the spread between the local EME interest rate and the U.S. federal funds rate,
stock-market index growth, and the sovereign debt rating (“AAA”=1, “AA+”=2, etc.). Growth rates are in percentage terms. (The
underlying sample changes from columns 1 through 4 due to data availability.) In Panel B, Loan Spread to Average Rate in
Country-Quarter is the loan spread (relative to 3M LIBOR rate) minus the average loan spread in the country of the borrower
during the same quarter. Loan Spread to Country Risk Premium is the loan spread (relative to 3M LIBOR rate) minus the historical
country           risk       premium          computed            and         maintained         by         Aswath            Damodaran
(http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/dataarchived.html). All other variables are as in Table 3. Robust t-

rate (in percentage points). U.S. Interest Rate is the federal funds rate (in percent). U.S. Term Spread is the difference between the
10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the federal funds rate (in percentage points). Columns (3) and (4) exclude U.S. banks and U.S.
borrowers from the sample. Column (4) includes only quarters where U.S. monetary policy was easing and ECB monetary policy
was tightening (or vice versa). Column (5) looks at euro-denominated loans by U.S. firms to non-EU borrowers. The sample covers
the period from 1999:Q1 (introduction of the euro) until 2016:Q3. All other variables are as in Table 3. Robust t-statistics are in
parentheses. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and
10% level, respectively.

 Notes: Log(Borrowing Amount) is the logarithm of the total dollar borrowing (in billion) at the firm-quarter level. Interest Rate
 Spread is the average all-in-drawn spread to the 3M LIBOR rate (in bps) of all dollar loans the borrower received in a given month.
 Probability of Refinancing is a dummy variable equal to one if an EME firm obtains a new loan in the quarter when an earlier loan
 matures and zero otherwise. In Panel B, Past Foreign Bank Reliance is the share of global banks’ lending to the firm in the last
 quarter the firm was borrowing. All other variables are as in Table 3. In both panels, the sample period covers 1990:Q1 through

Notes: In this table we replicate the baseline result in Table 3, column (4) for borrowers from different regions and industries; that
is, each coefficient reported in this table corresponds to the same regression estimated based on different subsamples. U.S. Interest
Rate is the federal funds rate. EME is a dummy variable that equals one if the firm is located in the corresponding emerging market
region (as defined by BIS), and zero otherwise. Offshore centers are excluded from the sample. Industry classification is based on
the 1-digit SIC code as reported in DealScan. The sample covers the period from 1990:Q1 through 2016:Q3. Robust t-statistics are
in parentheses. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and
10% level, respectively.




The result is economically and statistically weaker only for Latin America (the point estimate is
about two-thirds of the estimated average effect). This is in line with Takáts (2010), who points
out that, unlike in other EMEs, the expansion of international banks in Latin America mainly took
the form of increased domestic currency lending by local affiliates, making cross-border bank
lending relatively less important for these regions.

Notes: The purpose of this table is to confirm the robustness of the main result in Table 3, using data on all forms of bank claims on firms (and not just syndicated credit). This sample
also covers a larger set of countries. These data are collected from the BIS Consolidated Banking Statistics. The dependent variable is the logarithm of the claim amount held by a
developed market banking sector on a given country in a given quarter. U.S. Interest Rate is the federal funds rate (in percent). U.S. Term Spread is the difference between the 10-
year U.S. Treasury yield and the federal funds rate (in percentage points). EME is a dummy variable that equals one if the firm is located in an emerging market country (as defined
by BIS), and zero otherwise. DME is a dummy that equals one if the borrower is located in a developed market country, and zero otherwise. The sample covers the period from
2005:Q1 through 2016:Q3, which is the period for which the data are publically available. Robust t-statistics are in parentheses. The estimate of the constant is not shown. Standard
errors are clustered at the quarter level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Note: The dependent variable is the logarithm of the dollar loan amount originated by a given bank to a given firm in a given quarter. U.S. Interest Rate is the federal funds rate (in
percent). EME is a dummy variable that equals one if the firm is located in an emerging market country (as defined by BIS), and zero otherwise. The sample covers loans by developed
countries banks during the period from 1990:Q1 through 2016:Q3. We use different methods to identify infrastructure-related projects, including the maturity of the loan and sector
of the borrower. In columns (3) and (4), we restrict the sample to infrastructure-related projects as classified in World Bank (2016). In columns (5)–(7) we look at corporate loans to
borrowers from infrastructure-relevant sectors, based on the classifications by the World Bank (2016) and the BIS (Ehlers 2014). Columns (9) and (10) focus on corporate loans with
maturity longer than 5 years, given that infrastructure-related credit is typically of long maturity. Given that the structure of the investment where the assets of the sponsor are ring-
fenced and repeated projects by the same sponsor are rare, we do not include borrower fixed effects in Columns (1)–(4). Robust t-statistics are in parentheses. Standard errors are
clustered at the quarter level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
