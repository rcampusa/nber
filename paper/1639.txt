                A Vintage Model of Supply
             Applied to French Manufacturing



                          ABSTRACT


     In Kouri, Macedo and Viscio (1982), we applied a vintage model of

supply to data from the French manufacturing sector. The model was,

however, solved with a particular parametrization (Cobb Douglas produc-

tion function and a quadratic adjustment function). Also, no fixed

factors were allowed for in the theoretical treatment, even though fixed

labor was found to be significant in the application to France. The

treatment of technological progress was equally restrictive.

     Here we solve in Section I the general case of N variable factors

and N fixed factors with embodied and disembodied technological progress.

It turns out to be simpler than the combination of a Cobb-Douglas produc-

tion function with a quadratic adjustment function, thus suggesting a

manageable framework for the analysis of profitability and employment in

industrial countries. The model is simulated in Section II using previ-

ously unavailable data on a subsector of French manufacturing froci 1959

to 1980. The empirical results confirm the importance of vintage

effects.

Introduction



     Prior to 1973, stability in prices and expanding demand masked the

difference among production techniques and the way in which these differ-

ences were related to economic performance. Following the energy price

shock, though, a period of sharp inflation and prolonged recession

clearly highlighted the importance of vintage differences.

     A key element of the vintage approach is the time path of invest-

ment. Firms construct plants with long useful lives when measured on an

engineering basis but only those plants which can operate profitably will

be used. Unexpected increases in factor prices can lead to economic

obsolescence if existing efficiencies of inputs such as labor and energy

cease to be appropriate at the new prices. Plant closings are the final

recognition of this obsolescence. The severity of the plant closings in

the 1970's can be explained in this manner.

     Reported utilization rates in many industries are currently over-

stating the present level of unused capacity. The issue is not just

measuring excess capacity, but identifying usable capacity. Thus, in

many industrial countries, the smokestack industries have been plagued

with idle capacity. Nevertheless, investment is required to maintain

usable capacity. The profitability of an investment can be seen most

easily in countries not. burdened with old technology that lowers the

average rate of return. Both Korea and Japan have been very successful

competing in world markets by applying modern, efficient production

techniques in   smokestack   industries.

     The steel industry provides a good example of the importance of

vintage differences: between 1974 and 1978, eighteen percent of the
blast fucnaces in        the   United States have been scrapped. Producing steel
iii   a   blast furnace requires over twenty-six million btu's of energy per
ton       of output, almost three times more than the mini mills which use

electric arc furnaces and continuous casting. The intermediate input

requirement is also different because electric arc furnaces use scrap

steel as a feed stock while blast furnaces are traditional smelters. The

advantage of the newer mini mills goes beyond energy and materials and

translates into a large difference in profitability. Capital costs for a

blast furnace process are about $2000 per ton per year of capacity,

almost seven times higher than the corresponding figure for a mini mill.

Although asset size is not an exact representation of the production

process, it is indicative of the profitability of the newer technology:

in 1982 US steel firms with less than $25 million assets had a profit of

$30 million while firms over $25 million registered losses of over $800

million.

          Electric utilities in the US provide another example of how vintage

cost curves affect production. The first, and unexpected, decline in

electricity demand took place in 1982. There is a long lead time for

planning and construction of new generating capacity, so that new plants

are continuing to come on stream despite the slower growth of demand in

the past few years. The distribution of plant utilization clearly showed

the expensive plants--in this case oil-fired generators--are

underutilized while coal-fired plants are still being built. One New

England utility ran an oil-fired plant at two percent capacity, using it

for peak-loading only. Currently, about ten percent of the oil-fired

capacity       on the   East Coast is planned to be converted to coal.   Past   fuel
choice is a major determinant of current operating costs and these costs

determine utilization rates.

     Other industries are heavily investing ira predominantly cost savings

rather than in increasing output capacity. Almost all recent investment

in the US paper and pulp industry has been to reduce labor and energy

costs. Very little new capacity has been created. Current capacity

utilization rates reported for this industry are over 98 percent. Partly

as a result of this shift in investment, the profitability of the indus-

try has completely turned around from its trough.

     The performance of industry has shown that adjustment of production

techniques to changing condition is slow. Improved efficiency is made at

the margin, as new facilities are built. Old capacity can be a hindrance

to new investment. International competition favors those newly indus-

trializing countries where the most appropriate technology can be de-

ployed. Since the most profitable plants will be utilized more

intensively, the decline of profitability in the industrialized West and

newly emerging patterns of international trade can also be explained by

difference in vintage characteristics. Indeed, foreign direct investment

is attracted to countries and sectors with a low rate of return on old

capital but a high rate of return on new capital. Strategic considera-

tions relating to trade policy notwithstanding, substantial Japanese

investment in the US auto industry in recent years can be explained along

these lines. The implication is that the traditional measures of return

to capital which equates the productivity of old and new capital may be

seriously misleading in the prediction of international capital flows.

     Even though the international repercussions of vintage differences

are an important issue for future research, it can be agreed that, in the
words of Fabbri (1984) foreign penetration forces "a portion of business'

net investment to be siphoned into 'slenderizing' existing plant."

     This view, which has been used in recent analytical work by

Nalinvaud (1983), also underlies the model of Faini and Schiantarelli

(1984), tested using data for the Italian industrial sector. Earlier

contributions to this way of thinking can be found in Kouri, Macedo and

Viscio (1982), where a vintage model of supply is applied to the French

manufacturing sector. The model is, however, solved with a particular

parametrization and no fixed factors were allowed for in the theoretical

treatment, even though fixed labor was found to be significant in the

application to France. The treatment of technological progress is also

restrictive.

     We now solve the general case of N variable factors and N fixed

factors with embodied and disembodied technological progress in Section I

and simulate the model using previously unavailable data on a subsector

of French manufacturing from 1959 to 1980 in Section II. While many of

the considerations mentioned above are not yet fully reflected in the

model presented here, they do provide a motivation for the approach.

Moreover, they are intended to outline a research agenda.


I The Model


     Think of an industry as a collection of plants, characterized by

their capacity, unit input requirements, and flexibility (ratio of fixed

to variable costs). These characteristics are chosen at the time of

construction, and they cannot be changed ex post. Plant characteristics

do, however,   vary over the life   span of the plant because of depreciaâ€”

tion, learning by doing, and disembodied technological progress.
     Time is divided into discrete production periods, during which the
stock of   capital remains fixed. The   flow   of capital services during the

period is the product of the stock of capital at the beginning of the

period and the time of its active use, or the rate of utilization. The

level of employment is similarly fixed during the production period,

while labor input can vary.

     Once a plant has been constructed, there are two levels of choice:

firstly, whether or not the plant should be operated, shut down temporar-

ily, or permanently scrapped; and secondly, if it is operated, what the

rate of utilization of capacity should be. We assume that there is a

maximum capacity ex post, and that output increases at a diminishing rate

as that maximum is approached. The actual rate of utilization is deter-

mined by short run profit maximization.

     We assume that the capacity of the plant, and the technology coeffi-

cients, are chosen at the time of construction so as to maximize the

present discounted value of profits over the lifetime of the plant.

Factor prices as well as the price of output are exogenously given to the

firm. Total investment is also given exogenously in each period, and the

decision is on how it is allocated between capacity creation, labor

saving, energy saving, and so forth. This decision determines dynamic

supply and factor demand schedules, which are functions of the time path

of investment, and of output prices and factor costs, both actual and

expected at the time of construction, We sketch in the conclusion a

procedure to make investment endogenous.

     In general, there is no simple production function representation of

the supply side, nor can the economy be described in terms of a represen-

tative plant. Plants of different vintage differ because of changes in
                                                   - () -




prices    and costs, and because of embodied technological progress. The

model is able to characterize these differences in a manageable way, and

also capable of assessing their quantitative significance.

        The model is first derived for the case of N variable factors and

compared to the standard putty-putty model. Fixed factors are introduced

next.


1.      N variable factors


        Consider a single plant built in period i with an initial investment

I.. Output during the production period t, X., is given by:

                       =    k
(1)
                                      4(u..t) hi


where        u.        =   the rate of utilization
              1   ,t
             y.        =   the output-capital ratio chosen at the time of
                           construction

                           a productivity coefficient capturing the effects of

                           depreciation, learning by doing and technological

                           progress

        The only inputs in the production process are variable factors.

Factor j input requirement in production period t,                          is given by:



(2)
                            a j                                 = 1,   ..   N

where        a input j-capital ratio chosen at the time of construction


                       =   productiviLy    coefficient capturing the effect of

                           depreciation, Jearning by doing and technological

                     progress on input            j
        To reduce the number of the parameters, we assume that the produc-

tivity of a given plant is a function of time (disembodied technological

progress), year of construction (embodied technological progress), and
                                                                             .3

age (learning by doing and depreciation). Then                         and        are
products of three parameters:


(1
                    k         =    lk2k
                                      q.      Ã´(t -   i)

                              = 1
                                     2 '
(2?)                                q       q Ã´(t-i)


where
             1k          1
                   and q measure disembodied technological progress,


            2k
             q. and q.
                         2a         measure embodied technological progress;


and         Ã´(t -   i)       measures the effect of age (learning and

            depreciation).

       The first term applies to all vintages equally; the last two terms

are a source of difference between vintages.

       Variable costs and profits (in units of output) add up to the value

of output each period:


                   =vc.
(3)         x.
             i,t             i,t +ri.i,t

                                    Zi,t wi,t
                                        .


where       VC.     =
                             j=1


                     the price of input j               in units of output
and         Fl = profits
                      in units                   of output

       Finally, technology is defined by:
                               1       2                      N
4)           y. =     F(a.,        a., ..., a., 1)


where        F({a.},1) is a standard neoclassical production function, with

             marginal products defined as F. and Fk.

        A useful benchmark is provided by the case where y. and a can be

chosen every production period: technology is putty-putty. Then, sub-

stituting from equations (1) and (2) into (4) we express output as: ;

                                       j (u.)                       k
(5)
                                                                                )
where
                 j    =
                                           j
                                                       captures the effect of j factor-augmenting

             technological progress

        Substituting (5) in (3) and maximizing profits, we find that the

rate of utilization should be chosen every period so as to maximize

output. This optimally chosen rate of utilization,                                   which can be

called the normal rate, satisfies:


             u'i,t)                    â€”
                                                   VC.
                                                        i,t
                      *                            U
             l-.(u.                                    i,t




where        c is the elasticity of the capacity utilization function

             assumed to have a unique maximum, U.

        As an example, consider the following parametrization:

                           N       .a.
(7)         y.             UI (a')
                       j=1
                     N
where                              =   I       -

                     j=1
(8)
            (u)      =
                                 uj)
       Then (6) implies that the optimal rate of capacity utilization is

constant and given by equation (21) in Kouri, Macedo and Viscio (1982),

reproduced below:


                    2o-
                   irO u.
(9)         u. =
             1


       Except for the Cobb-Douglas case, u. is a function of the capital

intensity of production and therefore of factor prices and technology

coefficients.

       In the putty-putty case, the plant is always operated at the normal

rate. We can therefore solve u5 out of equation (5) to obtain a

conventional production function:



(10)
                     G({q               I.)


       Thus the concepts of capacity and capacity utilization play no role

in a putty-putty model of production. Equation (10) shows that there is

no maximum capacity. Output can always be increased by employing more

labor. Similarly, there is no role for expected future factor prices.

       In contrast, with putty-clay technology, expectations about the

future become important in determining the optimal choice of technology

since decisions made at the time of construction cannot be revised. We

denote by a and y. the technology coefficients chosen in period i for

a plant of vintage i. The expected time path of the product wage is

denoted by fw} and that of the productivity coefficients by

         and {qj. Given expectations, the firm chooses a and y.      so    as
                                          - 10-



to maximize the expected present discounted value of profits over the

planned    lifetime of the plant:
                               T
(11)               = max               (1 +


where        fl1, =   Ec1,
                           k
                                   (u) -
                                               Nj a'    j       j
                                                        a u1 wÂ±t}
                                                  j=1

             is the expected profit in period t

and          R1t is the appropriate t-period market rate of capitalization

             prevailing in period i.

        The maximization problem in (11) is subject to the technology

constaint given by (4). The choice variables are a? and y.. In

addition, the optimal solution implies optimal planned rates of utiliza-

tion, denoted by               for each period. These are conditional on

expectations prevailing in period i. The utilization rate must obviously

be non-negative: this is an additional constraint of the maximization

problem.

        The optimal plan must satisfy the following first-order conditions:



                                   =
                                       j!l a

        These   equations may not have a positive       solution for       in some

periods when the   unit factor cost is very high. In           that case, the

optimal    policy is to set u. equal to zero. Since            there   are no fixed
costs, the plant is never shut down permanently except when                  is

nonpositive for all t after some period T. The planned life span of the

plant is therefore such that fl1, is nonnegative for all t greater than

T..

                                                                     have no closed

form representation. Using the parametrization in (7) a.nd (8) above with

labor and energy as variable factors, Kouri, Macedo and ViscIo (1982)

present an explicit solution for the case of static expectations as well

as for the case where there are no expected changes in relative factor

prices. Macedo (1983) presents an explicit solution for the case where

relative factor prices are expected to vary.

         Once the plant has been constructed, the only flexibility is the

choice of the rate of utilization. For a plant of vintage i the actual

rate of utilization in period t, u1 is determined by:
                                            -.12




 (17)
                  q '(u.1)                         a          w
                                        (u.) -            a           w] i > 0
                                                   j1
or                U.

                            â€”
                     :L,t




        Comparing equations (17) and (12), it is seen that the actual rate

of utilization is equal to the planned cx ante rate of utilization,

                                                                  3
u.k, only if expectations concerning                     and cl turn out to

be correct. Indeed, the only difference is that (17) is expressed in

terms of realized productivitIes and input costs rather than in terms of

their expected values (denoted by a tilde over the variable).

        It is convenient to write the rate of utilization as a function of

the ratio of technology coefficients and effective unit input costs:



(18) u = max                 {p[a/y.) w/q3], 0}

where        a and          are determined by equations (14) and (15).


        The aggregate supply function can now be written by summing over

plants of all vintages in operation, to yield:

                     t
(19)        X =          q       1   u.1,   I.,
                                             1


where             is determined by (18)

               is determined by (15)

and         Tt is the year of construction of the oldest plant still in

             operation in period t.
        The aggregate input demand functions are similarly obtained by
summation across vintages. They are given by:


            Zt = E
                   t      J a u.
                         qi,t

                              1 i,t 1
                  i=Tt
and         u by equation (18)

where       a' is determined by equation (14)


2. Fixed Factors and Economic Obsolescence


       When all costs, apart from sunk capital costs, are variable, there

is never any reason for plants to be shut down since it does not cost

anything to keep them alive. The situation changes when it is costly to

keep a plant alive. To integrate this feature into the model, denote the

N fixed factors by Z3 and their prices by w3. The associated

                                                                   â€”J
productivity    coefficients are denoted by a3 and qa                       By their very
nature, fixed input requirements do not change over the lifetime of the

plant. They are proportional to initial investment:



(21)
                                   Ii
                                                          for i   = 1,   ...,


       The rest of the model remain.s basically unchanged, but now the firm

has one more choice with respect to a plant already built (with given y.,

   and a). The choices are: (a) to produce, (b) not to produce but

still keep the plant alive; and (c) to shut the plant down.

        If the plant continues to produce, the rate of utilization is chosen

so as to maximize X.
                         i,t
                               -    VC.
                                        i,t   .   The relevant first-order condition is
                                                          -14-




exactly the same as before and given by equation (12) above. We denote

the rate of profit associated to this choice by


                        =   x.          vc.
(22)
                 i,t         i,t    -
                                             L,t
                                                   -   FC.
                                                           i,t
where       FCIt =
                            .                      , fixed       cost of keeping plant in operation


       The second choice is not to produce, but still keep the plant alive.

The rate of loss                    is then:
                             i,t

(23)                    =   - FC.
                                   i,t

The second choice dominates the first if X.                                 -

                                                  1
                                                               i,t is negative.
                                                                      i,t
                                                                                VC.
                                                                                 2
       We denote by 11.
                       i,t                          i,t and 11.i,t
                                    the maximum of H.


(24)                   = max


       The third alternative is to shut the plant down. This is optimal if

V is negative where V. is given by:



             i,t       = max
                                 Ti,t                      R.
                                                             i,T )t
(25)        V.                          H.         (1 +
                          T


       We can now give a complete characterization of the supply side as

far as existing plants are concerned:


        (1) Compute                                          and                for all plants still in

            operation. From these compute V.
        (2) Shut down all plants for which                                  is negative.

        (3) If V1 is positive there are two choices:

            (i)        If               is greater than                         set production, equal to

                       zero.
             (ii)            1.
                    if 1tit is greater than
                                                                  2.       the   rate   of utilization is

                    determined by equation (17) above.


        Total output is then simply the Sum of outputs of all active plants.

The total demands for variable inputs are the sums of input requirements

of all active plants. Finally, the total demands for variable inputs are

the sums of fixed input requirements of all plants that are alive.

        The problem of technology choice at the time of construction also

changes when there are fixed factors. Technology is now defined by:


(4')                           F(a, , 1),
where               F(        ) is a standard        neoclassical production function.


       When technology is putty-putty, adapting the notation in (5), output

is expressed as:



(5')                =
                             F[      j    4(u.)         .              j
                                                                                    Z1J};q1
                                                                                             k
                                                                                                  (u1)I]

       As before, the normal rate of utilization is obtained from (5') by

maximizing              with respect to u1. It satisfies an equation like (6)

above, but allowing for fixed costs:



                         c    (u. i,t )              VC.
                                                            i,t
'6'"
"                                          â€”
                                               fl.          +FC.
                    1    â€”
                              c(u.                i,t             i,t

       In   the case of putty-clay technology, the coefficients y., a3, a' as

well as the planned lifetime T. . and the planned rates of utilization

       are chosen so as to maximize the present discounted value of

expected profits as given by (11) above.
                                                               -I



       We nov' solve this problem in two stages. First we solve:

                                                         1,1                                  ..t

                                                                   i,t   (1 + R.

       Then we choose T.                 .    so as to maximize V.

They also imply an optimal time path for                                             as in (16) above. The

final step is to iterate on T.                                to

The associated values of y., a and a' are the optimal choices of

technology at the time of construction.

the French intermediate goods manufacturing sector (branch U04). The

purpose of this exercise is to study the behavior of the mode1 and to
                                  17-


measure its ability to replicate the   historical   evolution of output arid

factor demands in a particular subsector of French manufacturing.

     The basic series are reported in the Data Appendix. The data on

output, materials and energy consumption are expressed in billions of

1970 francs, series (1) through (3) in the Appendix. The series for

labor was obtained as follows. First, by multiplying employment by

average hours worked in the subsector and the number of weeks in one

year, we obtain series (4) in the Appendix, expressed in billions of

man-hours per year. We then use total labor compensation in the

subsector (wages, employees' social security contributions and fringe

benefits) for the base year 1970 and divide it by the man-hours series to

obtain the wage rate in the year. The adjustment coefficient comes out

to 10.37 francs per man-hour.

     In the simulation, a number of assumptions need to be made. concern-

ing expectations about productivity and factor prices in units of output.

These are listed in Table 1. As mentioned by Nairesse and Dormont

(1985), at this level of disaggregation nominal prices of factors in

manufacturing probably introduce a bias in the results. In part as a

consequence, they are inclined to neglect their importance. These

difficulties notwithstanding, we interpret our results as supporting a

view where both expected and actual factor prices play a crucial role, as

emphasized in Macedo (1985).

     The prices of output, materials and energy are reported in the Data

Appendix, series (6) through 8, while series (9) therein reports the

wage in units of output. By multiplying this series by series (6), it is

easy to see that labor comuensation increases by more than energy,

reaching 400 in 1980 from the base 100 in 1970. This implies a growth

rate of about 5% p.a. for the product wage. Note that this is the

expectations assumption of Table 1 for the period 1974-1980.

       Aggregate values for output, employment, energy consumption, and

intermediate goods consumption g.enerated by the model (denoted by S)

are obtained by summing across vintages in each year. These values

differ from historical data (denoted by A.) by a scale parameter f3..

The model's simulated values are then regressed against actual values, as

a four-equation system, after allowing for first-order autocorrelation in

the error term:

(29)        S.
             i,t
                   =   . 1A.i,t   + v.
                                     i,t

where       V.     =   p.1 V.i,tâ€”1   + p.
             i,t                        i,t

       The estimated values of .             andp.   are reported in Table 2. The

coefficient of autocorrelation is particularly high in the energy equa-

tion, where the standard error is also highest. The employment equation,

on the other hand, shows no autocorrelation.

       From the simulated values thus obtained, a dynamic simulation

(denoted by DSÂ±) is run using 1959 actual values as a base and

adjusting the values as:

       The dynamic simulations are reported in the Data Appendix, series

(10) through (12). A plot of the fitted versus actual values (Graphs 1

through 3) shows that the model is able to capture the evolution of

output and factor demands. Note that the fitted output series is off in

the first year but it follows the actual series consistently. The graph

of intermediate inputs is not shown because it replicates almost exactly

the   one for output: series (6) and (7) in the Data Appendix show how

close    prices ere during the sample period. This implies that working

with value-added is a good approximation, as argued in Kouri, Flacedo and

Viscio (1982, note 12).

      The putty-clay aspect of the model can be seen in the changes in the

technology parameters in Table 3. The evolution of a and by shows that,

when factor prices are increasing, firms will economize by increasing the

efficiency of that factor. In response to a 50% increase in wages, the

labor-capital ratio declined by about 20% from 1970 to 1980. Note that

the unit    requirement   for intermediate materials increases over this

period. The increase in materials cost combined with embodied techno-

logical progress (which decreases wage costs) accounts for the relative

stability in the coefficient of output, y.

      Both utilization and profits (operating surplus) decline over time

in each vintage, see table 4. From 1959 to 1980, for example, the profit

of that vintage falls to one-half of its initial value, while utilization

falls to one-fourth. The decline in profitability due to age of a

vintage is caused by two factors: the physical depreciation of the

initial investment which reduces output, but not fixed costs; and factors

costs rising above expectation, which lowers utilization rates. This is

clear after 1974, where utilization in 1980 is lower than for the 1973

vintage, and the profit rate is higher.

      Neasures of profitability are reported in Table 5. The return on

sales (or rate of profit) and the return on assets. The latter is

computed as aggregate operating surplus divided by aggregate capital

stock.    A downward drift in rates   of return is evident. The decline is

due to costs increasing faster than revenues. The lower initial

utilization   places the firm on a lower portion of the marginal cost

curve, but profitability is still not fully recovered. Note that the

profit of a 1980 vintage is 23%, whereas the average rate is only 18%.

     The shift in labor demand can be seen in Chart 4 where the demand

for labor in 1973 and in 1980 is aggregated across vintages. Both demand

curves are almost coincident despite the larger capacity in 1980.

However, recall from table 3 that the coefficient of labor has been

declining considerably since 1973. The shift in the demand for labor can

also be seen by comparing employment of 36 billion francs (at the base

wage of unit in 1970) for a real wage of 120 in 1973 and 32 billion

francs for a real wage of 160 in 198Q (see Appendix Table 1).

     The shift in output supply curves reported in Chart 5 shows less

elasticity in 1973 than in 1979. Noreover, despite greater capacity,

higher cost shifted the supply curve sharply to the left between the two

years. From a supply of 172 billion francs at a price of 110 in 1973, we

go to a supply of 200 billion francs at a price of 220 in 1979 (see

Appendix Table 2).


Conclusion


     The vintage model of supply is able to address issues of profitabil-

iLy and factor demands from the perspective of profit maximization of the

firm. Despite the uncertainty as to the appropriate values for expecta-

tions and technological progress, the model was able to roughly capture

the behavior of a subsector of manufacturing in France. This may be an

indication that severe measurement problems need not obscure the rele-

vance of factor prices in explaining the decline of employment and

profitability in French manufacturing during the seventies.

       We   have argued in this paper that the differentiation between old

and new capital by profitability is essential in assessing the "surplus'

capacity in many of the industrialized countries. The premature obso-

lescence of old capital by rising factor costs has both hindered the

productive capacity and improved the profit potential for new investment

relative to the average rate of return across vintages. Moreover, higher

factor costs require a propor-tionately greater amount of gross invest-

ment to yield an equivalent output capacity as cost savings investment
increases.
       The results are, nevertheless, quite tentative and oniy purport to

illustrate the workings of the model. Aside from a more satisfactory

treatment of demand, along the lines of Malinvaud (1983) for example.,

further work remains to be done in parametrizing individual countries and

industries.

       In   addition, the question of whether a plant should be built in the

first place must be answered. We merely sketch the argument here.

Associated with each investment program inherited from the past, there is

an investment plan for the future which, given the price of investment

goods, determines the expected supply curves. By netting out the invest-

ment cost from the gross value of the firm, one obtains a sequence of

expected net values of the firm. The rule is then to increase investment

until the ratio of net value to its replacement cost (marginal q) is

greater than one. This in turn determines investment and depreciation in

each period.
