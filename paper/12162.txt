                                           ABSTRACT

In the late nineteenth century, the United States imposed high tariffs to protect domestic
manufacturers from foreign competition. This paper examines the magnitude of protection given to
import-competing producers and the costs imposed on export-oriented producers by focusing on
changes in the domestic prices of traded goods relative to non-traded goods. Because the tariffs
tended to increase the prices of non-traded goods, the degree of protection was much less than
indicated by nominal rates of protection; the results here suggest that the 30 percent average tariff
on imports yielded a 15 percent implicit subsidy to import-competing producers while effectively
taxing exporters at a rate of 11 percent. The paper also finds that tariff policy redistributed large
amounts of income (about 9 percent of GDP) across groups, although the impact on consumers was
only slightly negative because they devoted a sizeable share of their expenditures to exportable
goods. These findings may explain why import-competing producers pressed for even greater
protection in the face of already high tariffs and why consumers (as voters) did not strongly oppose
the policy.

1. Introduction

       One of the most controversial aspects of U.S. economic policy in the decades after the

Civil War was the use of high import tariffs to provide trade protection for domestic

manufacturers. For most of the nineteenth century, U.S. foreign trade consisted largely of

exports of raw materials and food (cotton and tobacco from the South and wheat and corn from

the Midwest) in exchange for imports of manufactured goods. After the Civil War, the United

States maintained high import duties to insulate domestic industries (located mainly in the North)

from foreign competition.

       This protectionist policy was a contentious issue in national politics during the Gilded

Age of the 1880s. Tariff advocates claimed that high import duties helped labor by expanding

industrial employment and keeping wages high, while also aiding farmers by creating a steady

demand in the home market for the food and raw materials that they produced. Tariff critics

charged that those import duties raised the cost of living for consumers and harmed agricultural

producers by effectively taxing their exports, thus redistributing income from consumers and

farmers to benefit big businesses and capital-owners in the North.1

       Despite this controversy, and the fact that import tariffs were among the most important

government policies of the period, little research has been devoted to the overall economic

consequences of late nineteenth century trade protection.2 Many questions about the economic

                                                 -2-

impact of high tariffs remain unanswered, perhaps the most important being that of tariff

incidence: how much did import-competing producers benefit from protectionist policies and

who paid the price? Standard indicators of trade policy fall short of addressing this issue.

Nominal rates of protection reveal nothing about the distributive effects of the tariff because its

incidence can be shifted onto other sectors of the economy. And effective rates of protection do

not necessarily indicate the magnitude (or even the direction) of the underlying incentive to shift

resources into import-competing industries.

       This paper explores the incidence of U.S. tariff policy in the late nineteenth century by

focusing on how the policy changed the domestic prices of traded goods relative to non-traded

goods. A tariff increases the domestic price of importable goods relative to exportable goods, but

this positive effect for import-competing industries is often mitigated by a tariff-induced increase

in the price of non-tradeable goods. The rise in the price of non-traded goods also reduced the

relative price of exportables, to the detriment of that sector. Because of these effects, according

the results reported below, the average 30 percent U.S. tariff on imports during the 1880s yielded

just a 15 percent implicit subsidy to domestic import-competing producers and amounted to a 11

percent effective tax on exports. The tariff also redistributed a large share of national income

(about 9 percent of GDP) among various affected groups, but the impact on consumers was only

slightly negative because of the large share of exported products (particularly food) in consumer

expenditures.

       These findings help resolve several puzzles about late nineteenth century U.S. trade

policy. First, the results explain why domestic manufacturers pressed for ever higher duties, even


but few papers focus on the economy-wide impact of the policy.
                                                 -3-

though nominal tariff rates were already very high. The reason could be that the effective

subsidy to them was much smaller than suggested by nominal rates of protection. Second, the

results confirm that tariffs were a highly charged political issue for good reason: they

redistributed large amounts of income between various groups. In particular, the burden of high

tariffs fell to some extent on producers of agricultural exports, which helps account for the

opposition of farmers to the existing levels of import taxation. Third, the fact that the

protectionist policy was just slightly harmful to consumers helps explain why many voters were

not strongly opposed to the policy.

       Section 2 of the paper sets out the economic framework that underlies the concept of

“net” protection as contrasted with the more familiar concepts of nominal and effective rates of

protection. Section 3 examines the empirical relationship between the prices of traded and non-

traded goods to determine the degree of protection (positive or negative) given to different

sectors of the economy. The results also reveal the income transfers between various groups

(consumers, exporters, import-competing producers, etc.) for the mid-1880s. Section 4 applies

this framework to the antebellum period to provide a contrast with the results from the late

nineteenth century and to compare the results to other studies of the pre-Civil War period, such

as Harley (1992). Section 5 concludes by discussing how these findings improve our

understanding of U.S. trade policy during this period.



2. Assessing the Degree of Trade Protection

       The degree to which an import-competing sector of the economy is protected from

foreign competition is a deceptively complex question. The first step in addressing this question
                                                  -4-

is to examine nominal rates of protection. In the late nineteenth century, import tariffs were the

sole form of U.S. trade intervention (subsidies and quotas were not employed until later in the

twentieth century). The nominal rates of protection are the rates of duty in the import tariffs as as

set by Congress.

        Table 1 shows the average import tariffs with respect to the major import-competing

sectors of the economy for 1885. Because the United States was a net exporter of agricultural

goods and a net importer of manufactured goods, tariffs were imposed mainly on imported

manufactured goods and consumption items. The average tariff on dutiable imports was about

40 to 45 percent and, because most tariff rates were very stable over this period, this is true of the

entire period from 1870 to 1913. The distinction between dutiable and non-dutiable imports is

important because about one-third of U.S. imports during this time entered the country duty-free,

largely because they were products that did not compete with domestic producers, such as coffee

and tea, raw silk and certain hides, India rubber, and tropical fruits such as bananas. The average

tariff on total imports (dutiable and duty-free) was about 30 percent through the 1880s (U.S.

Bureau of the Census 1975, series U211-212).

        Nominal rates of protection do not necessarily indicate the actual degree of protection

given to domestic producers. One problem with nominal rates is that they ignore the structure of

protection across industries. The effective rate of protection, defined as the percentage change in

value added in an activity as a result of the tariff structure, takes into account the impact of tariffs

on intermediate and final goods in determining the degree to which producers of final goods are

protected (Corden 1971). Low tariffs on intermediate goods combined with high tariffs on final

goods can result in very high effective rates of protection for final goods.
                                                 -5-

        This tendency is evident in the late nineteenth century U.S. tariff code. As Table 1

indicates, tariffs on unprocessed raw materials (such as flax and wool) were set lower than duties

on final manufactured goods. For example, the duty on unmanufactured wool was about 33

percent, while the duty on manufactured wool products was about 67 percent. According to

Hawke’s (1975) calculations, the effective rate of protection given to domestic wool

manufacturers was 229 percent in 1889. Indeed, his study confirms that, for most U.S. industries

during this period, the escalation of the tariff with the level of processing led to much higher

effective rates of protection than indicated by the nominal rate of protection. However, a critical

shortcoming of the effective rate of protection is that it does not necessarily reflect the magnitude

(or even the direction) of the underlying incentive to shift resources into import-competing

industries.3

        A third measure of protection takes the price of non-traded goods as a numeraire against

which one can determine the degree of assistance given to import-competing producers and the

size of the burden placed upon export-oriented producers. The “net” or “true” rate of protection

is defined as the proportionate change in the domestic price of importables relative to non-

tradeable goods.4 Taking McDougall’s (1966) and Dornbusch’s (1974) work on tariffs and

non-traded goods as a point of departure, this approach focuses on how a tariff leads to excess

demand for non-traded goods, resulting in an increase in their price and an appreciation of the


        3
         This is a general conclusion from numerous studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

        4
          Corden (1971, pp. 106ff) calls this measure “net” protection while Clement and
Sjaastad (1984) call it “true” protection. See Greenaway and Milner (1993) for a fuller
discussion of the concept, which is often examined in the context of developing countries but has
yet to be applied to the United States.
                                                  -6-

real exchange rate (a decline in the price of traded relative to non-traded goods) as part of the

international adjustment mechanism.

        To illustrate the concept, consider a small open economy that produces exportables,

importables, and non-traded goods. The prices of the traded goods are determined on the world

market (the terms of trade), but the prices of the non-traded goods depend on domestic supply

and demand. (Thus, there are three relative prices, the terms of trade and the prices of

exportables and importables in terms of the non-tradeables.) The imposition of an import tariff

raises the domestic price of importables relative to exportables and, initially, relative to

non-traded goods as well. This higher price shifts resources into the production of importables

and out of the production of exportables and non-tradeables. It also shifts demand away from

importables toward exportables and non-traded goods. The increased demand for and reduced

supply of non-traded goods increases the price of non-traded goods in terms of exported goods

and mitigates the increase in price of importables relative to non-traded goods.

        These price changes are a necessary part of the international adjustment mechanism. An

increase in the tariff reduces imports, leading to an incipient balance of trade surplus and excess

demand for non-tradeables. An appreciation of the real exchange rate (that is, an increase in the

relative price of non-traded to traded goods) is required to restore balanced trade and eliminate

the excess demand. Because of the higher price of non-tradeables, the magnitude of protection

given to domestic producers of import-competing goods is less than that indicated by the nominal

tariff rate. In addition, producers of exportables face a decline in their price relative to that of

non-tradeables.

        In this framework, the net or true rate of protection is defined as the proportionate change
                                                 -7-

in the domestic price of importables relative to non-tradeables. The tariff increases the domestic

price of importables by (1+t), where t is the ad valorem tariff rate, which in turn increases the

domestic price of non-tradeables by (1+d), where d is the percentage increase in the price of non-

traded goods. As a result, the net protection to the importables sector is t* = (PM/PN) =

(1+t)/(1+d) -1 or

(1)    t* = (t - d)/(1 + d).

Similarly, the net subsidy to the exportables sector is

(1 )   s* = (s - d)/(1 + d),

where s is the rate of export subsidy granted by the government. If s = 0, as in the late nineteenth

century, then s* reduces to -d/(1+d), which will be negative (i.e., an export tax).

       For example, suppose that a 50 percent import tariff leads to a 20 percent increase in the

price of non-traded goods. This means that the net subsidy to import-competing producers as a

result of the tariff (as measured by the increase in the price of importables relative to non-traded

goods) is 25 percent, while the net tax imposed on exporters (as measured by the decline in the

price of exportables relative to non-tradeables) is 17 percent. If the price of non-traded goods

had risen by the full amount of the tariff, then the import-competing sector would have received

no protection since its relative price would not have increased.

       As is often the case in tax policy, policy makers can choose the nominal rate of

protection, but cannot directly control the incidence of the tariff because they cannot influence

how much it drives up the price of non-traded goods. In terms of incidence, in the example just

considered, only 60 percent of the nominal protection actually reaches import-competing

producers as a subsidy, while 40 percent of the nominal protection falls on exporters as an
                                                  -8-

effective export tax. Only if the tariff has no impact on non-traded goods prices will the nominal

rate of protection translate into assistance of the same magnitude for import-competing

producers.

       Furthermore, the following equilibrium relationship can be shown to hold:

(2)     PN = ωPM + (1 − ω ) PX ,

where PN is the price of non-traded goods, PM is the price of importables, PX is the price of

exportables, a ^ indicates the proportion rate of change (e.g., PX/PX). The incidence or shift

parameter    is a function of the compensated demand and supply price elasticities for non-

tradeables with respect to the three prices.5 This incidence or shift parameter     summarizes the

general equilibrium relationship between the prices of traded and non-traded goods and indicates

the degree to which importables and non-tradeables are substitutes in production and

consumption. In general,     falls between zero and one and indicates the fraction of the increase

in the price of importables (with a tariff) that spills over and increases the price of non-

tradeables. When      is zero, there is no change in the price of non-tradeables as a result of the

tariff and hence the price of import-competing goods rises by the amount of nominal protection.

As    approaches one, in which case PN/PN will be close to PM/PM, implying that import-

competing and non-traded goods are close substitutes in production and consumption, there will

be little net protection of importables relative to non-tradeables.

       If import tariffs are the only form of trade intervention, such that there are no export

         Specifically, = (hDM - hSM)/(hSN - hDN), where hDi and hSi and the compensated demand
and supply price elasticities for non-traded goods with respect to the price of import-competing
goods and non-traded goods, in compliance with homogeneity restrictions. See Greenaway and
Milner (1993, pp. 120-121) for further details.
                                                     -9-

subsidies and therefore PX/PX = 0, then from equation (2) we have:

(2 )      d=    t.

          Combining equations (1) and (2 ) yields

(3)       t* = (t - t)/(1 + t).

In this equation, the net or true rate of protection hinges on the nominal rate of tariff protection

(t) and the incidence parameter ( ). Since 0               1, the nominal rate of protection overstates

the true degree of protection (t       t* 0). If   = 0, then t* = t, but as    approaches one, then t*

approaches zero.

          The incidence parameter       also indicates the proportion of the tariff that is borne on

exporters as an implicit export tax. Assuming again that there are no export subsidies, then

combining equations (1 ) and (2 ) yields

(3 )      s* = - t/(1 + t).

If     = 0, then the price of exportables in terms of non-tradeables does not change and exporters

do not suffer (i.e., s* = 0), but if    > 0, then s* < 0. In the limit, if    = 1, then the price of

exportables relative to non-tradeables falls by the full extent of the tariff and a nominal tariff of a

given amount acts as an export tax of the same amount. Thus, if the tariff has a large impact on

the price of non-traded goods, the tariff simultaneously yields a low level of protection for

import-competing producers while imposing a great cost on exporters.

          Figure 1 illustrates these relationships. The horizontal axis measures the relative price of

exportables in terms of non-tradeables (PX/PN) and the vertical axis measures the relative price of

importables in terms of non-tradeables (PM/PN). In the absence of any trade policy interventions,

the domestic price of importables in terms of exportables (PM/PX) is given by the world market
                                                 -10-

and is represented by the ray extending from the origin. The schedule HH indicates different

combinations of prices of importables and exportables (relative to non-tradeables) that clear the

market for non-tradeable goods. (If the price of importables goes up, then the price of

exportables must go down to eliminate the excess demand for non-tradeables.) The initial

equilibrium is at A where the terms-of-trade ray intersects the HH schedule.

        The imposition of an ad valorem import tariff of rate t increases the domestic price of

importables relative to exportables, rotating the ray upward by the amount of the nominal tariff.

The new equilibrium point is B, where this ray intersects the HH schedule. To remove the

incipient tariff-induced trade surplus and accompanying excess demand for non-tradables, the

price of non-traded goods increases by d percent. The price of exportables relative to non-

tradeables falls by 1/(1+d) while the price of importables relative to non-tradeables increases by

(1+t)/(1+d).

        The magnitude of the increase in price of non-tradeables is determined by the degree of

substitutability between non-tradeables and importables in production and consumption. If there

is substitutability between nontraded and traded goods, then HH is negatively sloped.6 Figure 1

also depicts two extreme cases. If importables and non-tradeables are perfect substitutes in

production and consumption ( = 1), the HH schedule is horizontal, the price of non-tradeables

increases by the full extent of the tariff, and the final equilibrium is at C. In this case, the import-

competing sector receives no protection, because its relative price did not increase, and the

burden of the tariff falls entirely on producers of exportables, whose price falls relative to non-


        6
         This figure illustrates the particular case when there is substitutability in production and
consumption for traded and non-traded goods, but no such substitution between exportables and
importables.
                                                -11-

tradeables by 1/(1+t). This nominal tariff is a pure export tax with no protection for import-

competing producers relative to non-tradeables.

         Alternatively, if exportables and non-tradeables are close substitutes ( = 0), the HH

schedule is vertical, the price of non-tradeables does not change, and the final equilibrium is at D.

In this case, the nominal tariff equals the net or true protection given to import-competing

producers. The price of exportables falls relative to importables, but not relative to non-traded

goods.

         This framework is a useful way of thinking about the late nineteenth century American

economy for several reasons. First, the U.S. economy at this time can be viewed as being

comprised of three sectors, producing agricultural goods (exportables), manufactured goods

(importables), and non-traded goods (services). These sectors were roughly balanced in terms of

size: in 1879, agriculture and mining accounted for 33 percent of GDP, manufacturing about 23

percent of GDP, and services roughly 44 percent of GDP (Gallman 1960, Gallman and Weiss

1969). Any analysis that goes beyond a simple two-sector tradeoff between the export and

import-competing sectors and brings into account another large segment of the economy (the

non-traded services sector) is therefore historically relevant to the U.S. economy at this time.

         Second, the impact of protection in raising the price of non-traded goods and inflating the

cost structure of the economy is not only commonly recognized today, but was frequently

mentioned in the late nineteenth century. The imposition of high trade barriers to protect a large

segment of the economy could not help but to have an impact on the non-traded sector of the

economy as well. Many observers recognized that increased production in import-competing

industries as a result of the tariff would create demands on resources that would increase
                                                  -12-

production costs and thereby mitigate the gains to domestic producers of import-competing

goods while adversely affecting exporters. The Special Commissioner for Revenue, David Wells

(1867, p. 37), wrote in his first report that a high import tariff “will soon distribute itself

throughout the whole community, and will eventually manifest itself and reappear in the shape of

an increased price for all other forms of labor and commodities; thus aggravating the very evil

which in the outset it was intended to remedy.” And William Grosvenor (1871, p. 359) noted:

“A duty on one article may not affect at all the cost of producing others. But duties on three

thousand articles, each duty being diffused in its effect through a whole community, must have

some power to increase the cost of producing every thing, and thus must not only tend to

neutralize every benefit contemplated, but to put even our natural industries at a disadvantage.”7

        Third, changes in the real exchange rate were an important part of the international

adjustment mechanism in the late nineteenth century. In response to a higher tariff, an alternative

adjustment would be a nominal exchange rate appreciation, which would also lower the relative

price of tradeables. In the late nineteenth century, however, the United States was on a metallic

monetary (gold) standard for much of the period and so nominal exchange rate changes were

ruled out. Instead, changes in the domestic price level, i.e., the price of non-tradeables, were

required to remove the excess demand for non-traded goods and to restore the trade balance to its

previous level.8




        7
         Contemporary economists such as Taussig (1906) described the various mechanisms by
which high tariffs kept the level of U.S. wages and prices higher than they would otherwise be.
        8

that uses an approach similar to the one in this paper, see Devereux and Connolly (1996).

3. Measuring Net Protection and Tariff Incidence, circa 1885

        Like the concepts of nominal and effective protection, the net or true rate of protection

can be explored with some simple calculations. Because the incidence parameter              is

determined by a complex structure of substitution relationships, a common strategy is to estimate

it indirectly by rearranging equation (2) as follows:

(4)     PN − PX = ω ( PM − PX ) ,

and estimating

(5)     log (PN/PX)t =     +   log (PM/PX)t +    t   ,

where       is the elasticity of PN/PX with respect to PM/PX and is an error term. This regression

relies on the fact that the terms of trade are determined by the world market while the prices of

non-traded goods are endogenous.9

        This equation focuses on how changes in the relative price of imports (as depicted by a

rotation of the ray in Figure 1) affect the relative price of non-tradeables, but excludes anything

that might change the price of domestic non-traded goods without necessarily changing the price

of imports or exports. That is, it does not account for factors that might shift the HH schedule

itself. A plausible shift variable for domestic prices (the HH schedule) is the domestic money

stock, or currency held by the public, as changes in the money supply might bring about changes

in domestic prices beyond those induced by changes in the prices of traded goods. Therefore,

equation (5) can be modified as follows:

(5 )    log (PN/PX)t =     +   log (PM/PX)t +    log (M/PX)t + t,


        9
            It is also equivalent to estimating log (PN)t =     +   log (PM)t + (1 - ) log (PX)t +   t   ,
                                                 -14-

where M is the domestic monetary stock.

        This method of estimating      has the advantage of requiring only time series data on

export and import prices, the price of non-tradeables, and the money supply. Lipsey (1963)

calculates export and import prices starting in 1879, as presented in U.S. Bureau of the Census

(1975), series U-226 and U-238. A series representing the price of non-traded goods is not

readily available, in part because data on the prices of such goods (which typically include

housing and other services) are scarce and have not been collected to create a separate price

index. Researchers have typically used a broad price index, such as the GDP deflator or the

consumer price index, as largely representative of non-traded goods prices in lieu of data on

purely domestic goods prices. In this case, the GDP deflator is taken from Johnston and

Williamson (2005) and the consumer price index from David and Sollar (1977). The data on the

stock of money (currency held by the public) is presented in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975),

series X 410.

        One concern about this specification is that the results from a regression based on

equation (5) or (5 ) may be spurious if the relative price series are nonstationary. In results that

are not reported, augmented Dickey-Fuller test statistics on the data series confirm that one

cannot reject the hypothesis that log (PM/PX) and log (PN/PX) using either the GDP deflator or CPI

have a unit root in levels (i.e., are nonstationary), while one can reject that hypothesis in first

difference (indicating that the series are stationary when differenced). Estimation of equation (5)

and (5 ) in levels might be appropriate if the non-stationary series are cointegrated, i.e., that there

is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the two such that a linear combination of them is

stationary; otherwise, it should be estimated in first differences to ensure that the regressors are
                                                 -15-

stationary.

       Table 2 presents regression results for equations (5) and (5 ) in levels and first differences

for the period 1879 to 1913. The results for the levels regressions suggest that log (PN/PX) and

log (PM/PX) are not cointegrated. Using the Engle-Granger (1987) approach, the augmented

Dickey-Fuller test on the residuals of the levels regression indicates that the residuals are

nonstationary and hence the levels results are not consistent and may be spurious. (The Durbin-

Watson test statistic also suggests that the residuals are not stationary.)

       In the first-difference regression, both the regressors and the residuals are stationary. In

estimating equation (5), both measures of non-traded goods prices produce similar point

estimates of , 0.54 in the case of the GDP deflator and 0.57 in the case of the consumer price

index. However, as noted before, these estimates may suffer from omitted variables bias because

they do not account for possible changes in domestic prices that occur independently of changes

in the prices of traded goods. Hence, results are also reported including log (M/PX) as in

equation (5 ), which appears to confirm the bias of the previous estimates. With the inclusion of

this variable, the estimate of   falls to 0.42 in the case of the GDP deflator and 0.44 in the case

of the consumer price index, while the explanatory power of the regression improves

considerably.

       Taking a rough estimate of      as 0.43 along with an average tariff on total imports of 30

percent, equation (2 ) indicates that these duties would push up the price of non-tradeables by 13

percent. Is it plausible that import tariffs were at such a high level as to have raised the prices of

non-traded goods by about 13 percent? Most accounts of this period put the level of U.S. prices

as substantially higher than those in free-trade Britain. Ward and Devereux (2003, p. 832) report
                                                -16-

that the prices of services (housing, domestic service, and transportation) were roughly 25

percent higher in the United States than in Britain during the late nineteenth century, despite the

similar income levels in the two countries. In 1910, the nominal dollar-sterling exchange rate

was £4.86, but Williamson (1995) calculates the purchasing power parity exchange rate was 30

percent higher at £6.35, reflecting trade impediments and higher U.S. non-traded goods prices.

These would be upper-bound indicators of the possible impact of tariffs on the price of non-

tradeables.

       Using equations (3) and (3 ), the estimate of    at about 0.43 implies that the nominal rate

of protection of 30 percent translates into a 15 percent degree of net protection given to import-

competing producers (manufacturing) and amounts to an 11 percent effective tax on exporters

(agriculture). As expected, import tariffs were not nearly as protective as indicated by nominal or

effective rates of protection and the burden imposed on the exportables sector was significant.

       These results have implications that help explain several well-known features of the

nineteenth century debate over tariff policy. The advantages effectively gained by the import-

competing producers, as compared to non-traded goods producers, was much lower than might

be deduced from the nominal rates of protection. Just as agricultural subsidies in the twentieth

century get capitalized into land values and the prices of other inputs, thereby raising farmers’

costs, the import tariffs of the late nineteenth century put upward pressure on producers’ costs by

increasing nominal wages and the prices of non-traded goods. As a result, import-competing

interests had an incentive to press for even higher tariffs to gain greater protection. This may

account for the push by manufacturing interests for even higher rates of nominal protection in the

McKinley tariff of 1890.

        The results also indicate that exporters faced a substantial export tax, on the order of

about 11 percent. The term     indicates the fraction of protection that is borne by exporters,

meaning that about forty percent of whatever nominal import tariffs were imposed resulted in a

higher price of non-traded goods with no compensating change in the price of exportable goods.

Although the Constitution formally prohibited export taxes, agriculture faced a large, implicit

export tax as a result of the import tariffs of the day. The implicit export tax hit a broad

constituency because agricultural exports were quite diverse in the late nineteenth century,

encompassing traditional staples such as cotton and tobacco produced in the South, as well as

grains and meat products produced in many states across the Midwest. This feature of protection

may account for the general opposition of Midwestern farmers and Southern planters to the high

level of the tariff.

        The framework developed above can also reveal the income transfers associated with this

incidence of protection (Clement and Sjaastad 1984, Choi and Cumming 1986).10 Table 3

presents data on the structure of the economy that is required to calculate the income transfers

between various groups. Exportable production is the fraction of GDP accounted for by

agriculture and mining, while importables production is manufacturing as a share of GDP. In

order to get a central figure around 1885, these figures are a simple average of the shares in 1879

and 1889, taken from Gallman (1960) and Gallman and Weiss (1969).11


        10
          Although a fully specified, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model might
yield more precise accounting of changes in income distribution, previous research has found that
this framework yields findings similar to those more complex simulations without the detailed
data requirements. See Choi and Cumming (1986).
        11
         One adjustment was made to these data: food-related manufacturing, such as flour and
meat production, was shifted from the importables to the exportables sector. I thank Thomas

       Table 4 presents an intersectoral transfer matrix that records the implied income transfers

among five groups – import-competing producers, exporters, consumers, taxpayers, and the

government – as a result of the tariff policy that put average import duties at 30 percent. The

redistribution of income is calculated under the assumption of that the policy does not change

total income.12 According to these results, trade protection was responsible for reshuffling about

9 percent of GDP between various agents in the economy. The implicit export tax accompanying

the policy of import protection imposed a cost on exporters – measured as t*qX/(1- ) – that

amounted to 3.1 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the tariff forced consumers to pay 4.1 percent of

GDP in terms of higher prices on importables, 3.3 percent of GDP going to import-competing

producers (t*qM) and 0.8 percent of GDP going to the government (t*m) in customs duties.

Turning to the beneficiaries, import-competing industries gained 3.3 percent of GDP from

consumers, while consumers gained the equivalent of 2.3 percent of GDP at the expense of

exporters by virtue of the lower prices of exportables. The government collected a total of 1.6

percent of GDP in customs revenue, which – by assumption – was returned directly to taxpayers.

       The most interesting question that the transfer matrix can address is whether consumers

           The framework employed in this paper is not equipped to examine the deadweight
losses from the tariff policy. The net welfare impact (or the static deadweight loss) from trade
protection would probably be very small, perhaps just a percentage point of GDP. Even if the
United States had no tariffs, the share of trade in GDP would have been relatively small given the
large size of the U.S. economy. In addition, protection did not create many grossly inefficient
import-competing industries because free trade within the large U.S. market ensured vigorous
competition among domestic producers. Using an applied general equilibrium model of the
antebellum U.S. economy, Harley (1992) calculates that the aggregate welfare loss associated
with the tariff in 1859 was less than one percent of GDP. Like the results presented below, this
small net loss masked significant amounts of redistribution.
                                                 -19-

benefitted or lost from protection. Consumers gain from the lower domestic price of exportables

(by the amount t*cX/(1- )) but lose from the higher domestic price of importables (by the

amount t*cM). This gives rise to the “neoclassical ambiguity” of the standard specific factors

trade model (analyzed by Ruffin and Jones 1977) wherein the change in the real wage as a result

of the tariff hinges on the weights of goods in the consumption bundle. In this case, the

condition for consumers to gain from protection is      > cM/(cM + cX), i.e., when the incidence

parameter is greater than the share of importables in the consumption of tradeables. Thus,

consumers stand a chance of gaining from tariffs when domestic consumption of exportables is

large.

         The results here indicate that consumers lost slightly as a result of protection. As the

table indicates, consumers gained 2.3 percent of GDP at the expense of exporters but paid 3.3

percent of GDP to import-competing producers (the 0.8 percent of GDP sent to the government

in the form of tariff revenue is presumed to be returned to all consumers in a lump-sum

payment). Thus, tariff protection cost consumers on net about one percent of GDP. The reason

import duties did not put a huge burden on consumers is that about 40 percent of consumption

expenditures were devoted to food, and food accounted for more than half of U.S. exports in the

mid-1880s. (After cotton, breadstuffs and meat were the largest categories of U.S. exports.)

Although these products were important exports, most domestic production was consumed at

home; for example, about three quarters of the wheat crop was for domestic consumption. About

20 percent of consumer expenditures went to clothing, the major importable in the consumption

bundle, and another 10 percent was devoted to tobacco manufactures and alcohol, both of which
                                                  -20-

were imported.13 Thus, as Table 4 indicates, the consumption of importables as a share of GDP

exceeded that of exportables, but consumer spending was not highly skewed toward expenditures

on importables.14

        Even if the net effect of protection on consumers was negative, consumers-cum-taxpayers

could have gained from protection on the assumption that all the revenues from import duties

(some of which are paid by exporters, not just consumers) were returned to consumers as a lump-

sum rebate or exchanged for lower domestic taxes that financed public goods.15 Consumers-

cum-taxpayers gain whenever the shift parameter exceeds the share of production of importables

in the total production of tradeables, i.e.,   > qM/(qM + qX), a condition that does not quite hold.

Table 4 indicates that consumers lost 4.1 percent of GDP as a result of protection but gained 3.9

in government transfers, amounting to a net loss of just 0.2 percent of GDP. Thus, the overall

effect of tariff protection on consumers as taxpayers was roughly neutral.

        If the impact of tariffs on consumers as taxpayers, as a broad class (and not in their role as

producers), was roughly neutral, it would have been difficult to mobilize them to oppose the

policy. In fact, in the 1888 presidential election fought largely over the tariff issue, the voting



        13
          Various consumer expenditure surveys of the 1870s and 1880s indicate budget shares
of about 42 percent for food, 10 percent for tobacco and alcohol, 18 percent for housing, 20
percent for clothing, and 10 percent for other items (Ward and Devereux 2003, p. 833).
        14
           Of course, either a different trade pattern or a different consumption pattern would
have produced a different result in terms of the impact on consumers. Consumers in Britain, like
those in the United States, devoted a large share of their expenditures to food, but consumers had
a strong interest in free trade because the country was a net food importer during the nineteenth
century.
        15
          This assumption does not, strictly speaking, hold because the revenues from the import
duties were largely redistributed to specific groups, such as Civil War veterans in the North.
                                                 -21-

electorate was closely divided but voted slightly more for the tariff-reform candidate. The

incumbent Democratic president, Grover Cleveland, who wanted to reduce tariff rates, received

48.6 percent of the vote, while his pro-tariff Republican rival, Benjamin Harrison, received 47.8

percent of the vote. However, given the geographic distribution of these votes, Harrison won the

electoral college by 233 to 168 and thus became president.16 The extremely close popular vote

could be interpreted as indicating that the electorate was equally divided on the tariff question,

consistent with the distributional effects here on consumers.

       As a check on these results, we can use other data to assess the validity of the magnitude

of the transfers reported here. The most transparent transfer is from the government to taxpayers.

In the mid-1880s, the government collected about $200 million in tariff revenue, about 1.7

percent of GDP at that time, taking nominal GDP as about $12 billion (U.S. Bureau of the

Census 1975, series U-210). This is close to the 1.6 percent of GDP indicated in these

calculations.

       One aspect of these calculations that might alter the magnitude of the implied transfers is

the production of exportables and importables as a share of GDP. If not all agricultural and

mining production was linked (by prices) to export markets, and not all manufacturing

production influenced by import competition, then these shares could exaggerate the size of the

tradeable goods sector of the U.S. economy and inflate the size of the transfers.



4. An Antebellum Comparison

       16
            See Rietano (1994) for a detailed study of the 1888 political debate over tariff policy.

United States, a topic that has been relatively neglected, this framework can also be used to shed

some light on the antebellum period. Given the sharp political conflicts between the North and

the South over tariff policy, the connections between the tariff and income distribution prior to

the Civil War has long been of interest to economic historians. Pope (1972), James (1986), and

Harley (1992) all employed computable general equilibrium models of varying degrees of

sophistication to examine the impact of the tariff prior to the Civil War (specifically, in 1859, in

the case of James and Harley).

       The framework of net protection provides a much simpler, but also much less detailed,

approach to the questions posed in those models.17 Two key differences promise to make the

results dissimilar from the late nineteenth century. First, the incidence parameter    is expected

to be higher in the antebellum period. As     also represents the degree of substitutability between

traded and non-traded goods, a value closer to one than to zero implies somewhat more

substitutability between importables and non-tradeables than between exportables and non-

tradeables. In the antebellum period, exports consisted largely of cotton and tobacco produced

on Southern plantations, and the concentration of exports in traditional goods (i.e., raw material

or natural resource intensive primary products) are typically less substitutable with non-

tradeables than are importables and non-tradeables.18 Second, the structure of the economy was

different prior to the Civil War. Although exports and imports as a percent of GDP were


       17
          An advantage of the net protection framework used in this paper is that the data
requirements and modeling assumptions are much less severe than in computable general
equilibrium models, although the results are also much less detailed.
       18
           Most studies find much higher estimates of for countries where traditional exports
dominate. In the late nineteenth century, the U.S. export bundle was a mix of traditional and
non-traditional exports, and hence should be lower.
                                                  -23-

comparable, production of exportables (agriculture) was a larger and production of importables

(manufactures) was a smaller part of the economy.

         The results for the antebellum period will be presented with greater brevity than those

above. North (1966) calculated export and import prices for the period, the money stock is from

Temin (1969), and once again the GDP deflator is taken from Johnston and Williamson (2005)

and the consumer price index from David and Sollar (1977). Like the findings in the previous

section, the three variables – log (PM/PX) and log (PN/PX) using either the GDP deflator or the

CPI– are nonstationary in levels but are stationary in first differences for the period 1815 to 1860.

(These results are not reported but are available upon request.) Like the post bellum period, the

levels regressions suggest that log (PN/PX) and log (PM/PX) are not cointegrated and hence those

regression results are not consistent.

         In the first-difference regressions, both the regressors and the residuals are stationary. In

the first-difference estimate of equation (5 ), the point estimates of    are 0.65 (with a standard

error of 0.06) using the GDP deflator and 0.78 (with a standard error of 0.08) using the consumer

price index. Taking a rough estimate of       as 0.70 along with an average tariff on all imports of

20 percent in late 1850s, equation (2 ) indicates that this tariff would push up the price of

non-tradeables by 14 percent. This implies that the net protection given to import-competing

producers (manufacturing) was just 5 percent and the effective tax on exporters (agriculture) was

12 percent. The higher estimate of       implies a large impact on the price of non-traded goods and

confirms what Southerners complained fiercely about the time, that a burden of the tariff was

largely shifted onto Southern exporters through higher prices of importables and non-traded

goods.
                                                -24-

       Table 5 presents the structure of the economy in 1850 and Table 6 presents the implied

transfers.19 Three differences stand out in comparison to the late nineteenth century period.

First, the magnitude of the total transfers was less in the antebellum period, perhaps because the

average tariff (after the early 1830s) was lower than in the Gilded Age. Second, despite that,

transfers from exporters were greater in the antebellum period than later. The greater resources

squeezed from exporters combined with a greater commodity and geographic concentration of

those exporters in the South made the tariff even more controversial in the antebellum period.

Third, unlike the later period, consumers in the antebellum period appear to gain from the tariff

because domestic consumption of exportables (agriculture) was greater while consumption of

importables (manufactures) was lower as a percent of GDP.20 These results may be somewhat

misleading in that the major exportables were cotton and tobacco, and at least the former was not

directly purchased by consumer households but by textile firms in the North.

       The Table 6 results can be compared with those in Harley’s (1992) general equilibrium

calculations (in his tables 4 and 7). Perhaps because the categories are not exactly comparable,

the similarity in the results is mixed. Harley finds a much smaller positive impact of the tariff on

the price of non-traded goods, only about three to six percent, as opposed to the 14 percent here.

He also estimates that labor as a whole loses a small amount (about 0.5 percent) from the tariff


       19
           Due to the availability of greater data, previous work, such as Pope, James, and Harley,
cited above, also focused on the late antebellum period even though the most contentious debates
over the tariff were in the 1820s and early 1830s.
       20
           The most transparent transfer for which other data can be used to assess the validity of
the transfer magnitudes is that from the government to taxpayers. Around 1850, the government
collected about $40 to $50 million in tariff revenue, about 1.5 percent of GDP at that time, taking
nominal GDP as about $2.4 billion (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, series U-210). This is
reasonably close to the 1.0 percent of GDP indicated in these calculations.
                                                -25-

whereas a non-trivial gain to consumers is estimated here (about 2 percent of GDP). This

difference may be due to the different assumptions about the consumption bundle, as households

were not the direct consumers of exportables such as cotton. However, Harley’s estimate of the

tariff’s burden on farmers and planters is closer to that found here; he estimates a loss of about

two to three percent of GDP for farmers and planters (exporters) while the results here indicate it

is about four percent. His gains to capital (an import-competing factor) are only about 0.4

percent of GDP whereas here they amount to about one percent of GDP.



5. Conclusions

        This paper examined the issue of tariff incidence in the late nineteenth century United

States. Several findings give us insight into some of the important features of American trade

politics in the late nineteenth century. First, although the nominal level of protection was very

high to judge by legislated tariff rates, the net protection given to import-competing

manufacturers was diminished by the tariff-induced increase in the price of non-traded goods.

The calculations presented here suggest that the 30 percent average tariff on total imports

resulted in net protection of just 15 percent for import-competing producers (manufacturers) and

an export tax of 11 percent on export-oriented producers (agriculture). This low level of net

protection gave these manufacturers an ongoing incentive to press for higher duties to increase

their level of support.

        Second, the tariff redistributed substantial amounts of income among various producer

groups and consumers. In addition, the burden of the tariff on exporters exceeded the benefits

received by import-competing producers. The sizeable redistribution brought about by the
                                                 -26-

protectionist trade policy justified its status as one of the most highly controversial issues in

national political during this period. Both the desirability and the efficiency of the transfers were

leading political issues.

        Third, the policy of tariff protection appears to have been negative with respect to

consumers but roughly neutral with respect to consumers as taxpayers. Consumers do not bear

an enormous burden from the high tariff rates because of the large weight on exportable goods

(principally food) in domestic consumer expenditures. The political implication is that tariff

opponents would not be able to generate much support for their position by appealing to

consumer interests, and in fact the pro-tariff Republicans dominated national politics for many

decades after the Civil War.

        Fourth, in the antebellum period, the incidence of the tariff was higher on the exportables

sector. Although the total transfers as a result of the tariff were lower than in the late nineteenth

century, the cost to the exportables sector was greater than in the post bellum period. Because

the production of export crops was highly concentrated in the South, states such as South

Carolina vehemently argued that the tariff was a sectional policy, making trade policy even more

politically divisive than in the late nineteenth century.
