                                             ABSTRACT

We provide a theoretical description of a process that is capable of generating growth and income
convergence among economies, and where freer trade has persistent, positive effects on productivity,
beyond the standard efficiency gains due to reallocation effects. We add to a standard Ricardian model
a theory of endogenous growth where the engine of growth is the flow of ideas. Ideas are assumed
to diffuse by random meetings where people get new ideas by learning from the people they do business
with or compete with. Trade then has a selection effect of putting domestic producers in contact with
the most efficient foreign and domestic producers. We analyze the way that trade in goods, and impediments
to it, affect this diffusion. We find that exclusion of a country from trade reduces productivity growth,
with large long-term effects. Smaller trade costs have moderate effects on productivity.

1           Introduction
In this paper we provide a theoretical description of a process of endogenous technol-
ogy diffusion which we use to study the effects of trade barriers on productivity. Our
theory complements the classical insights from international trade theories, in which
gains from trade are due to re-allocation of resources using the same technology. Yet,
we provide a model in which, as is widely and reasonably believed, trade serves as a
vehicle for technology diffusion.1
    Our starting point is a static trade model. For concreteness we follow the frame-
work in Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Alvarez and Lucas (2007), EK-AL for short.
In this model (as in many others) freer trade replaces inefficient domestic producers
with more efficient foreign producers. We add to this familiar, static effect a theory
of endogenous growth in which people get new, production-related ideas by learning
from the people they do business with or compete with. Trade then has a selection
effect of putting domestic producers in contact with the most efficient (subject to
trade costs) foreign and domestic producers. The identification and analysis of these
selection and learning effects is the new contribution of the paper.
    Though constructed from familiar components, our model has a complicated,
somewhat novel structure, and it will be helpful to introduce enough notation to
describe this structure before outlining the rest of the paper. There are n countries,
i = 1, ..., n, with given populations Li and given iceberg trade costs, κij . There are
many goods produced in each country. The productivity of any good produced in i
will be modeled as a draw from a country-specific probability distribution, defined by
its cdf
              Fi (z) = Pr{productivity in i of good drawn at random ≤ z}.

We treat populations and trade costs as parameters and analyze the dynamics of the
technology profiles F = (F1 , ..., Fn ) that serve as the state variables of the model.
There are two steps in this analysis.
    1
        It is certainly not the only vehicle: Think of the diffusion of nuclear weapons capabilities.



                                                      2
    Given a profile F together with populations and trade costs we define a static
competitive equilibrium for the world economy. We use the static model of interna-
tional trade to determine the way a given technology profile F defines a pattern of
world trade, including listings of which sellers in any country are domestic producers
or exporters from abroad.
    The second step in the analysis is based on a model of technology diffusion that
involves stochastic meetings of individual people—we call them product managers—
who exchange production-related ideas. We use a variation on the Kortum (1997)
model, as developed in Alvarez et al. (2008). In this diffusion model, product man-
agers in country i meet managers from some source distribution Gi at a given rate αi
and improve their own knowledge whenever such meetings put them in contact with
someone who knows more than they do. In our application, this source distribution
Gi is the technology profile of the set of sellers of any good who are active in country
i, as determined by the trade theory applied in step 1. Under autarchy, then, the
source distribution is simply the distribution Fi of domestic producers.2 Trade im-
proves on this source distribution by replacing some inefficient domestic sellers with
more efficient foreigners, replacing Fi with a distribution Gi that stochastically dom-
inates it, at least for high productivities. It is this selection effect that provides the
link between trade volumes and productivity growth that we are seeking.
    Technically, trade theory provides a map from a technology profile F to a profile
G = (G1 , ..., Gn ) of source distributions. The diffusion model gives us a map from
each pair (Fi , Gi ) into a rate of change ∂Fi (x, t)/∂t. Combining these two steps yields
a law of motion for the technology profile F of all n countries together.
    The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces our
model of technological change in the context of a closed economy, which will be later
reinterpreted as a model of the entire world. For this case we present a complete
characterization of the dynamics of a single economy that introduces many features
that will be important in understanding the more general case. Section 3 characterizes
the competitive static trade theory that maps an arbitrary technology profile F into a
pattern of world trade. Section 4 then integrates the dynamics of technological change
and static equilibrium implied by trade theory. We characterize the balanced growth
path for a world economy and full dynamics of the right tail of the productivity
distributions under constant trade costs and populations. This section includes a
  2
      Kortum (1997) calls this distribution the technology frontier.


                                                   3
characterization of cases where trade costs have substantial effects on the stationary
distribution, relative income, and the volume of trade, relative to the static trade
theory of EK-AL. It also gives results for the case of costless trade. As we could
predict on the basis of the static trade theory alone, a full analytical characterization
of the dynamics in the general case is not a possibility, so we continue with numerical
results.
    In Section 5 we carry out some quantitative explorations to illustrate the effects
of trade costs on income levels and growth rates. We calculate equilibrium paths for
a symmetric world economy under different trade paths and compare the static and
dynamic effects of tariff reductions in this context. We then consider catch-up growth
when a small, poor, open economy is introduced into the otherwise symmetric world.
These results are illustrated graphically. Section 6 provides a brief discussion of some
substantive conclusions suggested by these exercises and of directions for future work
that they suggest. Finally, in an Online Appendix we outlines a version of the model
with Bertrand competition, and show numerical results for this alternative model.
    Before continuing, we present a brief summary of the main results in the paper,
and an overview of the related literature.

Preview of the Results This section review the main theoretical results, organiz-
ing them conceptually rather than in the order they are presented in the paper.
     The initial conditions are given by the distribution of productivities Fi (·, 0). These
govern all future behavior in our deterministic model. Their tail behavior can be
characterized by level and curvature parameters, λi and θi respectively. In particular,
θi is a measure of the concentration of firms in country i with very high productivities.
Trade among countries leads to the immediate convergence across countries of the
curvature of the tail to the common value θ, the maximum of the θi values in all n
economies. Despite the continuous evolution of the distributions Fi through time this
common tail parameter θ remains constant. [Propositions 1, 2, 7 and 8]
     Under natural assumptions, the distributions of productivities, consumption and
GDP converge to a unique balanced growth path with a common growth rate ν. The
                                                                            P
rate ν is given by the product of the sum of the countries’ meeting rates, i αi and the
common tail parameter θ. Increases in the search efforts ai or in the concentration θ of
high productivities both stimulate faster growth. The model features a form of scale
effect on growth. Adding more countries to the world in a way that enlarges the initial


                                             4
set of best practices increases the world growth rate, while arbitrarily partitioning a
country into subregions leaves everything in the world unaltered. [Proposition 1, 2,
7 and discussion in Appendix C]
    As with the case of the curvature parameter, the paths of the level parameters λi (t)
are independent of trade costs, as long as they are finite. Trade costs do not affect the
diffusion of extremely productive technologies—which are the ones determining tail
behavior—since for them productivity over-rides cost considerations. But in general
trade costs do affect the diffusion of technologies, and higher trade costs imply that
some more efficient foreign producers are replaced by inefficient domestic producers.
This reduces per-capita income levels. [Propositions 8, 10 and 11, and figures 2 and
3.]
    Both the effects of trade costs on output and the volume of trade depend on the
elasticity of substitution across products, η. This parameter determines the weight
that is given to goods from the left tail of the distribution of productivity. As η
increases towards a critical value, expenditures become concentrated on goods with
higher productivities. In this case, the behavior of trade volume and relative output
on the model approaches the EK-AL Frechet case. [Proposition 9]
    Our model has considerable flexibility because equilibrium wages are the only
feature of the static trade theory that is relevant in determining the distribution of
sellers in each country. No other feature of the equilibrium trade model is required
to determine the diffusion of productivity. In particular, as we show in the Online
Appendix, one can easily change the trade model from a competitive equilibrium to
a Bertrand competition and retain tractability.

Related Literature We build on previous work on both trade and growth. We
consider both perfect competitive setups from Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Alvarez
and Lucas (2007), and the case with Bertrand competition as in (Bernard et al.,
2003), Arkolakis et al. (2012), Holmes et al. (2012). We differ from these papers in
that we allow for a more general distribution of productivities.
    Our work is closely related to a number of papers on endogenous growth theory.
Kortum (1997) considers a model of a closed economy in which innovators spend
resources to draw ideas from an exogenous distribution of potential technologies.
Unlike our model, innovators do not learn form other producers, but instead they learn
form a set of exogenous ideas not embodied in goods, and thus there are no external


                                           5
effects. Yet the mathematical setup from which innovators learn best practices from
disembodied exogenous ideas is similar to the one that producers in our set up use to
learn from ideas currently embodied in goods. The derived stationary distribution of
productivities is Frechet, but in their model there is no long-run growth unless there
is population growth. We abstract from innovation, but allow for the diffusion of
existing technologies across sectors and countries, and obtain a model with endogeous
growth.
    Luttmer (2012) extends his work on growth driven by innovators with heteroge-
nous productivities and imitation by entrants. Luttmer (2007) considers imitation
of incumbants, which is closely related to our mechanism for growth. His interest is
to understand the contributions of both type of mechanisms to a balanced growth
path. This is a broad topic that has been studied extensively. An important early
contribution is Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994).
    Weitzman (1998) gives a mathematical description of a process where the engine
of growth is the repeated combination of pairs of original ideas from different areas
of knowledge. Our modeling of diffusion, at that general level, is guided by the same
mechanism: ideas embodied in different goods are pairwise combined to produce
newer ideas. Nevertheless our specification of ideas is closer mathematically to the
one in Kortum (1997), as extended by Alvarez et al. (2008).
    Jovanovic and Rob (1989) have a model with a simpler demand side, where new
ideas (productivities) are created by random meeting of existing ideas, but they al-
low for a richer set of possibilities after the meeting of two potential producers. In
their model, potential producers can either implement their ideas or engage in costly
search for a random meeting of a another holder of an unimplemented idea. Once
ideas are implemented, they are no longer available to be combined with other ideas
(implemented or not). Another difference in their outcome is that the ideas that are
being recombined are the relatively bad ones, since the goods ones are implemented.
Thus the initial set of ideas has an decreasing impact in the creating of new ideas as
as time goes by. Furthermore their model, as in Kortum (1997) features an exogenous
arrival of new ideas. Again, relative to our work, they abstract from trade.
    A related problem is studied by Lucas and Moll (2011), who consider the problem
of an individual which can produce or search for new ideas with variable intensity i.e
in terms of the object of this model they select α(t) ∈ [0, 1], which is interpreted as
fraction of time devoted to search for new ideas. The process of search is similar to


                                          6
the one in this paper. This allows the authors to study aggregate economic growth
and cross sectional individual income differences. Perla and Tonetti (2012) study a
similar problem, but there formulation is closer to a standard search model.
    We relate to a broader literature that examines the connection between growth
and trade, both theoretically and empirically.
    Grossman and Helpman have several theoretical papers on growth and trade.
The one that is closest to ours is Helpman and Grossman (1991). They consider a
small open economy where reserchers develop new varieties of intermediate inputs.
Technology is transferred from the rest of the world as an external effect. The pace
of technology transfer is assumed to be proportional to the volume of trade. Their
model abstracts from the selection effect which is at the core of our model, since the
transmission depends on aggregate outcomes and affects all the entrants in the same
way.
    There is a larger empirical literature studying the relationship between trade,
growth and development. On balance, they find relationships between trade flows,
domestic and foreign innovation, and TFP (Coe and Helpman, 1995; Coe et al., 1997;
Acharya and Keller, 2009). See Keller (2004) and Keller (2008) for reviews of this
literature.


2      Technology Diffusion in a Closed Economy
We begin with a description of technology diffusion and growth in a closed economy.
Consumers have identical preferences over a [0, 1] continuum of goods. We use c(s)
to denote the consumption of an agent of each of the s ∈ [0, 1] goods for each period
t. There is no technology to transfer goods between periods. The period t utility
function is given by
                                Z 1              η/(η−1)
                                         1−1/η
                           C=        c(s)      ds          ,
                                   0

so goods enter in a symmetrical and exchangeable way. Each consumer is endowed
with one unit of labor, which he supplies inelastically.
    Each good s can be produced by many producers, each using the same labor-only,
linear technology
                                   y(s) = z(s)l(s)                             (1)



                                          7
where l(s) is the labor input and z(s) is the productivity associated with good s.
Given the set-up, it is natural to assume that all the identical producers of good s
behave competitively, an assumption we will maintain for the analysis of the paper.3
   Using the symmetry of the utility function and the assumed competitive behavior
we can group goods by their productivity z and write the time t utility as
                                   Z                                     η/(η−1)
                                                   1−1/η
                         C(t) =              c(z)           f (z, t) dz                 ,   (2)
                                    R+


where c(z) is the consumption of any good s that has productivity z and f (·, t) is the
productivity density. We assume that f is continuous. We use F (z, t) for the cdf of
productivity so that the productivity density is f (z, t) = ∂F (z, t)/∂z.
   In a competitive equilibrium the price of any good z will be p(z) = w/z and the
ideal price index for the economy at date t is
                                   Z                                    η/(η−1)
                                                    1−1/η
                          p(t) =             p(z)           f (z, t)dz              .       (3)
                                        R+


Real per capita GDP y(t) equals the real wage w/p(t) or
                                   Z                                  −η/(η−1)
                                                 −1+1/η
                          y(t) =             z            f (z, t)dz                ,       (4)
                                        R+


provided the integral on the right converges.
    In our model the analysis of the closed economy becomes a study of the evolution
of the productivity distribution F (z, t): a process of technological diffusion. We
model diffusion as a process of search and matching involving the product managers
of each of the s ∈ [0, 1] goods. We treat search as a costless activity, a by-product
of production. We assume that managers interact with each other and exchange
production-related ideas. When a manager of any good with productivity z meets a
manager of any other good with productivity z 0 > z adopts z 0 for the production of
his own good.4 After such a meeting the new technology z 0 is instantaneously diffused
to all producers of the same good, thus keeping all the producers of the same good
homogenous. We assume that entire set of managers of any single good has a total of
  3
    In the Online Appendix we consider the case of Bertrand competition.
  4
    Perhaps a more descriptive, yet less tractable model will distinguish between goods that are
similar, in terms of how transferable is the technology.


                                                      8
α meetings per unit of time. While we refer to this process as technology diffusion, it
might as well be called innovation, since the more advanced technology used for one
good are adapted to a different good.5
   Next we give a mathematical description of this process. To motivate a law
of motion for the productivity distribution F (z, t), we describe the discrete change
between t and t + ∆, and then derive its continuous-time limit. For a given level of
the productivity z at date t, we assume that

   F (z, t + ∆) = Pr{productivity drawn at random < z at t + ∆}
                    = Pr{productivity < z at t} × Pr{no greater draw in (t, t + ∆)}
                    = F (z, t)F (z, t)α∆

The first term on the right reflects the option, which managers always have, to con-
tinue with their current productivity. The second is the probability that in α∆
randomly drawn meetings an agent with productivity z does not meet anyone with
a higher productivity. Given our assumption of independent draws, the fraction of
managers with productivity below z at date t + h is given by product of these two
terms.
    We have that
                        F (z, t + ∆) − F (z, t)   F (z, t)α∆ − 1
                                                =
                                F (z, t)∆                ∆
and taking limits as ∆ → 0 that:6

                                  ∂ log F (z, t)
                                                 = α log (F (z, t)) .                                 (5)
                                       ∂t

Then for any initial distribution (cdf) F (z, 0) the path of F is given by

                                  log(F (z, t)) = log(F (z, 0))eαt .                                  (6)
   5
      The effect of indirect links, of the role of chance in our diffusion process, is familiar to us from
the history of technology. Here is a nice example, taken from chapter 13 of Diamond (1998): “[N]ew
technologies and materials make it possible to generate still other new technologies by recombination
... Gutenberg’s press was derived from screw presses in use for making wine and olive oil, while his
ink was an oil-based improvement on existing inks....”
    6
      See Appendix A for an interpretation of the continuous time limit. A similar, but not identical,
differential equation could be based on the more familiar assumption of Poisson arrivals, as opposed
to the continuous arrivals postulated here. The formulation here has the convenient property of
preserving distributions in the Frechet family. See Alvarez et al. (2008) and the Poisson extension
in the Online Appendix.

                                                    9
    It is evident from (6) that the law of motion (5) implies a non-decreasing level
of real income y(t). For empirical reasons, our interest is in sustained growth of
economies that either grow at a fairly constant rate or will do so asymptotically.
A central construct in our analysis will therefore be a balanced growth path (BGP),
defined as a cdf Φ (with continuous density φ) and a growth rate ν > 0 such that

                                F (eνt z, t) = Φ (z) for all t

is a particular solution to (5). On a BGP

                                              ∂F (z, t)
                           f (z, t) =                   = φ(e−vt z)e−vt

provided the integral on the right converges. In the rest of this section we characterize
(i) all pairs (Φ, ν) that are balanced growth paths and (ii) all initial distributions
F (z, 0) from which the solution F (evt x, t) will converge asymptotically to Φ(x).
    The possible balanced growth solutions to (5) are contained in the Frechet family
of distributions, a two-parameter family defined by the cdfs:

                          F (z, 0) = exp(−λz −1/θ ),                      θ, λ > 0.            (8)

Proposition 1. The cdf/growth rate pair (Φ, ν) is a balanced growth path of (5) if
and only if Φ is a Frechet distribution with parameters λ > 0 and θ = ν/α.

   Proof : It is immediate from (6) that if F (z, 0) is Frechet (λ, θ), F (z, t) is Frechet
(e λ,θ) for all t. Then if Φ(z) = F (eαθt z, t) is a BGP. Conversely, suppose (Φ, αθ) is
  αt

a BGP so that F (z, t) = Φ(e−αθt z) solves (6). Then

                            log Φ(e−αθt z) = log(Φ(z))eαt .

Differentiating both sides with respect to t and setting t = 0 gives

                              d log(Φ(z))    1
                                          = − log(Φ(z))
                                d log(z)     θ
which has the general solution

                              log(Φ(z)) = −λz −1/θ .                               (9)



   A Frechet distribution Φ has a “Pareto tail” which is to say that it has the property

                                      1 − Φ(z)
                                   lim         = λ.
                                  z→∞   z −1/θ

This is just a restatement of the solution (9) above, since Φ(z) → 1 as z → ∞ and so
the approximation log (Φ(z)) ' − [1 − Φ(z)] becomes exact. The terminology stems
from the fact that the numerator above is the right cdf of the Frechet distribution
while the right cdf of the Pareto has the form Az −1/θ . The two tails are proportional.
The parameter θ is often referred to as a “shape” or “tail” parameter.
    This observation is central to a study of the stability of balanced growth paths,
or to the question of what conditions on the initial distribution F (z, 0) ensure that

                     lim log F (eαθt z, t) = −λz −1/θ for all z > 0                (10)
                     t→∞


for some λ > 0 and θ > 0. The answer to this question is given by

Proposition 2. The solution (6) to (5) satisfies the stability condition (10) for some
λ and θ if and only if the initial distribution F (·, 0) satisfies

                          1 − F (z, 0)
                      lim              = lim θz 1/θ+1 f (z, 0) = λ.                (11)

    There are, of course, initial distributions that generate paths that do not converge
in the sense of (10): any distribution with a bounded support, for example. At the
opposite extreme, an example of an initial distribution that implies a growth rate that
increases without bound can also be constructed, as we show in the Online Appendix.


3      Competitive Trade Model
In this section we move from the autarky model of Section 2 to a world economy
of n countries. each with its own productivity distribution Fi (·, t) at any date t,
all linked by trade in goods. The technology profile F = (F1 , ..., Fn ) will be the
state variables of the world economy. We take iceberg trade costs and populations
as given and construct a static trade equilibrium under the assumption of continuous
trade balance. Among other things, this equilibrium will determine the productivity
distribution of the product managers who are active in each country i. We label the
cdfs of these distributions Gi (·, t). Product mangers in i, active and inactive, will meet
managers from Gi at a given rate α and the outcomes of these meetings will provide
a law of motion ∂Fi (z, t)/∂t for the technology profiles of all countries. This mapping
is the topic of this section. Since the analysis is static, we temporarily suppress the
time subscripts. The implied dynamics will be studied in Section 4.
    The model is a variant of the trade theory of Eaton and Kortum (2000) and
Alvarez and Lucas (2007). Each country under autarky is identical to the closed
economy described in Section 2. We use the same notation here, adding the country
subscript i to the variables ci (s), zi (s), yi (s), and `i . In this many-country case we
group goods s which have the same profile z = (z1 , ..., zn ) of productivities across
the n countries, where zi `i is the production technology of the good z in country i.
We assume that productivities are independently distributed across countries, and let
f (z) = ni=1 fi (zi ) denote the joint density of productivities. With this notation we

where ci (z) is the consumption in country i of goods that have the cost profile z.
    We use wi wage rates. We assume iceberg shipping costs: when a good is sent
from country k a fraction κik of the good arrives in i. The costs κik are the same
for all goods, and satisfy 0 < κij ≤ 1 for all i, j and κii = 1 for all i. Each good
z = (z1 , ..., zn ) is available in i at the unit prices

    We solve for equilibrium prices, given wages. Let pi (z) be the prices paid for good

Given populations L = (L1 , ..., Ln ), trade costs K = [κij ] and the distributions
F = (F1 , ..., Fn ), equations (12) and (13) are 2n equations in wages w = (w1 , ..., wn )

Definition. A static equilibrium is a wage w = (w1 , ..., wn ) ∈ Rn+ such that for some
p = (p1 , ..., pn ) ∈ Rn+ , (w, p) solves (12) and (13).

   The next proposition states that a static equilibrium exists and that, provided
η ≥ 1, there is a unique static equilibrium.

4       Diffusion in a World Economy
The central idea of this paper is that trade in goods among countries stimulates the
exchange of productivity-related ideas. In Section 2 we described a specific model of
the exchange of ideas within a closed economy. In Section 3 we provided a model of
trade in goods with many countries. Now we put these pieces together.
    To do this, we replace the assumption of Section 2 that product managers in
country i learn from the examples of other managers in their own country with the
assumption that they learn from the managers of products that are sold in i, regardless
of their origin. Instead of drawing from the distribution Fi (·, t) they draw from a
distribution Gi (·, t) defined by the cdf

The probability that a producer in j with the productivity y exports to i is fj (y, t)
times the probability that no producer elsewhere can offer a lower price. This will
depend on all the productivity distributions plus trade costs plus equilibrium relative
wages as determined in Section 3. The law of motion for productivity in each country
then becomes
                             ∂ log(Fi (z, t))
                                              = αi log(Gi (z, t))                  (16)
                                   ∂t
    We are now in a position to define an equilibrium that describes the full dy-
namics of a world economy given parameters K, L and initial distributions F (·, 0) =
(F1 (·, 0), ..., Fn (·, 0)).
Definition. An equilibrium is a time path of wages w(t) = (w1 (t), ..., wn (t)) and cdfs
F (·, t) for all t ≥ 0 such that


                                                  15
       ( i) w(t) is a static equilibrium as defined in Section 3, and
       (ii) given w(t) the path F (·, t) satisfies (15) and (16).
    As in Section 2, we are also interested in balanced growth equilibria. Here we
define a BGP as a common growth rate ν and a profile of productivity distributions
Φ = (Φ1 ..., Φn ) such that
                                 Φi (x) = Fi (eνt x, t)

for all t. Along a BGP we can substitute Φi (e−νt z) for Fi (z, t) in (16) and φi (e−νt z)e−νt
for fi (z, t), and using the homogeneity of the model we have that a BGP (Φ, ν) must
satisfy7

Letting x = e−νt z, we have

Let γi (x) = ∂Γi (x)/∂x be the associated density.
   The relations (15) and (18) of learning environments Gi to the profile F are
complicated. A backward producer in a large, low wage economy could undercut a
domestic producer with higher productivity or another foreign producer with higher
trade costs. Little can be said in general, but the next result shows that all Gi are
bounded from below by the joint distribution of sellers that would be active in i in a
hypothetical world economy with no trade costs and a common labor market.

Proposition 4: Gi (z; K, w) ≥               j=1     Fj (z), with equality if K = I and w = 1.

   7
    Formally, let (w, p) be the equilibrium wages and prices for an economy with K, L, F . Let
ξ ∈ R++ and define Fiξ as Fiξ (z) = Fi (ξz), for all i. Then (w, p) are also the equilibrium wages and
prices for an economy with K, L, F ξ .

Proof : Define the sets

                        M (z) = z ∈ Rn+ : max{z1 , ..., zn } ≤ z

and                         (                                                                    )
                                                                                          wj
          Bi (z; w, K) =        z ∈ Rn+ : zj ∗ ≤ z, where j ∗ = arg min                                .
                                                                       j∈{1,...,n}       zj kij

It is easy to see that M (z) ⊆ Bi (z; w, K) since max{z1 , ..., zn } ≤ z ⇒ zj ≤ z, all
j = 1, ..., n. Therefore,
                        Z                                  Z                         n
                                                                                     Y
       Gi (z; K, w) =                       f (z, t)dz ≥             f (z, t)dz =           Fj (z, t).
                          z∈Bi (z;w,K)                     z∈M (z)                   j=1



   The next result is instructive, even though it is limited to the case of a symmetric
world with costless trade.
Proposition 5: Assume that the n countries have the same size, Li = L, and
the same α = αi , and that trade is costless, κij = 1, all i, j, and that the initial
distributions are the same: Fi (z, 0) = F (z, 0). Then wages will be identical and the
equilibrium path of F (z, t) is

                                ∂ log(F (z, t))
                                                = αn log(F (z, t)).                                        (19)
                                      ∂t

Proof: The distribution of sellers varies across countries only through its dependence
on country specific trade costs (see (15)). Therefore, in the case of costless trade all
countries share the same distribution of sellers, Gi (z) = G(z). In this case, the
distribution of productivity for every country i solves

                                 ∂ log(Fi (z, t))
                                                  = α log(G(z, t)).
                                       ∂t

In this symmetric case,
                                  Z    z
                   G(z, t) =               nf (y, t) [F (y, t)]n−1 dy = F (z, t)n .
                                   0


We can drop the subscripts and (19) follows.



                                                     17
       Along a BGP we can replace F (z, t) with Φ(e−νt z) and let x = e−νt z to obtain

                                    φ(x)x    αn
                                          =−    log(Φ(x))
                                    Φ(x)      ν

Then Proposition 1, with nα replacing α yields the
Corollary 1: The symmetric world economy described in Proposition 5 is on a
balanced growth path if and only the cdfs are given by the Frechet cdf

                                                            1
                                      Φi (z) = exp(−λz − θ )

with parameters λ and θ, and the growth rate of each of all economies is

                                             ν = nαθ.

    The fact that the equilibrium growth rate is proportional to the number of economies
n may require comment. We certainly do not believe that the division of Czechoslo-
vakia into Slovakia and the Czech Republic led to an increase in world growth rates.
In practice, ν would be identified with measured gdp growth and θ with a tail param-
eter (as discussed below) and the product nα with ν/θ. In everything that follows,
we treat n as an unobservable constant.8
    In Propositions 6-8 below, we develop some facts about much more general cases.
The Frechet distribution does not obtain in these cases. But, perhaps surprisingly,
the formula ν = nαθ (or more generally, ν = θ ni=1 α) continues to describe the
                                                    P

BGP of all economies.
    The following condition on the tail behavior of these distributions will be used in
deriving the next three results in this section.

Condition C: We say that a profile F (z) = (F1 (z), ..., Fn (z)) satisfies Condition C
if
                               1 − Fi (z)
                           lim            = λi < ∞
                          z→∞    z −1/θi
   8
     In Appendix C we present an extension of the model with multiple locations per country to
clarify the role of scale effects. There we show that, provided that the structure of transportation
cost and labor markets across locations is kept constant, an equilibrium of the model is invariant to
arbitrary division of locations into countries.




                                                 18
for all i,
                                    1 − Fi (z)
                                 lim           = λi > 0
                              z→∞     z −1/θi
for some i, and wi and κij > 0 for all i, j.
    If Condition C holds no country is capable of ever-accelerating growth, at least
one country is capable of sustained growth at a positive rate, and all countries are
connected in the sense that it is possible for any country to trade with any other
country.
    The next result shows that the distributions Gi share a common right tail, with
tail parameter θ = maxi θi .

Proposition 6: Assume that the profile F (z) satisfies Condition C. Then for all i
the cdfs G1 , ..., Gn satisfy

                                 1 − Gi (z, 0)
                               lim             = λ > 0,                              (20)
                          z→∞       z −1/θ
                         P
where θ = maxi θi and λ = j λj .

Proof: We show that
                                        gi (z, 0)
                                  lim               =λ                               (21)
                                 z→∞ (1/θ) z −1/θ−1

for all i which will obviously imply (20). Differentiating both sides of (15) with respect
to z and dividing through by (1/θ) z −1/θ−1 where θ = maxi θi we obtain
                                               n
                             gi (z, 0)     X          fj (z, 0)

                                         =      lim
                      z→∞ (1/θ) z              z→∞ (1/θ) z −1/θ−1
                                           j=1


since the cdfs Fk → 1 as z → ∞ under the assumption that wi and κij > 0. Condition
C requires that
                                           n
                          gi (z, 0)     X            (1/θj ) z −1/θj −1
                    lim               =     λ j  lim                    .
                   z→∞ (1/θ) z −1/θ−1           z→∞ (1/θ) z −1/θ−1
                                        j=1


The terms in the sum on the right are zero if λj = 0 or if θj < θ and equal to λj > 0
otherwise. This verifies (21) and completes the proof. 




                                            19
    Proposition 6 describes the instantaneous effects of anything that alters the static
trade equilibrium. Suppose, for example, that the initial distributions F1 (·, 0), ...Fn (·, 0)
represent a situation of autarky that is ended at t = 0 by an opening to trade. Then
immediately all countries will have access to the source distributions Gi (·, 0) charac-
terized in Proposition 6, all which have the same “Pareto tail.” For the analysis of
trade dynamics, then, any initial differences in the initial tail parameters θi cease to
matter, and we use θ to denote only θ = maxi θi .

Proposition 7. Assume that αi > 0, all i, and that the profile of stationary dis-
tributions Φ = (Φ1 (z), ..., Φn (z)) satisfies Condition C. Then the growth rate on the
balanced growth path equals

where the second line follows from Proposition 6 and Condition C. Condition C also
implies that for large x, φi (x) ' (λi /θ) x−1/θ−1 so

                                                   j=1


Summing both sides over i yields (22) and then (23) follows from (24). 

butions Fi (z, 0) that will imply convergence to a balanced growth path, in the sense

a Frechet distribution as in equation (10). Here we assume profiles for initial distri-
butions Fi (z, 0) that satisfy Condition C. Proposition 7 then implies that equations
(22)-(23) hold for the common value θ > 0 and positive values λ1 , ..., λn . In this n
country case, ν = θ ni=1 αi . It is certainly not the case that these conditions will

as x → ∞ and provides a characterization of the dynamics of the right-tail of the
productivity distributions Fi (z, t).

Proof: See Appendix B.

    Note that neither wages wj nor trade costs κij affect the right tail of productiv-
ity in the balanced growth path. The relative level of the right tail across countries
depends only on the relative value of αi , the rate at which technology diffusion op-
portunities arrive. If all the αi are the same, then the right tail (of normalized)
productivity converges to the same value for all countries. Otherwise, countries with
more opportunities for technology diffusion converge to a permanently higher produc-
tivity, which translates into higher income levels. As in the closed economy case, the
level of the initial right tail of productivity has a permanent effect on the long run
distribution, except that in the multi-country case it is the sum of the (normalized)
right tails which matters in the long run. In addition, note that if αi = 0 for some
country i then λ∗i = 0, as this country’s technology is constant, and hence gets farther


                                              21
and farther behind the rest.
    To better understand the role of cross country differences on the arrival of tech-
nology diffusion opportunities consider the case where trade is costless, so all κij = 1,
but where the value of αi differs across countries. With costless trade Gi (z) = Gj (z)
for all z, and hence from (17) and (18) we obtain that for all z > 0:
                                                                    αi
                                                Φi (z) = Φj (z) αj

or equivalently                          h 

                                  lim    h                 i = i                                               (27)
                                 t→∞                    θ
                                      log Fj (e(ν/θ)t z) , t    αj

Thus if αi > αj country i has a distribution of productivity that is stochastically
better than j. Hence with costless trade the ratio of (25) equals the ratio of the α’s
not only as z → ∞ but for all values of z < ∞.9
    The next proposition analyzes the effect of the elasticity of substitution η in im-
ports elasticities, equilibrium wages, and relative GDP’s. As a preliminary step we

parameters λi and the same shape parameter θ, i) the Armigton’s elasticity, i.e. the
price elasticity of imports demand, which equals 1/θ, (iii) equilibrium wages, and iv)
relative real GDP’s, and thus gains from trade, are all independent of η, and relative
GDP’s are given by the ratio of λ’s (Eaton and Kortum, 2002; Alvarez and Lucas,
2007).

     In the case of different α’s the value of (25) for country i is not constant across z, i.e. the
distributions Φi is not Frechet.

   We use the notation I˜ij , w̃i , p̃i and ỹi to refer to imports of i from j, country’s i
equilibrium wages, price level, and real GDP for the Frechet case with tail parameter
θ. The same three objects without a tilde can be interpreted as the long run distri-
bution of a world economy that starts with Frechet distributions in all countries with
the same tail parameter θ.

Proof: See Appendix B.

    This proposition is useful because the effects for the Frechet case are simple and
well understood. The logic behind the result is clear: as η → 1 + 1/θ the goods
became such good substitutes that demand is concentrated on the best products.
The result follows because the long run distributions of productivities have the same
behavior in the tail as a Frechet distribution. The proposition is stated in terms of
ratios for two reasons: first in the Frechet case the effect of η is multiplicative, and
hence it cancels in this form. Second, the levels of GDP and imports as η tends to
this limit diverge to infinity.

This corollary is a direct consequence of the last two propositions and equation (27).
    Summarizing, as explained in Remark 1, Eaton and Kortum (2002) takes as given
that productivity distribution given by Frechet with common tail θ and country spe-
cific λi which determines the Armington elasticities, and per-capita income differ-
ences. Our technology diffusion model gives a simple theory of θ and λi (propositions
7 and 8). In this theory, heterogeneity in α’s imply differences in the level of income
per-capita, while the sum of α’s affects the common growth rate of the countries in
the world.
    We finish the theoretical exploration of the model by studying the effects of trade
cost and wages in the neighborhood of costless trade, which would be helpful to in-
terpret some of the numerical results that follow. If we start from a situation with
costless trade and equal wages, a marginal increase in trade cost or wages has a neg-
ligible effect in the distribution of sellers.

Proposition 10: Take an arbitrary profile of productivity distribution F (z) and
consider the distribution of seller to country i given a profile of equal wages and
costless trade. Then, the distribution of sellers to country i is invariant to small
changes in trade cost or wages, i.e.,

A similar analysis follows by differentiating (18) with respect to wj 

    Proposition 10 holds independently of the profile of cdfs F (z), but it takes as
given the profile of wages w which we know is determined by the profile F (z). We
complement this result in Proposition 11, which studies the comparative static for
the stationary distribution. That proposition establishes that when starting from
a world with symmetric countries and costless trade, so that equilibrium wages are
equal, changes in trade cost or in the size of an individual country have a negligible
effect on the profile of stationary distributions of productivity of each country.
    Let the parameters of a world economy be given by n, α, K and L. We are inter-
ested in the comparative statics of the profile of stationary distributions φ(x; K, L)
with respect to K and L, evaluated at the case of a world of n equal size economies
with costless trade.

Proposition 11: Consider a world economy with matrix of trade cost K and vector
of population L. Let φ(z; K, L) be the stationary distribution of such an economy
where the corresponding equilibrium wages ensure balance trade for each country.
Assume that for each z the density φ(z; K, L) is differentiable. Then, for all z

                  ∂φi (z; K, L)                  ∂φi (z; K, L)
                                            =                                         = 0.

Proof: Notice first that φ(z; K, L) is the solution to the system of non-linear dif-
ferential equations given by: equation (17) defining a balance growth path, equation
(18) defining the distribution of sellers, equation (13) giving the solution to the static


                                                25
trade equilibrium wages, ν = nαθ defining the growth rate of a balance growth path,
and limx→0 xφ   i (x)
              Φi (x)
                      = θ and limx→0 θxθ−1 φi (xθ ) = λ giving the boundary conditions for
the densities. The result follows from totally differentiating the system of non-linear
differential equations and Proposition 10. 

    Propositions 10 and 11 taken together give the precise sense in which in a homo-
geneous world small trade costs have no effect on the diffusion of productivity. In
the quantitative exploration that follows, we find that the lack of first order effects is
clearly visible in a large range of parameters.


5      Quantitative Exploration
In this section we present numerical examples to illustrate the effect of trade costs.
We consider two cases: a world consisting of n symmetric countries facing trade costs
κij = κ, and, a world consisting of one asymmetric and n − 1 symmetric locations
facing trade costs κ1 = κ1j ≤ κji = 1, j = 2, ..., n, i 6= j. We also illustrate the effect
on the diffusion of technology of heterogeneous arrival rates αi and wages rates wi ,
driven by differences in the size of countries Li .


Calibration and Interpretation of Parameters
We can gain some understanding of the order of magnitude of the parameters α and
θ by using information of the long-run growth rate of the economy ν, and information
on θ which instead can be obtained either from the dispersion of productivities, or
the tail of the size distribution of firms/plants, or the magnitude of trade elasticities.
We turn to the description of each of these approaches.10
    First, since we show above that asymptotically z is Frechet distributed, then
                                                                        √
log(z), the log of productivity, has standard deviation equal to θπ/ 6, see chapter
3.3.4 of Rinne (2008). Hence we can take measures of dispersion of (log) productivity
to calibrate θ. The dispersion of (log) productivity range from 0.6 − 0.75 when
measured as the value-added per worker – see Bernard et al. (2003) Table II – and
  10
     Our calibration strategy follows that in Lucas (2009), although our focus is on the distribution of
productivity across “product managers” instead of individual workers. To operationalize the notion
of a “product manager” we interpret a plant or firm as one manager, but we acknowledge the limits
of this analogy.

data on value-added, capital and labor inputs, and assumptions about the demand
elasticities – see Hsieh and Klenow (2009) Table I, dispersion of TFPQ.11 These
numbers suggest a value for θ in the range [0.5, 0.6].
    Second, using that productivity is asymptotically distributed Frechet, and that the
tail of the Frechet behaves as that of a Pareto distribution with tail coefficient 1/θ, we
can use data on the tail of the distribution of productivity to directly infer θ. Lacking
direct information on physical productivities, we can use information on the tail of the
distribution of employment, together with a value for the elasticity of demand.12 The
tail of the size (employment) distribution of firms is approximately equal to 1.06 – see
Figure 1 in Luttmer (2007). Therefore for the values of demand elasticities typically
considered in the literature, say η ∈ [3, 10], (see Broda and Weinstein (2006), Imbs
and Mejean (2010), or Hendel and Nevo (2006)) it would imply a value for θ in the
range [0.1, 0.5].
    Third, as showed before, in the case of a model with several symmetrical locations,
θ is approximately the Armington trade elasticity, which will also give us another way
to measure it. This method would suggest a value for θ in [0.1, 0.25] (Alvarez and
Lucas, 2007).
    Once we have an estimate of θ, whatever its source, together with an estimate of
long term growth of output ν, we can estimate the value of α, using that ν = nαθ.
For instance, if we take the long-run growth to be 0.02, nα would be in the range
[0.03, 0.2]. Note that with a value of nα = 0.1, which is the object that governs the
speed of convergence of the λ’s in general as shown in Equation (26), and of GDP in
the setup of Corollary 2, the half-life to convergence will be approximately 5 years.
    Based on this discussion, we set θ = 0.2 to be consistent with the available evidence
on the right tail of the distribution of productivity, and set α = 0.02/(θ n), to match
a growth rate 0.02. We consider a world consisting of n = 50 economies symmetric
in all dimensions, with the possible exception of their trade cost. Given our choice of
n, in a world with symmetric trade cost each economy has a relative GDP similar to

     Using data for eleven products for which direct measures of physical output are available Halti-
wanger et al. (2008) calculate true measures of physical total factor productivity. They find that
the dispersion of (log) true physical productivity is 20% higher than that measured using just value-
added information.

Symmetric World
Figure 1 illustrates the long run effect on the distribution of productivities z of in-
troducing trade costs in a symmetric word of n countries. The thought experiment
is to go from costless trade to a case where κij takes a common value κ < 1 for all
j 6= i. On the x-axis we measure the value of productivity, expressed as a ratio to
the average productivity in the economy with costless trade (κ = 1). On the y-axis
we display the density of relative productivities for different values of κ. The top
panel shows the densities of productivities of the potential producers, the density φ
(or f ). The bottom panel shows the density of productivities of the sellers active in
each country, the common density γ (or g). We have chosen the value of λ for the
initial distribution so that with costless trade the average value of productivity z is
equal to one.
    Note first that, due to the selection effect, the density of sellers is stochastically
larger than that of potential producers for each κ. The difference between the two
densities increases for larger trade cost (for lower values of κ). Second, note that
for κ = 1 the densities are Frechet, as we showed in Corollary 1. Third, for larger
trade cost (lower κ) both densities have a thicker left tail, especially so for potential
producers. Fourth, the change in the distribution of potential producers as κ varies
illustrates the effect of trade costs on the diffusion of technologies, the main feature
of the model in this paper. Finally, we note that these distributions are independent
of the value of η, as equations (15) and (18) are independent of η, and wi = 1 in a
symmetric world.
    Figure 2 illustrates the effect of introducing symmetric trade costs on real gdp in
the top panel and in the ratio of imports to gdp in the bottom panel in a symmetric
word of n countries. On the x-axis we measure trade cost. On the y-axis we measure
real gdp, relative to gdp under costless trade (top panel) or the trade share, relative
to the costless trade benchmark (bottom panel). In each panel the solid line displays
the impact effect of introducing the trade costs, calculated by holding the distribution
of productivity fixed at its distribution under of costless trade. As shown above, this
benchmark has a Frechet distribution. The other lines in each panel show the effect of
introducing trade cost on the balanced growth path. Each line is for a different value

The top panel shows the effect of trade cost on per-capita income on impact (solid), and the long-run
effect for various values of η = 2, 4, 5. The comparison, and the initial condition, is given by the model
with costless trade, i.e., κ = 1. The bottom panel shows the effect of trade cost on the volume of trade,
measured as import to GDP. The effect on impact is the same regardless of the value of η. We consider
a world economy with n = 50 symmetric locations with parameter values θ = 0.20, and α = 0.002.



    The solid lines showing the impact effects correspond to the familiar effects of

                                                               30
trade cost in the Ricardian trade theory of Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Alvarez
and Lucas (2007). In this case there is an analytical expression for the GDP of an
economy relative to case of costless trade:13

The output effects of trade cost depend only on θ, the country size, 1/n, and the
value of the trade cost κ. As it has been noted, this expression does not depend
on the value of the substitution elasticity η. In contrast, in the long-run, once the
distributions of productivity adjust, the value of η does matter, as showed by the
dashed lines. These effects of trade costs on gdp are larger the more difficult it is to
substitute domestic goods for imports. The long-run calculations include the effects
of the changes in the distribution of productivity due to the diffusion of technology,
which are the contribution of this paper. As trade cost increases, individuals in each
country meet relatively more unproductive sellers, and therefore the good technologies
diffuse more slowly.
    This panel also shows that the difference between the effect on impact (solid
line) and the long-run effects (any of the other lines) are extremely small in the
neighborhood of costless trade. This is to be expected, since Proposition 11 shows
that around the symmetric costless trade, trade cost have only second order effects
on productivity. Indeed, Figure 1 shows that the lesson drawn from Proposition 11
applies for a large range of trade costs, say even trade cost as large as κ ≥ 0.5.
    The effect of trade cost on the volume of trade is shown in the bottom panel of
Figure 2.14 The impact effect and long-runs effects are defined as in the top panel.
Note that the impact effect of trade is the same as in Alvarez and Lucas (2007), since
the distribution of productivities is Frechet, and it is given by15

                                              (n − 1)κ1/θ

                                            1 + (n − 1)κ1/θ

The long run effect of trade cost on the volume of trade is smaller than its effect
  13
     This formula follows from specializing equation (6.10) in Alvarez and Lucas (2007) to a world
without intermediate goods, non-tradable Pngoods, and tariffs.
  14
     Total imports in country j are Ij = i=1,i6=j Iji and volume of trade, defined as imports relative
to GDP, is given by vj = 1/(1 + Ijj /Ij ).
  15
     See Alvarez and Lucas (2007) expression (6.11) for the case of β = ω = 1 and α = 0.

                                                 31
on impact. This is due to the fact that a higher trade cost leads to a distribution
of productivity for potential producers with a thicker left tail and the same right
tail (see Figure 1), i.e. they lead to larger dispersion of productivities. A larger
dispersion of productivity is associated with larger gains from trade. In addition,
the difference between the long-run and the impact effect is larger the lower the
elasticity of substitution η. As discussed before, the distribution of productivities are
independent of the value of η, but the gains from trade are not independent of η, and
with a lower elasticity of substitution for any given κ there is more trade.
    For the interpretation of the magnitude of trade cost, the reader should remember
that, for simplicity, in our model all goods are tradable. Compare our model with
Alvarez and Lucas (2007) which includes a non-tradable sector, one with infinite trade
cost, and with a fixed (i.e. Cobb-Douglas) share of expenditure. Thus our model’s
closest counterpart in the data will be the volume of trade for the tradable sector.
Alternatively one could introduce a non-tradable sector in our model, and match it
with the volume of trade of the whole economy, as in Alvarez and Lucas (2007).16
    In the Online Appendix we also explore the robustness of the welfare results
presented above to the case with Bertrand competition. We conclude there that
for small and medium size trade cost, i.e. κ ≥ 0.5, the welfare difference between
perfect and Bertrand competition is a pure level effect, i.e. independent of κ, both
on impact and on the long run. We reach this conclusion by analyzing the case of 25
symmetric countries, each with two locations, so that the total number of locations
are the same as in the previous examples. For each elasticity η, we compare the ratio
of the consumption using Bertrand competition to perfect competition for a given
common trade cost κ < 1, with the same ratio for a zero trade cost (κ = 1). These
ratios were between .98 and .95. For large trade cost, κ < 0.5, the effect of changes
in trade cost on this ratio is more significantly, although the pattern depends on the
particular value of the elasticity of substitution, taking values between 0.87 and 0.99.
  16
     For instance, suppose non-tradables have a share ξ of expenditures, with labor freely mobile
across sectors. Furthermore, suppose a form of Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis where there is no
diffusion in non-tradables. Then, the model applies literally to a fraction 1 − ξ of the economy, and
the trade share for the whole economy will be (1 − ξ) times the trade share of our. Yet a better
model, which has a similar effect but that requires more analysis, is one where diffusion occurs across
both tradables and non-tradeables. The effect on this model on trade volume will be similar, but
the analysis of the dynamics of diffusion is more complicated. We skip the inclusion of non-tradables
for simplicity.




                                                  32
Asymmetric Trade Barriers
In the previous exercises we illustrated the effect of symmetric trade barriers. We
now explore the impact of unilateral trade barriers by considering a world economy
consisting of n countries, n − 1 of which face symmetric trade cost κ1 when trading
among themselves, and a single country that faces a relatively larger cost to trade
from and to this country, κn ≤ κ1 . We refer to the first group as the n − 1 symmetric
countries, and to the later as the single deviant economy. Given our choice of n = 50,
the single deviant economy is a country of the size of Canada or South Korea.17
We interpret the n − 1 relatively open countries as developed economies. Following
Alvarez and Lucas (2007), we calibrate their trade cost to κ1 = 0.75.18
    In Figure 3 we illustrate, for different levels on initial trade cost, how the balanced
growth path of these n − 1 economies is affected by changes in the cost of trade with
the single deviant economy, κn . In the top panel we show the effect on the per-capita
income of the n − 1 symmetric countries (solid line) and the single deviant economy
(dashed line). Similarly, in the bottom panel we show the effect on the volume of
trade. Most of the impact occurs in the single deviant economy which has higher trade
cost. For the n − 1 symmetric economies the goods produced by the single deviant
economy are a small fraction of their consumption. As before there are two effects on
real consumption from reductions in trade costs. The first is the effect captured in
the traditional trade model: i.e., individuals consume goods that are less costly. The
second effect is that the distribution of productivity get better as domestic producers
interact with more productive sellers.
    Figure 4 displays the dynamic path following a trade liberalization of the single
deviant economy whose initial balanced growth path is described in Figure 3, for three
values of the pre-liberalization trade cost. In particular, Figure 4 displays the dynamic
effects of a once-and-for-all trade liberalization in the single deviant economy, taking
the form of a reduction of its trade costs to the level of the advanced economies.
These dynamics are shown for three different initial conditions (pre-liberalization),
   17
      For our benchmark parameter values this size of the single deviant economy is far from the
theoretical small open economy limit discussed in Appendix C. In that limit case there should be no
effect on GDP or volume of trade after impact. Instead for the size of this single deviant economy
there is a non negligible dynamic effect.
   18
      This value is a compromise between low values of κ obtained from indirect estimates using
gravity equations and higher ones using direct evidence of transportation costs, e.g., freight charges,
imputed time costs on cargo in transit.

corresponding to the balance growth path with three alternative values of trade cost
κn (0) = 0.05, 0.30, 0.50. In the top panel we show the value of GDP per-capita relative
to the case with costless trade for the single deviant economy in the pre-liberalization
and in the first 20 years following the trade liberalization. The bottom panel shows
the initial and post liberalization dynamics of the volume of trade. In the x-axis we
show the years that elapse since the trade liberalization.
    The main message from Figure 4 is that a large part of the output gains from a
reduction in trade costs occur immediately. The distribution of productivity of the
single deviant economy is not affected on impact, but this economy is no longer forced
to rely on its own producers for most of the goods it consumed, and can therefore
discontinue its most unproductive technologies. In the model, this effect happens
immediately. This is the effect captured by the standard trade model.19 Thereafter,
the distribution of productivity continues to improve due to the diffusion. This affects
the whole distribution with the exception of the right tail (see Proposition 7 and 8,
and Figure 1). These effects are persistent. The half lives are 10 years and longer.
The magnitude of the effect on the distribution on per-capita income will depend on
the value of η. For instance, if η is close to 1/θ+1, per-capita income is only a function
of the tail of the distribution, which is not affected by trade cost (see Proposition 9).


Heterogeneity in the Diffusion Rates α
In this section we explore the effect of cross country heterogeneity on the diffusion
rate α of the long run relative real income levels. This analysis complements the cases
of either large elasticity of substitution, η → 1/θ + 1, or a small open economy of
Corollary 2 and Remark 2 in Appendix C, where we obtain the following analytical
result: The ratio of long term real GDP equals yi /yj = (αi /αj )θ/(1+θ) . We focus on
a case where there are two values of the diffusion rate αL < αH , where half of the
countries have one value and the other half the other, and where countries are identical
in all other respects. We focus on costless trade so that the only departure from a
Frechet distribution of productivities is due to the heterogeneity on the meeting rate.
We conclude that the differences with the analytical cases discussed above are small.
    Figure 5 plots the ratio of the long term real gdp levels for the countries with αL
  19
    These effects are larger than those predicted by a model with Frechet distribution (Eaton and
Kortum, 2002), as the initial distribution of the single deviant economy has substantially more mass
in the left tail than a Frechet distribution, similarly to the examples described in Figure 1.

The trade cost of the n−1 symmetric countries is fixed at κ1 = 0.75. Per-capita GDP is measured relative
to the value in a world with costless trade, i.e., κ1 = κn = 1. The bottom panel shows the corresponding
dynamics of the volume of trade, measured as imports to GDP. We consider a world economy with n = 50

substitution η.
    We make two remarks on Figure 5 . First, the line for η = 1/θ + 1 corresponds to
the case of Corollary 2 and Remark 2 in Appendix C. Note that, for instance, if half
of the countries have a diffusion rate ten times smaller, then the ratio of real incomes
is about 60% of the one with the large diffusion rate. Instead if this diffusion rate is
half, their real gpd is about 85% of the leaders. This is a numerical illustration of the
comments right after Corollary 2. Second, the effect of a smaller η in relative gpd is
small. In the case where the elasticity of substitution across goods is lower than the
critical value, i.e., η < 1/θ + 1, the effect beyond the right tail have to be taken into


                                                  37
account. Yet, the quantitative effects, i.e., the vertical distance between the lines, are
small.

The horizontal axis of Figure 6 has the ratio of the size of the countries, in log scale. The vertical axis
plots the real aggregate per capital world consumption, as defined in (28). We normalize c for the static
case to 1, and plots the log of this quantity. The solid line shows the impact effect, i.e., the effect when
we take as given the initial Frechet distribution. The growth rate is ν = 0.02 and the value of θ = 0.2,
and therefore, we set α = 0.05. We set Lsmall + Llarge = 1.



    This section assesses the effect of different wages on the diffusion of technology.
Recall that our assumption is that technology is diffused to the potential producers
in a location from cost efficient producers located everywhere. Since sellers are deter-
mined by a comparison of relative cost of a particular good across locations, which


                                                                             38
depends on wages, thus differences in wages translate into difference in diffusion of
technologies. In particular we explore the difference in diffusion due to difference
in wages, itself caused by difference in country size, i.e. Li . To isolate from other
features we consider the case of no trade cost, i.e. κj,i = 1 and of only two large
countries (or equivalently two group of countries, each group made of countries of the
same size).
    We fixed L, a vector of sizes normalized so that ni Li = 1, solve for the equilib-
                                                      P

rium wages w(L), and consider the per-capita world real consumption as a measure
of productivity, i.e.:
                                     X
                             c(L) =      w(L)Li /p (w(L))                         (28)
                                            i

where p(w(L)) is the equilibrium common price level, which depends only on wages.
We compare the effect of variations on relative size (and hence wages) on the real
per capita world consumption both on impact and in the long run. For the impact
effect we use that the distribution of productivities is Frechet. For the long run effect,
which takes into account the effect on diffusion, we use the invariant distribution that
solves equations (17) and (18). Thus the interpretation of the experiment is that we
start from a world with two countries of the same size and compare the effects of
“moving” people from one country to the other.20
    The horizontal axis of Figure 6 has the ratio of the size of the countries, in log
scale. The vertical axis plots the real aggregate per capital world consumption, as
defined in (28). We normalize c for the static case to 1, and plots the log of this
quantity. The solid line shows the impact effect, i.e., the effect when we take as given
the initial Frechet distribution. As shown in Alvarez and Lucas (2007), in this case
the per-capita world consumption equals:
                                                      X    1/(1+θ)
                                  c(L) = λθ/(1+θ)         Li         .
                                                      i

                                                P
Clearly this expression is maximized when Li / j Lj = 1/n, for all i. This is because
we assume that costs are independently distributed across locations, thus if one region
has a small share of the population it can only produce a small share of the products,
  20
    The computations of these examples are facilitated greatly by using the converse of Proposition 3
stated and proven in the Online Appendix, so that we can actually compute the invariant distribution
of productivity for a given w and then find the vector L that supports the equilibrium with balanced
trade.


                                                 39
and hence requiring the more populous region to do it – which incidentally will be
reflected in the equilibrium value of relative wages.
    Our interest is on the additional difference between the impact effect and the long
run effect. As explained in Proposition 11 there the effects are of second order for
small change in wages. For change of wages of 50 %, i.e. those changes that correspond
to different of size of about 92%, we found that the extra effect of diffusion is of 15
percentage points.


6    Conclusions
We have proposed and studied a new theory of cross-country technology diffusion,
constructed by integrating two existing models: a static model of international trade
based on the Ricardian framework introduced by Eaton and Kortum (2002) and a
stochastic-process model of knowledge growth introduced in Kortum (1997) in which
individuals get new ideas through their interactions with others. The new feature
that connects these two models is a selection effect of international trade: Trade
directly affects productivity levels by replacing inefficient domestic producers with
more efficient foreigners and so increasing every country’s contacts with best-practice
technologies around the world.
    The theory implies a long-run equilibrium in which all economies share a common,
constant, endogenously determined growth rate, provided they are all connected in
some degree through trade. Differences in trade cost will induce differences in income
levels but not, in the long run, in rates of growth. This feature is shared with the von
Neumann (1927) model and with the Parente and Prescott (1994) model of “barriers
to riches.” The transition dynamics following changes in trade costs, both world wide
and by an individual country, are illustrated through stylized numerical examples.
These dynamics are a mixture of static gains from trade that occur instantaneously
under the trade model we use and gradual change that results from to changes in
the intellectual environment that trade brings to individual countries. Improvements
in technology arise from interactions among people who are brought together by the
prospects of gains from trade and who get new ideas by adapting better technologies
currently used in other locations and/or in the production of other goods.
    The model of this paper is general enough to support a fairly realistic calibration
to the world economy (as in Alvarez and Lucas (2007)) but our numerical illustrations

                                          40
here should not be viewed as an attempt to do this. The trade shares in the figures
are much larger than those we observe. Adding a non-tradeables sector would remedy
this, and would also reduce the size of the jump in production that follows a trade
liberalization, but we have not done this. The model of technological change that we
have adopted from Kortum (1997) is one of many possibilities—see, for example, the
ones explored in Lucas and Moll (2011)—and we have not yet sought a parameteriza-
tion that matches up to observations on actual catch-up growth. These are but two
of the many directions that would be interesting to pursue further.

A         Interpretation of the Continuous Time Limit
For some readers the continuous time law of motion of F (z, t) may seem odd, since for
small ∆ there are a “fractional” number of meetings. Here we show that our limit as
∆ goes to zero can be regarded as simply an “extrapolation” of the law of motion to
all values of t, with no change on the substance –provided the value of α is adjusted
accordingly–, but with a simpler mathematical formalization. To see this consider
the following discrete time law of motion for the right CDF of a closed economy:

              F (z, j + 1) = F (z, j)F (z, j) = F (z, j)2 , for all j = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

where we are measuring time in units so that there is exactly one meeting per period.
In this case j is also the number of meetings since time zero. Continuing this way,
and taking logs

                         log F (z, j + 1) = 2 log F (z, j) = 2j log F (z, 0)

If we now measure time t in natural units (say years) and we assume that there are α0
meetings per unit of time, we can write that j periods correspond to t = j/α0 (years)
and replacing in the previous expression

                                                         0
                                     log F (z, j) = 2α t log F (z, 0)

Compare this with the continuous time limit we obtain in Section 2:21

                                     log F (z, t) = eαt log F (z, 0)

Thus both expression for the law of motion give identical expression (on integers
values of t/α) if

                                             log(2) = α/α0 .

In other words, the continuous time value of α has to be smaller than the discrete time
value to take into account the ”compounding” effect of the meetings, but otherwise
they give the same answer.
 21
      To be more precise, log F̃ (z, t) = log F (z, tα0 ) = eαt log F (z, 0) = eαt log F̃ (z, 0).

B     Additional Proofs
Proof of Proposition 3: To establish existence we show that the the excess demand
system satisfies i) Walras’ law, i.e. ni=1 wi Zi (w) = 0 for all w, ii) that the functions
                                     P

Z are continuous and homogenous of degree zero in w, iii) that Z (w) are bounded
from below, and iv) that maxj Z(w) → ∞ as w → w0 where w0 is on the boundary
of the n dimensional simplex.
    Part (i) follows from replacing pi in the expression for Zi , (ii) continuity is im-
mediate since the functions Fi are differentiable, and homogeneity is immediate by
inspection of (12) and (13). For (iii), we can take − maxj Lj to be the lower bound.
For (iv) we assume, without loss of generality, that 0 = w10 ≤ w20 ≤ · · · ≤ wn0 = 1,
and show that Z1 (w) → +∞. For any w we have

     To establish the gross substitute property, since the excess demand system satisfies
Walras’ law, it suffices to show that ∂Zi (w)/∂wr > 0 for all i, r = 1, ..., n and i 6= r.
First notice that pj (w) is increasing in each of the components of w and homogenous

    That wi /wj , relative wages of country i respect to any country j, are decreasing

with Li , while the excess demand for any other country increases with Li , –see, for
example, first corollary of Theorem 3 in Quirk (1968). 

From this follows that the equilibrium wages are the same. The result for the ratio
of price levels follows a similar argument. Finally, the claim for the ratio of the real
GDP follows from the previous two results. 


C       Multiple Locations per Country
In order to clarify the role of scale effects and the interpretation of countries of
different sizes we introduce the notion of a location within a country. We consider a


                                                       50
world economy consisting of n countries, where each country i contains mi locations.
To simplify the analysis, we assume that a country is defined by a set of locations
satisfying the following conditions:22

   1. within each country there is a common labor market across the mi locations;

   2. there are no trading cost between locations within a country;

   3. locations within a country face the same trading cost when trading with loca-
      tions in other countries.

    Denoting by Li,l the labor force in location l of country i, we can write the labor
force of country i as
                                           mi
                                           X
                                     Li =      Li,l .                             (C.1)
                                                    l=1

Since we assume that all locations within a country share the same labor market,
there is a unique wage wi for all location within a country. Likewise, given that there
are no transportation cost within a country and all locations within a country face
the same trading cost when trading with locations in other countries, all locations
within a country face the same prices for all goods.
   Denoting by Fi,l (z, t) the distribution of cost in location l of country i, we can
write the distribution of best practices in country i as
                                                    mi
                                                    Y
                                      Fi (z, t) =         Fi,l (z, t).                          (C.2)
                                                    l=1


Notice that the right hand size of (C.2) is the distribution of the minimum labor
requirement over all locations within a country. This follows from the fact that all
locations within a country share the same wages, there is no transportation cost
between location within a country, and that all locations within a country share the
same transportation cost vis-a-vis all other countries. Thus, the distribution Fi (z, t)
of cost of a country is all we need to know to calculate a static trade equilibrium.
In particular, given the distribution of cost in each country and the size of the labor
force of each country, Li , we can calculate a static trade equilibrium as described in
  22
    It is straightforward to extend the analysis to the case where labor is not mobile across location
and there are arbitrary transportation
                             Pn         costs across locations. In this case an equilibrium is given by
a wage vector of dimension i=1 mi .

                                                    51
Section 3. In particular, the equilibrium values of (wi (t), pi (t), Ci (t))i=1,...,n are only
function of the (Fi (·, t), Li )i=1,...,n and independent of the decomposition of countries
into locations as long as equations (C.1) and (C.2) hold.
    Assuming that the arrival rate of ideas in location l of country i equals αi,l , we
can aggregate the evolution of best practices of all locations in a country to obtain
the law of motion of best practices in country i:


                     mi                           mi
                     X  ∂ log (Fi,l (z, t))       X
                                              =         αi,l log [Gi (z, t)]
                      l=1
                                  ∂t              l=1

or

                            ∂ log (Fi (z, t))
                                              = αi log [Gi (z, t)]
                                   ∂t

where αi = m
              P i
                 l=1 αi,l .
     Furthermore, assuming that countries are aggregates of different different number
of symmetric locations in terms of their population and number of technology man-
agers, Li,l = L and αi,l = α, we have that countries of different size are obtained by
scaling their population Li = mi L and the arrival rate of ideas αi = mi α.
     It should be also clear that, provided that the structure of transportation cost
and labor markets across locations is kept constant, an equilibrium of the model is
invariant to arbitrary division of locations into countries. For instance, a country
with mi locations can be divided into mi individual countries, each of them with a
population of size L, receiving α ideas per period, and having a distribution of best
                                    1
practices Fi,l (z, t) = (Fi (z, t)) mi .
     We use the notion of locations to study the effect of changes in the arrival rate of
product diffusions of a single small open into this country’s output and welfare. To
do so we first consider a limit set-up where all countries are identical and very small.
Then we let one of these small economies to differ in its own meeting rate. Consider a
sequence of worlds, each one indexed by n. We split the world economy into n identi-
cal locations, so that each country corresponds to one location, but where otherwise
every other aspect of the world is kept the same. In particular fix ᾱ, L̄ and a right cdf
F̄ (z, t). Using our previous result, for each world made of n countries let Li = L̄/n,
                                       1
αi = ᾱ/n and Fi (z, t) = F̄ (z, t) n for each country i = 1, ..., n. Furthermore assume


                                               52
that κij = 1 for all i, j regardless of the number of countries n. Clearly equilibrium
wages are wi = 1 for every country in every world with n countries. Moreover, for any
n the stationary distribution of sellers, Γi in equation (18), is independent of i and is
given by the same Frechet distribution with shape parameter θ and scale parameter
λ derived from F̄ (·, 0). The common growth rate of each country is ν = ᾱθ for every
n. The case of n small open economies is obtained when we let n be very large,
so that each country i has negligible effect on common distribution Γ faced by each
country. This is the same concept used in section 8 of Alvarez and Lucas (2007) to
study optimal tariff rates.

     Remark 2. Consider n small open economies, for large n. Assume that country
1 has α1 < ᾱ/n ≡ α2 = α3 = · · · = αn . Since each economy is very small, the
stationary distribution of sellers Γ in every country i is not affected by α1 . Equa-
tions (17)-(18) implies that the stationary distribution of country 1 is Frechet with
the same shape parameter θ but with scale parameter λ∗1 = (α1 /αj ) λ < λ = λ∗j , for
j 6= 1. Relative GDP’s equals the relative λ0 s to the power θ/(1 + θ), and the relative
λ0 s equal the relative α0 s. Moreover, we can study the dynamics of the effect of a
permanent change in α1 using Equation (26) from Proposition 8. Hence country’s 1
real income level converges to (α1 /αj )θ/(1+θ) at rate ν/θ = ᾱ for j 6= 1.

    Remark 2 and Corollary 2 give two different setups where relative meeting rates
for diffusion opportunities, i.e. relative α’s, determine exactly relative income levels.
