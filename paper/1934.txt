                         The Feminization of Poverty?




                                   ABSTRACT


    This paper uses Census of Population and Current Population Survey data

to describe and analyze the sex-incidence of poverty in 1959, 1969, 1979,

and 1984 according to a fixed standard and a standard that changes with

national per capita real income. The popular view that there was a large

increase in the percent of adult poor who are women and that this trend has

accelerated in recent years is not supported by the data. There was

considerable feminization of poverty in the 1960s, but in the 1970s the sex

mix of poverty was relatively constant, and between 1979 and 1984 women's

share decreased. The trend in feminization was more severe for blacks than

for whites, primarily as a result of disparate trends in the 1970s.

Statistical decomposition of the changes shows that an increase in the

proportion of women in households without men was the principal source of

feminization of poverty and the principal reason why the trend was more

adverse for blacks than whites.

     "Feminization" is a key word in almost all current discussions of

poverty. What does it mean? Has it occurred? If so, when? What were the

causes? This paper examines the sex incidence of poverty in 1959, 1969,

1979, and 1984 among all adults (18+) and also for the sub-group ages 25-64.

Disparate trends for whites1 and blacks are discussed and analyzed, and

poverty rates are calculated for both a fixed standard and a standard that

changes with national per capita real income. Changes in the sex mix of the

poor are decomposed into the portion due to sex differences in poverty

trends among particular types of households and the portion due to changes

in the distribution of population across household types. The paper also

considers how conclusions about "feminization" might be affected by

alternative measures of income and poverty and alternative rules for income

sharing within households.



Data and Methods

     The data examined in this paper come from the Censuses of Population of

1960, 1970, and 1980, and the Current Population Surveys of March 1980 and

March 1985. Because the samples and survey methods differ somewhat between

the Current Population Survey and the Censuses, direct comparison between

the 1985 Survey and earlier Census results is inappropriate. In this paper

the change between the 1980 and 1985 Surveys is linked to the changes in the

earlier Censuses to facilitate comparison over the whole period, 1959 to 1984.


                                      1
     Feminization of poverty is defined as an increase in the percentage of

the adult poor who are women. An alternative definition- -an increase in the

probability of a woman being poor relative to the probability of a man being

poor- -yields very similar results.2 Other definitions, such as "all

persons in female-headed and single-person households"3 (regardless of sex

or age) do not precisely address the question of the poverty of women

relative to men. Changes in the incidence of poverty among children and the

elderly are important, but analytically distinct from the issue addressed in

this paper.

     Income is defined as the pre-tax cash income from all sources received

by members of a household in the previous year. No imputation is made for

nonmarket production (such as housework or childcare), fringe benefits (such

as employer-paid health insurance premiums), or noncash transfers (such as

food stamps). The possible effects of these factors on sex differences in

the incidence of poverty are considered subsequently.

     The poverty levels for each household in each year are set according to

the official Census Bureau weights that establish poverty thresholds

based on the number of adults and number of children in the household.4 For

instance, a household with two adults and two children has a poverty

threshold 1.51 times that of a household with two adults, and 1.95 times a

one-adult household. Once a household is identified as having total money

income below the poverty threshold, all the individuals in that household

are designated as being in poverty. The implicit assumption is that income

is shared equally between men and women in the same household, regardless of

who provides it.

     In the official approach to poverty measurement, the poverty thresholds

change only to reflect changes in the price level; that is, in real terms

there is a "fixed standard." According to this view, poverty means failure


                                       2
to attain an absolute standard of income determined by the minimum amount

needed for food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities of life. This

standard does not change over time.

     Another view is that the poverty standard should change over time as

the general standard of living of the country changes.5 Adam Smith seems to

have had this view of poverty when he wrote "By necessaries I understand not

only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of

life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for

creditable people even of the lowest order to be without." Thus at one level

of economic development shoes may be a necessity; at a higher level,

bicycles; and at still higher levels a telephone, a television set, and a

refrigerator may be deemed part of a minimum standard of living.

     The historical record supports the changing standard approach. Each

generation has tended to redefine poverty in the light of contemporary

levels of living. For instance, in the depths of the depression of the

1930s, President Roosevelt noted that one-third of the nation was "ill-fed,

ill-housed, ill-clothed." Many at the time regarded this as an exaggeration,

but probably two-thirds of American families in Roosevelt's day had incomes

(adjusted for price change) below the official poverty standards that were

set in the early l960s. This paper, therefore, in addition to using a fixed

standard, also reports the incidence of poverty under a "changing standard"

that reflects changes in real per capita income for the economy as a whole.6

     The poverty trends are calculated for ages 25-64 as well as for 18 and

over. The latter is more comprehensive but the former may be more useful for

bringing sex differences in poverty into sharp focus. Income comparisons at

ages under 25 are not reliable guides to lifetime levels of economic well-

being because many young adults are still in school; their current income

may be much lower than their average lifetime income or their current level


                                       3
of living. Also, some young people choose their first full-time job partly

for the experience and training it affords; therefore their nominal wage

does not adequately measure their total compensation. If, for instance,

there is a change in the women/men ratio of enrollment in colleges and

graduate schools, money income measures at ages 18-24 may give a misleading

picture of the true sex differences in economic circumstances. Money income

can also be a biased measure of living standards at older ages, partly

because the value of assets such as owner-occupied homes is not included.

Also, non-cash benefits such as subsidized housing and medical care are very

significant for many of the low-income elderly.



Results

     Table 1 shows the percentage of women and men in poverty under the

fixed and changing standard for all adults and for those ages 25-64. Under

the fixed standard there was a dramatic decline in the incidence of poverty

between 1959 and 1969, some additional decline between 1969 and 1979, and

then a rise between 1979 and 1984. Under a changing standard, poverty rates

were about the same in 1979 as in 1959 and there was a substantial increase

between 1979 and 1984. As expected, the incidence of poverty is appreciably

lower at ages 25-64 than for all adults, but the broad trends are similar.

The percent in poverty in 1979 differs between the Census and the CPS,

indicating the importance of making linked comparisons rather than comparing

CPS 1984 directly with earlier Census years. The incidence of poverty among

blacks is more than double the rate for all races. The broad trends for

blacks are similar to those for all races, but subsequent tables will show

significant racial differences regarding "feminization."

     The percent of poor who are women, presented in Table 2, shows a sharp

increase during the 1960s for both whites and blacks for all poverty

measures, but the increase was larger under the fixed standard than under

the changing standard. One reason for the difference is that both men and

women experienced substantial gains in real income between 1959 and 1969:

under a fixed standard even sex-neutral increases in the average level of

income tend to raise the percent of the poor who are women.

     The effect of sex-neutral changes in income on the feminization of

poverty can be seen in a hypothetical example and then with calculations

based on actual data. Consider first the hypothetical income distributions

in Figure 1; these are, by assumption, the same except that women's income

is, on average, lower than men's. Let the poverty level be initially set at

P1. Assuming an equal number of women and men, the fraction of the poor who

are women is equal to the area under the women's curve to the left of P1

divided by the sum of that area and the area under the men's curve to the

left of P1. Now let average income rise, i.e., let both distributions move

to the right. This is equivalent to setting the poverty level somewhat lower

in the distributions, e.g., at P2. Now the fraction of the poor who are

women will be larger, even though neither the shape of the distributions nor

their relationship to one another has changed. It is possible to draw

distributions with very unusual shapes that do not produce this result, but

empirical experiments with 1984 data confirm the results of the hypothetical

example. When the poverty thresholds are allowed to vary from 1.6 to 0.6 of

the fixed standard threshold in 1984, the percent of the poor who are women

tends to rise the lower the threshold, even though the income distributions

are unchanged.

     Table 2 shows that in 1984 the feminization of poverty was much

greater among blacks than whites. Some differences were present in 1959 and

1969 as well, but divergent trends in the l970s played a major role in

enlarging these differences. Between 1969 and 1979 for whites 18+ there was

virtually no change in the percent of the poor who were women, and for

whites ages 25-64 the percentage actually declined. By contrast, the

feminization of poverty continued for blacks, albeit not as rapidly as in

the l960s. In the most recent period, 1979-84, women's share of the poor

decreased for both races, both age groups, and under both the fixed and

changing standards of poverty.



Sources of Change

    Why is the percentage of adult poor who are women always over 50

percent and why does the percentage change over time? The answer to both

questions is to be found in the distribution of men and women by type of

household and the incidence of poverty in those households. On average, men

earn appreciably more money than women. However, if all men and women lived

in two-sex households, the proportion of poor who are women would always be

approximately one-half because the poverty measures assume equal income

sharing between men and women within households. It is the presence of one-

sex households and the lower income of women than men in those types of

households that determines the feminization of poverty.

     In Table 3 we see that 12.8 percent of white women and 23.9 percent of

black women were in one-sex households in 1984. The incidence of poverty in

such households is appreciably higher than in male one-sex households or in

households that include adults of both sexes. Poverty rates are especially

high for women in one-sex households with children. Comparable tables for

all years, both age groups, and both poverty standards are available on

request.

     The percent of the poor who are women (X) depends on the poverty rate

(R) of each sex in each type of household multiplied by the proportion of

the population in each type of household (M).7 The change in the percent of

the poor who are women (AX) between two years can be decomposed into the

portion attributable to differential changes in the poverty rates of women

and men by household type (AR) and the portion attributable to changes in

the distribution of the adult population across types of households (AM).

The contribution from each source can be estimated by holding constant the

population distribution and allowing the poverty rates to change;

alternatively the poverty rates can be held constant and the distribution of

the population allowed to change.8 Neither approach is perfect because there

may be an interaction effect between changes in poverty rates and changes in

the distribution. This interaction effect is usually small, and an average

of the two approaches is a reasonable way to resolve the problem.

     Tables 4 and 5 present the results of such a decomposition for each

period for all races and separately for whites and blacks. Several interesting

conclusions emerge. First, it is clear that the feminization of poverty that

occurred between 1959 and 1984 was mostly attributable to changes in the

distribution of population by type of household and not to an increasing sex

differential in the incidence of poverty within particular household types.

Indeed, for all races the change in poverty rates alone would have reduced

the percent of the poor who are women except for 18+ under a fixed standard.

     Second, the feminization of poverty was much more severe among blacks

than among whites. By 1984 over 68 percent of the black poor were women (age

18+, fixed standard); the comparable figure for whites was only 62.2 percent.

This was primarily the result of an increase in the number of black women

living in one-sex households with children. As a proportion of the total

black adult population, this group increased from 5.8 percent in 1959 to

12.9 percent in 1984. There were increases for white women as well, but they

were much smaller in magnitude.

    Among whites the feminization of poverty was a phenomenon of the 1960s

only. Since 1969 there has actually been a substantial decrease in the

percent of the white poor that are women. This decrease is entirely

attributable to changes in the poverty rates by household type; changes in

the population distribution across household types were slightly unfavorable

for white women. Among blacks, changes in both poverty rates and population

distributions contributed to the continuing feminization of poverty in the

1970s.

     Between 1979 and 1984 the percent of the poor who are women decreased

for both whites and blacks as a result of changes in poverty rates; the

incidence of poverty increased relatively more rapidly for men than for

women. Indeed, for women in one-sex households without children the poverty

rate (18+, fixed standard) actually declined from 24.1 to 21.2 percent while

the comparable rate for men rose slightly from 12.5 to 12.8 percent. The

poverty statistics undoubtedly reflect the differential trends for men and

women in the labor market. Between 1979 and 1983 the women/men ratio of

average hourly earnings jumped by an unprecedented five percentage points.9

Furthermore, the unemployment rate for men 20 years of age and over

increased from 4.2 to 6.6 percent while the comparable rate for women rose

only half as much- - from 5.7 to 6.8 percent.

     Changes in the percent in poverty between 1959 and 1984 by type of

household are shown in Table 6. As the decomposition calculations suggested,

overall, for all races, these changes were about the same for women as for

men. There were, however, some sex differentials in changes depending upon

 type of household, age group, and poverty standard. In one-sex households

without children the decreases were almost always greater (or increases

 smaller) for women than for men. This was particularly true among blacks:

 the change for black women ranged from -29.4 to -11.5 percentage points,

depending upon age group and poverty standard while the range for black men

was from -11.5 to ÷3.7 percentage points. Black women in one-sex households

with children also showed significant gains relative to black men in similar

circumstances, but the latter group is very small. Unlike the blacks, white

women in one-sex households with children did not fare particularly well in

comparison with their male counterparts.



Alternative Measures

     The feminization of poverty measures presented in this paper are

derived from a particular definition of income and a particular set of

poverty thresholds. It is of some interest to speculate as to how the

measures might differ if alternative definitions and thresholds were used.

     The use of pre-tax rather than after-tax income is probably of little

consequence because neither women nor men in poverty pay much income tax.

Similarly, failure to include an imputation for fringe benefits is probably

not important because these benefits are likely to be small for the poverty

population, and are usually approximately equal for men and women as a

percent of labor income.

     The omission of noncash transfers is probably more significant,

especially for the 18+ category; most of these transfers go to households

headed by persons under 25 or over 64. As a percent of cash income, these

transfers are probably more important for women than men; thus their

inclusion would tend to lower the percent of the poor who are women,

especially in 1969 and 1979. These transfers were relatively small in 1959.

     Probably the most serious shortcoming of cash income as a measure of

economic well-being is that it neglects the value of goods and services

produced in the home. For all households (poor and nonpoor), the value of

home production has been estimated at about one-half of money income)0 The


                                     16
proportion is probably higher than that in low income households and probably

highest of all in female one-sex households. Thus, inclusion of home

production in the definition of income would tend to lower the percent of

the poor who are women. Among whites, however, the reduction would be

largest in 1959 and would get smaller over time as more women in one-sex

households entered the labor force.

     Taking the four possible modifications of the income measure together- -

taxes,                                                            it
         fringe benefits, noncash transfers, and home production- -    seems

that the level of the percent poor who are women would probably be lower

than the figures presented in this paper. The trends in this statistic,

however, would probably not be much affected because of the offsetting

trends in noncash transfers and home production.

     The official poverty thresholds used in this paper were established by

Mollie Orshansky on the basis of food cost estimates for families with

different numbers of adults and children.11 Some arbitrary choices were

made, including the important one that the poverty threshold for a one-

person household should be approximately 80 percent of the threshold for a

two-person household. Research by other investigators on adult equivalent

scales has produced a wide range of answers to the question of how income

needs vary depending upon the number of adults and children in a house-

hold.12 Because there is no consensus concerning the "correct scale," it is

useful to ask how the conclusions about the feminization of poverty might be

affected if different relative poverty thresholds were used. Two alternative

weighting schemes were tried. In one the economies of scale were assumed

to be similar to the official weights but adults were assumed to require

twice the income of children. The other scheme assumed equal needs for

children and adults and no economies of scale. Under either alternative,



                                        17
the percent of poor who are women is lower than when the official thresholds

are used, but the trends in the feminization of poverty are virtually

identical for all three weighting schemes.

     One other possible modification of the conclusions of this paper arises

from consideration of the rule for income sharing within households. When

two or more adults are in the same household, the effective income of each

will depend in part on how their combined income is shared. The official

poverty statistics implicitly assume that income is shared equally

regardless of who provides it, and this assumption has been followed in this

paper. It is supported by casual observation that members of the same

household usually consume similar amounts of housing, food, clothing, ai

other goods and services, even when their contributions to total income are

unequal.

     The equal sharing assumption does present problems for economic

analysis, however, because it implies that when women in two-sex households

increase their contribution to household income there is no effect on their

relative economic well-being. The economic perspective suggests that the

person who provides the income might have more control over its disposition.

In sharp contrast to equal sharing, one could assume that income is shared

among adults in proportion to their contribution to household income. Equal

sharing and proportionate sharing are not the only possible assumptions, but

most others produce results that are intermediate between these two polar

cases.

     If there were proportionate sharing, the percent of the poor who are

women would be much higher than under equal sharing. There would, however,

be a sharp downward trend in the percentage over time because women's money

income has been rising much more rapidly than men's throughout the period.

Between 1959 and 1979 it rose primarily because women's employment rate was


                                     18
increasing while men's was decreasing. Between 1979 and 1984 the divergent

employment trends continued; in addition, there was a substantial increase

in the women/men ratio of hourly earnings.



Summary

     This investigation of the feminization of poverty between 1959 and 1984

has yielded some striking conclusions regarding timing, magnitude, and

causation. There was a substantial increase in the percentage of the poor

who are women- -but it occurred in the 1960s, not in the 1970s or 1980s as is

often alleged. On the contrary, between 1969 and 1979 the percentage held

relatively constant, and then decreased between 1979 and 1984. Over the

entire span 1959-84, the change for whites ranged from +3.6 percentage

points (ages 18+, fixed standard of poverty) to -1.7 percentage points (ages

25-64, changing standard of poverty).

     The trend in feminization was more severe for blacks than for whites,

with the percent of black poor who were women continuing to increase in the

1970s, albeit not as rapidly as in the 1960s. For the entire 25-year period

the change for blacks ranged from +8.5 percentage points (ages 25-64, fixed

standard) to +4.3 percentage points (ages 25-64, changing standard).

     With respect to causation, the feminization of poverty that did occur

was not the result of worsening labor market conditions for women in

comparison with men. Part of the feminization was a statistical artifact:

under a fixed standard the percent of women who are poor rises when income

rises (i.e., when the poverty threshold falls to a lower point on the income

distribution). Substantively, the increase in the proportion of women in

one-sex households was the principal source of feminization of poverty and

a major reason why the trend was more adverse for blacks than whites.



                                        19
     Overall, the trends in poverty rates by type of household were not

better for men than for women, and between 1979 and 1984 they were

distinctly worse. This was the result of relatively favorable labor market

developments for women- - a sharp rise in the women/men ratio of hourly

earnings and a smaller increase in unemployment for women than for men.

Income," The Public Interest, No. 8 (Summer), 1967, pp. 88-95.

        6. To calculate the poverty threshold under the changing standard, the

fixed standard thresholds (already adjusted for price change) for any given

household are multiplied by the following factors: 1959 — 1.00, 1969 — 1.31,

1979 — 1.54, and 1984 — 1.62.
