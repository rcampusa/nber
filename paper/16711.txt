                                              ABSTRACT

While it has long been known that genetic-environmental covariance is likely to be non-trivial and
confound estimates of narrow-sense (additive) heritability for social and behavioral outcomes, there
has not been an effective way to address this concern. Indeed, in a classic paper, Goldberger (1979)
shows that by varying assumptions of the GE-covariance, a researcher can drive the estimated heritability
of an outcome, such as IQ, down to zero or up close to one. Survey questions that attempt to measure
directly the extent to which more genetically similar kin (such as monozygotic twins) also share more
similar environmental conditions than, say, dizygotic twins, represent poor attempts to gauge a very
complex underlying phenomenon of GE-covariance. Methods that rely on concordance between interviewer
classification and self-report offer similar concerns about validity. In the present study, we take advantage
of a natural experiment to address this issue from another angle: Misclassification of twin zygosity
in a nationally-representative study (Add Health). Since such twins were reared under one “environmental
regime of similarity” while genetically belonging to another group, this reverses the typical GE-covariance
and allows us bounded estimates of heritability for a range of outcomes of interest to medical and behavioral
scientists.

Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


Introduction

        To what extent are social and behavioral outcomes (or phenotypes) due to narrow-

sense (additive) genetic heritability (h2)? Notable researchers such as Richard Plomin or

David Rowe, as well as many others, have argued that by comparing social outcomes among

genetically identical twins (i.e. monozygotic twins who share 100 percent of their nuclear

genes) with those from (same sex) fraternal twins (i.e. dizygotic twins who share, on average,

50 percent of their genes, just like singleton siblings), we can properly estimate the genetic,

shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components of traits (see, e.g., Plomin,

DeFries, McClearn, McGuffin, 2001). While there are other approaches to estimating

heritability among humans, this is by far the most common approach and taken to be the least

problematic since, being of a cohort together, both types of twins share uterine environments,

experience societal events at the same time and deal with family transitions also at the same

point in their development.

        In the most naïve approach, narrow-sense (additive) genetic heritability is calculated

as two times the difference between the intra-class correlations of identical and fraternal

twins. (This is often estimated using an ACE model, where A stands for additive genetic

heritability, C for common environment and E for unique environment [essentially an error

term].) However, more recently, much more complex structural models have been offered to

account for various complications such as the fact that—as a result of assortative mating at the

parental level—fraternal twins may share more than 50 percent of their genes. Likewise, non-

linear interactions between alleles—such as dominance—have been modeled in attempts to

get at broad sense heritability (H2) (see Purcell 2002 for a review of these models and

simulation exercises and Purcell and Pak 2002 for an empirical example). And perhaps most




                                                                                                 1
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


importantly, the “equal environments” assumption has been relaxed. For the naïve calculation

mentioned above, it is necessary to assume that the covariance between environment and

genetics is zero—better known as the equal environments assumption (EEA). Put another

way, the simple estimation of heritability requires the rather heroic assumption that identical

twins experience the same degree of similarity in environment as do (same sex) fraternal

twins.

         Such newer models include an estimate of the degree to which environmental

similarity varies with genetic likeness. However, these are just that: estimates—often based

on questions about whether or not respondents were “dressed alike” growing up, whether they

were viewed as similarly as “two peas in a pod” and so on (see, e.g., Lichtenstein, Pedersen,

and McClearn 1992; Rodgers et al. 1999; Rowe and Teachman 2001; Guo and Stearns 2002).

Such questions are likely to capture only some of the ways that environmental similarity

differs across identical and fraternal twin pairs, which is troubling since Goldberger (1979)

has shown that depending on the GE covariance assumed, estimates of heritability can be

driven wildly up or down.

         Other more recent work has used adoptees to infer biological estimates of the

heritability of social traits. For example, Sacerdote (2004) used a dataset of Korean adoptees

in the United States where assignment to families was random (first-come-first-served basis)

to examine the intergenerational correlation on important socioeconomic indicators such as

educational attainment and income; on behaviors such as drinking and smoking; and on

anthropometric measures such as height and weight. The results were then contrasted to

intergenerational correlations among biological families from other data sources as well as

biological children within those same families (for the subsample that contained biological




                                                                                                 2

children). The results showed that—as might be expected—heritability for physical traits was

considerably stronger in biologically intact families. Education (specifically probability of

graduating from a four year college) and income were also much more strongly inherited by

biological descent. However, health-related behavioral inheritance was similar across the two

groups.

          Before we accept the putative inference that education and income are predominantly

genetically transmitted (while smoking and drinking are culturally transmitted) we must

question the external validity of the adoptee sample. While there was adequate variation

within the recipient families of adoptees, on observables, and while they did not look terribly

different on average from non-adopting U.S. families, on observables, we know, ipso facto,

that families who adopt are a distinct social group on unobservables—as are the adoptees

themselves. For example, if socialization is weaker among adoptees who do not feel

connected to their adoptive parents, heritability could appear to be weaker by virtue of this

fact, not the absence of genetic similarity. There are many other dynamics that could be at

work as well, such as increased (or decreased) parental investment, halo effects or stigma and

truncated genetic variability among adoptees (or adopters), which may work to bias estimates

for this population in unpredictable ways. The only adoption study that would avoid such

questions would be one in which adoptees were randomly selected from the newborn

population and then randomly assigned to parents, with both groups blind to the treatment (i.e.

not knowing whether they were adopted or not)—all while prenatal environment was held

constant. In other words, it is an impossibility to reliably estimate genetic heritability using

such an approach.




                                                                                                 3
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


        Another intriguing recent study uses sibling identity by descent (IBD) to estimate

heritability (for height). The approach of Visscher et al. (2006) was to identify the degree to

which siblings shared polymorphisms at about 629 sites (this was the mean number of

markers, the range was 201 to 1,717). The correlation of siblings on measured genotype was

then compared with the degree of their resemblance on the phenotype—in this case height.

The intraclass correlation for siblings ranged from 0.374 to 0.617 (with a mean of 0.498). It is

these differences in IBD that they leverage to identify the genetic similarity and thereby

estimate heritability. However, they make the assumption that this range of sibling genetic

similarity arises from random differences in recombination. However, while this range falls

in line with other estimates (c.f., Gagnon, Beise and Vaupel 2005), it does not just result from

random variation due to recombination and segregation, it could also result from differential

rates of assortative mating at the parental generation. Indeed, in order to arrive at the h2

estimates, Visscher et al. (2006) must assume random mating. This may, in fact, be the case;

however, it is an assumption that could easily be tested by comparing the IBD of the parents

(or by using sibling sets of three or more individuals and then deploying fixed effects before

calculating IBD dyadic correlations on the residual, which would, in fact, be a random result

of recombination). We are not suggesting that Visscher et al.’s estimates are necessarily

wrong, merely that they would be nice complemented by an alternative approach to deal with

GE covariance. We outline such an approach below.



Data and Methods

        Given the intractability of adoption studies and the limitations of IBD correlation

approaches, in the present analysis we deploy a different approach to improve on the standard




                                                                                                 4
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


ACE model: We examine the intra-class correlation for monozygotic and (same sex) dizygotic

twins who accurately perceive their genetic relatedness and separately for those twin sets who

are, in fact, mistaken about their degree of genetic similarity. A non-trivial number of same

sex twins are, in fact, incorrect about their zygosity. In Japan, for example, one study that

deployed four independent samples found that, in each, between a quarter and 30 percent of

MZ twins were misclassified as DZ twins at birth (Ooki, Yokoyama & Asaka 2004).

Likewise, in Norway, a study revealed that a questionnaire approach to classifying the

zygosity of adult twins was inaccurate 2.4 percent of the time when information from both

twins was available and 3.9 percent of the time when information from only one twin was

obtained (due to the death of or non-response from the other twin) (Magnus, Berg, & Nance

1983). Finally, a study in Denmark deployed the four traditional questions typically used to

assign zygosity and then checked these predictions against genetic test results and found that

the overall proportion misclassified was four percent, with the highest error rate among male

monozygotic twins (8 percent) (Christiansen et al. 2003). Finally, a study that genotyped 327

Dutch twin pairs found a parental misclassification rate of 19 percent—largely as a result of

monozygotic twins perceived as dizygotic (Van den Oord, Boomsma & Verhulst. 2000). So

we can imagine the Scandinavian results as lower bounds and the Japanese figure as upper

bounds of twin misclassification. In the United States, the National Longitudinal Survey of

Adolescent Health is the only nationally representative dataset with self-reported zygosity,

researcher-assigned zygosity and “true” genetic zygosity based on genetic testing.

        When we examine these data, we find that six twin sets disagree about their collective

zygosity (these siblings are excluded from our analysis). Of the remaining 254 same sex twin

sets that agree on their zygosity, 45 are incorrect (17.7 percent). The vast majority of these




                                                                                                 5
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


misperceiving siblings (82.2 percent) are genetically monozygotic twins who thought they

were dizygotic. These zygosity assessments are obtained in the first wave of data collection,

when the twins range in age from 12 to 18. Thus the 18 percent misclassification rate is

understandably lower than the Japanese rate at birth. Likewise, it is understandably higher

than the Norwegian or Danish rates, which were asked of adults and were not self-perceived

zygosity but rather interviewer assigned zygosity based on a series of questions. Indeed,

when Add Health assigns zygosity to twin sets based on a series of questions (such as whether

they looked like two peas in a pod as children and were confused by strangers, teachers, or

family members), the misclassification rate falls to a mere 5.9 percent. However, a significant

additional proportion (6.6 percent) of twin sets remain “undetermined” under this

methodology.

        Add Health assigned twin zygosity based on a series of questions about similarity.

These questions include: growing up, how alike did you and your twin look? Like two peas in

a pod or family members; did you and your twin ever confuse strangers?; did you and your

twin ever confuse teachers?; did you and your twin ever confuse family members? The

similarity score for each pair is the average of these confusability questions for both twins.

(These are the same sort of questions typically used to estimate GE covariance.) If a pair was

missing answers to these questions, mothers’ responses to questions about similarity were

used. Comparing similarity score to self-reported zygosity among same-sex twins, Add

Health made classification decisions based on a natural cut-point, “a cutoff score where the

score distribution seemed to divide naturally” (Rowe and Jacobson 1998: 2).

        If a pair claimed they were fraternal, but Add Health would have classified them as

identical based on a high similarity score, they were classified as undetermined. Add Health




                                                                                                 6
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


suggests excluding these pairs or treating them as fraternal. Since we are concerned not with

correct classification by the survey researcher, but rather with the lived experience of the

twins themselves, we rely primarily on their self-reported zygosity to take advantage of the

misclassified twins to interrogate the equal environments assumption.

        To question the equal environments assumption, we compare the degree of

resemblance among same-sex twins whose genetic and self-reported zygosity match, to those

whose identities do not align with their genetic zygosity. Twin self-report is privileged over

Add Health classification of zygosity because it better indicates twins’ subjective experience.

However, intra-class correlations are run multiple times, using both self-reported zygosity and

Add Health classification in order to make sure results are not an artifact of our choices. (This

sensitivity analysis shows that they are, in fact, similar, though not identical possibly due to

differences in sample size; see Table 2.) We are not the first researchers to pursue this

“misclassification strategy” to interrogate heritability estimates. Goodman and Stevenson

(1989) use this methodology to disentangle genetic and environmental effects among a sample

of 13-year-old British twins and find that hyperactivity and attentiveness appear to be about

half heritable. They (1989: 694) assign “true” zygosity based on “physical similarity, the

number of choria and placentae, and the hospital doctors ascription of zygosity and the

parental opinion”; when these sources disagreed, fingerprints were analyzed and blood group

was gathered in a few cases. Xian et al. (2000), Scarr and Carter-Saltzman (1979), and

Kendler et al. (1993) find evidence to support the equal environments assumption based on a

variety of twin data. Kendler and colleagues use female twins from the Virginia Twin

Registry, Xian et al. use male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, and Scarr uses

Philadelphia-area twins. Although Scarr and Carter-Saltzman use blood group and Kendler et




                                                                                                 7
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


al. use DNA data to identify genetic zygosity for pairs of “probable” or “uncertain” status,

Xian et al. rely solely on questions about similarity with no molecular evidence. Meanwhile,

while innovative for the late 1970s, Scarr’s and Carter-Saltzmann’s blood group approach is

problematic since these loci are not definitive or comprehensive enough. For example, in

their data DZ twins differed only on an average of 2.75 blood group loci out of 12. With such

high similarity among DZ twins, it implies that many sets who are similar on 12 out of 12 may

nonetheless be DZ by chance. Kendler et al.’s approach is the closest to ours. However, they

rely on a localized sample and similarity questions and photographs (available for about 80%

of twins) to assign zygosity for a majority of their twin pairs. They classified pairs as definite,

probable, or uncertain zygosity status based on similarity questions and photographs and then

attempted to gather blood samples for the probable and uncertain categories (186 pairs).

Blood samples, and therefore genetic zygosity, were available for 119 of these 186 pairs.

Genetic information was available for 26 pairs classified as definite zygosity and validated

Kendler’s assignment in all cases. For the “probable” group, genetic zygosity matched their

assignment for 83% of the pairs. To summarize, Kendler’s final zygosity assignment relies on

DNA data where available (a small portion of their pairs) and definite or probable

classification based on similarity questions and photographs. Their DNA data suggests

zygosity is assigned with high validity, but some error certainly remains – particularly among

pairs in the probable category without genetic data. In contrast to the studies above, genetic

zygosity is available for all twins in our data. Like Goodman and Stevenson (1989) and Xian

et al., Kendler et al. focus on psychopathologies: major depression, generalized anxiety

disorder, phobia, bulimia, and alcoholism. All of these studies find little evidence for

significant violations of the equal environments assumption.




                                                                                                 8
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


         Against this backdrop, we are the first to apply this misclassification approach to a

recent, nationally representative sample with genetic zygosity information for all twins over a

wide range of behavioral and anthropometric outcomes and to address possible bias in the

relationship between misclassification and phenotypic similarity due to reverse causation

(phenotypic non-resemblance causing misclassification) by comparing perceived zygosity to

birth weight discordance.

         We focus on the third wave of Add Health panel data for sibling pairs, which surveyed

respondents in 2001-2 when they were ages 18-26. Siblings of individuals identified as twins

in the stratified (nationally representative) sample were added, yielding 64 percent of sibling

pairs from the probability sample and 36 percent from convenience sampling. In other words,

to increase the number of pairs, some siblings were added after the random sampling strategy.

Sampling weights are therefore not available for genetic data.

Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


        Genetic zygosity was determined by 11 “highly polymorphic, unlinked short tandem

repeat (STR) markers: D1S1679, D2S1384, D3S1766, D4S1627, D6S1277, D7S1808,

D8S1119, D9S301, D13S796, D15S652 and D20S481” and a sex-linked-locus (Harris et al.

2006:992). Twins are classified as genetically monozygotic if they match at all 11 loci. Our

sample includes nearly 150 identical twin pairs and over 110 same-sex fraternal twin pairs

(although the exact sample size depends on the number of pairs with complete outcome data).

Table 1 compares genetic zygosity to perceived zygosity in Panel A and Add Health assigned

zygosity in Panel B. Panel A shows that 74 genetically identical twins perceive themselves as

fraternal, while 16 genetically fraternal twins believe they are identical. Supplemental tables

(S1-S3) provide descriptive measures by zygosity category and compare perceived and

assigned zygosity to the similarity index Add Health used to assign zygosity. Mean

differences between correctly and incorrectly classified twins are only significant for high

school GPA and birth weight.

        Our phenotypes include the following: Birth weight; height; weight; BMI; depression

score; ADHD; delinquency; and cumulative high school GPA. Birth weight is reported by

parents, measured in ounces, and logged. Height and weight, used to calculate body mass

index, are self-reported in wave 3. Depression is measured using the Center for

Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). It consists of 20 questions included in the

Add Health survey which ask respondents to rate the frequency of a depressive symptom from

0 (never/rarely) to 3 (most/all of the time). The sum of responses for all 20 items indicates the

frequency of depressive symptoms. A scale of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder

(ADHD) behaviors is constructed from 18 questions asked in wave 3 about behavior when the

individual was between 5 and 12 years old. The ADHD scale indicates how often




                                                                                                 10

(never/rarely, sometimes, often, or very often) the youth fidgeted, had difficulty sustaining

attention in tasks, was forgetful, had difficulty organizing tasks or activities, and left his seat

when being seated was expected, among other things. Cumulative high school GPA is

gathered from high school transcripts. Heritability for these phenotypes can be simply

estimated from the following equation 1:

        Var(y) = Var(g) + Var(e) + 2 Cov(g, e).                                                  (1)

Where y is an outcome or phenotype, g is the genetic contribution, and e is the environmental

contribution. Researchers usually suppose that Cov(g, e) = 0, so the equation reduces to

Var(y) = Var(g) + Var(e). Then heritability is the ratio Var(g)/Var(y). To estimate this using

MZ and DZ twin correlations, we rely on the following assumptions:

        rmz = A + C                                                                              (2)

        rdz =0.5A + C                                                                            (3)


Where A is shared genetics, C is shared environment, and the 0.5 coefficient for DZ twins

echoes the notion that they share, on average, 50 percent of their genes. (If positive

assortative mating is at play, then this biases heritability downward). We then difference

equations 2 and 3 and solve for A to yield equation 4, below:

Finally, we can deduce C from equation 2:

        C = rmz – A                                                                              (5)


And since we assume that MZ twins reflect maximal environmental and genetic similarity, E

(the effect of unique environment) is simply:

        E = 1 – rmz                                                                              (6)




                                                                                                       11
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


Again, this model is identified only because we assume away the covariance of A and C (cov

GE in our earlier notation). However, in our case, we will estimate two versions of the model,

one where we know that the 2*cov(G*E) term is positive—that includes the cases where the

genetic and social zygosity match—and one where we assume the 2*cov(G*E) is negative due

to the self-misclassification of the twins’ zygosity. The covariance should be positive for

correctly classified twins (because genetic and environmental similarity are aligned) but

negative for misclassified twins (because environmental treatment should not mesh with

genetic similarity). Therefore, we hypothesize that heritability estimates among correctly

classified twins should overestimate heritability, while estimates among misclassified twins

should underestimate heritability. Of course, we do not know a figure for the GE covariance

for each group, but its valence is enough to test classically-determined heritability estimates

for bias. We will not, then, try to estimate the *true* heritability (or the *true* parameters for

components C and E), but merely obtain a sense of whether the bias is substantively and

statistically significant.

        In a second approach, we use Kendler et al.’s strategy of comparing model fit with and

without perceived zygosity in the model. Phenotype is regressed on genetic zygosity and sex

for all twins by genetic zygosity (among same-sex, white, same-sex white, and all twins),

alternately including perceived zygosity. Genetic zygosity is coded 0.5 for DZ and 1 for MZ

twins. Perceived zygosity is 0 for DZ, 0.5 if twins disagree, and 1 for MZ. Akaike (AIC) and

Bayesian information criteria (BIC) are used to select the model best balancing data fit and

parsimony (Raftery 1986; 1995). In both cases, lower values indicate better fit. BIC alone is

insufficient because it may overvalue parsimony or simpler models (Weakliem 1999).

Therefore, it is important to consider both statistics in deciding which model fits best.




                                                                                                 12
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


        One concern with our research strategy might be that we are reversing the causal

process: Perhaps it is the case that twins who deviate greatly on the phenotypes of interest—

say height, weight, GPA, affect—are then socially misclassified? This would then suggest

that cov(G,E) is predicted by var(y), confounding our attempts at decomposition. To address

this possibility, ideally we would instrument misclassification. As we shall show below, we

do have a factor that temporally precedes self-perception of zygosity and strongly predicts it,

thus fulfilling the first condition necessary for an instrument. This factor is birth weight

differences between the twins. However, birth weight differences are likely to have direct

effects on the similarity in phenotypes we consider, net of misclassification status. Birth

weight has been shown to affect a range of anthropometric measures (see, e.g., Conley, Strully

and Bennett 2003 for a review), and recent work has shown that differences themselves, in

fact, have predictive power for the differences between siblings (including twins) (see Conley

and Rauscher 2010). Thus, birth weight differences violate the exclusion restriction and

would thus fail as an instrument. Indeed, it is likely that any factor that would affect the

probability of misclassification would also affect the phenotypes, thus we abandoned the hope

for an instrumentation strategy and rely instead on simple comparisons between correctly and

incorrectly classified groups. That said, the birth weight analysis gives us some comfort in the

notion that misclassification was a result of differences that began at birth and not as a result

of the phenotypes under study.

          twins is stronger than fraternal twins, whether the identical twins correctly perceive their

          zygosity or not. BMI shows a stronger distinction between genetically MZ and DZ twins,

          which supports the argument that BMI is largely heritable (e.g., Allison et al. 1996 find h² of

          BMI is between 0.5 and 0.7 based on twin data from Finland, Japan, and the US). Wide

          standard error bars illustrate the problem with using genetically fraternal twins who believe

          they are identical. The small sample sizes for misclassified DZ twins preclude using them.

                  Table 2 presents intraclass correlations of phenotypes by classification status for

          identical and fraternal twins. Heritability estimates using all correctly classified twins

          (column 5) and incorrectly classified MZ twins (column 6) are calculated for each phenotype.

          Figure 3 graphically compares heritability estimates for these correctly and incorrectly

          classified twins.

Figure 3: Narrow-sense (additive) heritability estimates (h2) for correctly and incorrectly
classified twins based on figures from Table 2a.




The estimated heritabilities of body mass index and height are about the same among

correctly and incorrectly classified twins. Estimated heritability of height is slightly higher

among incorrectly identified MZ twins, but in general estimates for BMI and height do not

provide evidence that correctly classified twins underestimate heritability.

        In contrast to these largely inherited outcomes, behavioral outcomes such as

depression, ADHD, and GPA show higher heritability among incorrectly classified twins.

Estimated heritability is only slightly higher for GPA, but substantially for ADHD and

depression among misclassified twins. Oddly, identical twins who believe they are fraternal

are more similar in GPA, depression, and ADHD symptoms than other MZ twins. (The

difference is only significant for depression, however.) There could, of course, be a

complicated behavioral response to similarity and difference across measures. For example,

MZ twins who perceive themselves as DZ may be more similar in their psychological

reactions to what they may sense as some discrepancy (perhaps that they are more “similar”

on physical measures than they might expect to be given their belief that they are dizygotic—


                                                                                                 16
Interrogating the ‘Equal Environments’ Assumption: Misclassified Twins as a Natural Experiment


however, mean levels of depression are not different for this misclassified group,

complicating this story). Alternatively, it could be that MZ twins who correctly perceive

themselves to be MZ psychologically seek to individuate more than those who perceive

themselves as DZ and thus do not feel compelled to form psychological niches. Overall,

comparing estimates for correctly and incorrectly classified twins suggest traditional

heritability estimates are not overestimated, and may in fact be underestimated for behavioral

phenotypes - particularly depression.

        Columns 7-10 in Table 2 list estimated shared and unshared environmental

contribution to phenotypes. Similar to the heritability estimates, shared environmental

estimates are quite similar using correctly and incorrectly classified MZ correlations, except

for depression and to a small extent ADHD. Depression and ADHD estimates suggest shared

environment is less important among identical twins who believe they are fraternal. This

suggests the equal environments assumption may be problematic, because shared environment

is more important for twins who believe they are identical. Correctly classified identical twins

may be treated more similarly than genetically MZ twins who believe they are fraternal.

Shared environment estimates of ADHD and depression are negative, however, for incorrectly

classified MZ twins, which makes this evidence weak. Estimated individual environmental

contributions (E) are generally larger than shared environment (C). Only height and GPA

have smaller individual environmental contributions – for both correctly and incorrectly

classified identical twins.

depression difference using AIC and BIC statistics. Regressions include genetic zygosity (.5

for DZ and 1 for MZ twins) and an indicator for male (indicators for both male and opposite

        sex in twin pair models including non-same-sex twins). Following Kendler et al., model fit is

        compared to a model including perceived zygosity (0 for DZ, .5 if twins disagree, and 1 for

        MZ). An AIC or BIC difference of 5 indicates a significant difference in model fit and lower

        values are better. In every case, using both AIC and BIC, perceived zygosity significantly

        improves model fit among white, same sex, same sex white, and all twins. Perceived zygosity

        improves prediction of both individual depression and twin pair depression difference,

        suggesting environmental differences due to perception are nontrivial.

                 Table 4 offers evidence that twin misclassification is driven at least partially by very

        early differences. Twins who are genetically identical, but misperceive themselves as

        fraternal, have significantly higher differences in birth weight. The sample size for incorrectly

        classified DZ twins is only 7 pairs, so results for this group are not conclusive. Among MZ

        twins, however, perceived zygosity is related to birth weight differences.

        Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between birth weight and perceived zygosity.

Misclassified MZ twins have substantially lower similarity in birth weight than all other twin

types and likely encouraged their identification as DZ twins. Misclassified DZ twins had

slightly higher birth weight similarity than their correctly classified counterparts, but the

sample size is too small to reach significance.

Discussion

        Although it may be partially endogenous to the phenotypes studied here,

misperception is significantly related to a much earlier difference – birth weight – which

suggests misperception is not primarily codetermined with phenotypic similarity. Overall, the

evidence suggests that typical twin heritability estimates of behavioral outcomes are not

upwardly biased by failing to address the covariance between genes and environment. In

other words, our evidence supports the equal environments assumption. Our results therefore

build on previous research to suggest that phenotypic similarity and perceived zygosity are not

co-determined. Perceived zygosity is influenced by differences as early as birth. Therefore,

evidence supports methods used here and in previous studies which compare similarity based

on actual and perceived zygosity to assess the equal environments assumption.

        Results suggest that heritability estimates may be higher if we deploy comparisons

among twins who misperceive their zygosity – but mainly for behavioral phenotypes. While

we may not make much of these differences, they at least give us comfort that by setting the

GE covariance term to zero in standard heritability models, we are not significantly biasing

results. A number of approaches—ranging from the misclassification strategy pursued here to

using IBD sibling resemblance models—seem to be converging on the results that the old

narrow-sense heritability estimates are not far off. This assumes, of course, that the other

assumption of random mating holds. However, if parents tend to be more alike genetically

than they would be if mating were random (a likely case, especially if we believe genes are

related to phenotypes and the same phenotypes that researchers tend to study are those on

which mates also sort), then heritability estimates would be downwardly biased. There are

instances where we might expect genetic opposites to attract, such as the major




                                                                                                 20

histocompatibility complex where genetic diversity increases the chances of species or

population survival through an epidemic. The phenotypes of interest to most social scientists

and those studied here, however, are likely to see assortative mating (educational assortative

mating – related to GPA, ADHD, delinquency, and depression – offers the most obvious

example). So all in all, it seems reasonable to take results from an ACE model more or less

at face value. In fact, we come to this conclusion grudgingly, having set out on this empirical

exercise with the assumption that we were going to show h2 to be overstated for our range of

phenotypes due to omitted, positive GE covariance.

Supplementary Material

Supplemental tables provide descriptive measures by zygosity category (S1) and compare perceived and assigned zygosity to the
similarity index Add Health used to assign zygosity (S2 and S3). Mean differences between correctly and incorrectly classified twins
are only significant for high school GPA and birth weight. Identical twins who believe they are fraternal have significantly higher
high school GPAs than correctly identified identical twins. The same pattern does not hold among fraternal twins who believe they
are identical. Overall, all misclassified twins have significantly higher GPAs than all correctly classified twins. Birth weight is
significantly higher among fraternal twins who believe they are identical than correctly perceived fraternal twins. This difference is
not significant among identical or all twins.

Tables S2 and S3 show Add Health zygosity assignment by similarity score (based on
responses to questions about how similar the twins are). Table S2 illustrates the main
cut-off in similarity for Add Health-assigned zygosity. Table S3 shows that similarity
score and self-perceived zygosity is not as strongly related.

             Table S4 offers the same measures as Table 2 in the main text, but based on zygosity
             assigned by Add Health rather than perceived zygosity. Samples sizes are smaller for
             mis-assigned than misperceived twins (18 and 12 vs. 74 and 16 as shown in Table 1), but
             results are generally similar. Exceptions (differences of more than 0.10) are highlighted,
             but probably reflect the small number of mis-assigned twins.
