                                              ABSTRACT

A large literature has documented an association between economic growth and export diversification.
We study this question in France between 1836 and 1938. The period witnessed the onset of modern
economic growth and sharp changes in the level of international competition. We use a new long term
database on French foreign trade at a high level of disaggregation. At the dawn of the first Globalization,
France appears to have specialized along Ricardian lines, exporting a handful of textile products in
large quantities. There is a decrease in specialization from 1860 to World War I along the lines of
modern studies. Changes in trade costs along with economic growth help explain the evolution of
France’s comparative advantage. The decline of export concentration is associated with a chronic deficit
in the balance of trade during the Belle Époque and the major part of the interwar period particularly
after 1927.

   1. Introduction


   Decades of research on France’s economic fortunes during the 19th century come to the
conclusion that France was a laggard in the adoption of new technologies. Another strand of
the literature emphasizes the slow growth of French exports and other difficulties in
competing internationally. The latter is often taken to be a reflection of the country’s subpar
economic performance.
        Standard Ricardian trade models applied to 19th century France might help explain the
nation’s apparent difficulties. Having to compete with price competitive British exports would
lead France to specialize in an ever shorter and more specific range of manufactured products.
Since Temin (1997) has persuasively shown that early 19th century Britain was exporting an
increasingly large range of manufactured goods, the possibility of de-industrialization and
intensified specialization in France would not be unexpected in this view. The pace of French
productivity growth lagged the British implying British dominance in many manufactured
goods. Nevertheless, in a world of differentiated goods, the economic growth and
productivity improvement seen in France in the 19th century might have been associated with
improved prospects for French exports in new as well as old products.
        The very same Ricardian model, say that of Dornbusch et al. (1977), also makes an
interesting prediction about patterns of specialization when trade costs change. For a country
facing decreasing trade costs, in this case those associated with the first globalization and
trade liberalization, a new range of exports would emerge. A host of new imports would flood
in. As is well-known, France did not de-industrialize in the 19th century despite its relatively
poor performance. Moreover, France did transition to modern economic growth in the 19th
century in addition to seeing marked changes in trade costs due to large shifts in trade policy
and globalization.
       As it turns out, neither did France end up specializing in an increasingly narrow range
of goods. Rather than being outcompeted by Great Britain, trade cost changes and economic
growth may have been the dominant forces in explaining 19th century patterns of French trade
and specialization. While its exports did not grow as quickly as other countries, and its trade
balance worsened after 1860, France diversified its export portfolio after the mid-19th century.
       In this paper we document for the first time the evolution of France’s comparative
advantage during a period that encompasses the onset of modern economic growth and which
witnessed large changes in trade costs. Recent work for the modern period by Cadot, Carrere
and Strauss Khan (2011, 2013) has highlighted that the initial stages of modern economic
growth and trade liberalization are two key drivers of trade diversification. We are unaware of
any direct examination of this issue in the historical record. Strikingly, we find evidence in
support of these dynamics in this particular historical setting.
        More generally, if the pattern of exports reflects the sectoral allocation of economic
activity, we are able to make inroads on gauging the level of sectoral diversification in France
between 1836 and 1938 in the absence of reliable and consistent information on the sectoral
allocation of employment and output. Doing so allows us to connect the French experience to

                                               2
Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) who document that sectoral concentration in terms of employment
follows a U-shape against per capita income. Sectoral diversification increases at low levels
of per capita income, but there exists a level of output per capita beyond which the sectoral
distribution starts concentrating again. Their evidence suggests an increase in export
diversification during the early stages of economic growth and a subsequent concentration.
Our data allow us to examine this stylized fact for a leading country prior to World War II
whereas Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) focussed only on post-World War II data.
        Our analysis relies on a newly digitized long-run database of highly disaggregated
French foreign trade. We use information on imports and exports disaggregated at the product
level to consider the evolution of the composition of imports and exports. We employ
conventional measures of comparative advantage and diversification including export and
import concentration ratios, coverage ratios, and the Lafay index of specialization. We also
investigate the short-run dynamics and determinants of specialization. Econometric
specifications test the stability of specialization and link specialization with trade policy.
Overall we find that France became increasingly diversified over the period we study, but that
the diversification process slowed dramatically from the 1880s. Evidence points to the idea
that lower international trade costs, economic growth and broad-based productivity advance
drove these early changes. As trade policy became more protectionist after the 1880s, and the
economy matured, the diversification evident between 1860 and 1880 lost momentum. It is
likely that the process of diversification bottomed out due to economic growth itself as
suggested by Cadot et. al. and many other studies.
        This new evidence permits us to highlight French trade performance over the long run
in the British (and later the German) mirror. The literature tends to emphasize the inability of
French manufacturers to compete, and it is often argued that France lagged behind other
industrial nations like Germany, the US, and Great Britain. While changes in relative
productivity may have been disadvantageous to certain sectors in France, in some respects,
France’s export economy thrived in the midst of adversity. Economic growth, which was not
insignificant, carried with it a dividend of diversity as regards economic activity and leading
exports. In addition, falling trade costs allowed previously uncompetitive product lines to be
exported. By the late 19th century rising trade costs associated with resurgent protectionism
seem to have locked France into older patterns of production.
        The article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a survey concerning French
international trade between 1836 and 1938. Section 3 introduces the original database and
some key data. Section 4 provides an analysis of the dynamics of France’s comparative
advantage and specialization using conventional methodologies. The final section discusses
the relation between trade policy and the degree of specialization. We conclude with some
explanations and propose some new lines of research.


   2. France: Relative Decline in the 19th Century?
    There is a large volume of research in the economic and historical literature on France’s
foreign trade between the 1830s and WWII. However, this research is fragmented and is
unable to offer a complete and clear view of long-run tendencies and trends. Pioneering
research by Tyszynski (1951) analyses the evolution of exports in manufactured products’

                                               3
after 1899 concluding that the French share of manufactured exports - in a sample of eleven
major countries - decreased from 15.8% in 1899 to 6.4% in 1937. Yates (1959) focusses on
primary products during the first part of twentieth century. Maizels (1963) applies shift-share
analysis to manufactured goods exports between 1899 and 1913 in order to explain an
apparent “French foreign trade decline” that witnessed limited geographical diversification.
France is often characterized as being unable to take advantage of the opportunities afforded
by the first wave of globalization. French exporters, it is often argued, failed to establish
themselves in distant emerging markets which were enjoying strong growth (e.g., the United
States, Latin America or Asia). None of these studies examine the issue of the evolution of
French specialization patterns and the international division of labor.
     Recent papers pay particular attention to short-to-medium term outcomes or specific
sectors. Verley (1988) analyses the links between exports and economic growth during the
1860s applying a sectoral method. He found that export spill-over effects were reduced after
the trade liberalization of the mid-19th century. Broder (1993) calculated effective protection
to call into question the effects of the Méline tariff on specialization responding to an earlier
literature which had established that rising tariffs were not effective in developing new sectors
such as electric materials or agricultural mechanicals. Broder (2006) focuses on exports and
imports of ‘Machines and Mechanicals’ between 1874 and 1913 showing a lack of innovation
in these sectors, and hence an inability to successfully export such items. Other authors
suggest that French trade policy was not an offensive one but a defensive one. Even when
considering a longer period, research focusses on only a few points in time (Weiller, 1971;
Bairoch, 1977; Levy-Leboyer and Bourguignon, 1990; Lefeuvre, 1993; Guillaumet, 2002).
For example, Bairoch (1993) studies the sectoral structure of exports at only three points in
time: 1886/90. 1911/13 and 1926/29. The latter studies miss the long-run, global trends.
    Using annual data, Verley (1997) studies the evolution of seven principal exports between
1827 and 1880 in order to analyse their relationship with French industrialization. He focuses
on the textile industry and finds that French exports in the sector were largely complementary
to British textile exports on global markets. From the 1820s, the variety of textile products
exported and produced increased. This rise was founded on fashion effects, innovation
strategies and market segmentation. Because of higher mechanization and hence labor
productivity, the UK gained a comparative advantage in the mass production of standardized
cotton textiles. The UK had other advantages in complex textiles manufacturing due to new
technologies such as the power loom, spinning mule, factory organization and applied steam
power. France’s textile exports included high quality products (silk trade from Lyon, print
cotton from Alsace, articles from Paris…) destined for the luxury markets. Skilled labor was a
relatively abundant factor of production (Crouzet, 2003). In the early 19th century, France
exported textiles towards a great number of countries not only in Europe but also more distant
areas such as Latin America the US etc. By the mid to late 19th century newly industrialised
countries such as the USA and the Zollverein imported textiles from France in a sort of intra-
industry trade. It would be wrong to say that these industrial upstarts were in pure competition
over homogenous goods with French products.
    Studying the impact of protectionism in four top industrial countries (France, Germany,
Italy and UK), Dormois (2009) computes revealed comparative advantage for France in 1873,
1885, 1900 and 1913; France appears to have a significant specialization in finished textiles


                                               4
and trinkets. During the first globalization, French specialization in textiles such as cotton,
wool, and silk is clearly established by the extant historiography.
    The decline of French trade power during first globalization is also well-known in
historiography (Cameron, 1961 or Maizels, 1963). As evidence of this decline, Bairoch
(1993) shows that France was the world’s second largest exporter until 1871 falling to the 4th
largest exporter from 1875 (behind Germany, the United States, and Great Britain). Indeed,
the share of France in world exports increased from 9% in 1847 to 16% in 1865 but this figure
quickly fell thereafter attaining 7% in 1913. Compared to other European countries, the
French “decline” appears to be unique (Lewis, 1981; Federico and Wolf, 2011; Dedinger,
2012; Huberman et al., 2015).
    Crouzet (2003) blames the apparent slow growth of French exports after 1860 on a rise in
wages induced by a ‘shortage of labor’. Indeed, France suffered recurrent trade deficits from
the end of the 1870s. These imbalances only worsened in the 1880s. Indicators of trade
openness, (i.e., the share of value added exported) tell a similar story (Asselain and
Blancheton, 2005). The French index of openness contracted at the beginning of the 1880s
while other Western European countries “opened up” (see Lewis, 1981). This is as true for
France’s major competitors like the UK and Germany (see Lewis, 1981) as it is for laggards
in industrialisation such as Italy (see Federico and Wolf, 2011) and Spain (Tena-Junguito,
2007). One possibility for France’s decline is of course slower economic growth and
productivity advance. Comparing labor productivity levels and variations, Dormois (2009)
shows that the French lagged the UK and Germany between 1871 and 1911. Dormois
concludes, as did Bairoch and Crafts previously, there was a decreasing level of French
industrial competitiveness. Lévy-Leboyer and Bourguignon (1990. p.65) highlight: “an error
in estimating market trends. Contemporary observations show that manufacturers did not
recognize in time that with the development of the urban market, durability and strength,
which had justified the successful exportation of their products, ceased to be selling points”. 1
    Once all these various assessments are put together, the diagnosis of decreasing
competitiveness of French exports owing to industrial failure after 1870 becomes the
predominant theme of the literature. The empirical basis for such a conclusion, however, is
very slim. Previous work has not been able to reach this conclusion on the basis of the
universe of trade data given the difficulty of processing the necessarily large datasets
involved. Bringing these puzzle’s pieces together in this way still does not give a complete
view of French participation in the global market of the 19th and early 20th century, its overall
specialization, and the dynamics of France’s comparative advantage. It is fair to say that, to
date, there is no general overview of French foreign trade and specialization for the entire
period in question. The present study is the first to make use of a comprehensive annual
database documenting product-level trade for France’s over the period 1836-1938.


    3. Data and global view of France’s foreign trade 1836-1938


1
  Senger (2015) shows a French deficiency in terms of market information. From the 1880s exporters were
unable to capitalize on foreign market trends. The ‘Agents system’ (commissionaires) used by French exporters
in all industries cut the direct link between foreign markets and producers. Furthermore, the “agents” captured
high gross margins reducing French competitiveness.

                                                      5
    To analyse the composition of trade over time in terms of both commodities imported and
exported, our strategy has been to build an original disaggregated database for France’s
foreign trade. Data are recorded annually between 1836 and 1938. Our main data source is the
Tableau général du commerce de la France avec ses colonies étrangères (Tableau général du
commerce et de la navigation after 1896).




3.1 Global Perspective
During this 103 year period, France’s economy changed significantly. Per capita GDP grew at
an annual rate of roughly 1.2% between 1836 and 1938. The share of labor employed in
industrial production rose from 25% to 31% between 1841 and 1911. Around 1911 the share
of labor employed in industry surpassed that of the share in agriculture (Crouzet, 2003). The
share of total output accounted for by industrial output moved from 29% to 39% between
1841 and 1911. To be sure, productivity in industry was relatively low in textiles compared to
the UK. Overall labor productivity levels in industry stood close to those of its close rivals
Britain and Germany in 1870 but by about 1910 France had fallen behind to a level 80% of
that in Germany and France (Dormois, 2009).
        At the beginning of the period, France exported roughly 5% of its total GDP. For the
years 1910-1913 this figure increased to just over 14%. At the same time, the share of total
exports accounted for by manufactured goods fell from 68% in 1836 to 48.9% in 1913. Unlike
the late 19th century US which became a net exporter of manufactures and where industrial
goods came to dominate exports (Irwin, 2003), France’s net exports of manufactured goods
declined over time. In spite of this change, the share of manufactured exports in total exports
during this period never declined below 43% (1937) (see Figure A1 in the Appendix). While
speculative, these observations about the US and France, and possibly even the conclusion of
Temin (1997), are consistent with the idea that the leading countries experienced a
diversification of exports as modern economic growth commenced.
        France’s leading sectors in the 19th century were textiles and of course wine. Circa
1860 cotton, woolen, and silk textiles accounted for a large share of exports. Textiles made up
around 1/3 of all industrial output, and half of all industrial employment amongst
establishments surveyed for the census of 1861 (Nye, 1987). This sector was once heavily
criticized for being much less technologically progressive than Britain’s industry and for the
small size of its establishments. Subsequent research has shown that relative factor prices may
help explain some of these differences (Allen, 2009). Inefficient establishment size has
seemingly been exaggerated (Nye, 1987). Over the course of the long run, textile exports
increased in absolute terms with an annual average growth rate of 0.51% between 1860 and
1913. Despite facing enhanced international competition, French producers were able to
grow.
        These aggregate trends are interesting, and the snapshot analysis of firm size from
1860-61 is interesting. However, the underlying dynamics of the evident changes are not well
understood in the French case. In France, no dramatic change in factor endowments is evident
as in the USA where massive resource discoveries provided the backbone of the American
transformation.

                                              6
        The leading hypotheses for these changes seem to be relatively slow productivity
growth and/or declines in trade costs. The Imbs and Wacziarg hypothesis does not specifically
address the open-economy issues, but it stands to reason that export concentration may mirror
trends in the structure of production assuming a world of differentiated goods and a love of
variety. Moreover, evidence from the modern period by Cadot et. al (2011, 2013) suggests
that economic growth and trade policy are two major drivers of export diversification.
       To gain further insight we resort to analysis of a new highly disaggregated data set on
exports and imports. Using annual observations between 1836 and 1938 we are able to track
the experience of France as a function of productivity changes as well as numerous (positive
and negative) shocks to trade costs.


3.2 A New Disaggregated Data Set on French Trade
        Our data set covers 107 headings for imports and about 135 for exports (corresponding
to SITC rev.3 classifications). Concerning the definition of trade, we track “commerce
spécial” and not “commerce général”. Data from “commerce spécial” includes the value of
goods imported for national consumption and the value of national production exported. Since
“commerce général” includes goods in transit these data are less useful for our purposes. Our
data set does not include traffic from tourism which can be significant as in the case of
garments, underwear, trinkets, perfumes etc. Another common problem of nineteenth century
trade statistics concerns valuations of goods and the use of official prices. After 1847 the
French Tableau provides only ‘valeurs annuelles’ using conventional prices defined by a
committee and not ‘valeurs officielles’ founded on traders statements (see Dormois, 2009,
chapter 4). The ‘valeurs annuelles’ were averages of market-based prices but some judgment
and discretion may have been involved in deciding the exact values.
        We now proceed to analyze the share of exports by product for France during these
years. First, it is noticeable that the list of France’s major exports did not differ markedly
from the beginning of the period up to 1913. These major products consisted of about a dozen
items including finished textiles (silk, woolen and cotton fabrics), wine, fancy goods and
trinkets. 2 In 1913, France’s main exporting industries were still those which had made their
fame under the Second Empire, only their share in total trade had been dwindling. During the
Belle Epoque (1870-1913) France is generally seen to have been unable to get a leg up in
modern specializations representative of the Second Industrial Revolution. Whereas Germany
came to dominate in fields like ‘machines and mechanicals’ (Dormois, 2009) and Switzerland
succeeded in ‘chemical products’ (Charles, 2013), France continued to produce and export in
fields of endeavor in which it had long been producing. The Second Industrial Revolution
seems to have been slow in arriving in France.
        Notwithstanding this ostensible “stagnation”, France did manage to diversify its
exports over the long run. To be more precise, we present first in Figure 1 the evolution of net
exports of manufactured products, finished textiles and raw materials. Between 1860 and the
start of the 1880s the net export ratios of finished textiles and, more broadly, manufactured

2
  This last product category, specific to the French nomenclature, combined a number of luxury or decorative
articles using precious wood, inlaid with bone, ivory, mother-of-pearl including chessboards, tobacco jars
jewellery cases, toys and the like; the Board of Trade referred to these as “Small fancy wares and toys.”

                                                     7
products decrease very quickly. If a stabilization can be observed prior to World War I for
textiles, the rate of decrease rises dramatically for manufactured goods as a class.
                                            Figure 1


        In Figure 2 we look at the evolution of the share of the top four exports in total exports
and the evolution of the share of the top four imports in total imports between 1836 and
1938. 3 Figure 2 shows that textiles (cotton, woolen and silk) and wine went from accounting
for about 47% of total exports down to 16% in 1913. Silk and cotton textiles see the most
dramatic declines.
        There is less of a discernable trend in the share of the top 4 imports evident in Figure
3. Major imports included primary products such as raw cotton, raw wool, and coal. That
these goods were the top imports implies a persistent international division of labor with
France importing raw materials and exporting manufactured goods. This first look at the data
invites us to consider other measures of export and import concentration.
                                            Figure 2
                                            Figure 3
3.3 Trade Diversification
       In order to gain a more comprehensive view of French international trade
concentration we compute Herfindahl indexes for all exports and imports (Figure 4). The
Herfindahl index is given by the following formula: 𝐻𝐻 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ² where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is the share of
product i = 1,…,135 in total exports. The maximal value is 100 implying total specialization.
        Between the 1830s and the 1850s, export concentration remains high in line with a
Ricardian positioning. During this period, France was highly specialized in a small range of
goods. From the mid-1850s, France’s trade costs fell dramatically due to advances in
international transportation and communications, the signing of the Cobden Chevalier treaty,
and subsequent MFN treaties with other major trade partners. The Herfindahl index declined
sharply between 1855 and 1865. A momentary deceleration is evident until 1869. From 1870
there is one further strong decline followed by a slower secular decline all the way down to
World War I.
        This decline would seem to be in opposition to a basic Ricardian trade model
suggesting specialization along the lines of comparative advantage. This decline seemingly
rules out the idea that productivity growth was concentrated in a few leading sectors or that
relative productivity in one or two goods mattered. On the other hand, it is well known that
the Ricardian model of Dornbusch et. al. would predict a negative impact of trade
liberalization on export concentration. A rise in the share of many goods not previously
exported in significant quantities or values should occur. To the extent that trade cost declines
heightened international competition, a Ricardian model would also predict that some goods
previously produced locally would lose out to international competition. This would be
consistent with a lower import concentration ratio which is also visible in Figure 4.
3
 For exports and imports we compute how many way one item is in the top 10 between 1836 and
1938 and calculate an average ranking.
                                                8
       During the interwar period, the H index stays stable at a low level. In contrast the
index for imports appears relatively stable over the long run. The shock of World War I shows
increased concentration, in a context of an export collapse and closed international markets.
This is a temporary and exceptional change and it is based on exports of armaments,
munitions, and cotton fabric mainly toward military allies like Russia and Italy.

        In Figure 5 we show that there is a strong negative relationship between the H index of
concentration and income per capita. This negative relationship is also consistent with Cadot
et. al (2011) and Imbs and Wacziarg (2003). The relationship becomes nearly flat above
$3,000 (1990 Geary-Khamis US dollars)
                                                   Figure 5
The fitted values in Figure 5 come from the following regression for the years 1836-1938 (t-
statistics in parentheses below coefficient estimates):

                       18.25          0.029                    0.008 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡            0.011    𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 2
              𝐻𝐻𝑡𝑡 =   (8.85)   −   (−1.50) (𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦)   −   (−4.27) �          �   +   (5.23)   �          �
                                                                       𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡                    𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡


       The R2 of the regression in Figure 5 is equal to 0.82. To the extent that export
concentration relates to employment shares we have uncovered to the best of our knowledge,
for the first time support for Imbs and Wacziarg’s conjecture from the 19th century. The
French case shows a long run decrease in exports concentration in line with their U-shape.
The model in Imbs and Wacziarg noted that concentration (in employment) increases at the
end of the 1960s when GDP per capita exceeded 10.000 dollars. Cadot (2011) also note that
export diversification also declines after a critical level of GPD per capita is reached. Our
findings are consistent with both although in this case re-concentration does not occur during
the time period covered in our sample.
        Cadot et. al. (2011) note that export diversification depends on trade policy as well as
the level of income per capita. To see if this is true in the case of France we regress the
Herfindahl index of concentration on the lag of the average tariff level as well as GDP per
capita, its square, and a linear time trend. The years included in the sample are 1851-1913,
years in which trade policy changes are well known and clearly discernible based on changes
in tariff revenues. The results below in this case are striking (z-statistics based on robust
standard errors reported are in brackets underneath coefficient estimates):

                       21.14          0.089                    0.011 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡            0.021    𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 2

                                                                       𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡                    𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
              R² = 0.86, F = 118.95, N = 64, all of the coefficients are significant at 1%.

    𝐻𝐻𝑡𝑡 =   (5.50)   −   (−3.96) (𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦)   −   (−3.33) �          �   +   (3.83)   �          � + (8.75) (Tariff𝑡𝑡−1 )
                                                             𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡                    𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
             R² = 0.94, F = 222.68, N = 63 all of the coefficients are significant at 1%.


        We find strong evidence once again that the export concentration ratio declined as
income grew but that there was a bottoming out in that process towards the end of the 19th
century and into the early 20th century. Our regression would predict a rise in the H index
after a critical level of GDP per capita about $3,355. After controlling for income, we find
that the average tariff rate is strongly positively associated with export concentration.
        From the 1860s France underwent a liberalization but from the 1880s up to 1893 the
average tariff rate nearly doubled from about 6.58% to 11.5%. Without this rise in tariffs, the
Herfindahl index would have fallen by roughly one more point. In the event, policy changes
seem to have reinforced the dwindling downward pressure of GDP per capita. Based on our
regression results, policy changes do not seem sufficient to explain the dramatic slowdown in
diversification seen above. Instead GDP per capita seems to be the dominant force in
explaining this measure of diversification.


3.5 Evidence Regarding Long Run Decline
        In order to deepen our understanding of France’s trade prowess and its
competitiveness, we compute two foreign trade coverage ratios. The CR4 coverage ratio for
each year takes the ratio of the value of the top 4 exports to the value of the top 4 imports; we
note that in each year the set of products covered in the ratio can vary. We also compute a
“global coverage ratio” (value of exports / value of imports), related to the trade balance
yielding a value above 100 when there is a surplus. We observe a perfect correlation between
the two measures. The ACD correlation coefficient between the CR4 coverage ratio and the
global coverage ratio takes a value of 0.82. When the ratio of the top 4 exports rises above the
top 4 imports, a trade surplus can be observed.
        Before the end of the 1870s, the CR4 coverage ratios are generally higher than the
global coverage ratios. France’s net exports for its top products were much more competitive
than the average product line up to this point. Figure 6 shows a turning point at the end of
1870s. The decline of export concentration seems to be somewhat correlated the balance of
trade. The chronic deficit in the trade balance from the end of the 1870s until WWI (which
improves slightly over these years) is associated with the historically low concentration ratios
seen in Figure 4. We observe an even stronger correlation during the interwar period
particularly after 1927. At that point, a lack of strong specialization seems to explain the
accentuation in the deficit.
                                                          Figure 6




4   The Stability of Comparative Advantage: 1836-1938

                                                              10
4.1 Lafay Index of Specialization
        In international economics, there are many ways to measure comparative advantage
and specialization. The pioneering Index of Revealed Comparative Advantage by Balassa
(1965) is an oft-used metric. However, the choice of the right index depends on many
elements. We propose to use the Lafay Index of international specialization (1992). For
historical work, the Lafay index offers some advantages. It needs only national trade statistics;
data on world exports with a suitable disaggregation are not available for our period. The
Lafay Index controls for distortions from an overall net deficit. In the context of the first
globalization which witnessed increasing intra-industry trade, a careful assessment of
international comparative advantages requires us to take into consideration exports and
imports. The Lafay Index, by taking account of imports, allows us to control for intra-industry
trade. The Lafay Index measures the contribution of different products to changes in total
comparative advantage.
We compute the Lafay Index of international specialization for items at the 3-digit SITC
classification. For any given product i the Lafay Index (LFI) is defined as :
                                        𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖    ∑𝑁𝑁
                                                        𝑖𝑖=1(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 )        𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖
                  𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = 100 × ��               � − 𝑁𝑁                 � × 𝑁𝑁
                                        𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖    ∑𝑖𝑖=1(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 )    ∑𝑖𝑖=1(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 )


where 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 and 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 are exports and imports of product i and N is the number of products. Thus, a
positive value indicates the existence of a comparative advantage in a given item (a
specialization in the ith good). On the contrary, negative values points to de-specialization.
All indexes summed over i sum up to zero. For each particular good, the part in parentheses
measures net exports normalized to average net exports. The weights, which sum to one, scale
these deviations by how important each good is in overall trade.
                                                    Figure 7


       We compute the LFI index, year by year, for each product. Figure 7 shows results for
France’s top 4 exports. At the start of the period, France was very highly specialized in, and a
net exporter of, finished textiles which are included in the top 4 exports (silk, woolen and
cotton fabrics). All series show a decline all the way to World War I but there is variance in
the outcomes by product.


        For silk fabric the LFI index reached a level higher than 10 in the 1850s, although it
decreased from the start of the 1860s down to the late 1870s. From then on, France clearly
maintained its status as a net exporter of silk textiles until WWII, likely founded on a
reputation for quality. 4 The LFI index was high for cotton fabric (with a peak at 8 in 1846).

4
 This industry concentrated in the area of Lyon which was responsible for around 2/3 of all exports until 1860.
The principal destination was the USA until the end of the 1850s with Great Britain becoming the number one
destination later (Verley, 1997).

                                                        11
The LFI for cotton decreased quickly near the end of the 1840s, and became briefly negative
in 1872 after Alsace and Lorraine were ceded to Germany. Its value rose from the 1880s all
the way to World War I and stayed stable above 2 during the interwar. For woolen fabric,
there are fewer sharp changes. Woolens were able maintain a value of around 4 from the
1860s through the 1890s. Woolens tend to decrease from the late 1890s and this trend
continued until the end of the period when France very nearly loses its comparative advantage
in this product.


4.2 Methodology to Study Stability of Specialization
       To study the (short-run) stability of French international specialization, we use an
approach inspired by the seminal contributions of Pavitt (1989) and Cantwell (1989). Our
approach follows recent papers about modern specializations such as Alessandrini and Butuo
(2010) and Chiappini (2014). Our estimating equation is given by:

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖   i= 1,…,135.
The dependent variable is the value of 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 at the end of one period. The key explanatory
variable is the value of the same index for the same product at the beginning of the period, α
is constant, β is the key parameter of interest to be estimated and ε is a residual term. In order
to reduce the impact of year-to-year volatility, we take an arithmetic average of the values of
the index in the current year and the preceding two years. The interpretation of the regression
is as follows:
      •     If 𝛽𝛽 = 1 the specialization of the country is unchanged over time.
      •     If 𝛽𝛽 > 1 country has become more (less) specialised in sectors for which it already has
            a comparative advantage (disadvantage).

      •     If 0 < 𝛽𝛽 < 1, on average the sign of the specialization is still the same, but the value of
            the index has increased in sectors for which the initial value of the index was low and
            has decreased in the sectors for which the initial value of the index was high.
      •     If 𝛽𝛽 < 0 the sign of the LFI index has changed and the specialization has reversed.
      •     If 𝛽𝛽 = 0 there is no relationship between initial and final pattern of specialization.
Dalum et al (1998) point out that the interpretation of the β coefficient does not allow a
conclusion about the overall evolution of a country’s specialization. However, more can be
said about the distribution of specialization. Cantwell (1989) shows how it is possible to
exploit the following relation deriving directly from the regression equation:
                                                           2
                                                        𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒      𝛽𝛽 2
                                                                    =
                                                          2
                                                       𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎   𝑟𝑟 2
                                                                                 2
where 𝑟𝑟 2 is the squared correlation coefficient from the regression and 𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒         2
                                                                                    and 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 are
respectively, the variance of the dependent and explanatory variable. The correlation
coefficient is 𝑟𝑟 2 a measure of the mobility of sectors along the distribution between periods. A
high value for this coefficient implies that products’ relative position remains almost
unchanged. By comparing the regression coefficient to r three outcomes can arise:

                                                              12
   •   If β = 𝑟𝑟, the dispersion of the distribution of the index remains the same
   •   If β > 𝑟𝑟, dispersion increases, the degree of specialization has increased
   •   If β < 𝑟𝑟, dispersion decreases, the degree of specialization has decreased
Thus, this method allows a better understanding of both a country’s average specialization
dynamics and changes in the overall distribution of specialization.


4.3 Estimation
        To begin our analysis of the stability of French specialization between 1836 and 1938,
we proceed by iteration. We use as a first starting point the years 1836-1837. We then
compare successive three year periods to this initial period in order to detect a break point
compared to the initial years. A break point appears when the estimate of β becomes
significantly different from 1.
        If we find a breakpoint, then we use the end period of the sub-sample as a new starting
point for successive regressions. The null hypothesis is that β re-sets to 1 after each break
point. A useful metric for how fast specialization is changing is the time between two break
points. We can evaluate long-run stability with these data. Detected break points are presented
in the tables that follow. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show many interesting results.
                                             Table 1


        Table 1 explores the period up to the Cobden-Chevalier treaty. With the exception of
1847-1849, between 1836 and 1858 French specialization appears completely stable (the null
hypothesis β = 1 cannot be rejected). The bad harvest of 1847 explains the instability found in
1847-49. Corn imports increased from 99.8 million francs in 1847 to 209 million francs in
1848 and as a consequence the LFI decreases from -5.03 to -10.15. Between 1836-37 and
1859-61, β/r remains very near 1 indicating strong stability in French specialization during a
quarter of a century. During this period French trade policy was particularly protectionist.
        Taking as a new starting point 1859-61, β is never significantly equal to 1 in the
1860s. Computing the regression every three years leads to the conclusion that there is great
instability in the structure of specialization between the start of the 1860s all the way to 1883-
85. The regression coefficient β becomes indistinguishable from 1 only when we consider
1883-1885 as a new starting point. The decrease in specialization during the 1860s and the
1870s accompanies an (economically) significant change in the distribution of specializations
as seen by values of β/r below 1 for all periods considered.


                                             Table 2


      Considering our estimates of β, a period of stability in specialization can be identified
between 1883-1885 and 1895-97. Taking a new starting point in 1895-1897, we reject the

                                               13
hypothesis of stability between 1895-1897 and 1898-1900. After this, two short periods of
stability (each of 6 years) can be detected until 1910-12.
        Compared to the level of specialization in 1910-1912, the specialization structure of
1913-1915 and 1916-1918 are completely un-stable. This is evidently due to the wartime
economy. Comparing specialization in 1910-1912 to 1919-1921 France appears more
specialized. The degree of specialization increases such that our measure of the distribution of
export activity, β/r equals 1.23 in 1919-1921. France’s main exporting industries were still
those which had made their reputation in the middle of the nineteenth century (silk fabric,
cotton fabric). France was unable to generate much export activity in modern large
specializations by this time period.
        As Table 3 shows, results for the 1920s are completely un-stable. Exchange rate
instability can probably explain part of the phenomena in the period. Between 1931-1933 and
1936-1938 French specialization appears completely stable (the hypothesis that β =1 cannot
be rejected). This result is consistent with the idea that higher trade costs led to higher and
more stable specialization. As was the case between 1883-1885 and 1910-1912, the rise in
protectionism seems correlated with the stability of the structure of specialization.


                                                     Table 3


       To summarize, our tests for the stability in specialization permits us to identify five
periods. Up until the trade liberalization of 1860, French specialization is perfectly stable and
highly concentrated. Between 1860 and the middle of 1880s, the degree of specialization
decreased; thereafter specialization is quite stable. From the 1880s until WWI, France was
involved in a strategic trade regime yielding a relative stabilization in specialization. During
the interwar period, the instability of the 1920s associated with exchange rate volatility
(depreciation and then undervaluation) is opposed to the stability of specialization of the
1930s once again in a context of elevated protectionism.


       5 Trade Policy and Specialization: a Focus on the Trade Policy, 1880-1913


       In order to highlight the link between trade policy and specialization stability we
propose to test the relation between relative protection and specialization. We compute a
regression of the Lafay index at time t on the ratio of the average tariff (CT defined as tariff
revenue for a good divided by total imports), and the Lafay Index at time t-1. Specifically we
run regressions of the following form:

                         𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 �𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 � + 𝑏𝑏2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡


         We restrict analysis to 9 of the top 10 specializations (see Appendix I for a complete
list of products and their ranks). We exclude trinkets (‘articles de Paris’…) because we have


                                                         14
no imports for these specific goods. We run a random-effects regression for all products
pooled together for 1850-1913 and include year dummies. The results of this regression are:


                                             0.96                      0.007
                           𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 =            �𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 � +        �𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �
                                           (117.71)                    (1.79)
                                                           2                            2
           𝑁𝑁 = 534 (9 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝, 64 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦), 𝑅𝑅𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0.90,        𝑅𝑅𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 0.99,
                          robust z − statistics in parentheses


        A positive relation between LFI and average tariffs is established, and the coefficient
on lagged tariffs is significant at the 7% level. A one standard deviation rise in tariffs is
associated with a rise in the LFI of about 0.02---less than 1% of the sample standard deviation
of the LFI. Given the adjustment implied by inclusion of the lagged dependent variable, the
long-run impact would be about 0.175 (.007/.04) or 6% of the sample standard deviation. This
is not an overwhelming impact in economic terms, but neither is it completely negligible.
        There is a possibility of unobservable heterogeneity at the product level if for instance
some sectors were more privileged in the political process or had better long-term prospects
due to endowments and so forth. In response, we included product fixed effects in the panel
regression. Such a regression suffers from a Nickell bias, although it is potentially small given
that T = 63. In this specification the coefficient on tariffs is slightly larger at 0.009 but it is no
longer significant (p-value = 0.2).
        As a further test, we implemented the Blundell Bond system GMM estimator that
builds on the GMM application of Arellano and Bond. This GMM estimator allows us to
simultaneously eliminate concerns arising from time-invariant unobservables at the product-
level and the endogeneity bias arising from inclusion of the lagged dependent variable. We
allow for lags 2 through 5 as GMM-style instruments for the lagged dependent variable.
When we do so, we find the coefficient on lagged tariffs is equal to 0.008 (robust p-value =
0.091), and the coefficient on the lagged value of the LFI index is 0.96. We experimented
with allowing up to 11 lags in the instrument matrix. Results are almost identical to those
reported. Other diagnostic tests for over-identifying restrictions and serial correlation are
favorable. Overall, we believe that, while marginally significant, tariffs did have some
marginal impact on specialization patterns. Trade policy seems to have been able to slow
down export diversification since it was often applied to more traditionally successful product
lines. Policy acted to refuse the closure, or paring down, of traditional specializations.
        Can trade policy and changes in trade costs explain the patterns of diversification in
the decades following 1860, or is a productivity/economic growth explanation more
appropriate? Three possibilities arise. First, a Ricardian model would predict increased
specialization if greater international competition was based on the evolution of relative
productivity in a small number of leading industries. Second, generalized productivity
advance across industry in France should have given rise to a diversification in exports. Third,
as regards trade costs and trade policy, the Ricardian model of Dornbusch et. al. predicts that
a fall in tariffs and other trade costs should result in both an increase in the range of goods
imported as well as an increase in the range of goods exported (see Balassa, 1966 and

                                                            15
Dornbusch et al, 1977). Clearly the second and third are superficially consistent with the data.
By any measure we can confidently rule out the first hypothesis of increased specialization
and narrow productivity advantages.
       The third hypothesis, that associated with falling trade costs, is consistent with the data
and our econometric results. Nevertheless the impact of tariffs seems small, but trade policy
changes and trade cost changes together may have been larger than we are able to capture
with the proxy based on tariffs. Undoubtedly the decline (post-1860) and then the rise of trade
costs (via tariffs) after 1880 played some role in the increased diversification and its
subsequent slow-down as per our econometric models. The onset of diversification around
1860 is surely not purely coincidental. It may be the case that the crude measure of trade
policy captured by tariffs is insufficient to capture the dismantling of the quantity restrictions
inherent in the trade policy changes of the 1860s. Alternatively, it may be that productivity
levels were related to trade policy although such a hypothesis would be impossible to test in
these early years.
        A simpler, if not sufficient explanation is the second hypothesis. Broad-based
productivity growth cannot be rejected. This explanation is in fact consistent with our
exploration of the determinants of the Herfindahl index which found a strong role for
economic growth at the aggregate level. It is also consistent with the exploration made by
Temin for England in the decades preceding our sample. While France lagged some decades
behind England in experiencing an industrial revolution, it is evident that this process had
started in earnest and continued throughout the period under examination. Moreover, as Cadot
et. al. (2013) highlight, economic advance leads to a U-shaped pattern of diversification.
While we do not see a U, we do see a strong slowdown in specialization apparent after a
certain level of GDP per capita.




Conclusion
        Using an original database, this paper focuses on French export specialization and
concentration at the onset of modern economic growth. We confirm France’s position as an
“advanced” country which exported manufactured products (73% of total exports in 1846)
and imported primary products. At the same time we show that France’s specialization
traversed a path in terms of specialization typical of modern LDCs at the onset of modern
economic growth. As France grew, it initially expanded the range of exports becoming
increasingly diversified. After several decades of growth this process began to slow and
diversification stagnated.
        Between the 1830s and the end of the 1850s, export concentration remained very high.
At the beginning of the period, France appears to have adhered tightly to the predictions of a
Ricardian model of trade exporting a few products in large quantities. France was largely
specialized in finished textiles (silk, woolen and cotton fabrics, and wine).
        In a context of falling trade costs, the trade liberalization of the 1860s and 1870s along
with broad-based and sustained economic growth produced a significant decline in the
specialization of French exports. The decrease in the degree of specialization associated with
these changes suggests that France’s export-oriented sector responded more to trade cost

                                               16
changes and internal economic dynamics than to outright industrial competition from highly
productive and technologically advanced leaders like Great Britain. To the extent that labor
force trends shadowed trade patterns, we find evidence consistent with the U-shaped
diversification hypothesis of Imbs and Wacziarg.
        Imbs and Wacziarg as well as Cadot et. al. suggested a critical level of GDP per capita
would provide an inflection point in diversification. Echoing Cadot et. al. we find that trade
policy also mattered somewhat for the deceleration in the trend towards greater specialization.
From the start of the 1880s to World War I, the decrease in specialization lost its momentum.
During this period, a new trade regime took hold which was more strategic and somewhat
discriminatory. Tariffs in this period were partly driven by a need to preserve political and
social stability in France. Successive French governments acted to protect industries in which
France had a traditional specialization (silk, cotton and woolen fabrics, leather or leather
articles, metal tools). This defensive protection strategy can partly explain the stabilization of
the specialization structure between 1883-1885 and World War I.
        The slowdown in diversification should not be meant to imply that broad-based
productivity growth had declined. Instead these patterns seem to be evident amongst all
countries growing into mature economies. On the other hand France was unable to gain a
major foothold in modern large specializations such as machines and mechanical devices. The
literature on the Second Industrial Revolution points out that there were many missed
opportunities (Dormois, 2009). Indeed our evidence shows that hiding from international
competition with higher tariffs may have slowed down any potential transformation to French
industry. In 1913, France’s main exporting industries were still those which had established
their reputation under the Second Empire although their share in total trade had been
dwindling.
        Studying export diversification of 156 countries between 1988 and 2006, Cadot et. al.
(2011) show that as countries travel across diversification cones, they fail to close a tail of
export lines that no longer belong to their comparative advantage but artificially inflate their
diversification, until finally comparative advantage catches up. Our evidence, consistent with
Cadot et. al. (2013) suggests that trade policy is able to slow down export diversification.
Government policy may have refused to close a tail of traditional specializations, but other
deeper forces that limited entry and exit and the allocation of resources may have been at
play.
        Regarding export diversification and de-specialization, a crucial question for further
research remains: how exactly did a relatively advanced industrial country like France adapt
itself to global markets in the face of falling trade costs and rapidly rising foreign
productivity. Further exploration of this question requires a detailed analysis of more finely
disaggregated trade data at the product level. Such evidence will allow us to explore more
carefully how countries diversify, and possibly re-concentrate over the long-run.
