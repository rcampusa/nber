              The Desirability of a Dollar Appreciation,
             Given a Contractionary U.S. Monetary Policy


                               ABS TRACT



     Undesirable real effects have been attributed to floating exchange

rates in general, and the 1980—83 appreciation of the dollar in particular.

In the appreciating country, the U.S., export industries lose competitiveness

and so output falls. In the other country, say Europe, the exchange rate

change worsens inflation.

     This paper starts from the premise that these undesirable side effects

are attributable, not to the exchange rate, but rather to the decision

in the U.S. to switch to a more contractionary monetary policy in order

to fight inflation. Given the U.S. contraction, it might be desirable

for the dollar to appreciate in the sense that it allows each country to

attain the best possible tradeoff between aggregate output and inflation.

This conclusion follows from the assumption that in each of two sectors,

nontraded goods or exportables, the relationship between output and inflation

is concave. A U.S. contraction will then give the maximum reduction in

inflation per lost output only if it is shared equally by both sectors.

This means allowing the currency to appreciate; under a fixed exchange rate

the burden of contraction would be borne disproportionately by the nontraded

goods sector. The exchange rate change is also good for Europe. Given

the U.S. contraction, the European export sectors would suffer a dispropor-

tionate loss in output if European currencies were not allowed to depreciate

against the dollar.

     The great rise in the value of the dollar against virtually all foreign

currencies during 1980—82 has brought forth protests from all sides. In the

United States, firms that produce for export or that compete with imports

have lost competitiveness. Output in these industries has declined in conse-

quence. In Europe,1 prices of traded goods have gone up. The Europeans'

struggle against inflation has been endangered, and they have thus felt

obliged to contract their economies. All this——an exacerbated recession at

home and alienated allies abroad-—due to an exchange rate that appears to

be far out of equilibrium.

     Exchange rates have seen similar fluctuations since 1973. But for the

first time, more than a few American economists are joining those in the

media, business and government, who seriously question the floating rate

system. Rudiger Dornbusch (1982, p. 4) believes that "exchange rates in the

1970s have not worked well." C. Fred Bergsten (1982, P. 1) argues that

"massive currency misaligrtments are distorting international trade and capital

movements. The dollar is overvalued by at least 20 per cent, on average....

These Imbalances. . .add significantly to national growth problems, both in

countries with overvalued currencies (which suffer competitive losses) and

countries with undervalued currencies (which are driven to adopt restrictive

monetary policies)." There are really two steps to the argument, first that

the exchange rate swings are not due to economic fundamentals, and second that

they have harmful real effects. While almost no one is seriously urging an

early return to fixed exchange rates, the new skepticism toward floating entails

a renewed interest in foreign exchange intervention and capital controls.

     The first point to make is that we have a good idea why the dollar has

been so strong over the last three years. By the end of 1979, public concern

with high levels of U.S. inflation had reached a near—panic state. One
                                                                                2




might say that the political consensus had swung in favor of a willingness

to suffer a recession in order to bring down inflation. In any case, the

Federal Reserve Board under Chairman Paul Volcker began a strict program of

monetary restraint: slow money growth and consequent high real interest rates.

With the support of the administration elected a year later, the Fed stuck to

that program for three years.

     All our models tell us that a monetary contraction causes an appreciation

of the currency, whether it is the Mundell—Fleming model with imperfect

capital mobility, the Dornbusch and Frenkel monetary models, or the Branson—

Henderson—Kouri portfolio—balance model. It is true that the existing

theoretical models of exchange rate determination have some conflicting proper-

ties. It is further true that recent attempts to see which models fit the

data best on a monthly basis have reached the disturbing conclusion that none

of them any longer fits the data well at all.2 But this just says that we

are going to have to be exceptionally clever with our econometrics if we

want to avoid such problems as structural shifts andendogeneity of other

variables. Our econometric dIffIcultIes are no reason to give up our theoreti-

cal knowledge, certainly not when the gross empirical facts——the 1980—82 data

point——are in accordance.

     The complaint that the appreciation of the dollar has been harmful is

not as easily disposed of. Dornbusch (1982, p. 31) states the claim in

extreme form: "There is no sensible argument that tightening of money should

involve as a desirable side effect a loss of exports, an increase in imports

    Because these side effects are undesirable, both here and abroad, we

should attempt to the maximum possible extent to immunize the world economy
                                                                                  3




against these spillovers." But it is the position of this paper that the

appreciation of the dollar is the natural concomitant of the U.S. monetary

contraction, not just in the sense that appreciation is what we would

expect from the contraction, but in the sense that it is actually

desirable, in that welfare in the United States and in Europe is greater than

it would be under fixed exchange rates, given the contraction.

     It used to be said that flexible exchange rates allowed each country

to pursue its own internal economic policy goals regardless of the policies

of its trading partners. Early Keynesian models with no capital mobility

gave the result that a floating exchange rate guaranteed complete insulation by

shutting off the trade balance. A domestic contraction, for example, would cause

the currency to appreciate, "bottling 11TV the loss of domestic output and pre-

venting any loss in foreign output. The claim of complete insulation has long

since been abandoned. Robert Mundell showed that when capital is internationally

mobile, economic disturbances are transmitted internationally, because floating

rates, though they guarantee a zero balance of payments, do not guarantee a

zero trade balance. When a domestic monetary contraction appreciates the

domestic currency, the foreign country experiences an expansion of output in

response to its improved competitiveness.3

     While the literature on transmission has been extended in a variety of

directions, the analysis of the welfare effects of fixed vs. floating rates

continues to have some conspicuous holes. Everyone rediscovers Mundell's

finding that under floating rates a policy change in the United States Is

transmitted to Europe, with the implication that if Europe was previously

where they wanted to be in terms of the output—inflation tradeoff, they are
                                                                                 4


now worse off. The world is proclaimed to be a complex interdependent system,

governments are urged to coordinate policies and avoid large exchange rate

swings, while skepticism is expressed as to the likelihood that the governments

will do so, as if they are members of a weak cartel who are fated to succumb

to the temptation of pursuing their short—term individual self—interest to

the collective detriment.

     The first hole to be plugged is the simple point that just because a

U.S. disturbance would have an impact on Europe if it kept its policy variables

unchanged, it does not follow that Europe is worse off. The Europeans can

change their policy variables in response. Indeed, the Europeans have chosen

to meet the U.S. contraction with a contraction of their own to mitigate the

large depreciation of their own currencies. This is sufficient to explain why

Europe has not experienced the expansion of the Mundell—Fleming model. The

inhibition of domestic demand for European goods caused by heightened real

interest rates has offset the stimulus to foreign demand caused by their

improved competitiveness.4 For the Europeans to have been made worse off by

the U.S. policy change, it would be necessary to argue that the terms of their

output—inflation tradeoff worsened.

     But none of this answers the question whether, given a shift in U.S.

policy priorities, Europe and the United States are worse off or better off

with the change in the exchange rate than they would have been without it.

As regards U.S. welfare, this paper will argue that given the decision to

contract to fight inflation, we are better off if the currency appreciates

so that the loss in demand is felt by the export or tradable sector as well

as by the domestic or nontradable sector. While one might make an argument

for equal sharing of the pain on equity grounds, the argument made here is on
                                                                                5




the grounds of obtaining the best possible terms for the tradeoff between

aggregate output and aggregate inflation. As regards European welfare, the

paper will argue that, given the U.S. contraction, they too are better off

with a dollar/European exchange rate that is at least somewhat lower. Under

a fixed exchange rate, the Europeans would experience a loss in export demand.

If they do not change their own demand policy, any gain in competitiveness

will mitigate the involuntary movement down the Phillips curve (to lower out—

put) that they would otherwise experience. If they do adjust their demand

policy in response to the U.S. contraction, a lower exchange rate will still

improve their output—inflation tradeoff by improving the balance between their

export and nontraded goods sectors.

     We assume that prices are sticky in the currency of the country producing

the good in question, and adjust only gradually over time to conditions of

excess supply or demand   The key assumption in deriving our results is that

the inflation/output tradeoff within each of the two sectors, domestic goods

and exportables, is concave upward. Empirical support for the concavity of

the curve lies in the familiar observation that at high levels of unemployment

and excess capacity, changes in output come more easily than changes in infla-

tion, whereas the reverse is true closer to full employment and peak capacity

utilization.5 Theoretical support for concavity lies in the rationale that the

aggregate supply curve gets its slope from neoclassical firm optimization

subject to prices that are flexible, but subject to unskilled wages (or costs

of whatever other few factors of production are variable in the short run) that

lag behind. For example, if (1) output is given by a Cobb—Douglas production

function, with y < 1/2    the elasticity with respect to the variable factor,

unskilled labor, (2) the firm produces where the marginal product of labor is
                                                                              6




equal to the real wage, and (3) the nominal wage is proportionate to last

period's price level, then one plus the inflation rate will be proportional

to output to the power of (lIy — 1)

    We will demonstrate six propositions.
                                                                                     7




      (1) TO OBTAIN THE MOST FAVORABLE TRADEOFF BETWEEN AGGREGATE INFLATION

AND AGGREGATE OUTPUT, A COUNTRY SHOULD EXPAND EQUALLY OR CONTRACT EQUALLY IN

BOTH SECTORS.

     The intuition here is that, with concave supply curves, if     the   contrac-

tion were more severe in the domestic sector than in the export sector, the

marginal reduction in inflation gained for a given further loss in output would

be greater in the latter sector than the former. Our two supply curves are:


                                     + N =
                                                                                 (1)
                                 1   +   =


where we have defined

         E output in the nontradable sector

             potential output (the non—inflationary level) in that sector

             the inflation rate in that sector

         E output in the export sector

         E   potential   (non—inflationary) output in that sector

         E the inflation rate in that sector

             the elasticity of the price level with respect to output, assumed

             greater than one (this is the concavity assumption), and for

             simplicity assumed equal in all sectors. In terms of the output

             elasticity with respect to unskilled wages, we can think of

             as (1/i — 1)

The two supply curves are illustrated in figure 1.

    We will focus on the inflation rate iT measured by a producer price

index, the weighted average of the inflation rates in the two industries:

aggregate potential output.

     Note that if we used a consumer price index that included the price of

imported goods, instead of the producer price index,6 we would find that the

price 1evel, as opposed to the inflation rate, would fall instantaneously when

the exchange rate falls. Buiter and Miller have shown that any gains against

inflation of this nature must be given back later when the real exchange rat2

returns to its long—run level. We would thus be in the difficult position of

having to compare the welfare effects of an unambiguous fall in the rate of pr'.c

change versus a path that features an initial fall in the price level followed by

an increased rate of change. It is easier to leave import prices out
                                                                     altogether.

     Let "a" be the share of output that is allocated to nontraded goods.

                  1 + = a(aY/aY) + (1            -   a)((l    -   a)Y/(l   -


To find the value of "a" that minimizes r for a given level of Y                        ,   we

differentiate:



     da
          =   a(aY/aY)Y/aY   -   (1   -   a)[(l - a)Y/(l - a)Y]Y/(l             -   a)Y =   0

                                 S—l =
                        (a/a)              [(1   -   a)/(l    -   a)]
                                           aa
     Thus the country should allocate output in the same proportions between

the two sectors as at full employment. If the government is going to "put the

screws" to the construction industry, it should do the same to autos and steel.

        A consequence is that the optimal aggregate tradeoff is of the same shape

 as the individual tradeoffs in the two sectors:


                            1 +   =    a(Y/Y)     + (1-
                                                                                   (3)
                                      =   (y/)S

It is illustrated in figure 2. We draw in upward—sloping societal indifference

curves to illustrate the preferences between inflation and output. A shift in

priority from fighting unemployment to fighting inflation is shown as a

decrease in the slopes of the indifference curves. The tangency moves down the

curve to lower levels of inflation and output.


        (2) TO CONTRACT EQUALLY IN THE TWO SECTORS, A REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL OF

EXPENDITURE MUST BE ACCO!PANIED BY AN APPRECIATION OF THE CURRENCY IN ORDER TO

SWITCH EXPENDITURE AWAY FROM EXPORTABLE GOODS.

        If there were no change in    the exchange rate or other   expenditure—switching

policies, a contraction of expenditure would be concentrated relatively more in

the   output of non—traded goods, though it would also have some effect on the
output of exportables assuming they         enter domestic consumption. Export sales
would    to a large extent be buoyed by foreign expenditure. If output is to fall
equiproportionately     in the two sectors some     policy like a revaluation of the

currency is necessary to switch expenditure away from exportables toward non—

traded goods. In the case of foreign expenditure, this means a shift in

demand   away from   the export of the domestic country toward its own    goods.   In

the case of domestic expenditure it means a shift in demand towards its import

good, away from its own    exportable      (and a similar shift away from its non—traded

goods, which is assumed to be dominated by the other effects).
                                                                                        10




       We wish to keep output in the two sectors in the same proportions, as we

found in equation (3):


                                          'Xl-c                                   (4)




We define

       A E domestic expenditure, determined by policy

       A* E foreign expenditure, determined by policy

       x     the share of domestic expenditure falling on the exportable good

       x E the share of foreign expenditure falling on the domestic exportable

       n     the share of domestic expenditure falling on the nontraded good, and

       E     the exchange rate defined as units of domestic currency per unit

             of foreign currency.

x ,    x   and n are all increasing functions of the exchange rate. In the

case of x and n ,       if    the exchange rate increases, i.e. the domestic

currency depreciates, domestic consumers substitute away from the importable

good, since its price goes up in terms of domestic currency. In the case of

x* ,   foreign   consumers substitute away from the domestic Importable as well

as from their own nontraded good, since the price of the domestic exportable

falls in terms of foreign currency.

       Output in the two sectors is determined by demand:


                             =   x(E)A + x*(E)A*        =   n(E)A   .             (5)

So our condition (4) is

                           (x'A + x*'A*) — (xA + x*A*) n'/n> 0                 .
                                                                                                     (7)

Intuitively the question is whether an increase in E raises the numerator

of (6) more than the denominator; we already know that an increase in A

does the reverse.

        Using (6) in (7), the question is whether


                                                     1 -   a n'A
                                   x'A + x*'A* >                      .                              (8)

                                                                                   w)Y   ,


w is whatever share of Y happens to be sold to domestic consumers. Then

our condition is


                              cxW + c(l - w)Yx >             a       C nN


Using    (4),

                                           + c(l — w)   > C      .                                   (9)
                                                                               12




Thus the question comes down simply to whether a weighted average of the

domestic and foreign elasticities of demand for the exportable exceeds the

elasticity of demand for nontraded goods.

     We cannot prove that (9) holds, but it seems likely. It says that

exportables are closer substitutes for the importable good whose price has

changed than are nontraded goods. It is often observed that countries tend

to trade similar products.   A common model, sometimes called the dependent

economy model, even assumes that exportables and importables are perfect

substitutes. We shall simply assume condition (9). The reader may find the

proposition that a devaluation shifts relative expenditure into exportable

goods, and that a revaluation shifts relative expenditure out of exportable

goods, sufficiently obvious that Proposition (2) can be taken directly.

     As long as (9) holds, there will exist some size decline in the exchange

rate that will allocate a decline in U.S. expenditure in the desired equal pro-

portions between the two sectors. Of course there is no guarantee that the size

of the decline in the dollar/European exchange rate that actually takes place

WIll be of the correct magnitude. It depends obviously on what kind of

exchange rate model is assumed and what parameter values. But it also depends

on what is done with other policy variables besides expenditure A .   First,
we must allow for the foreign country responding by changing its level of

expenditure A* .   Second, we must recognize that either government can

and does affect the exchange rate. In a portfolio—balance model, the central

banks can intervene on the foreign exchange market to affect the exchange

rate without changing the money supply. In a monetary model,    la Mundell—

Fleming, Dornbusch (1976) or Buiter—Miller, the government can affect the
                                                                                 13




 exchange rate by varying the monetary/fiscal policy mix, even if effective

 sterilized foreign exchange intervention is precluded by the assumption of

pure floating, or of perfect substitutability between domestic and foreign

bonds.

     If the domestic country were small, so that it alone cared about its

exchange rate, we might content ourselves with the observation that it can

obtain the optimum outcome by the proper revaluation, if it so desires. But

the necessity to consider the policy options of the rest of the world inspire

us to consider some further propositions, beginning with the welfare effects

of a decrease in the exchange rate that is smaller than the optimum.


     (3)   WHEN IT REDUCES EXPENDITURE IN ORDER TO FIGHT INFLATION, EVEN IF

THE COUNTRY IS CONSTRAINED FROM DISCRETELY DECREASING THE EXCHANGE RATE, IT

IS STILL TRUE THAT AN INCREMENTAL DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE (APPRECIATION)

WILL IMPROVE ITS WELFARE.

     The basic intuition here is the same as for Proposition (2): under a

fixed exchange rate the reduction in expenditure falls disproportionately on

non—traded goods, so that an incremental appreciation to shift expenditure

away from exportable goods moves the economy closer to a balanced contraction.

The situation is illustrated by Figure 3. The optimal tradeoff pictured in

Figure 2 held when the country was free to vary both E and A at will. If

the country is constrained from varying E ,   it will necessarily have a less
attractive opportunity set. We assume that we start from a point 0 on the

optimal tradeoff curve, where output in the two sectors is proportional to

their full—employment capacities, and that the exchange rate is then fixed at

that level. Now society's indifference curves shift. With E fixed, the new

optimal tangecy point P is no longer attainable, and the economy must settle

for the tangency with a more concave constrained tradeoff, at Q                    .   Since   the

constrained tradeoff is flatter at low levels of output, Q lies above and to

the right of P .            An incremental decrease in E will incrementally lower

ir and Y , which is a movement southwestward, so it seems likely that this

will improve welfare. But the proposition needs to be proven.

      We repeat equations (5)


                               =   x(E)A + x*(E)A*          "RN =   n(E)A                       (5)


We substitute them into equation (2) for aggregate inflation, and the equation
  =
      N   +        for   aggregate output, to see how these variables depend on E

and A

                   1 + = [n(E)A/YNJ ÷ (1          -   a)[(x(E)A   + x*(E)A*)/YxJ               (10)


                      Y =   n(E)A + x(E)A + x(E)A*

We are interested in the slope of the constrained curve in Figure 3, the terms

of the tradeoff between inflation and output as A alone is varied:


       dir
                     =   _'ir(A,E)lA

               E
                         Y(A,)/A .

                                                                                               (11)
                                           n(E)   + x(E)
                                                                                                  15




     At points of tangency like 0 and Q                , the   slope is equal to society's

marginal rate of substitution between ir and Y .                       There is no way to know

what the society indifference curves look like, even whether they are convex

or concave. We assume for simplicity that they are linear, that welfare

W is given by


                              W: c(Y/Y) —        d(l   + ir)       .                          (12)


Thus the marginal rate of substitution is constant7 at


                               dTr         —     W/(Y/Y)       —
                             d(Y/Y)

                                                                           and Y = (1   —   a)Y
Equating to the slope given by (11), and using N = aY



         d
               n(E) + x(E)



                                      + [(x(E)A + x*(E)A*)IYx]1x(E)}                          (14)



    We can see from (14) how a decrease in the slope c/d of the indifference

curves will require a reduction in the only free policy variable, A .                       Given

the non—linearity of equation (14), it is impossible to solve explicitly for

A   Nor is it necessary to solve for A in order to demonstrate Proposition

(3). However, it will help to make things more concrete if we take a moment

out to consider the example          = 2   ,   which makes (14) linear and allows us to

solve for A:
                                                                                                    16




                C   =          2

                                                                          x*(E)A*)x(E)IYx}
                        n(E) +      x(E)

                        c n(E) + x(E) —           x*(E)x(E)    A*

                                    n (E)
                                                + x   (E)




     We thus see explicitly how the fall in -                        , say from [J      to [-J
causes the government to reduce A , say                       from A0 at 0 to A1 at P
The question is, what is the effect on welfare of an incremental decline in

E from point P ? From the expression for welfare (12),




                                                                             E —
                           W(A1,E)          =         aY(A1,E)/Y —        rr(A1,E)
                                                 c1                  d1                          (16)


Taking our derivatives from (10),



             W(A1,E) = c1
                       —           (n'A1+       x'A1+ x*'A*)

We want to show that a decrease in E increases welfare, i.e. that the expres-

sion is negative. This will be true if

From equation (14),                  is   a weighted average of two terms
                          [--J.


                              (a)        5[n( E)Al/YN]rS


                              (b) 5[(x(E)A1 + x*()A*)/YxIô1


where the weights are


                                          (14a)              —     and
                                                    n(E) + x(E)


                                          (14b)       _x(E) —     , respectively.
                                                    n(E) + x(E)


The righthandside (RHS) of (17) is a weighted average of the same two terms,

(a) and (b), with weights


                                                     n'A1
                                    (l7a)                                and
                                              n'A1 + x'A1 + x*'A*

                                                   x'A. + x*'A*
                                                                         respectively.
                                              n'A1 +'A1 + x*'A*
                                    (17b)




Now x' + x*'A*/A1 >       x' + x*'A*/A0            because A1 <


                          1      a n'

                              ctY(A0,E)


                      >   x(E)      n'      because we saw in Proposition (1) that outputs
                          n(E)
                                                                                                    18




in the two sectors were originally proportionate to their full—employment

levels:



                                         aY(A0,E) = n(E)A0


and


                      (1 -                    =            + x*(E)A* >
                                 ct)Y(A0,E)       x(E)A0                 x(E)A

This means that the ratio of the weights (l4a) and (14b) is greater than the

ratio of the weights (17a) and (l7b)

                                          —            n'A1
                                          —        x'A1 + x*'A*
                                        x(E)


Again by virtue of Proposition (1), the two terms (a) and (b) would be equal

at point 0 ,   i.e.   with A0 substituted for A1 .                     (There the slope in
equation (14) reduces to [}              = [/]_l            ,   as can be seen by differentiating

(3).) But since A has fallen to A1 , both terms have fallen, with (a)

falling by more. Thus our finding that equation (14) puts relatively more

weight on the first term (a), implies that                           is less than the RHS of
                                                                 1
(17), which is precisely what we needed to show. This inequality was our

condition for - < 0          :    an incremental fall in the exchange rate improves

welfare.

      In the foregoing we have taken foreign expenditure A* as given. We now

consider the foreign country's reaction to the change in international circum-

stances.
                                                                                   19




     (4)    IF   THE EXCHANGE RATE IS NOT ALLOWED TO FALL, THE FOREIGN COUNTRY

SHOULD REACT TO THE DOMESTIC CONTRACTION BY EXPANDING ITS OWN EXPENDITURE.

     If    there were no change in the exchange rate, the foreign country would

bear part of the burden, in the form of lost exports, of the domestic con-

traction. This fact in itself supplies one reason why the foreign country

should want its currency to depreciate: to help insulate it from an exter-

nally imposed movement down the Phillips curve. But here we begin the

analysis by seeing how the foreign country will adjust its expenditure policies.

Given the exchange rate, it will want to fight the push down the Phillips

curve by following expansionary policies.

     We model the foreign country symmetrically to the domestic country.

Foreign welfare is a function of foreign income and inflation, which are in

turn functions of foreign output of non—traded goods and expott goods:

Foreign   outputs are in turn functions of expenditure shares and expenditure

levels


                                    Y = n*(E)A*

                                    Y =    m(E)A + m*(E)A*

where n*       the share of foreign expenditure falling on their nontraded good

       m       the share of domestic expenditure falling on the foreign export

               (which is of course the domestic import; m 1 — n         —   x)
           E   the share of foreign expenditure falling on their own exportable
               (m* E 1 —        — x*)

all of them decreasing functions of the exchange rate.

     We assume that the foreign country is starting from a point on its optimal

output—inflation tradeoff, i.e. that output is allocated between the two

sectors in proportion to their full—employment levels


                                 y=y*

and that the government then chooses the level of expenditure such that the

society's marginal rate of substitution between output and inflation is equal

to the terms of the tradeoff.

     Analogously to equation (14),


                     c     =
                                         —
                                                    —    — 5*_, —

                               n*(E) + m*(E)
                                                                                  (20)

                                             m(E)A)/Y*]*_lm*(E)}

It can be seen from equation (20) that when A falls, the foreign country

will have to raise A* if it wants to niaintain optimality.8

     Figure 4 graphs the inverse dependence of foreign expenditure on

domestic expenditure. The curve might be concave or convex. In the graph

we choose to show the case where S* = 2           so that the relationship is linear.

 In this case we can solve explicitly for A* in terms of A ,
                                                                       analogously
 to equation (15):


                             c* n*(E) + m*(E) -       m(E)m*() A
                             d*           2

                                                                   .                 (21)

 The absolute value of the slope is almost certainly less than 1.0; it is at

 any rate less than m/m*


      (5) GIVEN THE DOMESTIC CONTRACTION, AN INCREMENTAL DECREASE IN THE

EXCHANGE RATE WILL IMPROVE FOREIGN WELFARE.

     The foreign   country is now in the converse situation from that of the

domestic country in Proposition (3). There the domestic country had contracted

as much as It wanted to, but the contraction was concentrated disproportion-

ately in the non—traded goods sector, so an appreciation of its currency was

needed. Here the foreign country has expanded as much as it wants to, but

the expansion is concentrated disproportionately in the non—traded goods

sector, so a depreciation of its currency is needed. The world is indeed

lucky that both countries want the same exchange rate to move in the same

direction!

     Let A be the level that foreign expenditure rises to, according to

equation (19), or its linear form (20), in response to the decrease In domestic

expenditure to A1 .    Then we want to show that


                                  W*(A 1
                                       ,A*,E)
                                         1         <0.                               (22)
                                                                                        22




If we differentiate equation (19), we find that (22) is true if a condition

analogous to condition (17) for the domestic country holds:



 c*    *[fl*(E)A*/y*]1(fl*A1+ [(m*(E)At+m(E)Al)/Y*1m*A*mAl)                            (23)
 d*                            (_n*')A + (_m*')A + (—m')A1


(Recall that the derivatives n' ,           m*'     and m' are negative.) From

equation (20), we know that, once the foreign country has raised its expendi—
                                           c*
ture to the optimizing level A ,                  is equal to a weighted average of

two terms:


                        (a*)



                        (b*) *{(m*(E)A +


where the weights are


                                   (20a)        —         —      and
                                           n*(E) + m*(E)


                                                  m* (E
                                   (20b) ______________         , respectively.
                                                —         —
                                           n*(E) + m*(E)


The RHS of condition (23) is a weighted average of the same two terms,

(a*) and (b*) ,   with   weights:


                                                _*' A*               and
                           (23a)
                                       _n*'A — m*IA!      —
                                                              m'A1


                                           _m*'A * — m'A1
                               (23b)                                   respectively.
                                       _n*'A _m*'A — m'A1
                                                                                                       23

 (8) for the foreign country,


                                  >    ni*(E)
                                            —       (_n*   )   because
                                       n*(E)


 by Proposition (1) outputs in the two sectors were originally proportionate

 to their full—employment levels:


                                  a*Y*(A0,A,) =                n*(E)A
and


                 (1 —                           =
                        ct*)Y*(A0,A*,)              m*(E)A         + m(E)A0 > m*(E)A3


This means that the ratio of the weights (20a) and (20b) is greater than the

ratio of the weights (23a) and (23b):

                                        —              _n*'A1*
                                      n*(E)
                                        —           _m*'A*1    —   mtA
                                   m*(E)                              1


The two terms, (a*) and (b*), would be equal to each other if
                                                                                       A0 and A
were substituted for A1 and 4 , again by Proposition (1). But since A

has decreased to A1 and A* has increased to At                            ,   the first term (a*) is
now greater than the second (b*). Since the relative weight on the first term

is greater in equation (20),                is indeed greater than the RHS of condition

(23). Thus (22) holds: a decrease in the exchange rate raises foreign

welfare.

      We originally proved Proposition (3) on the assumption that foreign

expenditure A* could be taken as given. Now that we have recognized that,
                                                                                   24




at the given exchange rate, the foreign country will respond to the domestic

contraction by expanding its expenditure, we must take this into account.

Equation (14), and its linear form equation (15), tell us that the domestic

country, in order to achieve its desired point on the output—inflation tradeoff,

will react to the increase in A* by reducing further its own expenditure A

We could show that at this new point It is again true that         domestic welfare

would benefit from an incremental fall in the exchange rate. However there is

no reason to assume that the process will stop there. Equation (20), and its

linear form equation (21), tell us that the foreign country will in turn react

to the further contraction by undertaking a further expansion. Then the domestic

country will contract further, and so on. The logical thing to do is to take up

the question when the process converges.


     (6) IN THE NASH EQUILIBRIUM IN WHICH BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY

SETTING EXPENDITURE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER COUNTRY'S EXPENDITURE, AN

INCREMENTAL DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE WOULD BENEFIT EACH COUNTRY.

     Indeed   given the further decreases in domestic expenditure and increases

in foreign expenditure which are necessary to reach Nash equilibrium, domestic

output becomes even more skewed away from nontraded goods than it was under

Proposition (3), so the appreciation of its currency Is even more needed; and

similarly foreign output becomes even more skewed toward nontraded goods, so

the depreciation of its currency is even more needed.

     Figure (5) graphs the dependence of domestic expenditure on foreign

expenditure on the same axes as the graph showing how foreign expenditure

depends on domestic expenditure. The Nash equilibrium occurs at the intersec-

tion, point N0    .   It   is clear from equation (14), or its linear form equa—
                                                                                                       25



 tion (15), that when the domestic country's marginal rate of substitution

between inflation and unemployment, c/d                   ,    falls,   its policy reaction schedule

shifts inward in Figure (5). The two countries can then be thought of as

taking turns in adjusting their policies in reaction to each other until the

new Nash equilibrium is reached.

     We can solve equations (15) and (21) algebraically for the equilibrium

point. The solution is


                              +   x)   -        +
                                           [a       1   a) [x (a* + m*) (1a)J
                          (            x        Ef      l_a* +m* + ___
                                   1-a                    m*             mj 1-a     m




and similarly for *

     The derivation of the welfare effects proceeds along the same lines as

before. For the domestic country, because the Nash equilibrium point repre-

sents an optimal setting of A ,                 equation (14) holds with A = A          and
A* = A*   .   The condition necessary for


                                                W(A,*,E) < o


is the same as condition (17), but with A substituted for
                                                                                  A1 , and    A*
for A .       We   can again think of two terms, the first less than the second

because A <
                A0
                     and A* >
                                   A0      ,   of   which the RHS of (14) is a weighted average

with relatively more weight on the first (14a) than the second (14b), and of

which the RHS of (17) is a weighted average with relatively more weight on the

second (17b) than the first (17a). It follows that the inequality holds.

An appreciation benefits the domestic country.
                                                                                26




      For the foreign country, because the Nash equilibrium point represents

an optimal setting of A* ,    equation (20) holds with A* = A* and A A
The condition necessary for


                                 W*(A,A*,E) <



is   the same as condition (23), but with A and A* substituted. Of the

two terms, the first is greater than the second. The RHS of (20) is a weighted

average that puts relatively more weight on the first (20a) than the second

(20b), and the RHS of (23) is a weighted average that puts relatively more

weight on the second (23b) than the first (23a). It again follows that the

inequality holds. A depreciation of its currency benefits the foreign country.


CONCLUSION

      We have shown that, given a U.S. monetary contraction, an appreciation

of the dollar is beneficial to both countries in that it allows them each to

achieve the best possible tradeoff between output and inflation.   We have

chosen to concentrate on an incremental change in the exchange rate. The

finite change in the exchange rate that actually takes place could be greater

than or less than the change, described in Propositions 1 and 2, that is

optimal for the domestic country. If the actual change were larger than the

optimal change by a wide enough margin, the country could theoretically be

worse off than if the exchange rate had not moved at all. But one would have

to argue that the output decline in export industries is much greater than

the output decline in nontraded industries like housing. In the case of the

1980—82 U.S. contraction, this does not appear to have been the case.
                                                                                 27




      In the only major sector that is unambiguously non—traded, construction,

output in the United States fell by 11 per cent from 1979 to 1981. In

manufacturing, by contrast, output fell by only 2 per cent. More disaggre—

gated data are available only for employment. For a set of 14 individual

industries that are the most clearly non—traded, the 1979—1981 change in

employment (1.88 per cent) was almost exactly the same as the change in

non—agricultural employment in the economy as a whole (1.91 per cent).9

     We could have chosen to model explicitly the exchange rate, and each

country's level of expenditure, as functions of the countries' monetary

policies and fiscal or debt policies, in order to see the welfare effects

of the actual exchange rate change. But this approach would have complicated

the Nash equilibrium solution considerably. More importantly, the results

would have been very dependent on the particular model used. The approach

followed here, working directly in terms of the exchange rate and expenditure

levels, has allowed us to keep the argument as general and model—free as

possible.

3.   See Mussa (1979) for a review of the standard results on transmission.

     There are of course a number of other ways besides capital mobility

     that the insulation claim can be undone. An increase in the exchange

     rate will not insulate the economy from a foreign contraction if the

     increase in import prices affects saving (the Laursen—Metzler effect),

     the demand for money, or nominal wages or other factor costs (e.g.

     through wage indexation). In this paper I abstract from these factors;

     in the case of saving and money demand, my treatment of expenditure as a

     policy variable accomplishes this abstraction automatically.

4. Presumably the contraction in European expenditure has not been as great

     as the contraction in U.S. expenditure. This would explain the outcome

     that the dollar/European exchange rate did, after all, fall. It would in

     turn be explained by the observation that it was in the United States

     that the fight against inflation was given increased priority; there is

     no reason to assume a similar political shift in Europe as a whole.

5. For example Robert Gordon (p. 194) offers some evidence that the Phillips

     curve is flat at high levels of unemployment. J. N. Fleming (p. 471)

     claimed that "the inverse relationships between unemployment and price

     inflation. .   . are typically curvilinear, at least in the vicinity of full
                                                                                30



     employment. As unemployment approaches zero successive percentage

     declines in unemployment must impart increasingly powerful stimuli to

     Inflation." Fleming used this fact to argue that the average Phillips

     curve tradeoff among a group of countries will be more favorable under

     floating exchange rates than fixed exchange rates. However, this is not

     the same as showing that each country Individually will be better off

     under floating rates, which is the object of the present paper.

6. Or if we allowed the price of the exportable good to be determined on

     world markets.

7.   Even if the indifference curves are not in reality linear, the proposi-

     tions derived here will be valid in the neighborhood of point 0 ,   i.e.
     for small policy changes (assuming of course the indifference curves are

     differentiable).

8. Europe has in fact responded to the 1980—82 U.S. monetary contraction by

     contracting, not expanding, as measured for example by real interest rates.

     But this is what we would expect in equation (19) from the large discrete

     appreciation of the dollar. If Europe did not reduce A* , a sufficiently

     large fall in E would raise both        and Y , pushing Europe higher
     on the inflation—output curve than desired.

9.   The source for the output figures is the Economic Report of the President,

     1983, Table B—li. The source for the employment figures is the Supplement

     to Employment and Earnings, U.S. Dept. of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics,

     Aug. 1981 and March 1982. The 14 non—traded industries and their employ-

     ment levels are given in Table 1.   (Note that employment increased slightly

     in both sectors, despite the fall in output and increase in the unemployment

     rate due to the recession.)
