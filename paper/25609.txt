                                          ABSTRACT

We propose a model to identify the causes of rising profits and concentration, and declining entry
and investment in the US economy. Our approach combines a rich structural DSGE model with
cross-sectional identification from firm and industry data. Using asset prices, our model estimates
the realized and anticipated shocks that drive the endogeneity of entry and concentration and
recovers shocks to entry costs. We validate our approach by showing that the model-implied
entry shocks correlate with independently constructed measures of entry regulation and M&A
activities. We conclude that entry costs have risen and that the ensuing decline in competition has
depressed consumption by five to ten percent.

1       Introduction

Since 2000, U.S. industries have become more concentrated and firms’ profit margins have increased.

Figure 1 shows the ratio of Corporate Profits1 to Value Added for the U.S. Non-Financial Corporate

sector, along with the weighted average change in 8-firm concentration ratio in manufacturing and

non-manufacturing industries. Another important stylized fact – discussed below – is that business

investment has been weak relative to measures of profitability, funding costs, and market values since

the early 2000s. Moreover, investment has been weak precisely in industries that have become more

concentrated.

    While these stylized facts are well established (Furman, 2015; Grullon, Larkin and Michaely, 2016;

Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017), their interpretation remains controversial. There is little agreement

about the causes and consequences of these evolutions. For instance, Furman (2015) and CEA (2016)

argue that the rise in concentration suggests “economic rents and barriers to competition”, while

Autor et al. (2017) argue almost exactly the opposite: that concentration reflects “a winner takes most

feature” explained by the fact that “consumers have become more sensitive to price and quality due to

greater product market competition.” The evolution of profits and investment could also be explained

by intangible capital deepening, as discussed in Crouzet and Eberly (2018).2

    Several reasons explain why the literature has remained inconclusive. The first challenge is that

entry, exit, concentration, investment, and markups are all jointly endogenous and it is difficult to

find exogenous variations in any of these variables. The second challenge is that the macroeconomic

implications of rising competition are difficult to analyze outside a fully specified model. As a result,

both the empirical and the theoretical literature are limited. Empirically, little has been done to identify

the causes of the trends in Figure 1. On the other hand, most theoretical models treat competition

as a residual. They simply assume that markups have changed and study the implications without

attempting to link them to independent measures of barriers to competition.

    Our paper is a first attempt to address these issues. We propose a new approach to disentangle

the various explanations by using a structural model together with micro-economic data. We build a

fully specified macro model of the U.S. economy, featuring many industries and taking into account

not only entry and investment, but also demand and interest rates.

    The key identification issue is that entry and concentration are endogenous. To be concrete,

consider an industry j where firms operate competitively under decreasing returns to scale. Suppose

industry j receives the news at time t that the demand for its products will increase at some time

t + τ in the future. There would be immediate entry of new firms in the industry. As a result, we

would measure a decrease in concentration (or in Herfindahl indexes) followed and/or accompanied by

an increase in investment. Anticipated demand (or productivity) shocks can thus explain why we see
   2
     Trade and globalization can also explain some of the same facts (Feenstra and Weinstein, 2017). Foreign competition
can lead to an increase in measured (domestic) concentration (e.g. textile industry), and a decoupling of firm value from
the localization of investment. One could entertain other hypotheses – such as weak demand or credit constraints – but
previous research has shown that they do not fit the facts. See Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017) for detailed discussions
and references.



                                                           2
more investment in less concentrated industries even if it is not due to competition.

   We make three contributions to the literature. Our first contribution is to use our model together

with macro time series and panel data from firms and industries to address the identification issue. We

specify a model with a rich set of demand and supply shocks, including shocks to investors’ expectations,

and we use the model’s joint restrictions to identify the shocks. Using current output together with

forward looking asset prices, our model can recover the shocks to expected demand across industries.

We find that these shocks are large in the late 1990s, and, exactly as theory would predict, they explain

variation in entry rates. Instead of being an empirical roadblock, however, these large shocks become

a powerful way to estimate some important parameters of the model, such as the elasticity of entry to

Tobin’s Q.

   Our main contribution is to link the structurally estimated shocks to measures of regulations and

antitrust enforcement, thereby providing the first direct structural evidence that policy is (partly)

responsible for decreasing competition in the U.S. economy. This requires many steps, as we explain

below, but the broad intuition is relatively simple. Using Bayesian estimation methods, our model

recovers a full panel of entry costs across time and industries. On the other hand, we use micro data to

construct independent measures of entry regulations and M&A activities for the same set of industries.

We show that the model-implied entry cost shocks track rather closely our empirical measures of entry

regulations, even though they come from entirely different data sources and methodologies.

   The final contribution of the paper is methodological but it turns out to be empirically important.

We specify the likelihood function for the panel of data and we estimate the model while taking into

account the zero lower bound (ZLB). We solve for the path of the economy using the solution method

and approach of Jones (2018). We use a Kalman filter and information about expected duration of

the ZLB to back out the other shocks that drive the model (including productivity, discount rate, risk

premia). While this might seem like a separate issue, we show that, in fact, it is critical understand

the behavior of the economy, for two reasons. The ZLB, by depressing the economy, has a significant

impact on entry and therefore on concentration. If we did not properly model the ZLB, we would

over-estimate the magnitude and impact of aggregate entry costs. In addition, because entry costs

affect the natural rate of interest, the consequences of entry shocks are different with or without the

ZLB.

   To summarize, our main finding is that time-varying competition has had a significant impact on

macro-economic dynamics over the past 30 years. For instance, absent the decrease in competition


                                                   3
since 2003, consumption would be 5 to 10 percents higher by 2015 and the capital stock would have

been 1 to 3 percent higher by 2015.


Literature      Our approach introduces several new ways to examine the relationship between firm

entry, competition, and the macroeconomy. A large empirical literature has looked at entry, concen-

tration, and firms dynamics. Decker et al. (2015) argue that, whereas in the 1980’s and 1990’s declining

dynamism was observed in selected sectors (notably retail), the decline was observed across all sectors

in the 2000’s, including the traditionally high-growth information technology sector. Furman (2015)

shows that “the distribution of returns to capital has grown increasingly skewed and the high returns

increasingly persistent” and argues that it “potentially reflects the rising influence of economic rents

and barriers to competition.”3 CEA (2016) and Grullon et al. (2016) are the first papers to exten-

sively document the broad increases in profits and concentration. Grullon et al. (2016) also show that

firms in concentrating industries experience positive abnormal stock returns and more profitable M&A

deals. Blonigen and Pierce (2016) find that M&As are associated with increases in average markups.

Alexander and Eberly (2016), and Lee et al. (2016) present recent firm and industry level evidence on

investment and Q. Dottling et al. (2017) find that concentration has increased in the U.S. while it has

remained stable (or decreased) in Europe. Autor et al. (2017) study the link between concentration

and the labor share. An important issue in the literature is the measurement of markups and excess

profits. De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) estimate markups using the ratio of sales to costs of goods

sold. Over long horizons, however, it is difficult to separate excess profits from changes in the capital

share. Barkai (2017), on the other hand, estimates directly the required return on capital and finds a

significant increase in excess profits.

       Our paper is also related to general equilibrium models with imperfect competition. Bilbiie et

al. (2012) study how entry affects the propagation of business cycles in a standard RBC model with

technology shocks. Eggertsson et al. (2018) take entry as exogenous and model a time-varying elasticity

of substitution between intermediate goods to study the impact of time-varying market power on a

number of broad macroeconomic trends. In our model, entry decisions are endogenous to the state of

the economy, including future expectations of demand, and we connect entry costs to explicit measures

of entry regulations.
   3
    Furman (2015) also emphasizes emphasizes the weakness of corporate fixed investment and points out that low
investment has coincided with high private returns to capital, implying an increase in the payout rate (dividends and
shares buyback).

        Following Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), a large and growing literature studies the consequences

of a binding ZLB on the nominal rate of interest. The ZLB has been proposed as an explanation

for the slow recovery of most major economies following the financial crisis of 2008-2009 (Summers,

2013). Eggertsson et al. (2019) propose a model of secular stagnation, including a study of the role of

demographic changes. Swanson and Williams (2014) study the impact on long rates. Most studies of

the liquidity trap are based on simple New-Keynesian models that abstract from capital accumulation

(see Fernández-Villaverde et al. 2015 for the exact properties of the New Keynesian model around the

ZLB). Capital accumulation complicates matters, however, as consumption and investment can move

in opposite directions.

        Section 2 presents the relevant facts about the U.S. economy in recent years. Section 3 presents

our benchmark model. We start from a standard DSGE model in which we allow for the possibility

that the zero lower bound constraint on short term nominal rates binds.



2        Two Facts About Profits and Investment

This section shows why it is critical to understand the dynamics of investment in concentrating indus-

tries.4


Fact 1: Investment is Low Relative to Profits and Q. The first stylized fact is that business

investment has been weak relative to measures of profitability, funding costs, and market values since

the early 2000s. The top chart in Figure 2 shows the ratio of aggregate net investment and net

repurchases to net operating surplus for the non financial corporate sector, from 1960 to 2015. As

shown, investment as a share of operating surplus has fallen, while buybacks have risen. The bottom

chart shows the residuals (by year and cumulative) of a regression of net investment on (lagged) Q

from 1990 to 2001, illustrating that investment has been low relative to Q since the early 2000’s. By

2015, the cumulative under-investment is large at around 10% of capital.


Fact 2: The Rise in Profits and Lack of Investment Comes from Concentrating Industries.

Grullon et al. (2016) show that profits increased in concentrating industries. Figure 3 shows that the

capital gap is coming from concentrating industries. The solid (dotted) line plots the implied capital

gap relative to Q for the top (bottom) 10 concentrating industries. For each group, the capital gap

is calculated based on the cumulative residuals of separate industry-level regressions of net industry

investment from the BEA on our measure of (lagged) industry Q from Compustat.



3     Model

Motivated by these facts, we use a model with capital accumulation, nominal rigidities, and time-

varying competition with firm entry. We organize firms into industries and, for simplicity, separate

them into capital producers – who lend their capital stock – and good producers – who hire capital

and labor to produce goods and services. We use data at the industry-level on concentration and

profitability to estimate the elasticity of firm entry to changes in Q. We then use those estimates to

understand the aggregate consequences of changes in entry costs.

    We use a standard nested CES demand system. The final good is a composite of industry-level

outputs aggregated by a perfectly competitive final goods firm:

3.2     Goods Producers

The goods-producing firms in industry j hire capital and labor for production and make pricing deci-

sions. The number of firms in an industry in our model is time-varying. Firms pay an entry cost to

become active producers in the subsequent period, with the price of entry increasing in the number of

entrants.

Each industry j is populated by firms indexed by i who face pricing and production decisions. They

face the industry demand curve

Indexation keeps the dispersion of prices small. In addition, we estimate relatively small nominal rigidities, so the impact
of these rigidities on productivity (output) and value (Tobin’s Q) are negligible.




                                                                          9
where, with some abuse of notation, we denote by yj,t the average firm output in industry j. We see

here is impact of product variety on productivity. The economy’s flexible price index from (2) can be

written as Pt .


3.2.2    Firm Entry

We model firm entry in the goods-producing sector as follows. The number of firms in industry j

evolves according to

                                      Nj,t+1 = (1 − δn )Nj,t + nj,t .                                 (19)

Each active firms disappears with probability δn , while nj,t is the number of new entrants that become

active in period t + 1. Entry requires a fixed input κt produced by a competitive industry with a

convex cost function, so that the input price is


                                            pej,t = (κt nj,t )φn .                                    (20)


Free entry then requires that

                                          pej,t κt ≥ Et Λt+1 Vj,t+1 ,                                 (21)

where Vj,t = (1 − χj,t )yj,t + (1 − δn )Et Λt+1 Vj,t+1 is the value of the goods-producing firm and yj,t is

average output as explained earlier. Equation (21) holds with equality as long as nj,t > 0, which is the

case in our simulations.

   Finally, an industry’s total Q combines the rents of capital and goods producers, all measured at

the end of the period
                                                        (1 − δn )Et [Λt+1 Vj,t+1 ]
                                  Qj,t = Qkj,t +                                   .                  (22)
                                                               Ptk Kj,t+1

The elasticity of the number of entrants nj,t to Qj,t is therefore parameterized by φn . The cross-industry

relationships between concentration, profits, and output will be key to determining this sensitivity,

which is important for quantifying the aggregate effects of entry shocks.


3.3     Households

We next introduce a standard household sector and wage setting mechanism. Households maximize

lifetime utility                          "∞                               !#

where Wt is the nominal wage and R̃t is the (random) nominal gross return on savings from time t − 1

to time t. The household’s real pricing kernel between periods t and t + j is

                                                                          γ

By definition of the pricing kernel, nominal asset returns must satisfy

3.4   Monetary Policy

Finally, to close the model, we specify a policy rule for the central bank, taking into account the zero

lower bound on nominal interest rates. We assume that monetary policy follows a Taylor rule for the

nominal interest rate


                     r̃t∗ = − log (β) + φi r̃t−1
                                             ∗
                                                 + (1 − φi ) φp πtp + φy ln Yt − ln YtF
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                         ,   (29)


where πtp is price-level inflation, YtF is the flexible price level of output, and where the actual (log)

short rate is constrained by the zero lower bound


                                                     r̃t = max (0; r̃t∗ ) .                                  (30)




                                                               11
At the zero lower bound, we allow for forward guidance as an extension of the zero lower bound

duration beyond that implied by fundamentals and the shocks. We discipline the durations by using

the durations observed, as discussed in the estimation section below.


3.5       Shocks

We model the following shocks (where lowercase letters denote variables in logs):

       • Industry-level demand shifter dj,t = log Dj,t :


                                             dj,t = (1 − ρ̃d )dj + ρ̃d dj,t−1 + σ̃d dj,t .                               (31)


         We estimate transitory shocks to dj,t , or dj,t , to help account for variation in relative industry

         output over time. We also estimate shocks to beliefs about dj , the steady-state value of demand,

         which can differ from fundamentals. In our baseline specification, we will estimate changes to

         steady-state beliefs between 1995Q1 and 1999Q4. This specification is chosen to account for

         excess entry observed in a number of industries before 2000.6

                                                                                        a + ζ a , where
       • A productivity shock to industry-level output, for aj,t = log Aj,t = log Aj + ζj,t  t

                                                      ζj,t = ρ̃a ζj,t−1 + σ̃a aj,t                                       (32)

                                                       ζta = ρa ζt−1
                                                                 a
                                                                     + σa at .                                           (33)


         There are, therefore, industry-specific and aggregate shocks to productivity.

       • A shock to the valuation of corporate assets for both capital-producing and goods-producing
   6
     The presence of noisy entry is documented in several papers. Doms (2004), for example, studies IT investment and
firm entry during the 1990s. He concludes that a “reason for the high growth rates in IT investment was that expectations
were too high, especially in two sectors of the economy, telecommunications services and the dot-com sector,” where dot-
com covers a wide range of traditional sectors, from retail trade to business services. See also Hogendorn (2011). One
explanation for noisy entry is potential variations in the willingness of investors (venture capitalists, or market participants
in general) to fund risky ventures. This is particularly important during the 1990s given the large inflows into Venture
Capital (VC). According to the National Venture Capital Association, annual VC commitments surged during the bubble
period, growing from about $10 billion in 1995 to more than $100 billion in 2000. They then receded to about $30
billion per year for the next decade (NVCA (2010)). According to Gompers and Lerner (2001), about 60 percent of
VC funding in 1999 went to information technology industries, especially communications and networking, software, and
information services. About 10 percent went into life sciences and medical companies, and the rest is spread over all
other types of companies. Clearly, not all entry is funded by VC firms, so this can only explain a portion of the variation
in entry rates, but the wide dispersion, and strong industry focus highlights the differential impact of the dot-com bubble
across industries. Another explanation is the presence of large stock market variations across industries, as documented
by Anderson et al. (2010). These extreme valuations may translate into excess investment and excess entry, especially
because firm entry increases precisely during periods of high-growth such as the late 1990’s.

     The valuation shock is a risk premium shock that applies to corporate (risky) assets, which will

     help us account for time varying-risk aversion and expected returns. In reduced-form, this shock

     has similar implications as the marginal efficiency of investment shocks studied by Justiniano et

     al. (2011).

     These shocks will help us account for the observed variation in prices at the industry and aggre-

     gate level.

In addition to the aggregate shocks to productivity, valuation of corporate assets, entry costs, and

economy-wide inflation, we include the following shocks at the aggregate level. These shocks will help

us account for the aggregate data.

4     Estimation

We next discuss the parameterization of the model for the quantitative analysis. We first calibrate

a set of parameters to those commonly used in the literature and to moments in the data. We then

estimate with Bayesian methods a small set of key structural parameters, beliefs about demand, and

the persistence and size of transitory shocks.

    The estimation is conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the industry-level data is used to

estimate σ and φn , along with the parameters of the industry-level shock processes. In the second

stage, the estimated value of φn is used in an aggregated version of the model with a single sector,

and the parameters of the aggregate-level shock processes are estimated. We then use the estimated

aggregate model to conduct our aggregate experiments on the role of firm entry.


4.1    Calibrated Parameters

Table 1 presents the assigned and calibrated parameters for our quarterly model. These estimates are

based on 43 industries that cover the U.S. Business sector.7 We set δn , the exogenous firm exit rate, to

0.09/4 to match the average annual exit rate of Compustat firms.8 We calibrate the quarterly capital
   7
     Investment and output data are available for 63 granular industry groupings from the BEA. We omit 7 industries in
the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate sector. We also omit the ‘Management of companies and enterprises’ industry
because no data is available in Compustat for it. We then group some of the remaining industries due to missing data
at the most granular-level (Hospitals and Nursing and residential care facilities), or to ensure that all groupings have
material investment; good Compustat coverage; and reasonably stable investment and concentration time series.
   8
     We use Compustat firms to focus on the exit of large firms.

adjustment cost φk to a value of 20, in line with a regression across industries of net investment on

Tobin’s Q, with a full set of time and industry fixed effects. Next, we calibrate the within-industry,

across-firm elasticities of substitution, j , parameters to match the gross operating surplus to output

ratio in 1993 from the BEA industry series.9 Most values are centered around 5, the standard cali-

bration in New Keynesian models, while some industries have higher elasticities of substitution, which

reflect relatively low and persistent profit levels in those industries.10

    In the second stage of the estimation with a single intermediate-goods sector, we set the elasticity

of substitution across varieties to  = 5, which is around the average of our calibrated j parameters

across industries, and which is in line with a standard calibration of the elasticity of substitution in the

New Keynesian literature, implying a steady-state markup of 25%. We also calibrate the parameters

of the monetary policy rule to those estimated by Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), with a weight on

the interest rate smoothing parameter φr of 0.86, a weight on deviations of inflation from target of φp

of 1.71, and a weight on deviations of output from its flexible price level φy of 0.05.


4.2    Estimated Parameters

With industry-level data, we estimate σ, φn , and the persistence and variance of the industry-level

shocks. We also estimate beliefs dj about the steady-state level of demand in industry j, which all

agents are assumed to hold between 1995Q1 and 1999Q4, and which we assume revert to their true

value of dj = 0 in 2000Q1. With aggregate-level data, we estimate the persistence and variance of

aggregate shocks.


4.3    Data

We use cross-sectional data in our identification, based on heterogeneity across industries (and firms).

At the industry level, we use annual data on concentration ratios, Q, nominal output, capital, and

prices, from 1989 to 2015.11

    • We measure concentration for BEA segments using the data of Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017)

      from Compustat. In particular, we measure the concentration ratio as the share of sales by the
   9
     The model’s implied steady-state gross operating surplus to output ratio changes as σ changes. In the estimation we
recalibrate the values of j accordingly. Figure A.2 in the Appendix plots the distribution of j across industries in our
baseline calibration.
  10
     For most industries, the gross operating surplus to output ratios are stable and do not change much over time, as we
show in the Appendix.
  11
     The Appendix provides a complete description of the data used.



                                                           15
         top 8 firms in the industry (concentration ratio).12 To account for global competition, we correct

         the concentration ratio for imports using data from Pierce and Schott (2012). In the model, all

         firms are identical, so that the Herfindahl index is (yi,j,t/Yj,t )2 di = (yi,j,t/Nj,t yj,t )2 di = 1/Nj,t .
                                                             R                    R

         We therefore match the concentration ratio we measure in the data to 1/Nj,t in the model.

       • We measure industry Q as the ratio of market value to total assets across all firms in Compustat

         that belong to a given BEA industry.13 In our baseline, we match the observed values of Q to

         the Q of goods-producers.14

       • We measure nominal output and and prices at the industry-level using the BEA’s GDP-By-

         Industry accounts.

       • We measure investment and capital stocks at the industry-level using the BEA’s Fixed Assets

         Tables.

To compare the model and the data, we express the industry-level data series relative to their respective

aggregate series, by subtracting a full set of time effects, one for each year and each variable. We also

subtract an industry-specific fixed effect. The resulting series for each industry are plotted in the

Appendix.

       At the aggregate level, our data is quarterly from 1989Q1 to 2015Q1, and includes the Fed Funds

rate, the change in real consumption per capita, the net investment rate, inflation, and employment.

We also link observed changes in the aggregate concentration ratio to changes in the model’s aggregate

Herfindahl index. To discipline the expected durations of the zero lower bound between 2009Q1 and

2015Q1, we use data from the New York Federal Reserve Survey of Primary Dealers, following Kulish

et al. (2017). The Appendix describes and plots the aggregate data that we use.


4.4      Solution Method

We use the relative variation across industries to identify the key parameters of our model that are

critical for governing the dynamics of firm entry. Using industry-level variation for our identification

builds on Jones, Midrigan and Philippon (2018), and exploits the structure of the model to overcome
  12
     We have validated that Compustat-based concentration ratios (adjusted for the share of Compustat sales) exhibit
similar behavior as the Census. The two series exhibit a 65 to 70% correlation in levels and 40 to 50% in 5-year changes,
while the aggregate trend is also similar.
  13
     Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017) compare alternate measures of Q used in the literature and conclude that market-
to-book is the most robust and stable definition
  14
     We explore robustness to matching Q in the data to the aggregate sector level Q, which combines both the rents of
the goods-producers and the capital-producers. We discuss these robustness exercises below.


                                                           16
two key challenges with respect to the approximation of our model. The first challenge is to model

time-varying beliefs about the steady-state of industry-level demand that differs from fundamentals,

for each industry. The second challenge is to simultaneously account for the nonlinearities caused by

the zero lower bound. In this section, we discuss each challenge in turn. In the next section, we discuss

how we use our approximation below to form the likelihood function for estimation.


Solution Method for Beliefs         We first discuss the linearized solution under time-varying beliefs for

a single industry denoted by j, abstracting from industry j’s dependence on aggregate variables. We

follow Kulish and Gibbs (2017) in specifying two regimes: one under the industry’s true parameters,

and another where beliefs about demand differ from the truth. Denote the true demand regime which

is driving the observables as


                                  Axjt = C + Bxjt−1 + DEt xjt+1 + Fjt ,                              (46)


where xjt is the vector of state variables for an industry j and jt collects the shocks for industry j.

However, suppose that agents in the model instead believe that an alternative demand regime is true,

believing that the industry’s law of motion is driven by the regime denoted by the ∗ matrices


                                A∗ xjt = C∗ + B∗ xjt−1 + D∗ Et xjt+1 + F∗ jt .                       (47)


Our goal is to construct the reduced-form VAR approximation for industry j of the form


                                         xjt = Jt + Qt xjt−1 + Gt jt .                               (48)


In periods when beliefs Et xjt+1 accord with regime (46), the solution is the standard time-invariant

solution

                                          xjt = J + Qxjt−1 + Gjt .                                   (49)

Instead, in periods when beliefs Et xjt+1 are formed with (47) then Et xjt+1 = J∗ + Q∗ xjt , where J∗ and

Q∗ are the matrices of the reduced form solution corresponding to the system (47). Substituting these




                                                      17
beliefs Et xjt+1 into (46) and rearranging gives


                                      Q̃ = [A − DQ∗ ]−1 B                                            (50)

                                      G̃ = [A − DQ∗ ]−1 F                                            (51)

                                       J̃ = [A − DQ∗ ]−1 [C + DJ∗ ]                                  (52)


For our time-varying representation (48), we therefore set Qt = Q, Gt = G, and Jt = J in periods

when beliefs align with the truth, and Qt = Q̃ , Gt = G̃, and Jt = J̃ in periods when beliefs differ

from the truth.


Zero Lower Bound Our second computational challenge is to approximate the dynamics of our

model where the policy rate is subject to the zero lower bound. We do so following the approach of

Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015) and Jones (2017). The logic of the solution follows the time-varying

approximation (48) that we use for estimating demand beliefs. We define two additional regimes, one

for when the zero lower bound does not bind, and one for when the zero lower bound binds. At each

point in time the zero lower bound is observed, we assume that agents believe no shocks will occur in

the future and iterate backwards through our model’s equilibrium conditions from the date that the

zero lower bound is conjectured to stop binding. We then iterate on the periods that the interest rate

is conjectured to be in effect until it converges, after which the solution is that in (48).


4.5   The Likelihood Function

The direct approach to estimating the parameters of the model and demand beliefs would be to form

the likelihood function using the solution (48) and the industry and aggregate data together. However,

the nonlinearities induced by the zero lower bound together with the large number of industries makes

this approach computationally infeasible.

   As a result, we follow Jones, Midrigan and Philippon (2018) and construct the likelihood function

differently and exploit the relative variation across industry outcomes for identification. This approach

allows us to separate the likelihood into an industry-level component and an aggregate component and

conduct the estimation in two stages.

   Let xjt denote the vector of variables for each industry j, expressed in log-deviations from the steady

state. Under a piece-wise linear approximation and an assumption that aggregate shocks propagate to



                                                    18
each industry in the same way we can write the evolution of xjt as the sum of two components:



                             xjt = J + Qxjt−1 + Gjt + Jat + Qat x∗t−1 + Gat ∗t .                     (53)

Here, the first set of matrices, J, Q and G, account for how an industry’s variables depend on its own

state variables and industry-specific shocks jt , while the vector x∗t collects the aggregate variables and

∗t collects the aggregate shocks, and the matrices Jat , Qat and Gat express how the industries’ variables

depend on the aggregate variables, with the aggregate variables evolving according to:


                                         x∗t = J∗t + Q∗t x∗t−1 + G∗t ∗t                               (54)


The matrices multiplying the aggregate variables and shocks are time-varying because of the nonlin-

earities caused by the zero lower bound. In contrast, the matrix of coefficients J, Q and G multiplying

the industry-level variables is time-invariant.

   Intuitively, under (53), for an industry j, aggregate shocks and the zero lower bound do not change

the response of firms in that industry to its own history of idiosyncratic shocks. Under this, letting

xt = xjt dj denote the economy-wide average of the industry-level variables, the deviation of industry-
     R

level variables from their economy-wide averages,


                                                x̂jt = xjt − xt ,                                      (55)


can be written as a time-invariant function of industry-level variables alone:


                                          x̂jt = J + Qx̂jt−1 + Gjt ,                                  (56)


                                     jt dj = 0, that industry-level shocks have zero mean in the aggre-
                                 R
where we use the assumption

gate. We then use the representation in (54) and (56) to estimate the model using industry-level and

aggregate U.S. data, separately. Because the industry-level outcomes are independent of each other,

the likelihood contribution of industry-level data as a whole is the sum of each industry’s likelihood

contribution. We then use standard Bayesian methods to characterize the posterior distribution of the

model’s parameters.

4.6   Estimates

Table 2 presents moments of the prior and posterior distributions of the estimated parameters, for

both the industry and aggregate-level parameters.


Industry Estimates       Panel A shows the estimates of σ and φn , and Panel B shows moments of

the posterior distributions of the persistence and standard errors of the industry specific shocks. We

choose wide priors for the parameters. The value of σ is estimated to be around 0.4, suggesting that

the industry-level outputs are complementary, which is reasonable for broad classes of goods, and

consistent with the trade literature. The value of φn is around 1.5, with a 10th and 90th percentile of

1.1 and 2.3, respectively. The implications of these estimates for the speed of firm entry are discussed

in the next section. The persistence of entry shocks is low, being centered around 0.1. The persistence

of demand shocks is high, close to 1, while the persistence of the technology shocks is around 0.9.

   The estimates of beliefs about demand that are held between 1995 and 2000 are plotted in Figure 4.

Agents in the model hold beliefs about steady-state demand Dj during this period, when in truth, the

steady-state value of demand for all industries is Dj = 1. We choose a diffuse prior for each estimated

Dj which is an equal mixture of an inverse gamma distribution with a mode of 1 and a uniform

distribution between 0 and 100. This prior has a 10th percentile around 1, a mode slightly above 1,

and a 90th percentile around 80. We assume that from 2000 on, beliefs revert and align with their

true assumed values.

   Most estimates of Dj = log dj are around their fundamental value of dj = 0. Some industries are

estimated to have low expected demand; for example, rail transport has an estimated expected steady-

state demand of around -0.5. In addition, some durable manufacturing industries are estimated to have

low beliefs about demand, such as durable non-metal and durable miscellaneous manufacturing, which

have estimated steady-state demands of around -0.3. Agriculture, waste management, and wholesale

trade are also estimated to have comparatively low beliefs about steady-state demand between 1995

and 2000.

   By contrast, technology industries are estimated to have high beliefs about their steady-state levels

of demand between 1995Q1 and 1999Q4, in line with the dot-com exuberance before 2000, and discussed

above in footnote 6. The information data industry are estimated to have beliefs about demand of

around 4, significantly higher than its true value of 0. This industry includes firms such as IBM and,




                                                  20
at present, Google and Facebook.15 The next highest estimated beliefs about demand are for firms

in the durable computing industry, with an estimated demand parameter of 0.7. Firms in this sector

include Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola. We explore the implications of these estimated demand

parameters in the next section.


Aggregate Estimates               Panel C of Table 2 presents estimates of the persistence and size of the

aggregate shock processes. To interpret these, we show the unconditional forecast error variance

decompositions of a set of aggregate variables in Table 3. We find that the aggregate shock to the

valuation of corporate assets – risk premia shocks – are key drivers of aggregate variables. In reduced-

form, this shock has similar implications as the marginal efficiency of investment shocks found to be

key drivers of business cycles in Justiniano et al. (2011). Aggregate entry cost shocks are found to

explain a significant amount of the variation of investment – about 41% – and the natural rate – about

37%. The Herfindahl, corresponding to the number of firms in the economy in our model, is largely

explained by technology shocks (20%), households’ preference shocks (20%) and risk premia shocks

(49%). Entry cost shocks explain about 8% of the unconditional variance in the number of firms. As

shown in counterfactual simulations in the next section, during the period 1989 to 2015, we find an

important role for firm entry cost shocks in explaining investment and the natural interest rate.



5         Firm Entry and the Decline in Investment

In this section, we explore the implications of firm entry for investment, aggregate output and monetary

policy. We first examine the industry-level implications of our estimates, and show that about 10% of

the variation in industry concentration ratios between 1995 and 2000 can be explained by firm entry

caused by our estimated beliefs about an industry’s long-run demand. The remainder of the variation

in relative industry concentration is largely accounted for by transitory entry-cost shocks. We also find

that about 10% of the relative variation in the capital stock is accounted for by demand belief shocks,

with the remainder of the variation mostly accounted for by risk premia shocks.

         We then identify aggregate shocks to firm entry costs and in our main counterfactual, set those

entry costs to zero from 2005 onwards. Our findings suggest that entry cost shocks account for much

of the increase in concentration, and that once the entry cost shocks are removed, we find substantial

effects on aggregate investment, the natural interest rate, and therefore the stance of monetary policy.

In the counterfactual exercise, we find that absent the entry cost shocks, the aggregate Herfindahl

index would have been about 10% lower by 2014 and the capital stock would have been about 2.5%

to 3.5% higher by the start of 2015, depending on how binding the zero lower bound is over 2009 to

2015. In the next section, we show that these entry cost shocks correlate well with empirical proxies

of entry barriers, such as regulation, that are not used in the estimation.


5.1   Industry Implications

We first examine the industry-level impulse responses to industry-level shocks for the average indus-

try with an elasticity of substitution between firm-level goods of  = 5, when the remaining model

parameters are set to the mode of their estimated posterior distributions. Figure 5a plots the re-

sponse of goods-producers’ Qt , industry-level concentration, and real output following a one standard

deviation transitory demand shock. Following the demand shock, industry-level real output rises,

goods-producers’ profits increase, and new firms enter, lowering the Herfindahl and the level of con-

centration in the industry. Our estimate of φn = 1.5 implies that entry into the industry is fairly

gradual. Given our estimates, the impulse response implies that, following a demand shock that raises

goods-producers’ Qt to 10% above steady-state after one year, the number of firms increases by 1.4%

after two years. This is consistent with the evidence in Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018).

   Figure 5b plots the impulse response of the industry-level observables following a one standard

deviation shock to entry costs. Following an increase in entry costs, profits rise and fewer firms enter so

that industry concentration increases with the Herfindahl index rising by just over 1%, while industry-

level real output falls by about 0.1%. Figure 5c plots the impulse response to a one standard deviation

productivity shock, which we find to temporarily lower prices and goods-producers’ Qt , reduce firm

entry, and raise real output.

   We next explore what the estimated shocks imply for the industry-level variables. In Figure 6 we

plot, for the information data industry, the path of the Herfindahl index used in estimation and the

path without stochastic shocks but under the estimated demand beliefs only. In Panel B, we also plot

the path of the capital stock used in estimation and under demand beliefs only for the information

data industry. As discussed earlier, beliefs about steady-state demand are estimated to be strongly

positive for the information data industry. Under these optimistic beliefs about long-run demand only,

firms enter and the Herfindahl falls by about 5%, which is about half of the observed decline in the

relative Herfindahl index between 1995 and 2000. Following the reversion in beliefs back to their true


                                                    22
values in 2000, firms exit the industry and the Herfindahl increases. As shown in Panel B, about a

quarter of the increase in the relative capital stock observed in the information data industry can also

be accounted for using the shock to beliefs about steady-state demand.

       Next, we show for all industries how well the expected demand shock captures the change in firm

concentration. We compute counterfactual paths for each industry under the expected demand regimes

only and plot, in Figure 7, the change in the observed Herfindahl from 1995 to 2000 against the change

in Herfindahl predicted by our model and the estimated demand regime beliefs alone. Across all

industries, the slope of the regression line between the observed and predicted change is 0.06, while the

correlation is about 0.4. In Panel B, we plot the change in the industry capital stock in the data from

1995 to 2000 against the capital stock predicted by our model and the expected demand beliefs only

in 1995. The slope of the fitted line between capital observed and that predicted by expected demand

beliefs is 0.14, while the correlation is 0.76. There is also a slightly positive relationship between

the level of Qt predicted by expected demand beliefs in 1995 and the change in observed Qt , with a

correlation between the predicted and actual levels of 0.14.


5.2      Aggregate Implications

In this section, we explore our estimated model’s implications for aggregate variables. We first obtain

the smoothed shocks that generate the aggregate data.16 With those shocks, we generate a counterfac-

tual series by setting the entry cost shocks to zero from 2003Q1 on, assuming that the zero lower bound

can bind under those shocks, and that the Federal Reserve does not implement forward guidance when

faced with a binding zero lower bound. The simulation results are plotted in Figure 8. Under this

counterfactual, there is substantially more firm entry. Panel A plots the Herfindahl index in the data

and in our counterfactual. By 2006Q1, the Herfindahl is 4.1% lower without entry cost shocks, 11.2%

lower by 2008Q1, and 6.7% lower by 2014Q1. We find that this counterfactual entry has substantial

aggregate effects, even when monetary policy does not react to shocks that caused the Great Recession.

In Panel B we show that, while the Fed Funds rate would have been at its zero lower bound for much

of the 2009Q1 to 2015Q1 period, it would have been positive between 2010 and 2012.

       In addition, Figure 8 plots how the economy would have reacted under all shocks but where

monetary policy is not constrained by the zero lower bound. In this case, we estimate that the zero
  16
     For this experiment, we keep the Herfindahl fixed at its 2012Q1 level from 2012Q1 on. This ensures our Herfindahl
series is consistent with the patterns observed in Census data (available only until 2012), and mitigates the issues with
relative prices and weights during the financial crisis, as documented in Figure A.1 in the Appendix.

lower bound would have been a significantly constraint on monetary policy from 2012 so that, by

2015Q1, we estimate that the Fed would have lowered the Fed Funds rate by almost 2 percentage

points (Panel B). This observation that the zero lower bound was not a significantly binding constraint

early on in the zero lower bound episode is consistent with estimates of the shadow interest rate

bottoming out by 2014/15 (see Wu and Xia, 2016). In Panel A, we see that if the Fed had been able

to lower the Fed Funds rate below zero, the monetary stimulus would have encouraged firm entry:

the Herfindahl index in this case would have fallen by almost 2 percentage points by 2012Q1, and

by 6 percentage points by 2015Q1. This counterfactual illustrates the importance of modeling entry

alongside the zero lower bound, as firm entry depends critically on the state of the economy, and not

by entry cost shocks alone.

   Next, we explore what our model predicts for investment and consumption. Figure 9 plots the

level of capital, in Panel A, and the level of consumption, in Panel B, both in the data and in two

simulations: (i) without the zero lower bound and all shocks, and (ii) without the zero lower bound

but with entry cost shocks set to zero from 2003 onwards. The additional monetary stimulus during

the zero lower bound period would have caused both capital and consumption to be higher between

2009 and 2015. In particular, the capital stock would have been higher by about 1.4% by 2015, and

consumption would have been higher by about 5.5% by 2015. On top of this, we find a key role for

entry cost shocks. If we were to simulate the economy absent entry cost shocks from 2003 and absent

the zero lower bound, we find that the level of the capital stock would be higher (relative to that

observed) by 3.5% by 2015, and the level of consumption by 11% by 2015. We conclude therefore that

entry cost shocks have had a significant effect on aggregate quantities and that modeling monetary

policy during the zero lower bound is crucial to determine the aggregate effects of entry cost shocks.

   As highlighted, the aggregate effect of the identified decline in firm entry can be separated into

the direct channel caused by a fewer number of firms investing, and an indirect channel caused by the

binding zero lower bound and the inability of monetary policy to accommodate further declines in the

natural rate. To illustrate the interaction between entry cost shocks and a binding zero lower bound,

we plot the natural interest rate implied by the data and the Kalman filter, against the natural interest

rate computed in a simulation where entry cost shocks are removed. Figure 10 plots the natural rate

implied by the data and in two simulations: when entry cost shocks are removed from 2000 to 2015, and

when entry cost shocks are removed during the ZLB period only. The simulations show the important

role that firm entry has had in explaining movements in the natural rate. Comparing both simulations


                                                   24
against the data-implied natural rate, our estimates imply that the positive entry cost shocks caused

the annualized natural rate to fall by an additional 2.8 percentage points by 2011Q1, while keeping it

depressed through to 2015.



6     Explaining the Rise in Entry Costs

Our model suggests that rising entry costs had a substantial effect on aggregate trends. We conclude

by showing that the estimated entry cost shocks are correlated with empirical proxies of barriers to

entry at the industry-level – namely regulation and M&A activity.17 The link between regulation and

entry costs is the subject of a long literature. Davis (2017) discusses recent evolutions for the U.S.

and Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018) study the relationship empirically. The link between M&A and

entry costs is more tenuous. Easing of M&A restrictions – as documented by Kwoka (2015) – allow

incumbents to consolidate and potentially increase barriers to entry. But M&A may increase for other

reasons, including demand shocks and technological change (Andrade et al., 2001).

    Figure 11 shows that aggregate entry cost shocks closely relate to regulation and M&A activity.

It plots the aggregate entry-cost shock ζtκ against log-changes in regulation (left) and M&A activity

(right). Measures of M&A activity are based on Thomson Reuters SDC. Measures of regulation are

based on RegData 3.1, introduced in Al-Ubaydli and McLaughlin (2015).18 RegData is a substan-

tial improvement relative to simple page counts but, given the sheer scale of regulation, measuring

regulatory stringency at the industry level is a challenging task. To control for measurement error,

we complement RegData with measures of regulatory employment from the Census’ Occupational

Employment Statistics in some of our tests.19

    Figure 12 shows that entry cost shocks are closely related to Regulation and M&A activity for two
  17
     One might worry that the estimated entry costs are driven by technological change or are unrelated to barriers to
entry. To test this, Figure A.4 plots the average entry cost shock by industry, against the industry’s intangible intensity.
As shown, there does not appear to be a positive relationship between the two. We find similar results using alternate
measures of intangible intensity (e.g., changes, initial levels, etc.)
  18
     RegData relies on machine learning and natural language processing techniques to construct measures of regulatory
stringency at the industry level. In particular, it counts the number of restrictive words or phrases such as ‘shall’, ‘must’
and ‘may not’ in each section of the Code of Federal Regulations and assigns them to industries. Goldschlag and Tabarrok
(2018) provide several validation analyses for RegData such as comparing to the size of relevant regulatory agencies and
the employment share of lawyers in each industry. They conclude that “the relative values of the regulatory stringency
index capture well the differences in regulation over time, across industries, and across agencies.” We use log-changes in
regulation throughout our analyses. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018) emphasize using absolute changes when considering
a long history because regulation increased rapidly from a low initial level in the 1970s, which exaggerates log-changes
early in the sample. Our sample period is more recent and log-changes appear well-behaved.
  19
     In particular, we consider changes in the number of employees in Legal and Compliance occupations (SOC codes
23-0000 and 13-1040, respectively), by industry. Data following the NAICS hierarchy is available only after 2002, which
limits our sample – but we still find a robust relationship.



                                                             25
important industries, which exhibit some of the highest average entry cost shocks – Durable Computer

Manufacturing and Transportation Air. The patterns for Transportation Air closely align with a recent

(and controversial) merger wave that included Delta-Northwest (2008), United-Continental (2010),

Southwest-AirTran (2011) and American-US Airways (2014).
                                                                            κ on measures of regulation
    Table 4 confirms these relationships across all industries. We regress ζj,t
                                                                                      κ are estimated
and M&A at the industry-level. All regressions include year fixed effects given that ζj,t

relative to aggregate shocks, and industry fixed effects to control for unobserved variation. Column

1 includes the full sample, since 1989, and uses the regulation indices from RegData. Columns 2

and 3 consider our alternate measures of regulation over the industry-years when both are available

(after 2002). As shown, both measures are positively correlated with entry cost shocks. To control for

measurement error, column 4 takes the average between both measures. As expected, the t-statistic

in column 4 increases substantially.20 Columns 5 and 6 replicate column 1 and 4, adding a measure of

M&A activity.



7    Conclusions

Entry has decreased in the US economy, and markets have become more concentrated. We find that

entry costs shocks have played an important role and that they are related to entry regulations. The

methodology we use in this paper, mixing a structural model with cross-sectional evidence, can usefully

be applied to other contexts.




  20
     In unreported tests, we instrument changes in the regulation index with changes in regulatory employment. We find
consistent albeit somewhat noisy results given the short time-period.

Notes: Solid line plots ratio of After Tax Corporate Profits with IVA and CCAdj to Value Added for the U.S. Non-
Financial Corporate sector (series W328RC1A027NBEA and NCBGVAA027S, respectively). Annual data from the
Financial Accounts of the United States, via FRED. Dotted lines show the cumulated sales-weighted average change in
8-firm Concentration Ratio (CR8). Data from the U.S. Economic Census based on SIC codes before 1992 and NAICS
codes after 1997. We include only those industries that are consistently defined over each 5-year period, so that no change
is measured from 1992 to 1997. When multiple tax groups are reported, only taxable firms are included. CR8 equals the
market share (by sales) of the 8 largest firms in each industry.

We use a wide range of aggregate-, industry- and firm-level data, summarized in Table A.1 and de-

scribed in the rest of this section.

A.1       Data Sources and Definitions

A.1.1      Aggregate Data

FRED.        For use in the model, we gather the change in real consumption per capita, the net investment

rate, inflation, and employment from FRED. We follow Smets and Wouters (2007) in using the GDP

deflator for inflation (FRED code GDPDEF), constructing real consumption per capita (FRED code

PCEC divided by the GDPDEF, and the index of civilian non-institutional population CNP16OV),21

and non-farm business hours (FRED code PRS85006023 times the civilian employment level CE16OV,

divided by the index CNP16OV). Our aggregate measure of the concentration ratio is the weighted

average by sales of the top-4 firm, import-adjusted, concentration ratio obtained from Compustat.

Consumption, inflation, and the concentration ratio are demeaned prior to estimation.


Financial Accounts of the U.S. For our motivating analyses, we gather quarterly data for the

Non-Financial Corporate and Non-Financial Non-Corporate sectors of U.S. Data is sourced from the
 21
      We also smooth CNP16OV to account for jumps in the series.

Financial Accounts of the United States via FRED. See Section A.2 below for details on the data series

and definitions used for each Figure.


A.1.2      Industry-level data

Investment and Capital Stocks.                Industry-level investment and capital stocks are gathered from

the Section 3 of the BEA Fixed Assets tables, available at link. Data includes current-cost and chained

values for the net stock of capital, depreciation and investment. Note that BEA I and K include

intangible assets (i.e., software, R&D, and some intellectual property), not just tangible capital.

       The data includes 63 granular industry groupings. We group these industries into 47 categories

to ensure all groupings have material investment; reasonable Compustat coverage; and yield stable

investment and concentration time series. In particular, we group industries so that each group contains

at least ∼10 firms, on average, and contributes a material share of output and investment. We exclude

Financials and Real Estate; and also exclude Utilities given the influence of government actions in

their investment. Last, we exclude ‘Management of companies and enterprises’ because there are no

companies in Compustat that map to this category. This leaves 43 industry groupings, summarized in

Table A.2. All other datasets are mapped into these 43 industry groupings.


Output and Prices.              Nominal Gross Output and Prices are gathered from the BEA’s GDP by

Industry accounts (file GDPbyInd GO 1947-2017). Industry segments closely follow those of the Fixed

Assets tables.


Regulation Index. We gather industry-level regulation indices from RegData 3.1, available at link

and introduced in Al-Ubaydli and McLaughlin (2015). RegData aims to measure regulatory stringency

at the industry-level. It relies on machine learning and natural language processing techniques to count

the number of restrictive words or phrases such as ‘shall’, ‘must’ and ‘may not’ in each section of the

Code of Federal Regulations and assign them to industries.22 Note that most, but not all industries

are covered by the index. We map the Regulation index to BEA segments by selecting the closest

NAICS industry(s) to a given BEA segments.23 Most industries map one-to-one. When this is not the
  22
     This represents a vast improvement over simple measures of ‘page counts’, but it is still far from a perfect measure.
Goldschlag and Tabarrok (2018) provide a detailed discussion of the database and its limitations, including several vali-
dation analyses that, for example, compare RegData’s measure of regulatory stringency to the size of relevant regulatory
agencies and the employment share of lawyers in each industry. Goldschlag and Tabarrok (2018) conclude that “the
relative values of the regulatory stringency index capture well the differences in regulation over time, across industries,
and across agencies.”

     We use the mapping in tab ’NAICS codes’ of file GDPbyInd GO 1947-2017.xls.

case, we take the average number of restrictions across the given industries.


Regulatory Employment.         We gather employment by occupation x NAICS x year from the BLS

Occupational Employment Statistics, available here. We map NAICS codes to BEA segments through

the same process as the Regulation Index. We measure regulatory-related employment in a given

industry as the total number of employees with Legal or Compliance occupations (codes 23-0000 and

13-1040, respectively). For our regressions, we set regulatory employment to missing for the BEA

Professional Services industry (which includes Legal Services).


A.1.3    Firm-level data.

Our firm-level data source is the CRSP-Compustat merged database, available through WRDS. We

download tables Funda and Company from Compustat, and table msf from CRSP. We also download

the CRSP-Compustat linking table (ccmxpf linktable) to match the datasets. We merge the CRSP

file and apply standard screens (consol = “C”, indfmt = “INDL”, datafmt = “STD”, popsrc = “D”

and curcd = “USD”). We keep firm-year observations incorporated in the USA (fic = “USA”), with

non-missing year, gvkey, Q (as defined below). We require assets above $1 million to mitigate the

impact of outliers.

   We use the industry codes in the Compustat Company table. NAICS codes are populated for all

firms that existed after 1985, but are sometimes missing for firms that exited beforehand. We map

those firms to the most common NAICS-4 industry among those firms with the same SIC code and

non-missing NAICS. We also map all retired/new NAICS codes from the 1997, 2002 and 2012 versions

to NAICS 2007 using the concordances in link.

   We map firms to BEA industry segments using the mapping in tab ’NAICS codes’ of file GDP-

byInd GO 1947-2017.xls. Firms with NAICS codes 999 are dropped because they cannot be mapped

to BEA industries. For some of our tests, we supplement Compustat with the firm-level intangible

capital estimates of Peters and Taylor (2016), available through WRDS.


Industry Q. We estimate firm-level Q as the ratio of market value to total assets (AT). We compute

market value as the market value of equity plus total liabilities (LT) and preferred stock (PSTK),

where the market value of equity is defined as the total number of common shares outstanding (item

CSHO) times the closing stock price at the end of the fiscal year (item PRCC F). When either CSHO

or PRCC F are missing in Compustat, we fill-in the value using CRSP. We cap Q at 10 and winsorize

                                                  45
it at the 2% level, by year to mitigate the impact of outliers. Last, we aggregate firm-level Q to

the industry level by taking the mean, median and asset-weighted average across all firms in a given

industry-year.


Industry Concentration.           We estimate import-adjusted concentration using sales from Compustat

and imports from Peter Schott’s website. Import data are available by HS-code x year from 1989 to

2017. HS codes are mapped to NAICS-6 industries using the concordance of Pierce and Schott (2012).

We map NAICS codes to BEA segments as described above, and aggregate the industry-level.

       We then define the import-adjusted market share of a given Compustat firm i that belongs to BEA

industry k, as the ratio of firm sales to nominal gross output plus imports:24


                                                           salekit
                                        skit =
                                                 gross outputkt + importskt

Concentration ratios sum market shares across the top firms, by sales, in a given industry.

       We aggregate concentration ratios using by taking a weighted average of industry-level concentra-

tion, with real gross output (in 2009 USD) as weights. Figure A.1 shows why weighing by real, rather

than nominal quantities is preferred. As shown in the left plot (solid line), the concentration ratio

weighing by nominal quantities rises quickly in the late 2000’s and then falls. This is because of large

variation in the price of oil, and therefore the weight of the Nondurable Petroleum industry – as shown

in the right plot. Nominal output in this industry grows by a factor of 4 from 2000 to 2011, and then

falls to about twice as the initial level. This leads to wide variation in the weight of this industry using

nominal quantities, which pushes the aggregate CR up and then down (since this industry is relatively

more concentrated). By contrast, real output and the corresponding aggregate CR remain far more

stable. In fact, the series weighted by real output behaves similar to the series excluding nondurable

petroleum.




A.1.4       M&A Transaction-level Data

Last, we gather M&A transaction-level data from Thomson Reuters SDC. We include only completed

transactions of US-domiciled targets. SDC provides SIC codes by target. We map these codes to NAICS
  24
    Because Compustat sales include exports, total sales in a given industry can exceed gross output plus imports. In
that case, we define firm-level market share as the ratio of firm-sales to total Compustat sales.



                                                          46
using the SIC-NAICS concordance available here. We then map NAICS codes to BEA segments and

aggregate by summing the transaction values.


A.2    Details on the Construction of Selected Figures

Table 1. Investment, Capital and Profits by Leaders and Laggards. Rank firms by market

value. Define a firm as leader if it is the top firm in a given industry or the cumulative market value

up to and including this firm is below 33% of the industry market value. Repeat the exercise for

mid-performers (33-66% of MV) and the bottom 33%. Next, compute the total OIBDP, CAPX +

R&D, PP&E and Capital K (including intangibles as estimated by Peters and Taylor (2016)) by year

and by MV group x year. Estimate the share of a given measure – say OIBDP – as the ratio of leader

OIBDP to total OIBDP in a given year. Because firms are discrete, the actual share of market value

in each grouping varies from year to year. To improve comparability, re-scale shares by the ratio of

33.33% to the share of market value. Report the average across all years in a given period.


Figure 2. Net Investment, Profits and Q-Residuals Top chart plots the ratio of net investment

and net buybacks to net operating surplus for the Non Financial Corporate sector. Net operating

surplus is sourced directly from series NCBOSNQ027S. Net investment is defined as gross fixed capital

formation minus consumption of fixed capital (series NCBGFCA027N minus NCBCFCA027N). Net

repurchases equal the negative of the net incurrence of equity liabilities (series NCBCEBQ027S).

   Bottom chart plots the per-period and cumulative residuals of a regression of the net investment

rate for the NFB sector on Q for the NFC sector. We use the 1990 to 2001 period as a training

sample and use the estimated coefficients to forecast out-of-sample after 2001. The net investment

rate is defined as the ratio of Net investment (see above) to lagged capital stock. The capital stock

is defined as the sum of equipment, intellectual property, residential and non-residential structures.

For the NFC sector, these are series ESABSNNCB, NCBNIPPCCB, RCVSRNWMVBSNNCB and

RCSNNWMVBSNNCB. For NFNC sector, ESABSNNB, NNBNIPPCCB, RCVSRNWBSNNB and

RCVSNWBSNNB. Tobin’s Q for the non-financial corporate sector is defined as


                                       V e + (L − F A) − Inventories
                                  Q=                                                               (57)
                                                   Pk K

where V e is the market value of equity (NCBCEL), L are the liabilities (TLBSNNCB); F A are financial

assets (TFAABSNNCB); and Pk K is the replacement cost of capital (sum of the four NFC capital series


                                                  47
listed above). Inventories are based on series IABSNNCB.


Figure 3. Cumulative Capital Gap for Concentrating and Non-Concentrating Industries.

We begin by identifying industries with the largest and smallest log-change in 8-firm import-adjusted

concentration ratio (CR8). The top plot shows the gross output-weighted average CR8 across the

corresponding industries. Right plot shows the weighted average cumulative capital gap for the corre-

sponding industries.

    We estimate the industry-level capital gap as follows. Define the net investment rate for industry k,
N Ikt
Kkt−1 ,   as Investment minus Depreciation over lagged Capital stock – all in 2009 dollars, as measured by
                                                      N Ikt
the Chain-Type quantity indexes. Then, regresses      Kkt−1   on the 1-year lagged median industry Q (from

Compustat) over the 1990 to 2001 period. Generate the residuals εkt , and compute the cumulative

gap as
                                                                           
                                                                     δkt
                                  Gapkt   = εkt + Gapkt−1 × 1 −
                                                                    Kkt−1

We aggregate across industries by taking the weighted average by capital.


Figure 13. Aggregate Entry Cost Shocks vs. Regulation and M&A                      For regulation, estimate

3-year log-change in industry-level regulation index and winsorize at 5% level. Aggregate by taking

the simple average across all industries. For M&A, simple compute the ratio of total M&A transaction

values to total Gross Output across BEA industries in our sample.



B      Additional Results and Figures

In this section, we present additional results and figures.


B.1       Robustness

We estimate the model along several different dimensions to check the robustness of the key estimated

parameters.

    1. Same j per industry. In this case, we set j = 5 for all industries, as a test of our assumption

      that the transmission of shocks to industry-level outcomes is the same for all industries. This

      assumption is necessary for constructing the likelihood function of the model, whereby we can

      isolate the likelihood contribution of each industry from other industries and from the aggregate.


                                                     48
      The results show the posterior distributions of the structural parameters are similar to our

      baseline estimation, with the posterior distribution of   n    centered around a value of 1.7 and 10th

      and 90th percentiles of 1.2 and 2.3 respectively.

  2. We also check the robustness of the key parameters to an estimation where the observed Qt is

      matched to total industry-Q – which includes the rents of both the capital and goods-producers.

B.2     Additional Figures

Figure A.2 plots the distribution of calibrated firm-level elasticities of substitution ✏j . The mean of

these calibrated values is around 5, which is the value used in the estimation of the aggregate model.

   Figure A.3 shows the ratio of gross operating surplus to output across industries in our sample. We

calibrate the value of ✏j so that our model’s steady-state markup is consistent with the value observed

in 1993 (see also Figure A.2). This ratio is roughly constant over time for most industries.

   Figure 12 plots the average entry cost shock by industry, against the industry’s intangible intensity.

As shown, there does not appear to be a positive relationship between the two. We find similar results

using alternate measures of intangible intensity (e.g., changes, initial levels, etc).

   Figure A.5 plots the response of the concentration and output when the zero lower bound binds,

and when it does not. The entry cost shock lowers the natural rate, so the entry cost shock has a

larger negative e↵ect on output in the presence of the zero lower bound.


B.2.1    Aggregate Data

Figure A.6 plots the aggregate data used in estimation of the aggregate model. We describe how these

series are constructed above.




                                                    49
B.2.2    Industry Data in Estimation

Figures A.7 through A.11 show the industry-level data used in estimation. We express the industry-

level data series relative to their respective aggregate series, by subtracting a full set of time effects,

one for each year and each variable. We also subtract an industry-specific fixed effect and an industry-

specific trend.
