                                           ABSTRACT

In 1992, the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced new
insurance coverage for two preventive services– influenza vaccinations and mammograms.
Economists typically assume transactions occur with perfect information and foresight. As a test

of the value of information, we estimate the effect of consumer knowledge of these benefits on their
demand. Treating knowledge as endogenous in a two-part model of demand, we find that consumer

knowledge has a substantial positive effect on the use of preventive services. Our findings suggest
that strategies to educate the insured Medicare population about coverage of preventive services may
have substantial social value.

         The Role of Consumer Knowledge of Insurance Benefits in the Demand for
                        Preventive Health Care Among the Elderly



Introduction

       Although economists typically assume that economic transactions occur with perfect

knowledge, consumers in health care markets often demand medical care with very limited

information on product characteristics and prices, and frequently rely on providers to act as their

agents (Arrow, 1963). Educational interventions to increase consumers’ knowledge of the costs

and/or probable benefits of medical care are, however, feasible. In 1992, the United States

Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) introduced coverage for Medicare beneficiaries

of two preventive services not previously covered– influenza vaccinations and mammograms.

Since then, HCFA, which was recently renamed the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services

(CMS), has used multiple communication strategies to inform beneficiaries of these benefits,

such as employing Medicare carriers to promote the use of preventive care in order to reduce the

risk of illness or avoidable hospitalization.

       Previous research suggests that educational interventions can translate into increased use

of services in general, and of preventive services in particular. Using data from a household

survey conducted in the mid-1970s, Kenkel (1990) measured consumers’ health knowledge by

responses to a set of questions about the symptoms associated with diabetes, heart disease,

cancer and tuberculosis. He found that better informed consumers were significantly more likely

to visit a physician. Hsieh and Lin (1997) examined the effect of information on demand for

preventive care (tests for blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and urinalysis) among elderly

persons in Taiwan. Their measures of information were based on responses to questions about

symptoms associated with high blood pressure and diabetes, the type of tests necessary to detect

                                                                                                    2
diabetes, and the consequences of poor diabetes or high blood pressure management. Their

results generally supported the notion that better informed respondents were more likely to

obtained the preventive services they studied.

         The value of some policies to promote preventive service use has also been clearly

suggested by previous analyses. The cost of treating influenza or comorbidities related to it is

substantial in both the hospital and physician settings (McBean et al., 1993). Furthermore, the

cost-effectiveness of the vaccination has been documented in earlier studies (U.S. OTA, 1981;

Govert et al., 1994). In the case of the cost-effectiveness mammography screening among

elderly women, the evidence is not as convincing as influenza vaccination (Blustein and Weiss,

1998) due to the relatively earlier incidence of breast cancer in women. However, several recent

studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness-cost ratio of mammography screening for

elderly women can be high (Rosenquist and Lindfors, 1998; Wolstenholme, Smith and Whynes,

1998).

         New evidence suggests that influenza vaccinations and mammograms among the elderly

increased between 1992 and 1997. In 1997, 62 percent of Medicare beneficiaries reported that

they obtained a flu shot compared to 44 percent in 1992, and 43 percent of women reported

obtaining a mammogram compared to 19% in 1992 (Westat, 1998). While a detailed analysis of

these increases, and the possible role of consumer knowledge and education, has yet to be carried

out, the latest empirical analysis on the factors affecting influenza vaccination by Mullahy (1999)

argues that an understanding of the role education and the knowledge of medical benefits play in

the receipt of a flu shot would be a valuable extension of earlier research.

         Previous studies have not specifically addressed the impact of knowledge of benefits on

service utilization, but recent data indicate that Medicare enrollees are in general poorly

informed about their health insurance benefits. CMS’s 1996-1998 Market Research for
                                                                                                   3
Beneficiaries project* identified multiple deficiencies in beneficiaries’ basic knowledge of the

Medicare program (Barents Group LLC, et al 1998). Although most beneficiaries know about

the major features of Medicare, they tended to have inadequate knowledge of services that are

infrequently used (such as long term care, second surgical opinion, or coverage of durable

medical equipment) or recently implemented benefits (such as influenza and pneumonia

vaccinations). These findings are supported by McCall et al (1986) who surveyed Medicare

beneficiaries in six states and reported a low level of knowledge of Medicare benefits and

supplemental policy benefits. These authors also found that respondents were more likely to be

aware of benefits for the services they use most, including eyeglasses, physician care, and

prescription drugs, rather than infrequently used services such as hospital or nursing home care.

It is also worth noting that other studies of the general population (rather than just Medicare

enrollees) also document gaps and misinformation in consumers’ reported knowledge of health

plans and entitlement programs (Isaacs 1996; Blendon et al, 1997).

        In this paper, we explicitly examine the impact of elderly persons’ knowledge of

Medicare benefits on the demand for preventive health care using supplemental questions from

Round 18 of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) regarding beneficiary knowledge

of Medicare. The aim of this analysis is to identify the marginal effect of such benefit

knowledge on demand in order to better value future initiatives to create a more informed health

care consumer. In the remainder of this paper, we describe our conceptual model, methods,

study population, estimation results, interpretations of our empirical findings, and conclusions.

  This project intended to provide CMS with an understanding of the needs of Medicare beneficiaries with respect to
two basic questions: what information do beneficiaries want and need from CMS; and how can CMS best get this
information to beneficiaries. This project was conducted by the Barents Group LLC, the Project HOPE Center for
Health Affairs, and Westat, Inc.
                                                                                                                  4
Conceptual Model

       We use a simple conceptual framework of consumer demand for preventive care to

motivate and interpret our empirical work. In this framework, the consumer faces two uncertain

states of the world in which she is either exposed or not exposed to a preventable disease.

Corresponding probabilities are πE and πN (= 1 - πE). The consumer’s utility function in each

state, i, is U(Hi,Zi;X) ( i = E,N), where Hi is realized health status, Zi is spending on all other

goods and services except the prevention of the preventable disease, and X is a vector of socio-

demographic characteristics describing the consumer. HN is health status in the absence of the

disease and we let λ denote the decline in health status due to the disease, Y denote consumer

income, and C denote the cost of preventive services. Assuming that the consumer maximizes

expected utility and that preventive services reduce the probability of disease occurrence in the

event of exposure by the factor (1-θ) (with 0≤θ≤1), the consumer will choose to obtain

preventive services if

(1) θπE⋅ U(HN-λ, Y-C;Z)+ (1-θπE)⋅ U(HN, Y-C;Z) > πE⋅ U(HN-λ, Y;Z)+ (1-πE)⋅ U(HN, Y;Z).

Taking a first-order Taylor series approximation around (HN, Y). subtracting common terms

from both sides and rearranging terms, (1) becomes

(2) -(1-θπE)λ(∂U/∂H) > C(∂U/∂Y).

This simply states that the consumer obtains preventive services when the expected utility gain

from reduced risk of the disease exceeds the utility loss from the financial cost of the services.

       The simple framework highlights several ways in which the level of consumer knowledge

can impact the decision to obtain preventive services. First, in the absence of knowledge that the

service is a fully covered benefit, the consumer will overestimate C. Second, the consumer may


                                                                                                      5
underestimate their risk of exposure (πE) and/or the severity of the disease (λ). Third, the

uninformed consumer may underestimate the effectiveness of the service in preventing the

disease (1-θ). In formal terms, the dependence of the consumer’s decision upon the level of

knowledge, denoted by K, can be represented in (1) and (2) above by making the variables C, λ,

θ, and πE functions of K.

       While this simple model only allows socio-demographc characteristics (the vector X) to

influence the consumer’s decision via preferences, we recognize that other channels for these

influences may in fact be operative. The level of knowledge about key variables (C,λ,θ,πE) may

be correlated with some elements of X. Exposure risk (λ,θ,πE) may also vary with socio-

demographic characteristics. To the extent that beneficiaries in varying circumstances differ in

the quality of medical care they can access, they may also face differing levels of λ and θ.

       In the empirical implementation of our model, consumer perceptions of C,λ,θ,πE are not

directly observable determinants of preventive service use. We seek to control for variations in

these magnitudes across the sample by including exogenous variables relating to consumer

health status and epidemiologic risk factors, access to care, income, other socio-demographic

characteristics, and consumer knowledge of Medicare coverage for preventive services. The

impact of the consumer knowledge variable, which is the primary focus of our analysis, is

largely a reflection of the influence of C on consumer decisions. Those who know that the

service is covered are aware that the out-of-pocket cost for the service itself is zero and those

who do not know this overestimate this cost. While this suggests that the coefficient for the

consumer knowledge variable in our empirical estimates is mainly a price effect on demand, we

recognize that the knowledge variable may also be correlated with higher estimates of λ or πE ,


                                                                                                    6
or lower estimates of θ, because the educational interventions that promoted benefit knowledge

also increased awareness of risks and consequences of exposure and efficacy of prevention. As

discussed below, we also follow previous researchers in allowing for the possibility that the

consumer knowledge variable is itself endogenous and therefore employ an instrumental

variables estimation method.

Data Sources

       The principal data source used in our analysis is the annual Medicare Current Beneficiary

Survey (MCBS). Administered to a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries,

the MCBS obtains information from beneficiaries on socio-demographic characteristics, use of

medical care, and indicators of health status and illness. Other respondent characteristics

obtained in the survey include education, household composition, health status, income, and

supplemental insurance coverage. The database also includes the Medicare claims records for

respondents. These claims records describe the exact health services provided and reimbursed

and serve to supplement the beneficiary’s recollection of whether certain medical services, such

as mammography, were provided. Once participating in the survey, a beneficiary is surveyed

three times a year for an in-depth personal interview for three years. Beneficiaries who die

during the course of their survey participation are replaced in the following year of the survey to

keep the average number of survey participants at roughly 14,000 beneficiaries.

       In this analysis, we used data on respondent characteristics from Round 16 of the MCBS

(the “health access survey”) administered in Fall, 1996. Information on respondents’ knowledge

of benefits was obtained from supplemental questions from Round 18 of the MCBS, which was

administered later in summer 1997. The questions included a short quiz to test beneficiary

knowledge of the Medicare, as well as questions regarding the beneficiary’s use of the Medicare


                                                                                                   7
Handbook and their access to communication technologies. We use five quiz questions from

Round 18. (These questions are given in our Appendix.) The first two ask if flu shot and

mammography are covered services. The remaining three questions test knowledge of Medicare

coverage of physical examinations, rules on provider payment and assignment, and rights to

appeal a payment decision.

       An additional data component for the analysis was claims data for all beneficiaries from

the Medicare 5% Part B physician file for calendar year 1996. From these data, we computed

utilization rates for flu shots and mammography for each 5-digit zip code. (Denominators for

these rates were the total number of beneficiaries reporting any claims in each zip code in 1996.)

These rates were matched by zip codes of residence to the beneficiaries in our analysis and were

used as explanatory variables to control for possible neighborhood effects. Differences in

“neighborhood” use rates may be indicative of patterns of diffusion of information (Besley and

Case, 1993) since consumers may learn about their benefits from neighbors who used the service

in question. These rates could also be capturing zip-code-specific variations in access to services

or variations in preferences that we cold not directly observe.

       The binary dependent variables in our analysis, for obtaining a mammogram and a flu

shot, were constructed from one year of claims data (September 1, 1997 to August 31, 1998)

following the end of interviewing for Round 18 of the MCBS survey (inAugust 1997). (For

respondents in our study whose participation in the MCBS ended before August 31, 1998, , we

obtained their additional claims data from CMS to complete our 12-month follow-up period)

Thus our dependent variable measures of utilization were collected subsequent to our measures

of consumer knowledge.




                                                                                                  8
       We also obtained binary indicators of prior use for mammogram and flu shots for MCBS

respondents pertain to calendar 1995. These were based on self-report data in the 1995 MCBS

Cost and Use file.

Estimation Methods and Model Specification

       In estimating the effects of consumer knowledge on service use, previous researchers

(Kenkel, 1990; Hsieh and Lin, 1997) have recognized the potential problem that estimated

knowledge coefficients are contaminated by simultaneity bias,In particular, this could arise if

persons with stronger preferences for using a particular service gain knowledge about that

service and its coverage from their providers and from prior utilization experiences. Following

Kenkel, and Hsieh and Lin, we address this problem via the use of instrumental variables for our

measures of benefit knowledge.

       In particular, consumer knowledge of benefits is measured directly by a binary indicator

for the correct response to the coverage of flu shot or mammogram quiz questions. Indicators of

responses to the other quiz questions, relating to Medicare program adminstration, were used as

instrumental variables for these knowledge of benefits measures. This procedure was based on

the rationale that enrollees with a good knowledge of the Medicare program are likely to know

about coverage of preventive health care while a “taste” for preventive care will not be correlated

with general Medicare program knowledge.As in Mullahy’s recent work on flu shots, we

estimate a two-stage model with binary dependent variables. The estimated models take the

form

       1)      Ki = a0 + a1Yi +Pi + ui

       2)      Di = b0 + b1Yi + b2Ki + vi

where K is the binary indicator of benefit knolwedge for beneficiary i Pi is a two-element vector

of binary indicators of general Medicare program knowledge, Di is the binary indicator of
                                                                                                  9
preventive service use, Yi is a vector of exogenous determinants of preventive service demand,

and uiand viare random errors that may be correlated. The explanatory variables in the vector Yi

include determinants of the beneficiary’s demand such as income, supplementary insurance

coverage, education, and demographic characteristics. Measures of beneficiary health

characteristics are included on the assumption that these will affect the beneficiary’s perceptions

of exposure risk, severity of illness consequences, and preventive service effectiveness.

Neighborhood use measures are included to account for geographic differences in access which

may be correlated with time costs of obtaining preventive services (a component of C in our

conceptual model) and diffusion of benefit knowledge Finally, we also include a prior use

variable based on the beneficiary’s self-reported prior year use of the preventive service

examined. Prior use will increase consumer knowledge through experience. It will also proxy

for unmeasured “taste” factors that are stable over time. Thus, we view the inclusion of prior use

as providing a more stringent test of the pure effect of benefit knowledge on demand. More

specific definitions for these variables are given in Table 1.

       Equations (1) and (2) are estimated via two-stage least squares with Huber-White robust

standard-error estimates for coefficients. The properties of this estimation method for

simultaneous equations with binary dependent variables have previously been described by

Heckman and McCurdy (1985). A recent example of applying this method in a closely-related

context is Mullahy (1999). We note that concern over several deficiencies of least-squares

estimation of linear probability models should be relatively minor in our application. In

particular, robust standard-error estimation allows for heteroscedasticity, while specification

error due to the assumption of a linear functional form should not be a major problem with

dependent variables whose mean values are far from the extremes of the 0-1 interval.

Study Population Characteristics
                                                                                                  10
      The core analytic sample for the analysis contains complete data for beneficiaries age 65

and older who were living in the community (i.e., who were not living in a short-term or long-

term care facility) and who answered Rounds 16, 17, and 18 of the MCBS. We excluded

respondents from this subset who had missing data for the dependent variables or key beneficiary

characteristics, such as income information. Respondents enrolled in Medicare managed care

health plans were also included provided their health service utilization data, which would

normally be abstracted from administrative claims data, was not missing. An analysis of

excluded respondents did not reveal significant economic or demographic differences from the

non-excluded respondents. Although income differences could not be determined directly for

the excluded respondents, a slightly higher percentage of beneficiaries with Medicaid eligibility,

and a lower percentage of beneficiaries with higher education levels, were in the non-excluded

(i.e., study) sample.

      Table 1 summarizes the two study samples, one for the entire population to model flu shot

demand and the other restricted to women for modeling mammography screening demand. The

largest age group in the sample is the 65 to 74 year olds, who make up 41 percent of the total

sample. A slight majority of beneficiaries are women (51 percent). About 83 percent of

Medicare beneficiaries in the sample are White non-Hispanic, with African Americans (non-

Hispanic) comprising the second largest racial group (9 percent), and Hispanics making up 6

percent of the sample. Many Medicare beneficiaries have low incomes, with the largest income

group being $15,000 or less (about 46 percent of the sample). About 41 percent of the sample

has not completed high school. Over half of beneficiaries live with their spouse (53 percent).

Approximately one-third of the sample live in the south (35 percent), and three-quarters live in a

metropolitan area (71 percent). Only 10 percent of the sample are Medicaid recipients and


                                                                                                  11
nearly three quarters of the sample (71 percent) have some supplemental coverage (e.g.,

Medigap) purchased directly or provided by a former employer.

      A majority of beneficiaries reported they were in excellent, very good, or good health (78

percent). However, 38 percent have been told they have a chronic heart condition, 18 percent

have been told they have cancer, 15 percent have diabetes, 13 percent have emphysema, asthma,

or COPD, and 11 percent have had a stroke. About 41 percent of beneficiaries have a visual

impairment (have some or a lot of trouble seeing) or are blind, while about 45 percent are hard of

hearing (have some or a lot of trouble hearing) or are deaf.

Estimation Results

       Table 2 presents the results of the first-stage regressions on 1) flu shot benefit knowledge

for the entire study population and 2) women's knowledge of the mammography screening

benefit. General Medicare knowledge is found to be positively and significantly related to flu

shot benefit knowledge. The same is true for prior use of flu shots. Those likely to have greater

knowledge of the benefit are those with supplemental coverage and those living in rural areas.

Given that supplemental carriers provide another source of information about health benefits,

this result is not surprising. Beneficiaries residing in rural areas may be less inundated with

information than urban populations, and may be better able to attend the information they do

receive. We may also be observing the impact of information campaigns conducted by CMS, the

American Association of Retired Persons, and other social and civic organizations with high

participation in rural regions, such as the Rotary Club and Lions Club. Those residing in the

South are more likely to know about the benefit than those in the Northeast. Those with a heart

condition are more likely to be knowledgeable about the benefit as well. Since heart disease can

require a significant interaction with health care delivery and finance systems, spillover

knowledge to basic preventive care is not surprising. Finally beneficiaries who are married are
                                                                                                  12
also more knowledgeable about flu shots. Two explanations for this result may be that a spouse

is another information source, as well as a direct incentive to keep one's partner healthy. Those

less likely to know about the benefit include blacks and males.

        A number of the results regarding women’s knowledge of mammography screening are

similar to those found for flu shot benefit knowledge. The factors with the strongest positive

effects on knowledge of the mammography benefit are again good knowledge of general

Medicare program rules and prior use of mammography. Significant positive effects are again

observed for Medigap coverage and for residence in the South. Other features of the results do

not parallel the findings for flu shot knowledge. Blacks and Hispanics are significantly more

likely to know about the mammography benefit, as are persons with Medicaid coverage. Older

beneficiaries are significantly less likely to know about the mammography benefit. There is also

stronger evidence of regional differences in benefit knowledge. One of the largest

mammography benefit knowledge marginal effects was associated with women residing in

Puerto Rico, which again suggests the importance or regional information sources or campaigns.

There is also a positive relationship for women with a history of cancer, which may reflect

increased concern with cancer prevention.

       The OLS and 2SLS second stage estimation results for flu shot and mammography

screening demand are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Benefit knowledge for each of

the two preventive services and prior use had strongly significant impacts on service use in both

OLS and 2SLS models. Comparison of the 2SLS and OLS results indicates that OLS tends to

yield a downward-biased estimate of the impact of knowledge on use. This finding is somewhat

surprising but could be explained, at least in part, by the possibility that the prior use variable

accounts for much of the positive correlation between unobservables that increase benefit

knowledge and unobservables that predispose to use of services. In addition, note that in both
                                                                                                      13
the flu shot and mammography 2SLS models Basmann's (1960) test fails to reject our

overidentifying exclusion restrictions.

       Since the two preventive services are covered with no out-of-pocket cost to the consumer,

the interpretation of the strongly positive results for the Medigap and Medicaid dummies (for

both services) and for the high income dummy (in the case of mammography) is not the usual

straightforward confirmation of negative own-price and positive income effects on demand. An

alternative hypothesis concerning insurance effects is that cross-price effects on preventive

service demand are positive. Beneficiaries who use more curative services (because of lower

out-of-pocket price) may also be more likely to receive recommendations from their physicians

to obtain preventive services. In the case of influenza vaccinations, complementarity in demand

could also arise from joint time costs: the time and inconvenience of obtaining a vaccination are

greatly reduced if it is received at the same time and in the same provider location in which

curative services are received. Both of these arguments could also account for positive income

effects if the income effect on demand for curative services is also positive.

       Race and ethnicity appear to have significant effects on flu shot demand. Specifically,

black beneficiaries and Hispanics have significantly lower probabilities of receiving a flu shot,

ceteris paribus. Corresponding effects on mammography demand, however, are not significant..

Our four education dummies are also insignificant in both Tables 3 and 4 although the pattern of

point estimates for their coefficients suggests a positive gradient for a continuous education

measure. Other demographic variables have no significant effects on flu shot demand although

there is weak evidence of a positive age effect. In the case of mammography, age has a strongly

negative effective while the dummy for marital status has a significantly positive coefficient.

       Relatively few of the results for the health problems and disability variables are

significant in any of the models. Beneficiaries with one major disease, cancer, have a greater
                                                                                                    14
likelihood of receiving each of the preventive services. Women with a hearing problem have a

significantly lower probability of mammography use. Those women with significant (four or

more) limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) are less likely to receive mammography

screening. This finding may reflect individuals who can not seek care independently.

       Results for location variables are mixed. The rural population receives more of both

preventive services than those residing in urban areas. On the other hand, neighborhood effects

are not significant at the 0.05 level in either 2SLS model.

       In addition to the results just presented, we also estimated our two demand models with

the prior use variables excluded. This did not substantially alter our findings. The magnitude of

the TSLS coefficient for benefits knowledge increased by about 35% in the flu shot model but

was essentially unchanged in the mammography model. Corresponding OLS coefficients

increased in magnitude by about 90% in the flu shot model and about 45 % in the mammography

model. We experimented with using an additional instrument in each of the two demand models

consisting of the binary variable associated with the preventive service knowledge question in

the other demand model. For example, in the model for mammograms, the instrumental

variables used were general Medicare program knowledge and knowledge of the flu shot benefit.

These additional variables yielded little additional predictive value as instruments and resulted in

rejection of the test for our exclusion restrictions. This latter finding could be a refection of the

fact that a “taste” for preventive care is common to both services.

       We also examined interaction effects of benefits knowledge with prior use, both by

adding an interaction term to our models and by estimating separate regressions for those with

and without prior use. For flu shot use, OLS estimation of the model with an interaction yielded

a positive and significant main effect for benefits knowledge of 0.055 and a significant

interaction effect of 0.073. Two-stage estimates, with both the main and interaction knowledge
                                                                                                    15
variables endogenous, yielded implausibly large coefficients that were very sensitive to the

choice of instruments. In the separate sample regressions, OLS estimation yielded significantly

positive benefit knowledge coefficients of 0.111 and 0.068 for those with and without prior flu

shot use respectively. Two-stage estimation yielded a small and insignificantly positive benefits

knowledge coefficient for those with no prior use and a very large (0.334) and significant

coefficient for those with prior use.

        For mammography, OLS estimation of the model with an interaction yielded a positive

and significant main effect for benefits knowledge of 0.082 and a moderately significant (p =

0.078) interaction effect of 0.053. Two-stage estimates, with both the main and interaction

knowledge variables endogenous, yielded large and imprecise coefficient estimates. In the

separate sample regressions, OLS estimation yielded very similar positive and significant

coefficients of 0.110 and 0.090 for those with and without prior mammography use respectively.

Two-stage estimation yielded significantly positive benefits knowledge coefficients of 0.285 and

0.170 for those with and without prior use respectively.

        Taken together, these various results suggest that the positive benefits knowledge effects

on use are larger in magnitude for persons with prior use. It is also true, however, that persons

with prior use will tend to have better benefit knowledge. (Mean values of FLUKNOW were

0.852 and 0.631 for persons with and without prior use respectively. Corresponding means for

MAMKNOW were 0.802 and 0.506.) Thus, our results do not necessarily suggest that education

efforts should be targeted specifically to those with prior use; we suspect that it is more cost

effective to target these efforts to groups that have the lowest average level of benefit knowledge.

Discussion

        To place the results just described in a broader context, it is useful to compare them with

findings from earlier related studies. First, it is interesting to note that our finding of positive
                                                                                                       16
knowledge impacts on demand for services is qualitatively similar to knowledge effects reported

by Hsieh and Lin (1997) and by Kenkel (1990). Our application differs from these previous

works, however, in that knowledge in our study basically measures awareness that the out of

pocket price of a preventive service is zero; thus a positive knowledge effect is clearly to be

expected and is logically consistent with rational consumer behavior. We also note that our main

result is robust to estimation technique (OLS vs. TSLS), and to the inclusion or exclusion of a

measure of prior service utilization as an explanatory variable. Inclusion of this variable does,

however, diminish the magnitude of the knowledge effect.

       Our study differed from Hsieh and Lin (1997) by including education variables in the

structural demand function rather than simply using them as instruments for our knowledge

variables. In both our OLS and instrumental variables results, however, we find little evidence

of a general education effect on demand. (We do note that the coefficients for the education

dummies in the mammography regressions suggest the presence of a positive education gradient

in demand.) In alternative empirical models, we tried repeating the approach of Kenkel (1990)

and Hsieh and Lin (1997) to include education as instrument in addition to our other knowledge

variables. This approach yielded similar results. Thus, our results provide support to Hsieh and

Lin’s presumption that when more focused measures of knowledge are available, measures of

general educational attainment can be used as instruments and excluded from the structural

demand function.

       Our results for flu shot demand can also be compared directly to the recent findings by

Mullahy (1999). His analysis, based on 1991 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),

indicates that self-assessed health status has a strong negative relationship to flu shot demand

while years of schooling is a strongly positive predictor. While these results contrast to our own

findings, Mullahy also confirms our result of a significantly lower flu shot probability for
                                                                                                    17
African Americans. There are important differences in model specification, which could easily

explain the differences in results. These include our inclusion of income as a demand factor and

the absence from the NHIS data set of many of the variables relating to health and disability

status used in our analysis.

       The policy implications of our study are significant in a climate where CMS desires

elderly beneficiaries to play a greater role in their own health service utilization as well as health

plan choice. The results show that knowledge is an important attribute in medical care demand.

Few health care empirical studies measure knowledge directly. The rapidly growing consumer

choice and information literature provides data on self-reported information sources and health

plan choice. With the development of different benefit options for CMS beneficiaries on the

horizon, policy evaluations should consider recording measures of benefit knowledgeas well as

information sources to better understand the value of information dissemination.

       An obvious extension of to our analysis would be to examine the impact of Medicare

program knowledge on medical expenditures. This analysis could be used to compute the net

fiscal impact to Medicare of funds spent on direct consumer education campaigns. Given the

fiscal realities of an aging population, a future analysis of the relationship between knowledge,

preventive services use, and health care expenditures would be valuable.

Conclusions

       Economists commonly assume that consumers make rational choices with perfect

information. In health care, however, most consumers understand relatively little about the

consequences of their purchases or even the complex arrangements under which these purchases

are made. In this study we specifically focus on consumer knowledge of insurance benefits as it

affects demand for preventive health services. We find that even controlling for prior use (which

could be viewed in part as a proxy for experiential learning), knowledge of the insurance benefit
                                                                                                    18
is one of the strongest factors affecting the use of influenza vaccination in the non-

institutionalized elderly population and mammography screening within the female non-

institutionalized elderly. Our findings suggest that strategies to educate the insured Medicare

population about coverage of preventive services may have substantial social value. Our

findings of positive income and insurance effects on demand (in the context of full coverage for

these preventive services), as well as race/ethnicity differences (especially for flu shots) suggest

that complementarities exist between demand for curative and preventive services and that

policies to reduce social disparities in the receipt of curative care among Medicare enrollees will

also reduce disparities in receipt of preventive services.

                             MCBS KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS

        The five questions below are the items from the MCBS survey that we used to measure
consumer knowledge. The first two items pertain to flu shot and mammography coverage. The
fourth and fifth items, which pertain to general knowledge about Medicare program rules, were
used as instruments. All items were coded as binary 0-1 variables with 1 signifying the correct
answer and 0 signifying all other answers.


1. Medicare pays for flu shots. [PROBE: Do you think this is true or false, or are you not sure?]

                                      TRUE ...............................................    1
                                      FALSE ..............................................    2
                                      NOT SURE ......................................         3
                                      REFUSED ........................................       -7



                        IF SP IS FEMALE, ASK 2. ELSE, SKIP TO 3



2.       Medicare pays for a mammogram every two years. [A mammogram is an X-ray to check
         for breast cancer.] [PROBE: Do you think this is true or false, or are you not sure?]

                                      TRUE ...............................................    1

                                      REFUSED ........................................       -7


3.       Medicare pays for an annual physical examination. [PROBE: Do you think this is true or
         false, or are you not sure?]

4.       A doctor who accepts assignment can’t charge more than Medicare allows for covered
         services. [PROBE: Do you think this is true or false, or are you not sure?]

                                      TRUE ............................................... 1
                                      FALSE .............................................. 2

5.   If you don’t agree with a decision Medicare makes on a claim from a doctor or hospital,
     such as whether it will cover the service or how much it will pay, you can appeal the
     decision. [PROBE: Do you think this is true or false, or are you not sure?]

                                 TRUE ...............................................    1
                                 FALSE ..............................................    2
