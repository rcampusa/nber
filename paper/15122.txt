                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of job loss from business closings on body mass index (BMI) and
alcohol consumption. We improve upon extant literature by using: exogenously determined business
closings, a sophisticated estimation approach (finite mixture models) to deal with complex heterogeneity,
and national, longitudinal data (Health and Retirement Study). For both alcohol consumption and BMI,
we find evidence that individuals who are more likely to respond to job loss by increasing unhealthy
behaviors are already in the problematic range for these behaviors before losing their jobs. Thus health
effects of job loss could be concentrated among “at risk” individuals.

Introduction

         Losing a job can be stressful.       Beginning with notification and culminating in

reemployment, each phase of job loss—anticipation, termination, unemployment, and job

search—can produce a forceful emotional response. The potential pathways of stress comprise

an assortment of psychosocial and economic factors, including stigmatization, uncertainty,

severance of social identity and role, unallocated time, and financial deprivation (Kasl and Jones

2000).

         Individuals over 50 have been disproportionately represented among displaced workers in

recent decades (Couch 1998).       Job loss often induces forfeiture of critical health benefits

(Beckett 1988), reduced wealth (Bernheim, Forni, Gokhale, and Kotlikoff 2000; Bernheim

1997), and obstacles to reemployment (Chan and Huff Stevens 2001; Hipple 1999). Further,

when reemployed, workers over 50 experience significant wage penalties (Couch 1998; Huff

Stevens 1997). A growing body of research has linked late-career job loss to a range of adverse

health and chronic disease outcomes (Gallo, Bradley, Dubin, Jones, Falba, Teng, and Kasl 2006;

Gallo, Teng, Falba, Kasl, Krumholz, and Bradley 2006) and mortality (Sullivan and von Wachter

2009). In this paper, we study the effect of business closures on body mass index and alcohol

consumption using data on workers nearing retirement.          We use finite mixture models to

examine whether there are differential effects of job loss by latent class and, upon finding

substantially heterogeneous effects, explore the determinants of the classes.

         Alcohol misuse is a critical social concern for older individuals.       Because older

individuals have less lean body mass, they attain higher blood alcohol content for a given amount

of alcohol consumed (Vestal et al. 1977), and for any given blood alcohol level, there is an

intensified sensitivity to alcohol (Vogel-Sprott and Barrett 1984). Alcohol can contribute to


                                                 1
difficulties with reaction, balance, and elements of cognitive function, increasing the probability

of automobile collisions, falls, and both home and workplace accidents. In addition, alcohol use

may exacerbate chronic health problems, such as high blood pressure, ulcers, and diabetes,

which are more common among older individuals. There is, moreover, a potential for alcohol-

drug interactions, as older people take more prescription and over-the-counter medications than

younger individuals (Williams 1988). Risk of late-onset alcoholism (Hurt et al. 1988) is also of

concern.


         Obesity may be similarly problematic for the middle aged and near elderly. Obesity is a

well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and

some research has associated obesity with shorter life expectancy. Simulation data suggest that

obese older persons can expect to live fewer years disability free than their normal weight

counterparts and have higher incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, with

significantly burdensome healthcare costs paid by Medicare (Lakdawalla, Goldman, and Shang

2005).

         Nevertheless, evidence on the effects of job loss on health behaviors has been decidedly

mixed (McKee-Ryan, Song, Wanberg, and Kinicki 2005). This is especially true with regard to

the health behaviors of interest in this research. Studies investigating the impact of job loss and

unemployment on alcohol consumption have produced inconsistent results in terms of

significance, magnitude and even direction of effect.       Several assessments have found no

relationship between unemployment and subsequent alcohol use (Broman, Hamilton, Hoffman,

and Mavaddat 1995; Cook, Cummins, Bartley, and Shaper 1982; D'Arcy 1986; Gallo, Bradley,

and Kasl 2001; Morris, Cook, and Shaper 1992; Morris, Cook, and Shaper 1994). Increases in

alcohol consumption (Catalano, Dooley, Wilson, and Hough 1993; Janlert 1992) have been

                                                2
documented; however, it has been argued that these associations are related chiefly to selection

(Kasl and Jones 2000). Reductions in alcohol consumption after job loss have also been reported

in population-based studies (Iversen and Klausen 1986).            Economic research linking

macroeconomic conditions to health (Ruhm 2000, 2005) has found that recessions tend to reduce

drinking, presumably in part due to reduced income.

       Findings from research on changes in weight associated with unemployment are similarly

ambiguous (Leino-Arjas, Liira, Mutanen, Malmivaara, and Matikainen 1999; Morris, Cook, and

Shaper 1992; Morris, Cook, and Shaper 1994). Retrospective evidence (Leino-Arjas et al. 1999)

has suggested a link between unemployment and BMI, but no panel study of which we are aware

has found a significant change in BMI after job loss. One longitudinal study, which used data

from the British Regional Heart Study (Morris, Cook, and Shaper 1992), did however find that

middle-aged men who became unemployed had a higher risk of gaining more than 10% of their

body weight (measured as a dichotomy) than similar continuously employed men.

       There are several potential mechanisms that may help explain the wide variation in the

individual behavioral responses to the stress of job loss.    The first may be thought of as

differences in stress-reactivity. Thus, although greater alcohol or food consumption might be

employed to counterbalance neuro- or emotion-regulatory disturbances, reduced consumption or

no change in consumption are equally plausible. So while there is evidence from animal,

preclinical and clinical studies that stress leads to overeating and excessive drinking to self-

medicate (Sinha, 2007), research on stress suggests substantial heterogeneity. To date,

differences in response to stress have been explained by such factors as coping style, genetic

proclivity, and other aspects of family history (Moore, Sikora, Grunberg, and Greenberg 2007).

Secondly, income and substitution effects may also contribute to the ambiguity of earlier



                                               3
findings. Unemployment frequently diminishes income, creating financial constraints that may

generally reduce the demand for food or alcohol, and alter the demand for specific items. Even

so, the results of deprivation are again uncertain. For example, with less income, displaced

workers may simply eat less or forgo alcohol use; however, they may simply substitute lower-

priced, calorie-rich food or less costly alcohol for their normal consumption items. Finally, for

some individuals, the increase in discretionary time due to unemployment may be used to pursue

health-promoting behaviors, such as physical activity, that might precipitate weight loss or

encourage alcohol temperance. Plausibly opposing effects render the net impact of job loss an

open empirical issue.

       This study contributes to the literature on behavioral effects of job loss along three

dimensions. First, we use business closings as our measure of job loss. Business closings

provide an exogenous source of stress, so that our findings are less susceptible to problems

associated with selection. Job loss has frequently been represented by layoff or some

combination of involuntary termination (e.g., layoff, plant closing, and firing) in other studies.

However, layoffs and firing are likely to be endogenous (e.g., due to worker incompetence), and

the use of these measures may have biased earlier findings (Charles and Stephens 2004; Dooley,

Fielding, and Lennart 1996; Gibbons and Katz 1991; Hu and Tabor 2005; Weiss 1995). In

contrast, business closings are more typically occasioned by external influences, such as an

organizational decision to restructure or relocate business units.

       Second, we use a finite mixture model (FMM) methodology to better address the

complicated potential relationships among job loss, alcohol use, and BMI. We propose that the

complexities of the relationship are not appropriately handled by traditional methodology, which

may have led investigators to draw erroneous conclusions about the effect of job loss on health



                                                 4
behaviors. Traditional statistical analyses have been unable to account for essential unobserved

heterogeneity—in this case, individual differences in response to the stress of job loss. FMM

permits estimation of the effect of business closings on health behaviors among groups of

individuals whose response to stress is distinct from the average. Our findings illustrate that

traditional modeling techniques, even when stratified by the customary attributes that

presumably pick up much of the crucial heterogeneity in response to stress (e.g., gender, race,

and education), are incapable of detecting behavioral changes within subgroups after job loss.

Finite mixture models have received increasing attention in the statistics literature mainly

because of the number of areas in which such distributions are encountered (see McLachlan and

Peel, 2000, and Lindsay, 1995, for numerous applications). Econometric applications of finite

mixture models include the seminal work of Heckman and Singer (1984) to labor economics,

Wedel, et al. (1993) to marketing data, El-Gamal and Grether (1995) to data from experiments in

decision making under uncertainty, and Deb and Trivedi (1997) to the economics of healthcare.

       Finally, our research topic is both timely and germane to the ongoing debate on the

impacts of job loss. Adverse impacts of business closings are presently of interest to policy

makers, given the extraordinary number of recent job losses associated with the current

economic recession. Global economic interdependence and the failure of financial markets

linked especially to housing have precipitated a nearly unprecedented loss of employment, with

major business closures in both goods-producing and service sectors of the U.S. economy.

Nearly 2.6 million jobs were eliminated in 2008, with over 1.9 million of the job losses occurring

in the 4-month period from September through December, following the collapse of major

lenders, investment banks, and financial institutions, and the near ruin of the U.S. automobile

industry. White collar jobs, often protected in prior recessionary periods, have witnessed almost



                                                5
unparalleled elimination. Despite nascent federal efforts to stabilize the economy, employment

losses continue to mount. In February 2009, alone, the number of unemployed individuals

increased by 851,000, as the unemployment rate rose to 8.1%, its highest level in 25 years

(Bureau of Labor Statistics).



Data

        Our data were drawn from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a nationally

representative study of men and women age 50 or older, begun in 1992 and designed to

investigate health and economic consequences of older individuals as they advance from work to

retirement. At baseline, HRS participants included 12,652 individuals from 7,702 households.

Baseline surveys were conducted in 1992, via face-to-face interviews. Follow-up interviews,

completed every two years, were completed by telephone or mail. More detail on the HRS is

available elsewhere (Juster and Suzman 1995). Our study takes data from both the original HRS

and Version H of the data prepared by RAND.1

        We used data from the first six HRS waves (1992-2002) to investigate the behavioral

effects of business closings. To isolate individuals who were at risk for job loss, our analysis

sample was restricted to HRS participants who met the following criteria at the 1992 baseline:

(1) were between ages 51 and 61; (2) were working for pay, but not self employed; (3) reported a

minimum of two years of continuous employment with the 1992 employer; and (4) provided at

least one follow-up response. For each study participant, we constructed up to five, two-year

(i.e., Wave 1-Wave 2…Wave 5-Wave 6) person-spell data records, depending on participation in

the Survey. For each record after the first, we limited the sample to study subjects who reported

continuous employment in the previous person-spell. The baseline application of the tenure

criterion circumscribes undesirable sample heterogeneity deriving from the inclusion of seasonal

workers and those with weak labor force attachment (Couch 1998; Jacobson, LaLonde, and

Sullivan 1993); its reapplication limits the effects of multiple job loss. After listwise deletion of

cases with missing data, our final analysis sample numbered 6,726.

        The explanatory variable of interest, business closure, is represented by a binary variable

that records employment change between survey waves.                     As such, retrospective data are

necessary for the creation of this variable. Thus, at each follow-up wave (i.e., Wave 2, Wave 4,

Wave 6), we first identified employment discontinuities. Among sample members who reported

that they were no longer working for the previous wave’s employer, we then considered

responses to the following survey question: Why did you leave that employer? Did the business

close, were you laid off or let go, did you leave to take care of family members, or what?

Individuals who indicated that business closure was the reason for their departure were assigned

a 1 for the indicator variable; otherwise, a 0 was assigned. Note that we do not include self-

employed individuals in our analysis.

        We investigated the effect of business closings on two dependent variables in this study:

daily drinking behavior and Body Mass Index (BMI).                   Drinking behavior (DRINKS) was

measured by the number of alcoholic drinks (i.e., beer, wine, liquor) consumed per day, which

was first asked at HRS Wave 3.2 It was based on responses to the following survey question, In

the last three months, on the days you drink, about how many drinks do you have? Non-drinkers


2
 In previous HRS waves, drinking was measured categorically. Given the lagged structure of our models, we may
only use outcome data from Wave 4 through Wave 6 in our analysis of drinking behavior. The relevant sample size
for the analysis of daily drinking behavior is 4,349.

                                                       7
were assigned a 0 value for this variable. The average number of drinks in a single day is a

marker for heavy, hazardous, abusive, or dependent drinking. It is preferable to weekly quantity-

frequency measures, which may mask abusive alcohol use on single days. BMI is a continuous

variable, taken from the RAND HRS, and was calculated as weight, in kilograms, divided by the

square of height, in meters.

         Socioeconomic covariates were drawn from a number of domains.                                 Demographic

variables include age, gender, race, marital status, and education.                        Work-related variables

comprise occupation, physical demands, and job stress. We control for occupational category to

control for characteristics such as physical demand of the job and reemployment probabilities.

Depressive symptomatology was a health-related control.                    Geographic regional variables were

also included in most specifications.

         Three additional variables were used in our later analysis of the determinants of whether

an individual responds to job loss (i.e. latent class membership). They are a measure of risk

aversion, financial planning horizon, and cognition. To infer risk preferences, the HRS asked

respondents to choose among four different gambles, trading off certain and uncertain job

opportunities and income. From this information, a risk aversion variable was developed, which

ranged from 1 (least risk averse) to 4 (most risk averse).3 Risk preferences questions were asked

of all respondents, excluding proxies, in 1992; they were not repeated in the 1994 and 1996

  The first gamble was presented as follows: Suppose you are the only income earner in the family, and you have a
good job You are given the opportunity to take a new and equally good job, with a 50-50 chance that it will double
your income and a 50-50 chance that it will reduce your income by a third. Would you take the new job? If the
answer was no, the respondent was presented with the second gamble: Suppose the chances were a 50-50 chance
that it would double your income and a 50-50 chance that it would cut your income by 20 percent. Would you still
take the new job? If the answer to the first question was yes, the interviewer asked: Suppose the chances were a 50-
50 chance that it would double your income and a 50-50 chance that it would cut your income by half. Would you
still take the new job? Based on their choices, we created a variable that took the value 1 if the individual chose the
riskiest option (50-50 chances of doubling their income or reducing it by half); 2 if they chose the job with even

                                                           8
waves. From 1998 onward, selected respondents answered the risk preferences questions based

on their cohort, age, and/or random selection. Assuming that risk attitude is a time invariant

trait, we replaced missing data from the post-1992 HRS waves with responses from the previous

wave. For participants who answered these questions in more than one wave prior, we took the

mean of the previous responses.

         To measure planning behavior the HRS asked respondents: In deciding how much of their

(family) income to spend or save, people are likely to think about different financial planning

periods. In planning your (family’s) savings and spending, which of the time periods listed in the

booklet is most important to you [and your (husband/wife/partner)]? We created a variable that

took the value 1 if respondents answered next few months; 2 if they answered next year; 3 if they

answered next few years; 4 if they answered the next 5-10 years; and 5 if they answered longer

than 10 years. As with the risk preferences battery, this question was asked of all respondents,

excluding proxies, in 1992, and was not repeated in the 1994 and 1996 waves. In 1998 and

2000, respondents were selected to answer this question based on a combination of their cohort

and random selection. In 2002, individuals who were 65 years and older were not asked this

question. We also treated planning horizon as a time invariant trait and applied the same data

replacement approach, described above, as we used for the risk attitudes variable.

         The HRS included a set of questions measuring the cognitive status of respondents.

Based on responses to these questions, we constructed a cognitive score that was the sum of

three separate measures: immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and series seven. The total

score varied from 0 to 25, with a higher score representing a greater cognitive function. The




chances of doubling their income or reducing it by a third; 3 if they chose the job with even chances of doubling
their income or reducing it by a fifth and 4 if they chose to stay with their current job.

immediate word recall measure counted the number of words that individuals could recall

immediately after a list of 10 words was read to them by the interviewer. The delayed word

recall measure counted the number of words from the same list that the individual could recall

after five minutes. For the series seven measure individuals were asked to serially subtract seven

starting from 100. This measure was the number of correct answers. The series seven question

was not asked in 1992 and 1994 and none of these questions were asked of proxy respondents.

       Table 1 provides a detailed description of the dependent and independent variables while

Table 2 provides summary statistics for those who lost their job through business closings (121

observations) and separately for those who did not (6606 observations). For most the variables,

there are no significant nor substantial differences across the two groups. Education and income

are the exceptions for which there are significant differences at the 5% level. Individuals who

suffered job losses through business closings had lower pre-job loss income and have lower

levels of education.



Econometric Methods

       The basic econometric model for BMI, a continuous variable, is given by

        E ( BMI t | BCt −1 , BMI t −1 , X t −1 ) = α BCt −1 + γ BMI t −1 + X t −1 β            (1)

where BC is an indicator for job loss due to business closing between times t-1 and t. For

notational convenience, we subscript BC with t-1. Time-invariant socioeconomic characteristics

are denoted by X which is measured at time t-1. In addition, we include BMIt-1 to control for

baseline BMI. Equation (1) is first estimated by OLS. However, if BMI is drawn from distinct

subpopulations, as we have argued above, the OLS estimate of α is the average of the effects

across subpopulations, thus may hide substantive differences in α across the subpopulations.


                                                       10
Thus, we also estimate equation (1) using a finite mixture model, where the subpopulations are

assumed to be drawn from normal distributions. The model is described in more detail below.

        The basic econometric model for number of drinks per day (DRINKS), an integer valued

variable, is given by

         E ( DRINKSt | BCt −1 , DRINKSt −1 , X t −1 ) = exp(α BCt −1 + γ DRINKSt −1 + X t −1 β )                     (2)

where, in addition to BC, measured between t-1 and t, and X, measured at time t-1, we include

DRINKS      t-1   as an additional regressor to control for baseline drinking behavior. Because the

conditional mean is specified as an exponential function, DRINKS t-1 enters the argument of the

exponent logarithmically. (One is added to DRINKS t-1 to bypass the log (0) issue.) Equation (2)

is first estimated by Poisson regression.                           Again, if DRINKS is drawn from distinct

subpopulations, the Poisson estimate of α is the average of the effects across subpopulations and

may hide substantive differences in α across the subpopulations.                                  Thus, we also estimate

equation (2) using a finite mixture model with Poisson-distributed subpopulations.

        In the finite mixture model, the random variable y is postulated as a draw from a

population which is an additive mixture of C distinct classes or subpopulations in proportions π j

such that

where λ ji = exp(α j BC t −1 + γ j DRINKSt −1 + X t −1 β j ) . Other applications of normal mixtures

include Morduch and Stern (1997) and Conway and Deb (2002), while an early application of

finite mixture of Poisson densities is Wang, Cockburn and Puterman (1998). The finite mixture

models are estimated using maximum likelihood and cluster-corrected robust standard errors are

used throughout for inference purposes. These are implemented using the Stata package fmm.

       The finite mixture model provides a natural and intuitively attractive representation of

heterogeneity in a finite, usually small, number of finite mixtures latent classes, each of which

may be regarded as a ‘type’ or a ‘group’. Estimates of such finite mixture models may provide

good numerical approximations even if the underlying mixing distribution is continuous

(Heckman and Singer 1984; Laird 1978).            In addition, the finite mixture approach is

semiparametric—it does not require any distributional assumptions for the mixing variable—and

under suitable regularity conditions is the semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the

unknown density (Lindsay 1995).

       A finite mixture characterization is especially attractive if the mixture components have a

natural interpretation. However, this is not essential. A finite mixture may be simply a way of

flexibly and parsimoniously modeling the data, with each mixture component providing a local

approximation to some part of the true distribution. A caveat to the foregoing discussion is that

the finite mixture model may fit the data better simply because outliers, influential observations

or contaminated observations are present in the data. The finite mixture model will capture this

phenomenon through additional mixture components. Hence it is desirable that such models be



                                                 12
supported both by a priori reasoning and by meaningful a posteriori differences in the behavior

of the latent classes.

        We can use our finite mixture parameter estimates to calculate the posterior probability of

being in each of the latent classes. Although the models assume that the prior (unconditional)

probability of class membership is constant across observations (p), we can use Bayes Theorem

to calculate the posterior probability of membership in each class, conditional on all (both time

invariant and variant) observed covariates and outcome, as

                                           f k ( yi | θ k )
          Pr( yi ∈ k | θ, yi ) =                              , ∀k = 1, 2,..., C.               (6)
                                   ∑
                                       C
                                           π f ( yi | θ j )
                                       j =1 j j



Thus the posterior probability varies across observations. Note that in the 2-component mixture

regressions we include only time-varying independent variables because the lagged dependent

variable absorbs the time-invariant variation. However, in the posterior we use both time-

varying and time-variant covariates. We use the estimated posterior probabilities to explore the

determinants of class membership.

        We note that quantile regressions have been used in similar contexts to study

heterogeneous responses to treatments. In the context of our study, quantile regression methods

have two limitations vis-à-vis finite mixture models. First, quantile regressions are not always

well behaved in the context of count data. Second, although quantile regression methods may

detect heterogeneous responses, they provide no way to characterize the source of the

heterogeneity.



Results

        For both of the outcomes, we present results from 2-component mixtures. For DRINKS,

model selection criteria provide clear evidence in favor of the 2-component model as compared

                                                                  13
to the 3-component one. For BMI, the 3-component model failed to converge after a reasonable

number of iterations, suggesting that the third component was likely attempting to fit a small

number of outliers or otherwise influential observations.        We first provide results from a

preferred specification, which compares estimates generated by FMM models with estimates

derived from traditional statistical analysis (i.e., OLS for BMI, Poisson regression for DRINKS).

See Tables 3 and 6. We then provide results (Tables 4 and 7) of the FMM models for two

extended specifications, the first of which adds additional demographic controls, and the second

of which adds job-related variables. Finally, in Tables 5 and 8, we present estimates of latent

class membership, or the posterior probability of belonging to one of the subgroups identified in

the FMM analysis.

BMI Results

       Considering the preferred specification, OLS estimates of the effect of business closure

on subsequent BMI suggested no significant difference between participants who experienced

business closure and those who did not.       See Table 3. This contrasts with the results of the

FMM model, in which two latent classes (components) were identified in proportions of 0.81 and

0.19, respectively. Members of the first latent class (Component 1) had small, but statistically

insignificant decreases in BMI after business closure.          In a markedly different manner,

participants in the second latent class had large, statistically significant (p<.05) increases in BMI

following business closure. On average, Component 2 members increased their BMI by over

one unit. This one-unit change is similar to gaining 7 pounds for a 5 ft, 10 inch man who weighs

180 pounds before job loss. These results are robust to the addition of other covariates in the

extended specifications (Table 4).

       There are a number of other notable results that can be seen in Table 3. First, while older



                                                 14
sample members had lower overall BMI, age had a substantially larger effect on individuals in

Component 2. Second, individuals in Component 2 who worked in manufacturing occupations

had lower BMI than other individuals in that group, while this did not hold for individuals in

Component 1. Third, while farmers in the first component had greater BMI than others in that

group, there was no effect in the second component. Finally, lagged BMI was highly significant

in both components and the coefficient is very close to one for individuals in Component 1. The

coefficient was smaller in Component 2, suggesting less persistence in BMI among individuals

in Component 2.         Note that lagged BMI is a highly significant explanatory variable that

presumably picks up much of the pre-existing differences in BMI, thus leaving relatively little to

be absorbed by the time-varying independent measures.

        As mentioned above, Component 2 is the smaller latent class with a mixing proportion of

about 0.19. Individuals who were (ex-post) classified as being in Component 2 had an average

BMI of 29.4 as compared to 26.9 among individuals in Component 1. In the top panel of Figure

1, we illustrate the component densities of the finite mixture model for BMI. At 29.4, the

average BMI for Component 2 is on the verge of meeting the criteria for obese (BMI over 30),

and clearly many members of this component are obese. At 26.9, the mean for Component 1 is

just over the cut point for overweight (25 and above), but only a small percentage of these are

likely to be obese. Indeed, we find that individuals in Component 2 were almost 21 percentage

points more likely to be obese compared to those in Component 1. BMI in the overweight and

especially obese range put individuals at increased risk of health problems.4 Given that they are



4
  Other methods estimate not only body fat but also body fat distribution as excessive fat in the abdominal area in
particular is associated with increased health risks. Such methods include measurements of skinfold thickness and
waist circumference, waist-to-hip circumference ratios, and techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography,
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While some of these indicators are more specifically correlated with health
risks, however, the HRS does not have any of these other measures.


                                                        15
an older population, this effect compounds their already elevated risks. It is also noteworthy that

the distribution associated with Component 2 has a substantially higher variance.

       Several variables predict membership in the Component 2, as can be seen in Table 5.

Those who are younger, have lower non-housing net worth, have higher depressive symptoms,

and are female were significantly more likely to be in Component 2. Those in Component 2 also

had higher job stress prior to business closure.       Interestingly, education does not play a

significant role in allocating individuals to components, even though in the expanded FMM

results, education decreased BMI for those in Component 2. A longer financial planning horizon

significantly reduced the probability of being in Component 2, but was significant in only one

specification. While we expected that risk-aversion and cognitive abilities might be significant

in determining latent classes, they were not.

Daily Drinking Results

       As with BMI, comparison of the single equation (Poisson in this case) results with FMM

suggest considerable heterogeneity across two components, which occur in proportions 0.94 and

0.06. While business closure had no effect on subsequent daily drinking in the Poisson

regression, the FMM results indicated one group whose behavioral response to business closure

is large and statistically significant. These results are displayed in Table 6. This group

(Component 2) increased its daily consumption of alcohol by just less than 100 percent per day

after business closure (p<.01). In contrast, members of the first latent class (Component 1) had

small, though not statistically significant increases in daily drinking after business closure.

Marginal effects calculated at the sample means of other covariates showed that individuals in

Component 2 increased their alcohol consumption by 2.7 drinks.

       Over two drinks a day exceeds the maximum recommended amount for both men and



                                                16
women (for women the recommended maximum is 1 per day). Thus the additional alcohol

consumption is likely to be harmful to the individual due to increased risk of accidents,

interactions with medications, and harmful effects of alcohol for individuals with chronic

diseases. Also, the additional alcohol consumption could have negative externalities due to

increased drunk driving, negative impacts on family members, and impairments and accidents at

home and at work (for the employed.).

        The extended specifications suggest negative confounding between business closure and

several of the additional covariates. See Table 7. That is, when the full set of demographic and

employment variables are included in the model, the magnitude of the effect of business closure

increases.

       There are a number of other notable differences between individuals across latent classes.

Older individuals, those with lower incomes, and those in administrative, service, operator and

farming occupations consumed fewer drinks if they belonged to Component 1. Neither age, nor

income or occupation had an effect on individuals in Component 2. Finally, while prior drinking

was significantly correlated with current drinking among individuals in Component 1, there was

no association between past and current drinking among individuals in Component 2.

       In the extended specification shown in Table 7, education and depressive symptoms each

affect consumption of alcohol differently across components, with each significant only in

Component 1. Higher education increases the number of drinks for those in Component 1 while

depressive symptoms have a negative impact. A physically demanding job significantly reduces

the number of drinks only for those in the second latent class. The lagged drinks variable

becomes significant in Component 2 with the inclusion of job demands and physical demands.

       Individuals who were (ex-post) classified as being in Component 2, the smaller latent



                                              17
class with a mixing proportion of 0.06, consumed an average of 2 drinks as compared to 0.3

drinks among individuals in Component 1. See Table 8. We found that, compared to individuals

in Component 1, those in Component 2 were almost 9 percentage points more likely to be

classified as being problem drinkers, were 24 percentage points more likely to be binge drinkers,

and binged 1.2 more days on average.

       In the bottom panel of Figure 1, we illustrate the component densities of the finite

mixture model for DRINKS. The figure clearly shows that individuals in Component 2 are

heavier drinkers, have greater variability in consumption, and are less likely to be non-drinkers.

       A broader set of factors contribute to the likelihood of membership in the latent classes

than those which were associated with daily alcohol use after business closure. The members of

the group with higher consumption propensity were less likely to be married, and work in sales,

mechanical and operator occupations. They had lower educational attainment and were less risk

averse, but had higher non-housing net worth. They also tended to have lower physical demands

in the pre-closing job. Interestingly, education significantly increases the probability of being in

Component 1 (with the lower average drinking), but significantly increases the number of drinks

for those in Component 1 in the expanded results (Table 7). That is, higher education is

associated with an increase in being in the lower drinker group, but conditional on being in this

group, it raises the number of drinks. Being male significantly increases the probability of being

in Component 2 and significantly increases the number of drinks only for those in Component 2

(Table 7).

Discussion

       In this study, we used nationally representative data on U.S. workers nearing retirement

to assess the effect of business closures on two important health behaviors: BMI and daily



                                                18
alcohol use. The recent severe economic downturn and resulting large increases in job loss

coupled with the mixed results in the previous literature make our analysis especially timely and

policy relevant. Indeed we show evidence that previous literature has likely failed to find

important effects of job loss on health behaviors because of a focus on the average effect of job

loss rather than the heterogeneous effects of job loss across the population.

       In particular, we extended the literature in several ways. First, we use a measure of job

loss that is plausibly exogenous; our focus on business closings helps to isolate a causal effect

that is less likely driven by selection. Second, we extend previous empirical modeling strategies

by using finite mixture models in order to capture heterogeneity in the effects of job loss on

health. Third, our use of national panel data allows us coverage of the population of individuals

over 50 years old as well as the ability to control for health measures before job loss.

       Accounting for sample heterogeneity via FMM estimation proved crucial to unmasking

subpopulations whose health behaviors were affected by the stress of job loss. Our main results

indicated substantial heterogeneity in the effect of business closure for both BMI and daily

drinking behavior.    While the majority of individuals experienced no behavioral effect of

business closing, a smaller proportion reported adverse changes. Importantly, we show that this

smaller proportion of individuals who respond to job loss by increasing unhealthy behaviors are

individuals already pursuing unhealthy behaviors (pre-job loss), so that these further increases in

unhealthy behaviors may be especially problematic.          This qualitative result holds for both

drinking and BMI. The broad consistency of the results across specifications, including the

stability of the class probabilities across a wide variety of specifications, gives us confidence that

the results are not spurious and specifically, not driven by the relatively small number of

individuals who experience job loss due to business closing.



                                                 19
        The results from this paper are of particular important given the current era of high job

loss. Behavioral health responses to job loss may aggravate an already stressful situation for this

vulnerable population of older workers. A better assessment of the empirical impact may pave

the way for methods to better protect the health of those who respond particularly negatively to

job loss.

Depressive Symptoms        Abridged version of the Center for Epidemiologic
                           Studies-Depression (CESD) Scale - sum of answers
                           to eight questions that asked if during the past week,
                           the respondent felt depressed, felt that everything he
                           did was an effort, experienced restless sleep, could
                           not get going, felt lonely, felt sad much of the time,
                           enjoyed life and was happy. The last question was
                           reverse coded so that a higher score represents more
                           depressive symptoms.

                           Note: Standardized to have mean zero and variance
                           one.

Household Income           Total (respondent + spouse) household income. It is
                           the sum of the following: earnings; household

                             inheritance.

                             Note: Divided by 10,000 for scalar consistency and
                             deflated to 1992 USD. We used the logarithm value
                             of income and added 0.01 to deal with the log(0)
                             issue.

Job Stress                   1 = Strongly agrees that current job involves lots of
