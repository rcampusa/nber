                THE NEER IMMIGRATION, TRADE, AND LABOR MARKETS DATA FILE


                                          ABSTRACT

      The NEER Immigration, Trade, and Labor Markets Data Files were developed

from public data sources to facilitate industry-based and area-based research

on the effects of international trade and immigration on labor markets in the

United States.      The industry data files contain shipments,     a shipments

deflator, value added, employment, payroll, hours, real capital stock,

imports, exports, unionization, and immigrant ratios for 450 four-digit (1972

Standard Industrial Classification) manufacturing industries.          The primary

source of the industry production and factor use       data   is the Annual Survey of

Manufactures.      The primary source   of the international trade data is the
defunct     Bt,S Trade Monitoring System (1972 to 1981). which was extended to

earlier and later years using U.S. Commodity Exports and Imports as Related to

Output, U.S. Department of Commerce Official Statistics, and the Annual Survey

of Manufactures.       The primary source of the unionization data is the Current

Population    Survey   (1973 to 1984), which cannot be extended to earlier years.

The primary source of the immigrant ratio data is the Census of Population

(1960, 1970, and 1980).      The area data files contain information on immigrants

in the work force by state and major SM$A from the Census of Population 1970

and 1980.     The data are available fro. the author on floppy disk (Stata or

ASCII format), computer tape (SASm format) or by electronic mail.

 Markets    Data Files were developed fro, public data sources to facilitate

 industry-based      research   on the effects of international trade and immigration
 on labor markets in the        United States. Many of the papers in this volume
                                                                                  make
 use    of data derived from these files.1        The purpose of this paper is to
 document      the sources and methods used to prepare the data files.
         There are three basic types of files. Trade data files contain
 information organized on an industry         basis for U.S.    manufacturingindustries.
 Industry      immigration   files contain information   on   work force characteristics,
 including     immigrants, organized on an industry basis        for all U.S. industries.

Area immigration files contain information on work force characteristics.

 including immigrants, organized on a state and Standard Metropolitan

Statistical Area (SMSA) basis.

         Trade Data File contains shipments, a shipments deflator, value
         The

added, employment, payroll, real capital stock, imports, exports,
unionization,      and   immigrant ratios for 450 four-digit (1972 Standard
Industrial      Classification) industries.       The files provide annual data    covering
the period from 1958 to         1986.   The Industry Immigration   File contains
information on the education, demographics and immigrant proportions in the
labor force of 292 Census Industrial Classification (CIC) industries. The
area  immigrant files contain information on immigrant proportions in the fifty
states (State Immigrant File) and SMSAs (SMSA Immlgrant File).
Overall Organization of the Data
        Table 1 contains a list of the variable names, short definitions, and
basic   sources, for the variables in the Trade Data File.           Table 2 contains a

comparable list for the variables in the Immigration Data File.             Variable

names shown in Tables I and 2 are        used throughout this   paper   to refer   to   the
variables   in   the files.

Annual    Survey of Manufactures Data
        The industry level production, factor use, and price index data were
prepared by Wayne B. Gray as a part of the flEa's Productivity Project.                 The

industry definitions conform to the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification.
These definitions are used throughout the Trade and Immigration Data Files.
        The initial version of the industry level production, factor use, and
price    index data, covering the period from 1958 to 1976, was developed as a

joint project by the University of Pennsylvania, the Bureau of the Census, and

SRI, Incorporated (called SRI-Penn herein).           The SRI-Penn data are documented

in   Andrews and Zabala (1984) and the references therein.2 SRI-Penn variables
from the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) Statistics for Industry Groups
and Industries have not been changed.           The SRI-Penn data were extended to 1986
using ASM Statistics for Industry        Groups and   Industries Table 2 (1986 and
earlier   years).

        The implementation of consistent bridges to recode all industry data to

a 1972 SIC basis was a major problem in the creation of the four-digit

industry-based data.      The SRI-Penn   data    (1958 to 1976) were based on 1967 SIC

definitions from the defunct Industry Profiles data base (U.S. Department of

Commerce 1971, 1978)      The SRI-Penn project recoded the 1967 SIC industry data

to a 1972 SIC basis using the many-to-many bridge based upon the industry

translation table published as a part of the Census of Manufactures (U.S.

Department of Commerce 1976).      This bridge assigned to the 1972 SIC the

proportion of the 1967 SIC-based variable that was appropriate based upon the

proportion of 1972 value added represented by the 1967 SIC-based industry.




                                             2
       The data from 1977 to 1986 were restated on a 1.972 basis as follows.

 Pour-digit 1977 SIC-based data were recoded to a 1972 basis using the many-to-

 many bridge that accompanied the 1977 Census of Manufactures (U.S. Department

 of Commerce 1981).     This bridge assigns to the 1972 SIC the proportion of the

 1977 SIC that was appropriate based upon the proportion of 1972 value added

 represented by the 1977 SIC-based industry.     (Although there are only 448

 1977-based four-digit SIC industries, the NBER files continue to use the 450

 1972-based four-digit SIC industries.)

       Some missing data were imputed because the values for a particular four-

 digit SIC were suppressed from the original published ASH tables in order to

avoid the breach of establishment confidentiality.     For the period from 1958

to 1976 the SRI-Penn data estimated the value of missing data by a combination

of remainder assignment and interpolation between the Census of Manufactures

years (see Andrews and Zabala, page 7).

      For the period from 1977 to 1986 in the NBER Trade Data File the

following procedure was used.     The complete two-digit industry group data and

the available three-digit industry group data were used to impute the missing

three-digit data by calculating the remainder of the two-digit classification

after subtracting all available three-digit data.     The two-digit remainder was

allocated to missing three-digit industry groups by imputation based on

available three-digit data in surrounding years.     The complete three-digit

industry group data (including imputations) and the available four-digit

industry    data were used to impute missing four-digit data following the same
remainder   and allocation process as used for the missing three-digit data.

      The detailed definitions of ASH variables can be found in Appendix A-i

of ASH Statistics for Industry Groups and Industries (1986 and earlier years).

The ASH is a survey of manufacturing establishments with a sampling frame




                                          3
derived from the Census of Manufactures conducted every five years.            The

following variables were used directly from the ASK Table 2.          VSHIPPED is the
total annual value of industry shipments in millions of current dollars.
VADDED is value added by manufacture in millions of current dollars.           ALL WRK

is the annual average employment of full or part time persons in thousands.
PROD_W1U( is the annual average full and part time employment of production
workers (through the line-supervisor level) in thousands.          PROD_HRS is the
total   annual hours of production workers in millions. ALLAY is the total

annual value    of gross earnings paid to all employees in millions of      current

dollars    (includes   salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation pay, sick

pay,    and compensation in kind as used in calculating Federal withholding
taxes).     PROD_WAG is the total annual   value   of gross earnings paid to
production   workers    in millions of current dollars.
        The estimated real value of    the capital stock (in 1972 dollars) is based
on the SRI-Penn data for the period 1958 to 1976.         The methods used to develop

this series are described in Andrews and Zabala (1984, pp. 10-15).          The

variable RCAPSTcK for the period 1958 to 1976 is an accumulation of the

depreciated, constant dollar plant and equipment investment series for the

industry.

        For the period from 1977 to 1986 the real capital stock was estimated

using unpublished information from the Industry Capital Stocks data base,

which   provides deflators for new investment and     separate   measures of real
plant and equipment capital stocks for three-digit industries.3 These data
were used to estimate implicit depreciation rates for plant and equipment
investments in the three-digit SIC industries. The price deflators and
depreciation rates for each three-digit industry were assigned to all four-
digit   industries within that SIC.    The published ASH new capital expenditures



                                           4
 were divided into plant and equipment using unpublished data from the Industry
 Capital Stocks data base. The four-digit SIC real plant and equipment stocks
 were estimated separately using the formula:

          Real Plant Stock      — (1   -   depreciation   rate) (Previous Year Plant Stock)
          +    (Previous Year New Plant Spending)/(Previous Year Plant Deflator)
 and similarly for the real equipment stock.               The variable RCAPSTCI( for the
 period from 1977 to 1986 is the sum           of    the real plant and real equipment
 stocks.

          Because the Industry Capital Stocks data base ends in 1982, deflators

 for new plant and equipment were derived from the Detailed Investment
                                                                       by
 Industry data base.       These data are only available at the two-digit level.

 The four-digit industry was assigned the new             plant   and equipment deflator from
 its two-digit industry group for 1983 forward.

         The shipments deflator for the period 1958 to 1976 comes from the
                                                                           SRI-
 Penn data.       For the period from 1977 to 1986 the deflator is based on

unpublished data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (SEA) in the Department

of Commerce.        The SEA four-digit SIC shipment deflators are based on the
Bureau of Labor Statistics product price indices. The 315 product price
indices are based upon the seven-digit detailed product class codes, which are
aggregated       to a four-digit SIC basis.         There have been many changes   in the
product       definitions and available price indices throughout the years.          There
are apparently no comprehensive descriptions of these series within the BLS
                                                                            or

the EM.        In recent years (varying depending upon the industry) the BLS has

created industry price indices (as opposed to product price indices) at the

four-digit SIC level.       The 5I.S industry price indices were used whenever

possible.       The shipments deflator is the variable SHIPDEFL.4

International      Trade Data


                                                5
         Since most domestic U.S.     data   are maintained on an industrial

classification basis,      primarily the SIC, the NBER Trade Data File was designed

to    provide import and   export data on an industrial basis.         The difficulty with

this    approach is that   the   SIC system requires information about the product
type and the manufacturing method while the basic classification system used
for imports and exports identifies on].y the product type. As a consequence,
the most detailed SIC-based classifications of imports and exports group
together products that span several four-digit SIC categories. The
noncomparability of SIC-based import, export and production data, as
published, required the development of alternative industry-based estimates of
international trade values.
     The annual industry measures of import and export value that appear in
the NBER Trade Data File were derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Trade Monitoring System (1979, l983a, l983b), the Bureau of the Census U.S.
Commodity   Exports and Imports as Related to Output (1965/64           and 1972/71), the

ASK   data described above, and the Annual Sunsy of Manufactures Value of
Product Shipments (1982 to 1985).
        For the period from 1972 to 1981 the Bureau of Labor Statistics
maintained a collection of time series called the Trade Monitoring System
(TI(S) that provided annual information on U.S. imports, the ratio of imports

to new supply, exports, and the ratio of exports to domestic shipments on a

modified four-digit SIC-based industry classification.             Schoepfle (1982)

reports the development and       uses   of the TKS data.   His appendix contains

numerous details of the calculations.          Bennett   (1982, available on request
from the Department   of Labor)     reports the details     of   the TMS data base

construction.




                                              6
          The TMS was based on
                             a very careful attempt to construct domestic
 shipment data that were as comparable as possible to the most detailed
 industrial classification-based import and export data. The flEa Trade Data
 File follows the TXS methodology to extend the series backward to 1958 and
 forward to 1985. The TMS methods were approximated for the period from
                                                                                         1958
 to   1972, using 1972    as a   splice year.       The TMS methods were     used exactly for
 l982to     1985.

          For imports, the TICS defined 317         mutually   exclusive   manufacturing groups
 in   a classification system called the MSIC (for import SIC).
                                                                              The MSIC covers
 all four-digit 1972 SIC-based manufacturing industries that
                                                             can be
 distinguished from the automatic application of               the concordance relating u.s.
 Department of Commerce Tariff Schedules of the United
                                                       States, Annotated
 (TSUSA) to Product Class code (Five-digit 1977-based SIC), which
                                                                  forms the
basis for the tables in the publication U.S. Commodity Exports
                                                               and Imports as
Related to Output and the Department of Commerce online data base
                                                                                  of official
international       trade statistics.5   The basic import data are collected

continuously at the port of entry to the United States by the
                                                              Bureau of the
Census and are classified according to the TSUSA as a part of the Customs

process.     The concordance between        Product Class codes is updated
                                         TSUSA and

monthly as TSUSA codes are created or eliminated. Annual import data
aggregated to a four-digit SIC basis are published regularly by the Census
Bureau on the basis of the current TSUSA to Product Class concordance and sum-
marized   biennially in the publication U.S.          Commodity Exports and Imports as
Related to Output.       In this publication a modified four-digit SIC, similar to

the HSIC,    is   used to distinguish the industries.5

       For exports, the TICS defined 370 mutually exclusive four-digit SIC

manufacturing industries in a classification system called the XSIC (for




                                                7
export SIC).    The classification is based upon ill 1972-based SIC industries

that can be    distinguished from an automatic application of the U.S. Department
of   Coinerce concordance   between Schedule B coinodity numbers and   five-digit

SIC-based Product Class codes.      The basic export data are collected at the
port of departure from the United States by the Bureau of the Census and are
classified according to the schedule B number as a part of the coding process
for international trade statistics. The concordance between Schedule B number
and Product Class codes is updated monthly as Schedule B numbers are created
or eliminated. Annual export data aggregated to a four-digit SIC basis are
published regularly by the Census Bureau on the basis of the current Schedule
B to Product Class concordance and sunarized biennially in the publication
U.S. Coodity Exports and Imports as Related to Output. In this publication
a modified four-digit SIC, similar to the XSIC, is used to distinguish the
industries.7
       The import data in the NBER Trade Data File were assembled for the 317
basic MSIC industries.      For each such industry, imports are defined as the
customs value of imports in millions of current dollars. The customs value
generally excludes transportation and insurance costs from the foreign port.
For the period from 1958 to 1971 imports were reported in U.S. Commodity
Exports and Imports as Related to Output using an old definition.       For 1972 to
1981 imports were used directly from the TNS.      For 1982 to 1985 imports were
reported in the U.S. Department of Commerce online data base of official
statistics from the table All Items in U.S. Imports for Consumption from World
(l986b) using a consistent definition but a revised concordance.       The year
1972 was   used as a splice to make the 1958 to 1971 values conform to the 1972
definitions and concordance.' The year 1981 was used as a splice to make the
1982 to 1985 values conform to the 1981 concordance.°


                                          8
          The MSIC-based   value of    domestic shipments    for the industry      or   industry
 group corresponding       to the MSIC was taken from the TMS for years 1972 to 1981.

 For the    years 1958 to 1971 the MSIC-based       value of domestic shipments was

 imputed using the following technique.           The value of industry shipments for

 the 1972 SIC-based four-digit industries was obtained from the Annual Survey

 of Manufactures (ASM)       data   discussed above.     Using the   concordance   between
 MSIC and SIC    developed   at the NBER, the ASM value of       shipments   data were
 merged with the pre-1972 MSIC-based import data.             Then, the SIC-based

 shipments data for the years 1958 to 1971 were multiplied by the ratio of

MSIC-based value of shipments in 1972 to SIC-based value of shipments in
                                                                         1972.

 For the years 1982 to 1985 the TMS definitions of MSIC-based value of domestic

shipments, which are based on comparable five-digit Product Class codes,
                                                                         were

constructed directly from the         Table 1 values in ASM Value of Product
Shipments.     Data from the five-digit value of product shipments table
represent    sampling estimates      of the net sales value freight-on-board at the

point of manufacture in millions of current dollars            (excludes discounts,
transportation costs and excise taxes).

         For each MSIC-based industry the import penetration           ratio (Ifl) was
defined    as the ratio of imports to the sum       of   imports and   (MSIC-based)

domestic shipments.       Using the MSIC to SIC concordance, the import            penetration
ratio was merged to the data for the 450 1972 SIC-based industries for the
years 1958 to 1985. The value of imports for the SIC-based industry was set
to zero if    there   was no concordant MSIC.     Otherwise, IMPORTS in the Trade Data
File    was calculated as the product of ASM shipments (the variable VSHIPPED)

and the ratio IPR/(l-IPRJ.          In the Trade Data File, the basic import

penetration ratio can be reconstructed exactly by toning the ratio

IMPORTS/(VSHIPPED + IMPORTS).




                                              9
        Using 1972 as the reference year, the quality of the MSIC S SIC

concordance at the four-digit level can be assessed by considering the summary

statistics in Table 4.      Slightly more than 50 percent of the industry value of

shipments    can be matched exactly.     An additional 48 percent of industry

shipments can be match by combining SIC's, using special I1SICs, and other

concordance arrangements.       Overall, import statistics are available for 98.3

percent of   all   shipments.

        The export data in the flEa Trade Data File were assembled for the 310

basic XSIC industries.      For each such industry, exports are defined as the

free alongside ship value of exports in millions of current dollars.          The free

alongside ship value generally includes transportation and insurance costs

from the point of manufacture to the port of departure from the U.S.          For   the

period from 1958 to 1971 the export value was reported in U.S. COmmodity

Exports and Imports a. Related to Output.          For 1972 to 1981 the export value

was taken directly from the TMS.       For 1982 to 1985 the export value was

reported in the U.S. Department of Commerce online data base of official

statistics from the table All Items in U.S. Domestic Exports to World (l986a)

using a consistent definition but a revised concordance.         The year 1972 was

used as a splice to make the 1958 to 1971 values conform to the 1972

definitions and concordance.'°      The year 1981 was used as a splice to make the

1982 to 1985 values conform to the 1981 concordance."

        The XSIC-based value of domestic shipments for the industry or industry

group corresponding to the XStC was taken from the TMS for years 1972 to 1981.

For the years 1958 to 1971 the XSIC-based value of domestic shipments was

imputed   using the following technique.        The value of industry shipments for
the   1972 SIC-based industries was obtained for the four-digit industry from

the ASM data discussed above.      Using the concordance between XSIC and SIC



                                           10
developed at the     NBER,   the ASH   value of shipments data were merged with the
pre-1972    XSIC-based export data.      Then, the SIC-based shipments data for the

years 1958 to 1971 were multiplied by the ratio of XSIC-based value of

shipments in 1972 to SIC-based value of shipments in 1972.          For the years 1982

to 1985 the TMS definitions of XSIC-based value of domestic shipments, which

are based on comparable five-digit product class codes, were constructed

directly from the Table 1 values in ASX Value        of Product Shipments.
         For each XSIC-based industry the export supply ratio (3(5) was defined as
the ratio of exports to (XSIC-based) domestic shipments.         Using the   XSIC to

SIC    concordance, the export supply ratio was merged to the data for the 450

1972    SIC-based industries for the years 1958 to 1985.      The value of exports
for the SIC-based industry      was set to zero if there was no concordant XSIC.

Otherwise, EXPORTS in the Trade Data File was calculated as the product of ASM

shipments (the variable VSHIPPED) and the variable 3(5.        In the Trade Data

File, the basic export supply ratio can be reconstructed exactly by forming

the ratio EXPORTS/VSHIPPED.

        Using 1972 as the reference year, the quality of the XSIC to SIC

concordance at the four-digit level can be assessed        by considering the summary
statistics   in Table 5.     Almost 62 percent of the industry value of shipments

can be matched exactly.        An   additional 36 percent of industry shipments can
be match by combining SIC's, using special XSICs, and other concordance

arrangements.    Overall, export statistics are available for 98.2 percent of

all shipments.'2

Current   Population Survey Data
        The industry unionization data were derived using the methods of Freeman
and Medoff (1979).     The Freeman-Hedoff estimates were updated into the 1980's




                                             11
but cannot be used       for       the period from 1958 to 1972 because the estimates rely

on the unionization questions from the May Current Population Survey (CPS).

          Union membership percentages were calculated as:


                 U— (EAuVij/IWsj) 100
                         i               i


where U3 is percentage of workers in Census industry j who are unionized; A13

—   1   if worker i is employed and in a union, and is zero otherwise; and V is

the CPS sampling weight attached to worker i.                  Separate unionization rates

were calculated for all workers and for production workers.                     Production

workers were defined as employed individuals in the following occupations:

craftsmen and kindred, operatives except                 transport, transport operatives,
nonfara    laborers, private household, all other              service, fan laborers and
foremen.       The values for 1974 were based on the 1973, 1974 and 1975 May

surveys.       The values in the Trade Data File for 1958 to 1973 are identical to

the 1974 values.       The values for 1980 were based on the 1979, 1980 and 1981

May surveys.       The values for 1984 were based on the 1984 May survey.                 All

other years were linearly interpolated.

         The   unionization data       for detailed Census Industrial Code (CIC)          from the
May Current Population Survey            was matched to the 1972 SIC-based industry data
using    a one-to-many   concordance between 1970 CICs             and   1972 SICs.   The variable
ALL UN contains the estimated overall unionization rate from the concordant
dC.      The variable PROD_UN contains          the estimated production unionization rate
from th, concordant CIC.
Census of Population         and   Housing   Data

         Public use aicrodata samples from the             1960,   1970, and 1980 decennial
Census of Population and Housing were used to derive estimates of the ratio of
iznigrant employees to total employees by industry for the census yBars.                        In


                                                    12
1970 and 1980 these Isigrant ratios are also available by racial, and ethnic

groups.      The 1970 and 1980 censuses were also used to create industry and area

data on labor force characteristics.

       The   1960 immigrant ratio was created    from the 1960 Census of Population

and Housing    using the 1/100 Public Use Sample    (Bureau of the Census, 1975).

The numerator of the ratio is the count of all immigrants       employed in the
detailed 1960 Census Industrial Classification (CXC) industry.          The
denominator is the count of all individuals employed in       the   detailed CXC.
Using a one-to-many concordance between the 1960 dC and the 1972 four-digit
SIC (for the 450 manufacturing industries only), the variable I&tRAT6O         was
created   on an SIC basis from the concordant dId.

       The 1970 immigrant ratios were created from the 1970 Census of

Population and Housing using the 1970 Five Percent Data County        Group Sample,
which is a 1/100 sample of the U.S. population (Bureau of the Census 1972).

The numerator of the ratio  is the count of all immigrants (or all immigrants
in the particular racial/ethnic group) employed in the detailed 1970 CIC
industry.     The denominator is the count    of all individuals employed in the
detailed dId industry. Using a one-to-many concordance       between the 1970 dc

and the 1972 four-digit SIC (for the 450 manufacturing industries only), the

immigrant ratios for 1970 were created on an SIC basis from the concordant

dId.   The immigrant groups used were:   all immigrants (IMMRAT7O), Asian
iimaigrants (A3AT70), black immigrants (BRAT7O), white immigrants (WRAT7O),
Mexican immigrants (MRAT7O), other Hispanic immigrants (ORAT7O), and all
immigrants who arrived within the last two years (RRAT7O). The Asian, black
and white racial groups are mutually exclusive and include Hispanics as
appropriate. The two Hispanic ratios are mutually exclusive.




                                         13
      The 1980 immigrant ratios were created from the 1980 Census              of

Population and Housing using the A   Sample,    which is   a   5/100   sample of     the U.S.
population   (Bureau of the Census, 1983a, 1983b).      The numerator of the ratio

is the count of all immigrants (or all immigrants in the particular

racial/ethnic group) employed in the detailed 1980 CXC industry.               The

denominator is the count of all individuals (from a 1/1000 random subsample of

the A Sample) employed in the detailed dC industry (multiplied by 50 to

reflect the different sampling rates).        Using a one-to-many concordance

between the 1980 dC and the 1972 four-digit SIC (for the 450 manufacturing

industries only), the immigrant ratios for 1980 were created on an SIC basis

from the concordant CXC.    The immigrant groups used were: all immigrants

(IMMRAT8O), Asian immigrants (ARAT8O), black immigrants (BRAT8O), white

immigrants (WRAT8O), Mexican immigrants (MRAT8O), other Hispanic immigrants

(ORAT8O), and all immigrants who arrived within the last two           years   (RRAT8O).

      The other variables in the Industry Immigration Data Files are labor

force characteristics by industry in 1980.       The variable P1(1624 is the

proportion of persons age 16 to 24 employed in the detailed CIC industry.                The

variable PR2COLL is the proportion   of employed persons with two of           more years

of college in the detailed CIC industry.       The variable PRFEMALE      is   the

proportion   of females employed in the detailed CXC industry.          The variable
PRZLACX is the proportion of blacks employed in the detailed CIC industry.
There are 292 detailed CIC industries represented.         For manufacturing
industries   only a one-to-many concordance between the 1980 CIC and the 1972

four-digit SIC was used to assign the labor force characteristics of the               dC
to its concordant SIC.

      The Area Immigration Data Files contain the variables IMNRAT7O and

IHMRAT8O, as defined in the Industry Immigration Data Files, except that the



                                         14
numerator and denominator of the ratios were calculated for immigrants and all
employed individuals in states and SMSAs. The states were defined using the
FIfl State Code for both Census Years. The SMSAs were defined by the SMSA
code in the 1980 Census and by the Area and Subarea codes in the 1970 Census.

5.    The basic classification
                             systems for imports and exports changed in 1988.
TheDepartment of Commerce online data base currently produces tables of
imports and exports by industry that are created using a different set of
concordances      than described in this paper.    The tables from the Commerce
Department online data base used in the NBER trade Data File were based on the
old concordances, described herein.

6.   The Trade Monitoring System (1983b) describes the concordance procedure
as follows. 'For the purpose of relating imports to output, individual TSUSA
commodity numbers are assigned to the five-digit SIC-based Product Class from
the numerical list of manufactured products, 1971 Census of Manufactures,
which contains the same products as the TSUSA number. In cases where the
t5TJSA numbers include items which should be classified in two or
                                                                  more SIC-
based output codes, an assignment is made to the SIC-based output code to
which the principal content of the TSZJSA appears to belong, where such an
assignment   will not significantly overcount the classificationto which the
TSUSA number belongs.   In cases where it appears  that distortions will result
from an assignment of an entire tStJSA number to a single SIC-based output
code, the principal SIC-based output product classes are combined to form an
SIC-based import code and TSUSA numbers are assigned to the combination."


7.    The Trade   Monitoring System (1983a) describes the concordance between
Schedule   B numbers and Product Class codes as follows: "For the purpose of
relating exports to output, individual. Schedule B commodity numbers are
assigned to the five-digit SIC-based Product Class from the numerical list of
manufactured products, 1977 Census of Manufactures, which contains the same
products as the Schedule B number. In cases where the Schedule B numbers
includ, items which should be classified in two or more SIC-based output
codes, an assignment is made to the SIC-base output code to which the
principal content of the Schedule B number appears to belong, where such an
                                          18
assignment will not significantly overcount the classification to which the
Schedule B number is assigned or undercount the other classification
it partially belongs. In cases where it appears that distortions willto result
                                                                        which
from an assignment of an entire Schedule B number to a single SIC•based output
code, the principal SIC-based output product classes are combined to form an
SIC-based export code and the schedule B numbers are assigned to the
combination.
