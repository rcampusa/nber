                                           ABSTRACT

Why is the equity premium so high, and why are stocks so volatile? Why are stock returns in excess
of government bill rates predictable? This paper proposes an answer to these questions based on a
time-varying probability of a consumption disaster. In the model, aggregate consumption follows a
normal distribution with low volatility most of the time, but with some probability of a consumption
realization far out in the left tail. The possibility of this poor outcome substantially increases the
equity premium, while time-variation in the probability of this outcome drives high stock market
volatility and excess return predictability.

1         Introduction

The magnitude of the expected excess return on stocks relative to bonds (the equity pre-
mium) constitutes one of the major puzzles in financial economics. As Mehra and Prescott
(1985) show, the fluctuations observed in the consumption growth rate over U.S. history
predict an equity premium that is far too small, assuming reasonable levels of risk aversion.1
One proposed explanation is that the return on equities is high to compensate investors for
the risk of a rare disaster (Rietz (1988)). An open question has therefore been whether the
risk is sufficiently high, and the rare disaster sufficiently severe, to quantitatively explain the
equity premium. Recently, however, Barro (2006) shows that it is possible to explain the
equity premium using such a model when the probability of a rare disaster is calibrated to
international data on large economic declines.
        While the models of Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006) advance our understanding of the eq-
uity premium, they fall short in other respects. Most importantly, these models predict that
the volatility of stock market returns equals the volatility of dividends. Numerous studies
have shown, however, that this is not the case. In fact, there is excess stock market volatility;
the volatility of stock returns far exceeds that of dividends (e.g. Shiller (1981), LeRoy and
Porter (1981), Keim and Stambaugh (1986), Campbell and Shiller (1988), Cochrane (1992),
Hodrick (1992)). While the models of Barro and Rietz address the equity premium puzzle,
they do not address this volatility puzzle.
        In the original model of Barro (2006), agents have power utility and the endowment
process is subject to large and relatively rare consumption declines (disasters). This paper
proposes two modifications. First, rather than being constant, the probability of a disaster
is stochastic and varies over time. Second, the representative agent, rather than having
power utility preferences, has recursive preferences. I show that such a model can generate
volatility of stock returns close to that in the data at reasonable values of the underlying
parameters. Moreover, the model implies reasonable values for the mean and volatility of
    1
        Campbell (2003) extends this analysis to multiple countries.

the government bills.
   Both time-varying disaster probabilities and recursive preferences are necessary to fit the
model to the data. The role of time-varying disaster probabilities is clear, the role of recursive
preferences perhaps less so. Recursive preferences, introduced by Kreps and Porteus (1978)
and Epstein and Zin (1989) retain the appealing scale-invariance of power utility, but allow
for separation between the willingness to take on risk and the willingness to substitute over
time. Power utility requires that these are driven by the same parameter, leading to the
counterfactual prediction that a high price-dividend ratios predicts a high excess return.
Increasing the agent’s willingness to substitute over time reduces the effect of the disaster
probability on the riskfree rate. With recursive preferences, this can be accomplished without
simultaneously reducing the agent’s risk aversion.
   The model in this paper allows for time-varying disaster probabilities and recursive utility
with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). The assumption that the EIS is equal
to 1 allows the model to be solved in closed form up to an indefinite integral. A time-varying
disaster probability is modeled by allowing the intensity for jumps to follow a square-root
process (Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985)). The solution for the model reveals that allowing
the probability of a disaster to vary not only implies a time-varying equity premium, it also
increases the level of the equity premium. The dynamic nature of the model therefore leads
the equity premium to be higher than what static considerations alone would predict.
   This model can quantitatively match high equity volatility and the predictability of excess
stock returns by the price-dividend ratio. Generating long-run predictability of excess stock
returns without generating counterfactual long-run predictability in consumption or dividend
growth is a central challenge for general equilibrium models of the stock market. This model
meets the challenge: while stock returns are predictable, consumption and dividend growth
are only predictable ex post if a disaster actually occurs. Because disasters occur rarely, the
amount of consumption predictability is quite low, just as in the data. A second challenge for
models of this type is to generate volatility in stock returns without counterfactual volatility
in the government bill rate. This model meets this challenge as well. The model is capable

                                                2
of matching the low volatility of the government bill rate because of two competing effects.
When the risk of a disaster is high, rates of return fall because of precautionary savings.
However, the probability of government default (either outright or through inflation) rises.
Investors therefore require greater compensation to hold government bills.
   As I describe above, adding dynamics to the rare disaster framework allows for a number
of new insights. Note however, that the dynamics in this paper are relatively simple. A
single state variable (the probability of a rare disaster) drives all of the results in the model.
This is parsimonious, but also unrealistic: it implies, for instance, that the price-dividend
ratio and the riskfree rate are perfectly negatively correlated. It also implies a degree of
co-movement among assets that would not hold in the data. In Section 2.4, I suggest ways
in which this weakness might be overcome while still maintaining tractability.
   Several recent papers also address the potential of rare disasters to explain the aggregate
stock market. Gabaix (2008a) assumes power utility for the representative agent, while
also assuming the economy is driven by a linearity-generating process (see Gabaix (2008b))
that combines time-variation in the probability of a rare disaster with time-variation in the
degree to which dividends respond to a disaster. This set of assumptions allows him to
derive closed-form solutions for equity prices as well as prices for other assets. In Gabaix’s
numerical calibration, only the degree to which dividends respond to the disaster varies over
time. Therefore the economic mechanism driving stock market volatility in Gabaix’s model is
quite different than the one considered here. Barro (2009) and Martin (2008) propose models
with a constant disaster probability and recursive utility. In contrast, the model considered
here focuses on the case of time-varying disaster probabilities. Longstaff and Piazzesi (2004)
propose a model in which consumption, and the ratio between consumption and the dividend
are hit by contemporaneous downward jumps; the ratio between consumption and dividends
then reverts back to a long-run mean. They assume a constant jump probability and power
utility. In contemporaneous independent work, Gourio (2008b) specifies a model in which the
probability of a disaster varies between two discrete values. He solves this model numerically
assuming recursive preferences. A related approach is taken by Veronesi (2004), who assumes

                                                3
that the drift of dividends follows a Markov switching process, with a small probability
of falling into a low state. While the physical probability of a low state is constant, the
representative investor’s subjective probability is time-varying due to learning. Veronesi
assumes exponential utility; this allows for the inclusion of learning but makes it difficult to
assess the magnitude of the excess volatility generated through this mechanism.
   In this paper, the conditional distribution of consumption growth becomes highly non-
normal when a disaster is relatively likely. Thus the paper also relates to a literature that
examines the effects of non-normalities on risk premia. Harvey and Siddique (2000) and
Dittmar (2002) examine the role of higher-order moments on the cross-section; unlike the
present paper they take the market return as a given. Similarly to the present paper, Weitz-
man (2007) constructs an endowment economy with non-normal consumption growth. His
model differs from the present one in that he assumes independent and identically distributed
consumption growth (with a Bayesian agent learning about the unknown variance), and he
focuses on explaining the equity premium.
   Finally, this paper draws on a literature that derives asset pricing results assuming en-
dowment processes that include jumps, with a focus on option pricing (an early reference
is Naik and Lee (1990)). Liu, Pan, and Wang (2005) consider an endowment process in
which jumps occur with a constant intensity; their focus is on uncertainty aversion but they
also consider recursive utility. My model departs from theirs in that the probability of a
jump varies over time. Drechsler and Yaron (2011) show that a model with jumps in the
volatility of the consumption growth process can explain the behavior of implied volatility
and its relation to excess returns. Eraker and Shaliastovich (2008) also model jumps in the
volatility of consumption growth; they focus on fitting the implied volatility curve. Both
papers assume of EIS greater than one and derive approximate analytical and numerical
solutions. Santa-Clara and Yan (2006) consider time-varying jump intensities, but restrict
attention to a model with power utility and implications for options. In contrast, the model
considered here focuses on recursive utility and implications for the aggregate market.

2         Model

2.1         Assumptions

I assume an endowment economy with an infinitely-lived representative agent. This set-up
is standard, but I assume a novel process for the endowment. Aggregate consumption (the
endowment) solves the following stochastic differential equation

                               dCt = µCt− dt + σCt− dBt + (eZt − 1)Ct− dNt ,                                   (1)

where Bt is a standard Brownian motion and Nt is a Poisson process with time-varying
intensity λt .2 This intensity follows the process

                                                                   p
                                      dλt = κ(λ̄ − λt ) dt + σλ     λt dBλ,t ,                                 (2)

where Bλ,t is also a standard Brownian motion, and Bt , Bλ,t and Nt are assumed to be
independent. I assume Zt is a random variable whose time-invariant distribution ν is inde-
pendent of Nt , Bt and Bλ,t . I use the notation Eν to denote expectations of functions of Zt
taken with respect to the ν-distribution. The t subscript on Zt will be omitted when not
essential for clarity.
        Assumptions (1) and (2) define Ct as a mixed jump-diffusion process. The diffusion term
µCt− dt + σCt− dBt represents the behavior of consumption in normal times, and implies
that, when no disaster takes place, log consumption growth over an interval ∆t is normally
distributed with mean (µ− 12 σ 2 )∆t and variance σ 2 ∆t. Disasters are captured by the Poisson
process Nt , which allows for large instantaneous changes (“jumps”) in Ct . Roughly speaking,
λt can be thought of as the disaster probability over the course of the next year.3 In what
    2
        In what follows, all processes will be right continuous with left limits. Given a process xt , the notation
xt− will denote lims↑t xs , while xt denotes lims↓t xs .
   3
     More precisely, the probability of k jumps over the course of a short interval ∆t is approximately equal
                   k
to e−λt ∆t (λtk!
              ∆t)
                  , where t will be measured in units of years. In the calibrations that follow, the average
value of λt will be 0.0355, implying a 0.0249 probability of a single jump over the course of a year, a 0.00044
probability of two jumps, and so forth.


                                                          5
follows, I will refer to λt either as the disaster intensity or the disaster probability depending
on the context; these terms should be understood to have the same meaning. The instanta-
neous change in log consumption, should a disaster occur, is given by Zt . Because the focus
of the paper is on disasters, Zt will be assumed to be negative throughout.
      In the model, a disaster is therefore a large negative shock to consumption. The model is
silent on the reason for such a decline in economic activity; examples include a fundamental
change in government policy, a war, a financial crisis and a natural disaster. Given this
paper’s focus on time-variation in the likelihood of a disaster, it is probably most realistic
to think of the disaster as caused by human beings (namely, the first three examples given
above, rather than a natural disaster). The recent financial crisis in the United States
illustrates such time-variation: Following the series of events in the fall of 2008, there was
much discussion of a second Great Depression, brought on by a freeze in the financial system.
The conditional probability of a disaster seemed higher, say, than in 2006.
      As Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) discuss, the solution to (2) has a stationary distri-
bution provided that κ > 0 and λ̄ > 0. This stationary distribution is Gamma with shape
parameter 2κλ̄/σλ2 and scale parameter σλ2 /(2κ). If 2κλ̄ > σλ2 , the Feller condition4 is sat-
isfied, implying a finite density at zero. The top panel of Figure 1 shows the probability
density function corresponding to the stationary distribution. The bottom panel shows the
probability that λt exceeds x as a function of x (the y-axis uses a log scale). That is, the
panel shows the difference between 1 and the cumulative distribution function for λt . As this
figure shows, the stationary distribution of λt is highly skewed. The skewness arises from
the square root term multiplying the Brownian shock in (2): This square root term implies
that high realizations of λt make the process more volatile, and thus further high realiza-
tions more likely than they would be under a standard auto-regressive process. The model
therefore implies that there are times when “rare” disasters can occur with high probability,
but that these times are themselves unusual.
      I assume the continuous-time analogue of the utility function defined by Epstein and
  4
      from Feller (1951)


                                                6
Zin (1989) and Weil (1990), that generalizes power utility to allow for preferences over the
timing of the resolution of uncertainty. The continuous-time version is formulated by Duffie
and Epstein (1992); I make use of a limiting case of their model that sets the parameter
associated with the intertemporal elasticity of substitution equal to one. Define the utility
function Vt for the representative agent using the following recursion:
                                                    Z   ∞
                                          Vt = Et           f (Cs , Vs ) ds,                              (3)

Note that Vt represents continuation utility, i.e. utility of the future consumption stream.
The parameter β is the rate of time preference. I follow common practice in interpreting γ
as relative risk aversion. As γ approaches one, (4) can be shown to be ordinally equivalent
to logarithmic utility. I assume throughout that β > 0 and γ > 0. Most of the discussion
will focus on the case of γ > 1.


2.2        The value function and the riskfree rate

Let W denote the wealth of the representative agent and J(W, λ) the value function. In
equilibrium, it must be the case that J(Wt , λt ) = Vt . Conjecture that the price-dividend
ratio for the consumption claim is constant. Namely, let St denote the value of a claim to
aggregate consumption, then
                                                    St
                                                       = l.                                               (5)
                                                    Ct
for some constant l.5 The process for consumption and the conjecture (5) imply that St
satisfies
                              dSt = µSt− dt + σSt− dBt + (eZt − 1)St− dNt .                               (6)

Let rt denote the instantaneous riskfree rate.
   5
       Indeed, the fact that St /Ct is constant (and equal to 1/β) arises from the assumption of unit EIS, and
is independent of the details of the model (see, e.g., Weil (1990)).


                                                        7
   To solve for the value function, consider the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for an
investor who allocates wealth between St and the riskfree asset. Let αt be the fraction
of wealth in the risky asset St , and (with some abuse of notation), let Ct be the agent’s
consumption. Wealth follows the process

    dWt = Wt− αt (µ − rt + l−1 ) + Wt− rt − Ct− dt + Wt− αt σ dBt + αt (eZt − 1)Wt− dNt .
                                               


At the optimum, the instantaneous expected change in the value function, plus flow utility
must equal zero (Duffie and Epstein (1992)). That is, optimal consumption and portfolio
choice must satisfy the equation:

where Ji denotes the first derivative of J with respect to variable i, for i equal to λ or W , and
Jij the second derivative of J with respect to i and j. Note that the instantaneous return
on wealth invested in the risky asset is determined by the dividend yield l−1 as well as by
the change in price. Note also that the instantaneous expected change in the value function
is given by the continuous drift plus the expected change due to jumps.
   As Appendix A.1 shows, the form of the value function and the envelope condition
fC = JW imply that that the wealth-consumption ratio l = β −1 . Moreover, the value
function takes the form
                                                  W 1−γ

It follows from (11) that, for γ > 1, b > 0.6 Therefore, by (8), an increase in disaster risk
reduces utility for the representative agent. As Section 2.4 shows, the price of the dividend
claim falls when the disaster probability rises. The agent requires compensation for this
risk (because utility is recursive, marginal utility depends on the value function), and thus
time-varying disaster risk increases the equity premium.

                           rt = β + µ − γσ 2 + λt Eν e−γZ eZ − 1 .
                                                               
                                                                                            (12)

                                 standard model             disaster risk

The term above the first bracket in (12) is the same as in the standard model without
disaster risk; β represents the reflects the role of discounting, µ intertemporal smoothing
and γ precautionary savings. The term multiplying λt in (12) arises from the risk of a
disaster. Because eZ < 1, the riskfree rate is decreasing in λ. An increase in the probability
of a rare disaster increases the representative agent’s desire to save, and thus lowers the
riskfree rate. The greater is risk aversion, the greater is this effect.


2.3       Risk of default

Disasters often coincide with at least a partial default on government securities. This point
is of empirical relevance if one tries to match the behavior of the riskfree asset to the rate
of return on government securities in the data. I therefore allow for partial default on
government debt, and consider the rate of return on this defaultable security. I assume that,
in the event of disaster, there will be a default on government liabilities with probability q.
I follow Barro (2006) in assuming that in the event of default, the percent loss is equal to
the percent fall in consumption.
      Specifically, let rtL denote the interest rate that investors would receive if default does
not occur. As shown in Appendix A.5, the equilibrium relation between rtL and rt is

                                  rtL = rt + λt qEν e−γZt 1 − eZ .
                                                               
                                                                                            (13)

      Note that κ > 0 and β > 0 are standing assumptions.


                                                    9
Let rb denote the instantaneous expected return on government debt. Then rtb = rtL +
            
λt qEν eZ − 1 , so
                         rtb = rt + λt qEν (e−γZt − 1) 1 − eZ .
                                                            
                                                                                (14)

The second term in (14) has the interpretation of a disaster risk premium: the percent
change in marginal utility is multiplied by the percent loss on the asset. An analogous term
will appear in the expression for the equity premium below. Figure 3 shows the face value
of government debt, rtL , the instantaneous expected return on government debt rtb and the
riskfree rate rt as a function of λt . Because of the required compensation for default, rtL
lies above rt . The expected return lies between the two because the actual cash flow that
investors receive from the government bill will be below rtL if default occurs.
   All three rates decrease in λt because, at these parameter values, a higher λt induces a
greater desire to save. However, rtL and rtb are less sensitive to changes in λ than rt because
of an opposing effect: the greater is λt , the greater is the risk of default, and therefore the
greater the return investors demand for holding the government bill. Because of a small cash
flow effect, rtb decreases more than rtL , but still less than rt .


2.4     The dividend claim

This section describes prices and expected returns on the aggregate stock market. Let Dt
denote the dividend. I model dividends as levered consumption, i.e. Dt = Ctφ as in Abel
(1999) and Campbell (2003). Ito’s Lemma implies
                             dDt
                                 = µD dt + φσ dBt + (eφZt − 1) dNt ,                       (15)
                             Dt−
where µD = φµ + 21 φ(φ − 1)σ 2 . For φ > 1, dividends fall by more than consumption in the
event of a disaster. This is consistent with the U.S. experience (for which accurate data on
dividends are available) as discussed in Longstaff and Piazzesi (2004).
   While dividends and consumption are driven by the same shocks, (15) does allow divi-
dends and consumption to wander arbitrarily far from one another. This could be avoided
by modeling the consumption-dividend ratio as a stationary but persistent process, as in,

                                                  10
e.g. Lettau and Ludvigson (2005), Longstaff and Piazzesi (2004) and Menzly, Santos, and
Veronesi (2004). In order to focus on the novel implications of time-varying disaster risk, I
do not take this route here.
   It is convenient to price the claim to aggregate dividends by first calculating the state-
price density. Unlike the case of time-additive utility, the case of recursive utility implies
that the state-price density depends on the value function. In particular, Duffie and Skiadas
(1994) show that the state-price density πt is equal to
                                     Z     t                   
                          πt = exp              fV (Cs , Vs ) ds fC (Ct , Vt ),            (16)

where fC and fV denote derivatives of f with respect to the first and second argument
respectively.
   Let Ft = F (Dt , λt ) denote the price of the claim to future dividends. Absence of arbitrage
then implies that Ft is the integral of future dividend flow, discounted using the state-price
density:

Define a function representing a single term in this integral:
                                                                            

                                H(Dt , λt , s − t) = Et                    Ds .
                                                                        πt

Then
                                                  Z    ∞
                               F (Dt , λt ) =              H(Dt , λt , τ ) dτ.

The function H(Dt , λt , τ ) has an interpretation: It is the price today of a claim to the
dividend paid τ years in the future. Appendix A.3 shows that H takes a simple exponential

Appendix A.3 discusses further properties of interest, such as existence, sign and convergence
as τ approaches infinity. In particular, for φ > 1, aφ (τ ) and bφ (τ ) are well-defined for all
values of τ . Moreover, bφ (τ ) is negative. The sign of bφ (τ ) is of particular importance for
the model’s empirical implications. Negative bφ (τ ) implies that when risk premia are high
(namely when disaster risk is high), valuations are low. Thus the price-dividend ratio (which
is F (D, λ, τ ) divided by the aggregate dividend D) predicts realized excess returns with a
negative sign.
   The fact that higher risk premia go along with lower prices would seem like a natural
implication of the model. After all, don’t higher risk premia imply higher discount rates,
and don’t higher discount rates imply lower prices? The problem with this argument is
that it ignores the effect of disaster risk on the riskfree rate. As shown in Section 2.2, higher
disaster risk implies a lower riskfree rate. As is true more generally for dynamic models of the
price-dividend ratio (Campbell and Shiller (1988)), the net effect depends on the interplay of
three forces: the effect of the disaster risk on risk premia, on the riskfree rate and on future
cash flows. A precise form of this statement is given in Section 2.6.
   The result that bφ (τ ) is negative implies that, indeed, the risk premium and cash flow
effect dominate the riskfree rate effect. Thus the price-dividend ratio will predict excess
returns with the correct sign. Appendix A.3 shows that this is true in general for reasonable
values of the parameters, namely for φ > 1. Section 2.7 contrasts this result with what holds
in a dynamic model with power utility.

                                               12
       The results in this section also suggest the following testable implications: Stock market
valuations should fall when the risk of a rare disaster rises. The risk of a rare disaster
is unobservable, but, given a comprehensive data set, one can draw conclusions based on
disasters that have actually occurred. This is important because it establishes independent
evidence for the mechanism in the model.
       Specifically, Barro and Ursua (2009) address the question: Given a large decline in the
stock market, how much more likely is a decline in consumption than otherwise? Barro
and Ursua augment the data set of Barro and Ursua (2008) with data on national stock
markets. They look at cumulative multi-year returns on stocks that coincide with macroeco-
nomic contractions. Their sample has 30 countries and 3037 annual observations; there are
232 stock-market crashes (defined as cumulative returns of -25%) and 100 macroeconomic
contractions (defined as the average of the decline in consumption and in GDP). There is
a 3.8% chance of moving from “normalcy” into a state with a contraction of 10% or more.
This number falls to 1%, if one conditions on a lack of a stock market crash. If one considers
major depressions (defined as a decline in fundamentals of 25% or more), there is a 0.89%
chance of moving from normalcy into a depression. Conditioning on no stock market crash
reduces the probability to 0.07%.
       Also closely related is recent work by Berkman, Jacobsen, and Lee (2010), who study
the correlation between political crises and stock returns. Berkman et al. make use of the
International Crisis Behavior (ICB) database, a detailed database of international political
crises occurring during the period 1918–2006. Rather than dating the start of a crisis with
a military action itself, the database identifies a start of a crisis with with a change in the
probability of a threat.7 A regression of the return on the world market on the number of
such crises in a given month yields a coefficient that is negative and statistically significant.
Results are particularly strong for the starting year of a crisis, for violent crises, and for crises
rated as most severe. The authors also find a statistically significant effect on valuations:
   7
       See Berkman et al. for a discussion of the prior empirical literature on the relation between political
instability and stock market returns.



                                                       13
the correlation between the number of crises and the earnings-price ratio on the S&P 500
is positive and statistically significant, as is the correlation between the crisis severity index
and the earnings-price ratio. Similar results hold for the dividend yield.
   Comparing the results in this section and in Section 2.2 indicate that both the riskfree
rate and the price-dividend ratio are driven by the disaster probability λt ; this follows from
the fact that there is a single state variable. This perfect correlation could be broken by
assuming that consumption is subject to two types of disaster, each with its own time-varying
intensity, and further assuming that one type has a stronger effect on dividends (as modeled
through high φ) than the other. The real interest rate and the price-dividend ratio would
be correlated with both intensities, but to different degrees, and thus would not be perfectly
correlated with one another. The correlation between nominal rates and the price-dividend
ratio could be further reduced by introducing a third type of consumption disaster. The
three types could differ across two dimensions: the impact on dividends and the impact on
expected inflation. The expected inflation process would affect the prices of nominal bonds
but would not (directly) affect stocks. I conjecture that the generalized model could be
constructed to be as tractable as the present one.


2.5    The equity premium

The equity premium arises from the co-movement of the agent’s marginal utility with the
price process for stocks. There are two sources of this co-movement: Co-movement during
normal times (diffusion risk), and co-movement in times of disaster (jump risk). Ito’s Lemma
implies that F satisfies the following:
                       dFt
                           = µF,t dt + σF,t [dBt dBλ,t ]> + (eφZ − 1) dNt ,                  (21)
                       Ft−
for processes µF,t and σF,t . It is helpful to define notation for the price dividend ratio. Let

                              G(λ) =        exp {aφ (τ ) + bφ (τ )λ} dτ.                     (22)

Then rte can be understood to be the instantaneous return on equities.8 The instantaneous
equity premium is therefore rte − rt .
       Appendix A.4 shows that the equity premium can be written as

                                                >

The first term represents the portion of the equity premium that is compensation for diffusion
risk (which includes time-varying λt ). The second term is the compensation for jump risk.
While the diffusion term represents the co-movement between the state-price density and
prices during normal times, the jump risk term shows the co-movement between the state-
price density and prices during disasters. That is,

       The first term in (26)) is the percentage drift in prices, the second term is the instantaneous dividend
yield, and the third term is the expected decline in prices in the event of a disaster. The first plus the third
term constitutes the expected percentage change in prices.

The first and third terms are analogous to expressions in Barro (2006): the first term is
the equity premium in the standard model with normally distributed consumption growth,
while the third term arises from the (static) risk of a disaster. The second term is new
to the dynamic model. This is the risk premium due to time variation in disaster risk.
Because bφ is negative, G0 is also negative. Moreover, b is positive, so this term represents a
positive contribution to the equity premium. Because both the second and the third terms
are positive, an increase in the risk of rare disaster increases the equity premium.9
         The instantaneous equity premium relative to the government bill rate is equal to (28)
minus the default premium rtb − rt (given in (14)):

                               G0 2

The last term in (30) takes the usual form for the disaster risk premium: the percent change in
marginal utility is multiplied by the percent loss. Here, with probability q, the expected loss
on equity relative to bonds is reduced because both assets perform poorly. This instantaneous
equity premium is shown in Figure 4 (solid line). The difference between the dashed line and
the solid line represents the component of the equity premium that is new to the dynamic
model, and shows that this term is large. The dotted line represents the equity premium
in the standard diffusion model without disaster risk and is negligible compared with the
disaster risk component. Figure 4 shows that the equity premium is increasing with the
disaster risk probability.
         Equation (30) and Figure 4 show that the return required for holding equity increases
with the probability of a disaster. How does it depend on a more traditional measure of
risk, namely the equity volatility? When there is no disaster, instantaneous volatility can be
     9
         Also of interest is the equity premium conditional on no disasters, which is equal to (28) less the
component due to jumps in the realized return (see Equation 26). This conditional equity premium is given
by

Figure 5 shows that volatility is an increasing and concave function of the disaster probability.
When the probability of a disaster is close to zero, the variance in the disaster probability
is also very small. Thus the volatility is close to that of the dividend claim in non-disaster
periods (φσ). As the risk of a rare disaster increases, so does the volatility of the disaster
process. The increase in risk rises (approximately) with the square root of λ. Because the
equity price falls when the disaster probability increases, the model is consistent with the
“leverage effect” found by Black (1976), Schwert (1989) and Nelson (1991).
   The above equations show that an increase in the equity premium is accompanied by an
increase in volatility. The net effect of a change in λ on the Sharpe ratio (the equity premium
divided by the volatility) is shown in Figure 6. Bad times, interpreted in this model as times
with high probability of disaster, are times when the investors demand a higher risk-return
tradeoff than usual. Harvey (1989) and subsequent papers report empirical evidence that
the Sharpe ratio indeed varies countercyclically. Like the model of Campbell and Cochrane
(1999), this model is consistent with this evidence.
   The time-varying disaster risk model generates a countercyclical Sharpe ratio through
two mechanisms. First, the value function varies with λt : when disaster risk is high, investors
require a greater return on all assets with prices negatively correlated with λ. The component
of the equity premium associated with time-varying λt thus rises linearly with λ while the
volatility rises only with the square root. Second, the component of the equity premium
corresponding to disaster risk itself (the last term in (30)) has no counterpart in volatility.
This term compensates equity investors for negative events that are not captured by the
standard deviation of returns.

2.6        Zero-coupon equity

In order to understand the dynamics of the price-dividend ratio, it is helpful to think of the
aggregate as being composed of components that pay a dividend at a specific point in time,
namely, zero-coupon equity.
       Recall that
                                   H(Dt , λt , T − t) = exp {aφ (τ ) + bφ (τ )λt } Dt

is the time-t price of the claim that pays the aggregate dividend at time t + τ . Appendix A.3
shows that the risk premium on the zero-coupon claim with maturity τ is equal to

                      e,(τ )
                               − rt = φγσ 2 − λt σλ2 bφ (τ )b + λt Eν (e−γZ − 1)(1 − eφZ ) .
                                                                                         
                     rt                                                                                       (31)

Like the equity premium, the risk premium on zero-coupon equity is positive and increasing
in λt .
       Zero-coupon equity can help answer the question of why the price-dividend ratio on the
aggregate market is decreasing in λt . Because bφ (0) = 0, the question can be restated as:
why is b0φ (τ ) negative for small values of τ ?10 The differential equation for bφ (τ ) is given by
(A.27). Evaluating at zero yields:

  b0φ (0) = Eν e(φ−γ)Z − e(1−γ)Z

                                                                                                                .

                          riskfree rate               equity premium              expected future dividends

Equation (32) shows that the change in bφ (τ ) can be written in terms of risk premium, riskfree
rate and cash flow effects. The first term multiplies λt in the equation for the riskfree rate
(12). The second term multiplies λt in the equation for the risk premium (31) in the limit
as τ approaches zero. The third term represents the effect of change in λt on expected
future dividends: eφZ − 1 is the percent change in dividends in the event of a disaster. The
  10
       This restatement relies on the fact that bφ (τ ) is monotonically decreasing. It is, because as τ increases,
e−ζφ τ falls and 1 − e−ζφ τ rises. The numerator of (19) therefore rises. In the denominator, the term
(ζφ + bσλ2 − κ) 1 − e−ζφ τ rises, and so the denominator falls in absolute value.

terms corresponding to the riskfree rate and the risk premium enter with negative signs,
because higher discount rates reduce the price. Expected future dividend growth enters
with a positive sign because higher expected cash flows raise the price. Indeed, the term
corresponding to the equity premium and to expected future dividends together exceed that
of the riskfree rate when φ > 1.
      As explained in the paragraph above, understanding b0φ (τ ) for low values of τ is sufficient
for understanding why the price-dividend ratio is a decreasing function of λt . However, it
is also instructive to decompose b0φ (τ ) for general values of τ . At longer maturities, it is
possible for λt to change before the claim matures. Thus there are additional terms that
account for the effect of future changes in λt :


  b0φ (τ ) = − Eν e−γZ (eZ − 1) − −bσλ2 bφ (τ ) + Eν (e−γZ − 1)(1 − eφZ )

                                    expected future dividends       Jensen’s inequality       mean-reversion

The first three terms in this more general decomposition are analogous to those in the simpler
(32). The final two terms account for the effect of future changes in λt . The first of these is
a Jensen’s inequality term; all else equal, more volatility in the state variable increases the
price-dividend ratio. The second of these represents the fact that, if λt is high in the present,
λt is likely to decrease in the future on account of mean reversion.
      While the focus of this paper is on the aggregate market, it is also of interest to com-
pare the model’s implications for zero-coupon equity to the behavior of these claims in the
data.11 Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2011) use option price data to calculate prices and
risk premia on zero-coupon equity. Their methods are able to establish prices for dividend
claims that have variable maturities of less than two years. They find that these claims
have expected excess returns that are statistically different from zero. In other words, the
equity premium arises at least in part from the short-term portion of the dividend stream.
 11
      A related issue is the behavior of zero-coupon bonds. Bonds are described in detail in Appendix B.



                                                     19
Binsbergen et al. argue that this evidence is contrary to the implications of some leading
asset pricing models such as Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
In these models, the claim to dividends in the very near future has a premium close to zero;
the equity premium arises from dividends paid in the far future.
       In contrast, the present model implies a substantial equity premium for the short-term
claim, and thus is consistent with the empirical evidence. Figure 7 shows risk premia (31)
as a function of maturity. While the equity premium is increasing in maturity (that is, the
“term structure of equities” is upward-sloping), the intercept of the graph is not at zero but
rather at 5.5%. The reason is that a major source of the equity premium is disaster risk
itself. Equities of all maturities have equal exposure to this risk, and thus even equities with
short maturities have substantial risk premia, as the data imply.12


2.7        Comparison with power utility

To understand the role played by the recursive utility assumption, it is instructive to consider
the properties of a model with time-varying disaster risk and time-additive utility.13 Consider
a model with identical dynamics of consumption and dividends, but where utility is given
by
                                                       ∞

  12
       van Binsbergen et al. also show that, in their sample, short-maturity equity has a higher risk premium
than the aggregate equity claim. While the model predicts that short-maturity equity has a lower risk
premium, the data finding is not statistically significant, and the predictions of the model appear to be well
within the standard errors that van Binsbergen et al. calculate.
  13
     Gourio (2008b) also shows analytically that the power utility model cannot replicate the predictability
evidence.

It is useful to contrast (36) with its counterpart in the recursive utility model. Under recursive
utility, bφ (τ ) is negative for φ > 1, implying that the price-dividend ratio is decreasing in
λt . For power utility, bφ (τ ) is negative only if φ > γ; otherwise it is positive.14 Under the
reasonable assumption that φ is less than γ, the power utility model makes the counterfactual
prediction that price-dividend ratios predict excess returns with a positive sign.15
       What accounts for the difference between the power utility model and the recursive utility
model? The answer lies in the behavior of the riskfree rate. Comparing (33) with (12) reveals
that the riskfree rate under power utility falls more in response to an increase in disaster risk
  14
     For φ > γ, the numerator of (36) is positive, and ζp,φ > κ, so 2ζp,φ > ζp,φ − κ > (ζp,φ − κ)(1 − e−ζp,φ τ )

and the denominator is negative. For φ < γ, it is necessary to also assume that κ2 > 2Eν e(φ−γ)Z − 1 σλ2 .
                                                   
The numerator is negative because Eν e(φ−γ)Z − 1 > 0. The denominator is also negative because κ > ζp,φ .

     Gabaix (2008a) solves a model with disaster risk and power utility assuming linearity generating processes
for consumption and dividends. While the theoretical model that Gabaix proposes allows for a time-varying
probability of rare disasters, the disaster probability is assumed to be constant in the calibration and dy-
namics are generated by changing the degree to which dividends respond to a consumption disaster. As
this discussion shows, incorporating time-varying probabilities into Gabaix’s calibrated model would likely
reduce the model’s ability to match the data.

than under recursive utility with EIS equal to 1. In the power utility model, the riskfree rate
effect exceeds the combination of the equity premium and cash flow effect, and, as a result,
the price-dividend ratio increases with disaster risk.16



3        Calibration and Simulation

3.1        Calibration

3.1.1       Distribution of consumption declines

The distribution of the percentage decline, 1 − eZ is taken directly from the data . That
is, 1 − eZ is assumed to have a multinomial distribution, with outcomes given by actual
consumption declines in the data. I use the distribution of consumption declines found
by Barro and Ursua (2008). Barro and Ursua update the original cross-country dataset of
Maddison (2003) used by Barro (2006). The Maddison data consists of declines in GDP;
Barro and Ursua correct errors and fill in gaps in Maddison’s GDP data, as well as construct
an analogous dataset of consumption declines. I calibrate to the consumption data because
it is a more appropriate match to consumption in the model than is GDP. However, results
obtained from GDP data are very similar. The frequency of large consumption declines
implies an average disaster probability, λ̄ of 3.55%.17
       The distribution of consumption declines in Panel A comes from data on 22 countries
from 1870 to 2006. One possible concern about the data is the relevance of this group for the
United States. For this reason, Barro and Ursua (2008) also consider the disaster distribution
  16
       As in the recursive utility model, examining b0p,φ (0) allows a precise statement of these trade-offs. For
power utility:

            b0p,φ (0)   = Eν e(φ−γ)Z − 1

                        = − Eν e−γZ − 1 − Eν (e−γZ − 1)(1 − eφZ ) +       Eν eφZ − 1

    I follow Barro and Ursua in using a 10% cut-off to identify large consumption declines.

for a subset consisting of developed economies. For convenience, I follow Barro and Ursua
and refer to these as “OECD countries.”18 The distribution of consumption declines in these
countries is given in Panel B. There are fewer of these crises; the implied average disaster
probability is 2.86%. However, eliminating the non-OECD crises in effect eliminates many
comparatively minor crises (generally occurring after World War II). The overall distribution
is shifted toward the more serious crises. In what follows, I use the distribution in Panel A
for the base calibration, while the implications of the distribution in Panel B are explored
in Section 3.4.


3.1.2      Other parameters

Table 1 describes model parameters other than the disaster distribution described above.
Results are compared with quarterly U.S. data beginning in 1947 and ending in the first
quarter of 2010. Equities are constructed using the CRSP value-weighted index, while the
riskfree rate moments are constructed from real returns on the three-month Treasury Bill).
Postwar data are chosen as the comparison point in order to provide a clean comparison to
moments of the model that are calculated conditional on no disasters having occurred. Two
types of moments are simulated from the model. The first type (referred to as “population”
in the tables) are calculated based on all years in the simulation. The second type (referred
to as “conditional” in the tables) are calculated after first eliminating years in which one or
more disasters took place.19
       In the model, time is measured in units of years and parameter values should be inter-
preted accordingly. The drift rate µ is calibrated so that in normal periods, the expected
  18
       The overlap with the actual founding members of what is now known as the OECD is not exact. The
seventeen countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K and U.S. The remaining five countries are
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Taiwan.
  19
     For calculations done over consecutive years, relevant periods are omitted. For example, for evaluating
predictability over 10-year horizons, 10 year periods of the simulation with a disaster are omitted.




                                                     23
growth rate of log consumption is 2.5% per annum.20 The standard deviation of log con-
sumption σ is 2% per annum. These parameters are chosen as in Barro (2006) to match
postwar data in G7 countries. The probability of default given disaster, q, is set equal to
0.4, calculated by Barro based on data for 35 countries over the period 1900–2000.
      Barro and Ursua (2008) consider values of risk aversion equal to 3 and 3.5; because the
dynamic nature of the present model leads to a higher risk premium, I use risk aversion equal
to 3. Given these parameter choices, a rate of time preference (β) equal to 1.2% per annum
matches the average real return on the three-month Treasury Bill in postwar U.S. data.
      Leverage, φ, is set equal to 2.6; this is a conservative value by the standards of the prior
literature. For example, the model of Bansal and Yaron (2004) uses leverage parameters of
3 and 5. The ratio of dividend to consumption volatility in postwar U.S. data is 4.9. In
the present model, φ has implications for the response of dividends to a disaster, relative
to consumption. For example, if consumption falls by 40%, dividends fall by 1 − 0.62.6 =
74%. Is this reasonable? For many countries and events in the Barro and Ursua data
set, accurate dividend and earnings information is difficult to come by. However, data on
corporate earnings are available for the Great Depression, as described by Longstaff and
Piazzesi (2004), who argue that earnings may be a better proxy for economic dividends
due to artificial dividend smoothing. Longstaff and Piazzesi report that in the first year of
the Great Depression, when consumption fell by 10%, corporate earnings fell by more than
103%. In their calibration, they adopt a more conservative assumption: for a 10% decline
in consumption, earnings fall by 90%. This is consistent with a leverage parameter of 22.
However, the Longstaff and Piazzesi calibration assumes that the consumption-dividend ratio
is stationary; thus not all of the dividend decline is permanent. One approach to this issue
would be to model a stationary consumption-dividend ratio. As argued above, this would
complicate the model significantly, so instead I adopt a relatively conservative value for
leverage along with the simpler assumption that the dividend decline, like the consumption
decline, is permanent.
 20
      The value µ = 2.52% reflects an adjustment for Jensen’s inequality.


                                                     24
       Other novel parameters are (implicitly) the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the
mean reversion of the disaster intensity, κ, and the volatility parameter for the disaster in-
tensity, σλ . The EIS is set equal to 1 for tractability. A number of studies have concluded
that reasonable values for this parameter lie in a range close to one, or slightly lower than 1
(e.g. Vissing-Jørgensen (2002)). Mean reversion κ is chosen to match the annual autocorrela-
tion of the price-dividend ratio in postwar U.S. data. Because λt is the single state variable,
the autocorrelation of price-dividend ratio implied by the model is determined almost en-
tirely by the autocorrelation of λt . Setting κ equal to 0.080 generates an autocorrelation for
the price-dividend ratio equal to 0.92, its value in the data. The volatility parameter σλ is
chosen to be 0.067; as will be discussed below, this generates a reasonable level of volatility
in stock returns. The quantity σλ itself is hard to interpret economically; for this reason the
                           
table also reports σλ E λ1/2 , which is a measure of the annual volatility of λt . This measure
indicates that λt varies (approximately) by 1.14 percentage points a year. That is, when λt
is one standard deviation above its mean, its value is 4.49%.


3.2        Simulation Results

Table 2 describes moments from a simulation of the model as well as moments from postwar
U.S. data. The model is discretized using an Euler approximation (see Glasserman (2004,
Chapter 3)) and simulated at a monthly frequency for 50,000 years; simulating the model
at higher frequencies produces negligible differences in the results.21 First I simulate the
series λt and ∆ log Ct . Given the simulated series λt , the price-dividend ratio is given by
(22) and the yield on government debt, rtL , is given by (13). Equity returns are computed
using the series for the price-dividend ratio and for consumption growth, while bond returns
are computed using (A.41). The resulting series for monthly returns and growth rates in
fundamentals are then compounded to an annual frequency.
       The model can be rejected if it offers unrealistic implications for the mean and volatility
  21
       The discrete-time approximation requires setting λt to equal zero in the square root when it is negative.
However, this occurs in less than 1% of the simulated draws.


                                                        25
of the aggregate market, Treasury bills and consumption and dividend growth as well as for
predictability of stock returns and consumption growth.22 These particular measures have
been the focus of much of the recent asset pricing literature. As I argue below, the model’s
implications are in fact realistic. Table 2 shows that the model generates a realistic equity
premium. In population, the equity premium is 7.6%, while, conditional on no disasters,
the equity premium is 8.9%. In the historical data it is 7.1%. The expected return on the
government bill is 1% in population, 1.36% conditional on no disasters, and 1.34% in the
data. The model predicts equity volatility of 19.9% per annum in population and 17.7%
conditional on no disasters. The observed volatility is 17.7%. The Sharpe ratio is 0.39 in
population, 0.49 conditional on no disasters and 0.40 in the data.
       The model is able to generate reasonable volatility for the stock market without gener-
ating excessive volatility for the government bill or for consumption and dividends. Note
that the parameter values were not explicitly chosen to target a low interest rate volatility.
The volatility of the government bill is 3.8% in population, much of which is due to realized
disasters; it is 2.0% conditional on no disasters. This compares with a volatility of 2.7%
in the data. Given that interest rate volatility in the data arises largely from unexpected
inflation that is not captured by the model, the data volatility should be viewed as an upper
bound on reasonable model volatility.
       The volatilities for consumption and dividends predicted by the model for periods of no
disasters are also below their data counterparts. Conditional on no disasters, consumption
volatility is 2.0%, compared with 1.3% in the data. Dividend volatility is 5.2%, compared
with 6.6% in the data. Including rare disasters in the data simulated from the model has
a large effect on dividend volatility. When the disasters are included, dividend volatility is
16.5%. The difference between the effect of including rare disasters on returns as compared
with the effect on fundamentals is striking. Unlike dividends, returns exhibit a relatively
small difference in volatility when calculated with and without rare disasters: 19.9% versus
  22
       While the calibration approach that I adopt has the advantages of transparency and comparability to
the results of other models, it has the disadvantage that it does not offer a formal test of quantitative success.



                                                       26
17.7%. This is because a large amount of the volatility in returns arises from variation in the
equity premium. Risk premia are equally variable regardless of whether disasters actually
occur in the simulated data or not.
   I next discuss the model’s implications for excess return and consumption predictability.
These moments are not explicit targets of the calibration, but follow naturally given the
model’s properties, as described in Section 2.4. Table 3 reports the results of regressing long-
horizon excess returns (the log return on equity minus the log return on the government bill)
on the price-dividend ratio in simulated data. I calculate this regression for returns measured
over horizons ranging from 1 to 10 years. Table 3 reports results for the entire simulated
data set (“population moments”) for periods in the simulation in which no disasters occur
(“conditional moments”) and for the historical sample.
   Panel A of Table 3 shows population moments from simulated data. The coefficients on
the price-dividend ratio are negative: a high price-dividend ratio corresponds to low disaster
risk and therefore predicts low future expected returns on stocks relative to bonds. The
R2 is 4% at a horizon of 1 year, rising to 26% at a horizon of 10 years. Panel B reports
conditional moments. The conditional R2 s are larger: 13% at a horizon of 1 year, rising to
63% at a horizon of 10 years. The unconditional R2 values are much lower because, when a
disaster occurs, nearly all of the unexpected return is due to the shock to cash flows.
   The data moments are higher than the population values, but, more relevantly, lower
than the conditional values. As demonstrated in a number of studies (e.g. Campbell and
Shiller (1988), Cochrane (1992), Fama and French (1989), Keim and Stambaugh (1986))
and replicated in this sample, high price-dividend ratios predict low excess returns. While
returns exhibit predictability over a wide range of sample periods, the high persistence of
the price-dividend ratio leads sample statistics to be unstable (see, for example, Lettau and
Wachter (2007) for calculations of long-horizon predictability using this data set but for
differing sample periods), and unusually low when calculated over recent years. For this
reason, the R2 statistics in the data should be viewed as an approximate benchmark.
   Another potential source of variation in returns is variation in expected future consump-

                                              27
tion growth. According to the model, a low price-dividend ratio indicates not only that the
equity premium is likely to be high in the future, but also that consumption growth is likely
to be low because of the increased probability of a disaster. However, a number of studies
(e.g. Campbell (2003), Cochrane (1994), Hall (1988), Lettau and Ludvigson (2001)) have
found that consumption growth exhibits little predictability at long horizons, a finding repli-
cated in Panel B of Table 4. It is therefore of interest to quantify the amount of consumption
growth predictability implied by the model.
       Table 4 reports the results of running long-horizon regressions of consumption growth on
the price-dividend ratio in data simulated from the model and in historical data. Panel A
shows the population moments implied by the model. The model does imply some pre-
dictability in consumption growth, but the effect is very small. The R2 values never rise
above 6%, even at long horizons. This predictability arises entirely from the realization of
a rare disaster. When these rare disasters are conditioned out, there is zero predictability
because consumption follows a random walk (in simulated data, the coefficient values are
less than .001 and the R2 values are less than .0001). Thus the model accounts for both
the predictability in long-horizon returns and the absence of predictability in consumption
growth.
       Of possible concern is the dependence of these results on the assumed probability of
default, equal to 0.4. Barro (2006) calculates this value based on the number of times a
disaster results in default, divided by the total number of disasters. However, one might
expect that the default is more likely to occur during the worst disasters. The value 0.4
does not take this correlation into account.23 To evaluate the sensitivity of the results to
  23
       One could extend the model to allow for such a correlation, without affecting tractability. Consider the
current specification of the price process for government liabilities, described in detail in Appendix A.5:

                                                       28
this assumption, I consider a higher probability of default, namely q = 0.6 (keeping all other
parameters the same). This change has the effect of raising the expected rate of return on
government debt to 2.1% (conditional on no disasters), as compared with a value of 1.3%
when 0.4 is used. The bond volatility falls from 2% to 1.4%. Because the government bill
rate is higher, the equity premium relative to the government bill is lower: 8.10% rather
than 8.85%. The Sharpe ratio is lower as well: 0.45 rather than 0.49. The predictability of
excess stock returns is slightly lower under this calibration: R2 values range from 11% to
56%. Other results do not change. Thus, except for the average government bill rate, this
change improves the fit of the model to the data. While the implied average government
bill rate of 2% is slightly higher than the sample average, it is not unreasonable given the
difficulties of measuring the mean for a highly persistent process (alternatively one could
further lower this rate by lowering β; this has very little effect on the other results).
    Other models succeed in matching the mean and volatility of stock returns. Two such
models are those of Bansal and Yaron (2004) and of Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Despite
the fact that all three models can capture these first two unconditional moments of returns,
they generate different implications for other observable quantities. The principle mechanism
in the Bansal-Yaron model is a persistent, time-varying mean of consumption growth. Their
model therefore implies that consumption growth should be predictable at long horizons.
However, it is difficult to see evidence for this in the data (Table 4). Because this model
implies a smaller degree of predictability, and only then in samples in which a disaster
occurs, it is more in line with the data in this respect. The Campbell-Cochrane model is
driven by shocks to consumption growth, and as such implies a perfect correlation between
consumption and stock returns. However, the correlation in the data is very low, and, while
time-aggregation in consumption over longer horizons mitigates this concern, it does not
Replace the latter equation by                    

for some threshold value k. In the absence of more complete data on defaults, and to maintain the simplicity
of the present model, I do not pursue this route here.

eliminate it. The present model implies zero correlation in samples without a disaster.
       This model also imposes different, and arguably more reasonable, requirements on the
utility function of the representative agent. In the main calibration, risk aversion is assumed
to equal 3. In contrast, in the model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), it is assumed to equal
10, while the model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) assumes a time-varying risk aversion,
which equals 35 when the state variable is at its long-run mean. Bansal and Yaron also require
a higher elasticity of intertemporal substitution (1.5 rather than 1); independent evidence
discussed above supports the lower value. While a full comparison of these three models
is outside the scope of this study, it appears that the present model may offer advantages
relative to leading alternative explanations for the high equity premium and the volatility
puzzle.


3.3        Implied disaster probabilities

This section describes the disaster probabilities implied by the historical time series of stock
prices. Equation 22 shows that, in the model, the price-dividend ratio as a strictly decreasing
function of the disaster probability. In principle, given observations on the price-dividend
ratio, one could invert this function to find the values of λt implicit in the historical data.
I follow a slightly modified approach: rather than using the price-dividend ratio itself, I
use price divided by smoothed earnings, as in Shiller (1989, Chap. 26). Dividend payouts
appear to have shifted downwards in the latter part of the sample (Fama and French (2001)).
Because the process assumed for dividends does not allow for this shift, requiring the model
to match the price-dividend ratio in the data could yield misleading results.24 For this
exercise it is particularly useful to have a longer time series. I therefore use data on the
S&P 500, which can be found on Robert Shiller’s website. These data begin in 1880 and are
updated to the present. Because the levels of the price-earnings ratio and the price-dividend
  24
       The predictability of returns and consumption is very similar regardless of which measure is used; thus
the choice of the price-dividend versus the price-earnings ratio has little impact on the results in Tables 3
and 4.

ratio are different, I adjust the level of the series in the data so it is comparable to that in the
model. That is, I subtract the sample mean from the historical time series of the log price-
earnings ratio. Then I add the population mean of the log price-dividend ratio computed
from the simulation of the model. I invert the resulting time series to find the implied values
of λt using (22). A few observations (namely, those corresponding to the highest observed
price-earnings ratios) imply negative values of λt . In these instances, I set λt to zero.
       Figure 8 shows the resulting time series for λt . The peak in the series occurs in 1920,
with a disaster probability of 14%. This year corresponds not only to a recession, but also to
an influenza epidemic. In fact, one of the two U.S. disasters as defined by Barro and Ursua
(2008) occurs at this time. A second peak in the series occurs in 1932 during the Great
Depression, which is the second disaster in U.S. data. The disaster probability was relatively
high in the 1950s, declining in the 1960s, and rising again in the 1970s. The highest postwar
values of the probability occur in the 1980s, corresponding to a period of heightened fears
of a third World War. In contrast, the disaster probability was very low in the 1990s and
early part of this century (rising very slightly with the bursting of the “tech bubble”). The
financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009 coincides with a rapid increase in the probability
of a disaster, from 0 to 5%. In 2010, the probability falls to less than 2%


3.4        Alternative calibrations

Table 5 shows the results of two alternative calibrations of the model. Panel A shows
the results of calibrating the disaster distribution to disasters in OECD countries only, as
described in Section 3.1. This calibration, by focusing on mainly developed economies,
alleviates the concern that the disaster distribution is not applicable to the U.S. Under this
calibration, there are fewer disasters, implying a lower mean of λ̄, namely 2.86%. I keep all
other parameters the same.25 The equity premium conditional on no disasters is 7.83% per
annum, lower than in the base calibration, but still higher than in the data. The average

                                                                                           
       Rather than keeping σλ the same, namely 6.4%, it might seem natural to hold σλ E λ1/2 fixed, and
raise σλ accordingly. However, it is not possible to do this and keep the value function well-defined.


                                                     31
government bill rate is 1.86% per annum, higher than before, but not far from the data
mean of 1.34% per annum. Other quantities, such as return volatility, the Sharpe ratio,
volatility of consumption and dividends and predictability (not shown), the results are also
quite similar. This change makes little difference because, while disasters are less frequent
under the OECD calibration, they are also more severe (see Figure 2).
       A second concern is that the results in this paper assume that the disasters are perma-
nent, rather than allowing for faster growth following a disaster (see Gourio (2008a)). It
would be of interest to consider a model allowing for time-variation in the mean of consump-
tion and dividends along with time-variation in the probability of disaster. Such a change
would significantly complicate the model, so for the present paper I consider a simpler mod-
ification. I consider the OECD above as a starting point, and reduce the percent declines in
consumption by half. This is the fraction of the decline that is, on average, permanent as
estimated by Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2011). That is, I assume that half of
the observed decline is noise, in the sense that it is immediately reversed.26 The results are
given in Panel B. Under these more conservative assumptions, the model can still capture
most of the equity premium and volatility with slightly higher risk aversion, namely with
γ = 6.
       Finally, the results also assume disasters are instantaneous, rather than occurring over
multiple periods (see Constantinides (2008)). Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2011)
estimate and numerically solve a model of multiperiod disasters with recoveries. While they
assume a constant disaster probability, their results provide insight into how multiperiod dis-
asters would effect the calibration in the current paper. Indeed, Nakamura et al. show that
a model with multiperiod disasters can match the equity premium with risk aversion that is
moderately higher than that required by a model with single-period disasters. The mecha-
nism, which is also operative in the present model, is that the agent with recursive utility
  26
       This is a conservative calibration, not only in that it assumes the reversal is instantaneous. Any variation
in the amount of the decline that is reversed, along with uncertainty about the average reversal would increase
the risk of disasters to the agent.



                                                         32
considers future consumption growth to be a source of risk along with current consumption
growth.27



4        Conclusion

This paper has shown that a continuous-time endowment model in which there is time-
varying risk of a rare disaster can explain many features of the aggregate stock market.
Besides explaining the equity premium without assuming a high value of risk aversion, it
can also explain the high level of stock market volatility. The volatility of the government
bill rate remains low because of a tradeoff between an increased desire to save due to an
increase in the disaster probability and a simultaneous increase in the risk of default. The
model therefore offers a novel explanation of volatility in the aggregate stock market that is
consistent with other macroeconomic data. Moreover, the model accounts for economically
significant excess return predictability found in the data, as well as the lack of long-run
consumption growth predictability. Finally, the model can be solved in closed form, allowing
for straightforward computation and for potential extensions. While this paper has focused
on the aggregate stock market, the model could be extended to price additional asset classes,
such as long-term government bonds, options and exchange rates.




  27
       Both multiperiod disasters and recoveries could in principle be introduced in the present framework
without affecting tractability. Allowing, for example, jumps in the drift rate of consumption growth would
imply disasters unfolding over multiple periods. Mean reversion in the drift rate would also imply faster
recoveries following disasters.

For the value function to exist, the term inside the square root in (A.9) must be non-negative.
This places a joint restriction on the severity of disasters, the agent’s risk aversion and rate

of time preference, and the volatility and permanence of shocks to λt . Note also that κ > 0
and β > 0 are standing assumptions that are required for the existence of λt and of the value
function respectively.
       While the presence of two roots in (A.9) suggests multiple possible solutions, a simple
thought experiment reveals that only one of these roots displays reasonable economic prop-
erties. Consider the case of Z identically equal to zero; namely the Poisson process Nt has
positive realizations, but that these have no economic consequence. There are no disasters
in this case and the value function should reduce to its counterpart under the standard
diffusion model. However, the choice of the positive root in (A.9) implies that the represen-
tative agent’s utility is reduced by an increased likelihood of these inconsequential Poisson
realizations. The choice of the negative root does not suffer from this defect.28
       Taking the derivative of (A.1) with respect to portfolio choice α, evaluating at α = 1 and
setting to zero implies

                               µ − rt + l−1 = γσ 2 − λt Eν e−γZ (eZ − 1) .

Because l−1 = β, it follows that the equation for the riskfree rate is given by

A.2       State-price density

Calculation of prices and rates of return in the economy is simplified considerably by mak-
ing use of the state-price density, which determines the equilibrium compensation investors
require for bearing various risks in the economy. As discussed in Section 2.4, the state-price
density is given by

       Two other considerations (perhaps not coincidentally) point toward choosing the negative root. First,
Tauchen (2005) suggests choosing the root such that the solution approaches a well-defined limit as σλ ap-
proaches zero (this holds for the negative root but not the positive root). Second, for the present calibration,
the choice of the negative root is more conservative in that it implies a smaller equity premium and lower
equity volatility than the choice of a positive root.

Because the exponential term in (A.12) is (locally) deterministic, covariances of the state-
price density with fundamentals, and thus risk premia, are determined by the second term,

where (A.17) follows from (12).
       In the event of a disaster, marginal utility (as represented by the state-price density)
jumps upward, as can be seen by the term multiplying the Poisson process in (A.14). This
implies that investors require compensation for bearing disaster risk, not surprisingly. The
first element of (A.15) implies that the standard diffusion risk in consumption is priced; more
interestingly, changes in λt are also priced as reflected by the second element of (A.15).


A.3       Pricing equity claims

Let Ft = F (Dt , λt ) denote the price of the claim to the aggregate dividend. It follows from
the absence of arbitrage that
                                                         Z      ∞           

       To compute the term in (24) multiplying the Poisson shock, note that
                             π t − π t−   fC (Ct , Vt ) − fC (Ct− , Vt− )  C −γ − C −γ

As discussed in Section 2.4, F is an integral of expressions of the form Et                              D
                                                                                                      πt s

convenient to calculate these expectations first, and then calculate F as the integral of
these expectations (since one-dimensional integrals are typically very simple to compute
numerically).
   Let Ht = H(Dt , λt , s − t) denote the price of the asset that pays the aggregate dividend
at time T , namely,
                                                                             

                                        H(Dt , λt , s − t) = Et             Ds .
                                                                         πt
No-arbitrage implies that H(Ds , λs , 0) = Ds and that

                                   πt H(Dt , λt , s − t) = Et [πs H(Ds , λs , 0)] .

That is, πt Ht follows a martingale. Conjecture that

                                  H(Dt , λt , τ ) = Dt exp {aφ (τ ) + bφ (τ )λt } .                              (A.19)

Ito’s Lemma then implies

where si = inf {s : Ns = i} (namely, the time that the ith jump occurs).
   I use (A.21) to derive a differential equation for H. The first step is to compute the

expectation of the jump term 0<si ≤t πsi Hsi − πs−i Hs−i . Note that πt is the product of
a pure diffusion process and Ct−γ , while Ht is the product of a pure diffusion process and
Dt = Ctφ . The pure diffusion processes are not affected by the jump. Therefore,

Under mild regularity conditions analogous to those given in Duffie, Pan, and Singleton
(2000, Proposition 1), the second and the third terms on the right hand side of (A.22)
are martingales. Therefore the first term on the right hand side of (A.22) must also be a
martingale, and it follows that the integrand of this term must equal zero:

Assume conditions sufficient for the existence of λt and Vt (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2). Then
the conditions Z < 0, σλ > 0 and φ > 1 are sufficient for the existence of aφ (τ ) and

bφ (τ ) at all values of τ .30 First, because Z is negative, Eν e(1−γ)Z − e(φ−γ)Z > 0, and
thus the term inside the square root of (A.30) is guaranteed to be positive. Moreover,
ζφ > |bσλ2 − κ| ≥ bσλ2 − κ, implying that the denominator (ζφ + bσλ2 − κ) 1 − e−ζφ τ − 2ζφ is
                                                                                    

strictly negative for all τ . This argument also establishes that bφ (τ ) < 0 for all τ .
       The last discussion shows that bφ (τ ) exists and is negative for all τ . I now show that
bφ (τ ) converges as τ goes to infinity. It follows from (A.29) that

       These functions also exist for the limiting cases of φ = 1, σλ = 0, and Z = 0. If φ = 1, G(λ) equals the
wealth-consumption ratio: bφ (τ ) = 0 and aφ (τ ) = −βτ . If σλ = 0, G(λ) can be shown to converge to its
analogue in a model with constant disaster risk. If Z = 0, the expressions converge to the standard model
with only normal shocks to consumption.

   Finally, let re,(τ ) denote the instantaneous expected return on zero-coupon equity with
maturity τ . Because zero-coupon equity pays only a terminal dividend at maturity, its
instantaneous expected return is simply the drift plus the expected percent change in price
in the event of a disaster:
                                          e,(τ )
                                                   ≡ µH,t + λt Eν eφZ − 1 .

                                         rt

Therefore, it follows from (A.16) and (A.23) that the risk premium is given by

        e,(τ )                 >
                                   − λt Eν e(φ−γ)Z − 1 − (Eν e−γZ − 1 − Eν eφZ − 1 .

      rt         − rt = −σπ,t σH,t

It follows that

A.4    Equity Premium

To derive an expression for the premium on the aggregate market, I first return to the
expression for the price of the dividend claim given in Appendix A.3:

I use this expression to derive a “local” no-arbitrage condition analogous to (A.23). Multi-
plying each side of (A.32) by πt implies

The same equation must hold at any time s > t:

Adding       0

where si = inf {s : Ns = i}. The second and the third terms on the right hand side of (A.37)

The left hand side of (A.39) is the instantaneous equity premium conditional on no disasters
occurring. The instantaneous equity premium in population is given by this quantity, plus
the expected percentage change if a disaster occurs. That is, if rte is defined as

where rtL is the “face value” of government debt (i.e. the amount investors receive if there is
no default), ZL,t is a random variable whose distribution will be described shortly and Nt is
the same Poisson process that drives the consumption process. Assume that, in event of a
disaster, there will be a default on government liabilities with probability q. I follow Barro
(2006) and assume that in the event of default, the percent loss is equal to the percent fall
in consumption. Therefore,

dend” on government liabilities is zero). It follows from the definition of ZL that

B     Prices and returns on long-term bonds

The price at time t of a real, default-free zero-coupon bond maturing at time s > t is given
by Et [πs /πt ]. The steps in Appendix A.3 can be followed to conclude that this price is given

and boundary conditions a0 (τ ) = b0 (τ ) = 0. These correspond to the differential equations
in Appendix A.3, with φ = 0 and µD = 0.
       The fact that long-term bond prices move with the disaster probability, combined with the
fact that changes in the disaster probability are priced in the model, implies that expected
                                                                                           (τ )
returns on long-term bonds differ from the riskfree rate. Specifically, let rt                    denote the
instantaneous expected return on a default-free zero coupon bond with maturity τ . The
same reasoning used to derive (A.31) shows

                                            (τ )
                                           rt − rt = −λt b0 (τ )bσλ2 .                                 (B.3)

Risk premia on default-free bonds arise only from the correlation with the time-varying
probability of a disaster (namely, there is no covariance with shocks to consumption, during
a disaster or otherwise). Intuitively, this risk premium should be negative, because bond
prices rise when interest rates fall, which occurs when disaster risk is high (keeping in mind
that the investor requires a premium to hold assets with prices positively correlated with
disaster risk). Indeed, as I show below, b0 (τ ) is positive for relevant parameter values.
Because b is positive (as shown in Section 2.2) risk premia on bonds are negative and the
real default-free term structure will be downward sloping.
       I now give the solutions to (B.1) and (B.2). Unlike for equities, there are two cases.31
   The difference arises from the fact that the analogue to Eν e−γZ − e(1−γ)Z in the case of equities is

In this case, the solution resembles that of equities. Namely, the solution is given by (18–20),

These functions exist for all τ provided that bσλ2 < κ. If, however, bσλ2 > κ, then there is
some finite τ at which bond prices go to infinity.32
    If bσλ2 > κ, then b0 (τ ) is positive for all τ . This follows from the fact that the numerator
is negative because Eν e−γZ − e(1−γ)Z > 0. Moreover, ζ0 < |bσλ2 − κ| = κ − bσλ2 , so
                                            

ζ0 + bσλ2 − κ < 0, implying that the denominator is also negative. If bσλ2 < κ, then by similar
reasoning, b0 (τ ) is positive for τ less than the maturity at which bond prices become infinite.
Therefore, an increase in the risk of a disaster raises prices of long-term default-free bonds,
not surprisingly, since an increase in the risk of a disaster decreases the riskfree rate.

This case applies for the calibrations given in this paper. Here, the solution takes the form

  32
       Consider the case of bσλ2 − κ < 0. Then ζ0 < κ − bσλ2 . It follows that the denominator in (B.4) is negative
for all τ , and that b0 (τ ) exists for all τ > 0. Now consider bσλ2 − κ > 0. Then ζ0 < bσλ2 − κ. For τ sufficiently
small, the second term in the denominator 2ζ0 exceeds the first term (ζ0 + bσλ2 − κ) 1 − e−ζ0 τ , and so the
                                                                                                      

denominator is negative. As τ approaches infinity, however, the denominator approaches bσλ2 − κ − ζ0 > 0.
Because the denominator is a continuous function, there must exist a τ for which it equals zero.

(where π denotes the geometric constant). Real bond prices therefore become unbounded at
a finite maturity. For the baseline calibration, this occurs at a maturity of 33 years. While
this conclusion may seem extreme, it is useful to remember that even a very small probability
of default would change this result.
       Figure B.1 shows zero-coupon bond yields for λ at zero, at its mean, and at the 90th
percentile, for parameter values given in Table 1. The figure shows that the yield curve
shifts down as the disaster probability shifts up. As mentioned above, the yield curves
are downward sloping because of the negative risk premia on bonds. The slope increases
in magnitude with an increase in the disaster probability. While Treasury yield curves
are upward sloping on average in the data, there are several differences between these yield
curves and the ones in the paper. First, Treasury bonds are subject to inflation risk. Because
inflation might be expected to rise in the event of a disaster, or perhaps with even an increased
probability of disaster, introducing inflation could very well lead to positive risk premia on
nominal bonds. Because inflation is a persistent process, long-term bonds carry greater
exposure to this risk than short-term bonds. This could lead to an upward slope of the term
structure. Second, all government bonds are subject to some risk of default, either through
inflation or outright. Because default could be expected to effect all debt outstanding when
it occurs, long-term bonds would again be exposed to more risk. To summarize, because

       While this solution appears very different from that in (B.7), they can both be expressed in terms of the
hyperbolic tangent.

the main economic force causing very low yields is the protection that bonds offer in very
bad states (when short-term interest rates are low), introducing inflation or default in these
states would significantly change these results.


C     Solution to the power utility model

Consider time-separable utility with
                                                   ∞
                                                              Cs1−γ

The state-price density for this model takes the familiar form

                                           πt = e−βt Ct−γ .                                 (C.1)

Ito’s Lemma implies that the state-price density follows the process

                           = µπ,t dt + σπ,t [dBt dBλ,t ]> + (e−γZ − 1) dNt ,

Risk of changes in the disaster probability are not priced in the power utility model.
    The absence of arbitrage implies

                                 µπ,t = −rt − λt Eν e−γZ − 1 ,

It follows from (C.2) that the riskfree rate under power utility is given by
                                     1
                        rt = β + γµ − γ(γ + 1)σ 2 − λt Eν e−γZ − 1 .

with boundary conditions ap,φ (0) = bp,φ (0) = 0. These ordinary differential equations take
the same form as those in the recursive utility case and therefore have analogous solutions
given in the main text.
   The equity premium for power utility can be computed in the same way as for recursive
utility (see Appendix A.4). The equity premium is given by

                                         >
                       rte − rt = −σπ,t σF,t + λt Eν (e−γZ − 1)(1 − eφZ ) .
                                                                        


Thus the equity premium takes the same general form as under recursive utility. However,
σπ,t is different. Ito’s Lemma implies
                                       h                     p i
                                               0
                              σF,t   = φσ (G (λt )/G(λt )) σλ λt .

Therefore, from (C.3), it follows that

                          rte − rt = φγσ 2 + λt Eν (e−γZ − 1)(1 − eφZ ) .

Notes: The model is simulated at a monthly frequency and simulated data are aggregated
to an annual frequency. Data moments are calculated using overlapping annual observations
constructed from quarterly U.S. data, from 1947 through the first quarter of 2010. With
the exception of the Sharpe ratio, moments are in percentage terms. The second column
reports population moments from simulated data. The third column reports moments from
simulated data that are calculated over years in which a disaster did not occur. The last
column reports annual sample moments. Rb denotes the gross return on the government
bond, Re the gross equity return, ∆c growth in log consumption and ∆d growth in log
dividends.

where ∆ct+i is log growth in aggregate consumption between periods t + i − 1 and t + i
and pt − dt is the log price-dividend ratio on the aggregated market. The time-varying
disaster risk model is simulated at a monthly frequency and simulated data are aggregated
to an annual frequency. Panel A reports population moments from simulated data. Panel B
reports sample moments. The conditional moments, namely the slope coefficient and the R2
calculated over periods in the simulation without disasters, are equal to zero.

Notes: This figure shows average risk premia on zero-coupon equity claims as a function of
maturity. Zero-coupon equity is a claim to the aggregate dividend at a single point in time

riskfree rate. The dotted line shows what risk premia would be if the disaster risk were zero.
The solid line shows risk premia in the model. Risk premia are expressed in annual terms.

Notes: This figure shows the disaster probability λt implied by historical values of the ratio
of the price divided to the previous ten years of earnings for the S&P 500 index. This ratio
is de-meaned and set equal to the price-dividend ratio in the model (also de-meaned). The
disaster probability is found by inverting the equation for the price-dividend ratio; when the
resulting value of λt is negative, it is set to zero. The solid line marks the average value the
disaster probability.
