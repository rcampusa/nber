                                               ABSTRACT

In a very broad class of dynamic linear models, if agents possess knowledge of current endogenous
variables in a least-squares learning process, determinacy of a rational expectations (RE) equilibrium
is sufficient but not necessary for learnability of that equilibrium. Thus, since learnability is an attractive
necessary condition for plausibility of any equilibrium, there may exist a single plausible RE solution
even in cases of indeterminacy. This paper proposes and outlines a distinct criterion that plausible
models should possess, termed "well formulated" (WF), which rules out infinite discontinuities in
the implied impulse response functions. The paper explores the relationship between this WF property
and learnability, under the information assumption mentioned above, and finds that they often agree
but neither strictly implies the other. Extending the P-matrix requirement, implied for specified matrices
by the WF property, to one that demands positive dominant-diagonal matrices would guarantee both
WF and learnability, but a suitable rationale has not been found. Finally, under a second information
assumption, which gives the agents only lagged information on endogenous variables during the learning
process, the situation is less favorable in the sense that learnability can be guaranteed only under special
assumptions.

1. Introduction

         It is almost unnecessary to begin by emphasizing that recent research in monetary policy

analysis has featured a great deal of work concerning conditions for determinacy—i.e., existence

of a unique dynamically stable rational expectations equilibrium—under various specifications

of policy behavior.1 Indeed, there are a number of papers in which determinacy is the only

criterion for a desirable monetary policy regime that is explicitly mentioned.2

         By contrast, I have argued in recent publications (McCallum, 2003a, 2007) that least-

squares (LS) learnability is a compelling necessary condition for a rational expectations (RE)

equilibrium to be considered plausible, since individuals must somehow learn about the exact

nature of an economy from data generated by that economy itself, while the LS learning process

is biased toward a finding of learnability. A similar position has also been expressed by Bullard

(2006, p. 2004). From such a position it follows that in conditions in which there is more than

one dynamically stable RE solution—i.e., indeterminacy—there may still be only one RE

solution that is economically relevant, if the others are not LS learnable. In this sense, LS

learnability is arguably a more important criterion than determinacy.

         It may be useful to expand briefly on the contention that LS learnability is a compelling

necessary condition. The argument begins with the idea that, in actual economies, agents must

ultimately obtain quantitative details concerning their economy, necessary for forming

expectations, from data generated by that economy. Accordingly, the same should be true for the

model economy used by a researcher. There are many conceivable learning processes, of course,

so it would be rash to presume that any single one is relevant. Thus we do not argue that LS

learnability is a sufficient condition for a RE equilibrium to be plausible. But the setup for LS

  See, e.g., Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005). These authors would almost surely include other criteria if explicitly asked.

learnability (see Evans and Honkapohja, 2003) is specified in a way that is, in a sense, biased

towards a finding of learnability. Specifically, it assumes that agents know the correct structure

qualitatively—i.e., know which variables are relevant. In addition, the process assumes that

agents are collecting an ever-increasing number of observations on all relevant variables while

the structure is remaining unchanged. Furthermore, the agents are estimating the relevant

unknown parameters with an appropriate estimator.3 Consequently, it seems, all in all, that if a

proposed RE solution is not learnable by the LS process in question, it is implausible that it could

prevail in practice.

        Substantively, my 2007 paper demonstrates that, in a very wide class of linear RE models,

determinacy implies LS learnability (but not the converse) when individuals have knowledge of

current conditions available for use in the learning process. This strong result does not pertain,

however, if individuals have available, in the learning process, only information regarding

previous values of endogenous variables.4 One task of the present paper, accordingly, is to

investigate the situation that obtains when only lagged information is available. In addition, the

paper will explore results that pertain when an alternative criterion of model plausibility,

provisionally termed “well-formulated,” characterizes the model’s structure. In particular, it is

shown that models that are well formulated, in the defined sense, often (but not invariably)

possess the property of E-stability and hence LS learnability if current-period information is

available in the learning process, even if determinacy does not prevail. Thus plausibility of a RE

solution requires both that it be learnable and that the model at hand be well formulated. A

sufficient condition for both of these to hold, requiring that certain matrices have positive

  A bit of additional discussion of the process is given below in Section 3. Also see Evans and Honkapohja (2001,
pp. 232-238).

  Another limitation of the analysis of McCallum (2007) is that it considers only solutions of a form that excludes
“resonant frequency sunspot” solutions. That limitation, which is maintained here, is discussed briefly in Section 6.

dominant diagonals, is introduced and considered below. Unfortunately, the situation in the case

of lagged information is less favorable—i.e., learnability can be assured only in special cases, for

which no general characterization has been found.

    2. Model and Determinacy

         It will be useful to begin with a summary of the formulation and results developed in

McCallum (2007). Throughout we will work with a model of the form

(1)      yt = A Etyt+1 + C yt-1 + D ut,

where yt is a m×1 vector of endogenous variables, A and C are m×m matrices of real numbers, D

is m×n, and ut is a n×1 vector of exogenous variables generated by a dynamically stable process

(2)      ut = R ut-1 + εt,

with εt a white noise vector. It will not be assumed, even initially, that A is invertible. This

specification is useful in part because it is the one utilized in Section 10.3 of Evans and

Honkapohja (2001), for which E-stability conditions are reported on their p. 238.5 Furthermore,

the specification is very broad; in particular, any model satisfying the formulations of King and

Watson (1998) or Klein (2001), can be written in this form—which will accommodate any

number of lags, expectational leads, and lags of leads. (See Appendix A.)

         Following McCallum (1983, 1998), we consider solutions to model (1)-(2) of the form

(3)      yt = Ω yt-1 + Γ ut.

in which Ω is required to be real. Then we have that Etyt+1 = Ω(Ωyt-1 + Γut) + ΓRut and

straightforward undetermined-coefficient reasoning shows that Ω and Γ must satisfy

(4)      AΩ2 − Ω + C = 0

(5)      Γ = AΩΓ + AΓR + D.

5
Constant terms can be included in the equations of (1) by including an exogenous variable in ut that is a random
walk whose innovation has variance zero. In this case there is a borderline departure from process stability.


                                                         3
For any given Ω, (5) yields a unique Γ generically,6 but there are many m×m matrices that solve

(4) for Ω. Accordingly, the following analysis centers around (4). Since we do not assume that

A is invertible, we write

          A 0 Ω2   I           −C   Ω 
(6)      0 I    =  I                         ,
              Ω                 0   I 

in which the first row reproduces the matrix quadratic (4). Let the 2m×2m matrices on the left

and right sides of (6) be denoted A and C , respectively. Then instead of focusing on the

eigenvalues of A −1 C , which does not exist when A is singular, we instead solve for the

(generalized) eigenvalues of the matrix pencil [ C − λ A ], alternatively termed the (generalized)

eigenvalues of C with respect to A (e.g., Uhlig (1999)). Thus instead of diagonalizing A −1 C ,

as in Blanchard and Khan (1980), we use the Schur generalized decomposition, which serves the

same purpose. Specifically, the Schur generalized decomposition theorem establishes that there

exist unitary matrices Q and Z such that Q C Z = T and Q A Z = S with T and S triangular.7 Then

eigenvalues of the matrix pencil ( C −λ A ) are defined as tii/sii. Some of these eigenvalues may

be “infinite,” in the sense that some sii may equal zero. This will be the case, indeed, whenever

A and therefore A are of less than full rank since then S is also singular. All of the foregoing is

true for any ordering of the eigenvalues and associated columns of Z (and rows of Q). For the

present, let us focus on the arrangement that places the tii/sii in order of decreasing modulus.8

         To begin the analysis, premultiply (6) by Q. Since Q A = SH and Q C = TH, where H ≡

Z-1, the resulting equation can be written as
6
  Generically, I − R’⊗[(I − AΩ)-1A] will be invertible, permitting solution of (5) for vec(Γ). Invertibility of (I − AΩ)
is discussed below in Section 4.
7
  Provided only that there exists some λ for which det[ C − λ A ] ≠ 0. See Klein (2000) or Golub and Van Loan
(1996, p. 377). Note that in McCallum (2007) the matrices A and A are denoted A and A11, repectively.
8
  The discussion proceeds as if none of the tii/sii equals 1.0 exactly. If one does, the model can be adjusted, by
multiplying some relevant coefficient by (e.g.) 0.9999.


                                                           4
         S11 0   H11 H12   Ω 2   T11 0   H11 H12   Ω              
(7)      S S   H H    =  T T   H H                                .

The first row of (7) reduces to

(8)      S11(H11Ω + H12)Ω = T11(H11Ω + H12).

Then if H11 is invertible the latter can be used to solve for Ω as

(9)      Ω = −H11-1 H12 = −Η11−1(−Η11Ζ12Ζ22−1) = Ζ12Ζ22−1,

where the second equality comes from the upper right-hand submatrix of the identity HZ = I,

provided that H11 is invertible, which we assume without significant loss of generality.9 10

         As mentioned above, there are many solutions Ω to (4). These correspond to different

arrangements of the eigenvalues, which result in different groupings of the columns of Z and

therefore different compositions of the submatrices Z12 and Z22. Here, with the eigenvalues tii/sii

arranged in order of decreasing modulus, the diagonal elements of S22 will all be non-zero

provided that S has at least m non-zero eigenvalues, which we assume to be the case.11 Clearly,

for any solution under consideration to be dynamically stable, the eigenvalues of Ω must be

smaller than 1.0 in modulus. In McCallum (2007) it is shown that

(10)     Ω = Z22S22-1T22Z22-1

so Ω has the same eigenvalues as S22-1T22. The latter is triangular, moreover, so the relevant

eigenvalues are the m smallest of the 2m ratios tii/sii (given the decreasing-modulus ordering).

For dynamic stability, the modulus of each of these ratios must then be less than 1. [In many

cases, some of the m smallest moduli will equal zero.]

9
  This invertibility condition, also required by King and Watson (1998) and Klein (2000), obtains except for
degenerate special cases of (1) that can be solved by simpler methods than considered here. Note that the
invertibility of H11 implies the invertibility of Z22, given that Z and H are unitary.
10
   Note that it is not being claimed that all solutions are of the form (9).
11
   From its structure it is obvious that A has at least m nonzero eigenvalues so, since Q and Z are nonsingular, S
must have rank of at least m. This necessary condition is not sufficient for S to have at least m nonzero eigenvalues,
however; hence the assumption.


                                                          5
        Let us henceforth refer to the solution under the decreasing-modulus ordering as the

MOD solution. Now suppose that the MOD solution is stable. For it to be the only stable

solution, there must be no other arrangement of the tii/sii that would result in a Ω matrix with all

eigenvalues smaller in modulus than 1.0. Thus each of the tii/sii for i = 1,…, m must have

modulus greater than 1.0, some perhaps infinite. Is there some m×m matrix whose eigenvalues

relate cleanly to these ratios? Yes, it is the matrix F ≡ (I − AΩ)-1A, which appears frequently in

the analysis of Binder and Pesaran (1995, 1997).12 Regarding this F matrix, it is shown that, for

any ordering such that H11 is invertible, including the MOD ordering, we have the equality

(11)    H11 F H11-1 = T11-1S11,

which implies that F has the same eigenvalues as T11-1S11. In other words, it is the case that the

eigenvalues of F are the same, for any given arrangement of the system’s eigenvalues, as the

inverses of the values of tii/sii for i = 1, …, m. Under the MOD ordering these are the inverses of

the first (largest) m of the eigenvalues of the system’s matrix pencil. Accordingly, for solution

(9) to be the only stable solution, all the eigenvalues of the corresponding F must be smaller than

1.0 in modulus. This result, stated in different ways, is well known from Binder and Pesaran

(1995), King and Watson (1998), and Klein (2000), and is an important generalization of one

result of Blanchard and Khan (1980) for a model with nonsingular A.

        Thus we have established notation for models of form (1)-(2) and have reported results

showing that the existence of a unique stable solution requires that all eigenvalues of the defined

Ω matrix and the corresponding F must be less than 1.0 in modulus. It will be convenient to

express that condition as follows: all λΩ < 1 and all λF < 1.


12
  There is no general proof of invertibility of [I − AΩ], but if AΩ were by chance to have some eigenvalue exactly
equal to 1.0, that condition could be eliminated by making some small adjustment to elements of A or C. Also, see
Section 5 below.

3. E-Stability in Two Cases

       We now turn to conditions for learnability under two different information assumptions.

First we will review the main results from my JEDC paper, which assumes that agents have full

information on current values of endogenous variables during the learning process, and then we

will go on to the second assumption, namely, that only lagged values of endogenous variables

are known during the learning process. The manner in which learning takes place in the Evans-

Honkapohja (E&H) analysis is as follows. Agents are assumed to know the structure of the

economy as specified in equations (1) and (2), in the sense that they know what variables are

included, but do not know the numerical values of the parameters. What they need to know, to

form expectations, is values of the parameters of the solution equations (3). In each period t,

they form forecasts on the basis of least squares regression of the variables in yt-1 on previous

values of yt-2 and any exogenous observables. Given those regression estimates, however,

expectations of yt+1 may be calculated assuming knowledge of yt or, alternatively, assuming that

yt-1 is the most recent observation possessed by agents and thus usable in the forecasting process.

In the former case, the conditions for E-stability reported by E&H (2001, p. 238) are that the

following three matrices must have all eigenvalues with real parts less than 1.0:

(12a) F ≡ (I − AΩ)-1A

(12b) [(I − AΩ)-1C]’ ⊗ F

(12c) R’ ⊗ F.

In the second case, however, the analogous condition (E&H, 2001, p. 245) is that the following

matrices must have all eigenvalues with real parts less than 1.0:

(13a) A(I + Ω)

(13b) Ω’⊗A + I ⊗AΩ



                                                 7
(13c) R’⊗A + I ⊗AΩ.

Except in the case that Ω = 0, which will obtain when C = 0, these conditions are not equivalent to

those in (12).

        It is important to note that use of the first information assumption is not inconsistent with

a model specification in which supply and demand decisions in period t are based on

expectations formed in the past, such as Et-1yt+j or Et-2yt+j. It might also be mentioned

parenthetically that conditions (12) and (13) literally pertain to the E-stability of the model (1)(2)

under the two information assumptions, not its learnability. Under quite broad conditions,

however, E-stability is necessary and sufficient for LS learnability. This near-equivalence is

referred to by E&H as the “E-stability principle” (E&H, 1999, p. 472; 2001, p. 41). Since E-

stability is technically easier to verify, applied analysis typically focuses on it, rather than on

direct exploration of learnability.

        Given the foregoing discussion, it is a simple matter to verify that if a model of form

(1)(2) is determinate, then it satisfies conditions (12). First, determinacy requires that all

eigenvalues of F must have modulus less than 1.0, so their real parts must all be less than 1.0,

thereby satisfying (12a). Second, from equation (4) it can be seen that (I − AΩ)-1C = Ω.

Therefore, matrix (12b) can be written as Ω’ ⊗ F. Furthermore, it is a standard result (Magnus

and Neudecker, 1988, p. 28) that the eigenvalues of a Kronecker product are the products of the

eigenvalues of the relevant matrices (e.g., the eigenvalues of Ω’ ⊗ F are the products λΩλF).

Therefore, condition (12b) holds. Finally, since λF < 1, condition (12c) holds provided that all

λR ≤ 1, which we have assumed by specifying that (2) is dynamically stable.

        Determinacy does not imply learnability, however, under the second information

assumption. This point, which is developed by E&H (2001, pp. 174-181), can be illustrated by



                                                   8
means of a bivariate example.13 Let the yt vector in (1) include two variables, y1t and y2t, related

by the dynamic model that follows:

Then for the MOD solution we have

              −0.01 0.01  0.0218 1.1133      −0.0012 −0.0189 

              0.99 −0.01  −0.095 − 0.774     0.0225   1.1099 

                                                          0.1604                    0.00831
with eigenvalues of Ω being −0.148 and −0.604, while F =                                       , which has
                                                          −9.040                     0.0893 

(complex) eigenvalues 0.1249 ± 0.2717 i. Inspection of these shows that this solution is

determinate, and that conditions (12a) and (12b), relevant for E-stability in the case in which

current information is available during learning, are satisfied. Let us assume R = 0, i.e., white

noise disturbances, for simplicity. Then the determinate RE solution is E-stable and learnable

under the first information assumption.

        But for the case with only lagged information during learning, we need to consider the

eigenvalues of the matrices shown in expressions (13). For (13a), the matrix A(I + Ω) is

 −0.0112      − 0.0089 
1.0125                    whose eigenvalues are −0.0030 and 1.0918. The last of these violates the
                1.0999 

condition for (13a), however, so under the lagged-information assumption the relevant E-

stability condition is not satisfied and the determinate RE equilibrium is not LS learnable.

        This result exemplifies the fact that determinacy is not generally sufficient for learnability

of RE solutions, although it is sufficient under the first information assumption. Of equal

importance, in my opinion, is the fact that determinacy is not necessary for learnability. In

13
  Its specification is close numerically to the qualitative version of the E&H example that is used in McCallum
(2007, pp. 1386-1388).


                                                         9
particular, the MOD solution can be learnable, and be the only learnable solution of form (3), in

cases in which indeterminacy prevails. One such example is given in my JEDC paper on p.

1386.14 In such cases, the position that learnability is necessary for a solution to be plausible

would suggest that there may be no problem implied by the absence of determinacy.15

4. Well-Formulated Models

         In an unpublished working paper (McCallum, 2003b), I have suggested that there is a

distinct and neglected property that dynamic models should possess to be considered “well-

formulated” and plausible for the purpose of economic analysis. To begin the discussion,

consider first the single-variable case of specification (1),

(16)     yt = aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut,

with ut = (1−ρ)η + ρut-1 + wt with ρ < 1 and wt white noise. Thus ut is an exogenous forcing

variable with an unconditional mean of η (assumed nonzero) and units have been chosen so that

there is no constant term. Applying the unconditional expectation operator to (16) yields

(17)     E yt = aEyt+1 + cEyt-1 + η.

In this case yt will be covariance stationary, and we have

(18)     E yt = η/ [1− (a + c)].

But from the latter, it is clear that as a + c approaches 1.0 from above, the unconditional mean of

yt approaches −∞ (assuming without loss of generality that η > 0), whereas if

a + c approaches 1.0 from below, the unconditional mean approaches +∞. Thus there is an

infinite discontinuity at a + c = 1.0. This implies that a tiny change in a + c could alter the

average (i.e., steady state) value Eyt from an arbitrarily large positive number to an arbitrarily

   I take this opportunity to point out that McCallum (2007, p. 1386), errs in stating that when the eigenvalues are …
“30.65, −0.532, −0.123, and 0.000 … both stable solutions are learnable.” Actually, only the MOD solution is
learnable.

   Disregarding, that is, “sunspot” solutions not of form (3).

large negative number. Such a property seems highly implausible and therefore unacceptable for

a well-formulated model.16 The substantive problem is not eliminated, obviously, by adoption of

the zero-measure exclusion a + c ≠ 1.

         In light of the foregoing observation, it is my contention that, to be considered well

formulated (WF), the model at hand needs to include a restriction on its admissible parameter

values; a restriction that rules out a + c = 1, and yet admits a large interval of values that includes

(a, c) = (0, 0). In the case at hand, the appropriate restriction is a + c < 1. Of course, a + c > 1

would serve just as well mathematically to avoid the infinite discontinuity, but it seems clear that

a + c < 1 is vastly more appropriate from an economic perspective since it includes the values (0,

0).17 Since we want this condition to apply to a + c sums between zero and that value that

pertains to the model at hand, our requirement for WF is that a and c satisfy 1 − ε(a + c) > 0 for

all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1. [It should be clear, in addition, that the foregoing argument could be easily

modified to apply to yt processes that are trend stationary, rather than strictly (covariance)

stationary.] It is shown in McCallum (2003b) that under this requirement, plus a second one to

be discussed shortly, the univariate model (16) is invariably E-stable.18

         Next, for the bivariate case of model (1), extension of the foregoing WF property requires

that A and C are such that det[I − ε(A + C)] is positive for all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1; otherwise the steady-

state values of the variables may possess infinite discontinuities. But there are other

requirements as well. Let acij temporarily denote the ijth element of A + C. Then the model

with y1 = Ey1t , y 2 = Ey 2t , η1 = Eu1t, and η2 = Eu2t implies


16
   The model could be formulated with the exogenous variable also written in terms of percent or fractional
deviations from the reference level η, e.g., û t = ut − η. But that would not alter the relationship between Eyt and η,
which can be extremely sensitive to tiny changes in a + c.
17
   In models of the linear form (16), one would expect coefficients a and c typically to represent elasticities and often
to be numerically small relative to 1.
18
   That paper’s analysis of multivariate systems is, however, unsatisfactory.

where ∆ = det[I − (A + C)] = (1−ac11)(1−ac22) − ac12ac21. Then the counterpart of the univariate

requirement that 1 − ε (a+c) > 0 includes the condition ∆ > 0 [for all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1].19 We must

rule out, however, the case in which ∆ > 0 results from 1−εac11 and 1−εac22 both being

negative.20 The condition on ∆ should be extended, therefore, to also require 1−εac11 > 0 and

1−εac22 > 0.

        How are these WF requirements extended to pertain to cases with more than two

variables? It appears that the appropriate requirement is that [I − ε(A+C)] must be a

P-matrix, which by definition has all its principal minors positive and thereby imposes the

conditions discussed for the cases above in which m equals 1 and 2. Other properties of any

P-matrix are that its inverse exists and is itself a P-matrix, and that all its real eigenvalues are

positive.21

        An alternative possibility that is of interest would be to require that [I − ε(A + C)] must

be a positive dominant-diagonal matrix.22 This requirement would have implications for the E-

stability status of the model, as will be discussed below, and positive dominant-diagonal (PDD)

matrices have an important tradition in dynamic economics stemming from the literature on

multimarket stability analysis. This condition is, however, somewhat stronger than is actually

19
   Henceforth the bracketed condition is to be understood wherever relevant.
20
   This is clear for the case in which A + C is a diagonal matrix.
21
   On the topic of P-matrices, see Horn and Johnson (1991) and Gale and Nikaido (1965).
22
   Again, see Horn and Johnson (1991) and Gale and Nikaido (1965).

required by our objective of ruling out specifications in which leading implications of the model

are hyper-sensitive to parameter values.

           As a brief but relevant digression, one example of a matrix that is a P-matrix and yet is

not positive dominant-diagonal is as follows:

            0.08 − 0.92 0.90 
(21)        0.92 0.07 −0.03  .
                              
            −0.72 0.30 0.04 

Clearly, the entries in any row show immediately that this matrix is not positive dominant

diagonal (PDD). But its determinant is 0.3087 and the three second-order minors are 0.0118,

0.651, and 0.852. Since the diagonal elements are also all positive, the matrix is a P-matrix. For

future reference, we note that its eigenvalues are −0.0067 + 1.2319i, −0.0067 − 1.2319i, and

0.2034. Thus the example illustrates the fact that, although a P-matrix cannot have a negative

real eigenvalue, it can have a complex eigenvalue pair with negative real parts.23

            Returning now to the main line of argument, there is a second type of discontinuity that

should also be eliminated for a model to be viewed as WF, namely, infinite discontinuities in its

impulse response functions. In model (1)(2) with solution (3), the impulse response to the shock

vector ut (3) involves the matrix Γ, which is given by

(22)       Γ = AΩΓ + AΓR + D.

 Thus (I − AΩ)Γ = AΓR + D so using F = (I − AΩ)-1A, equation (22) can be written as

(23)       Γ = FΓR + (I −AΩ)-1D.

Then using the well-known identity that, for any conformable matrix product ABC, it is true that

vec ABC = (C '⊗ A) vec B,24 we have


23
     See Horn and Johnson (1991, p. 123).

(24)     vec Γ = (R '⊗ F) vec Γ + vec [(I − AΩ)-1D]

implying

(25)      vec Γ = [I − (R '⊗ F) ]-1 vec [(I − AΩ)-1D].

Accordingly, our second WF requirement is for [I − (R '⊗ F) ] and (I − AΩ) to be well behaved

in the same manner as I − (A + C), i.e., that each is a P-matrix. Again it is of interest to consider

the possibility of requiring that each of these is a PDD matrix.

5. E-Stability in WF Models?

         In this section, the concern is with the relationship between models that are WF and those

in which the MOD solution is learnable. That there may be some significant relationship is

suggested by the following identity,

(26)     (I − AΩ)(I − F)(I − Ω) = I − (A + C),

which is mentioned by B&P (1995, fn. 34).25 From this equation we see that that non-singularity

of I − (A + C) implies that the three matrices (I − AΩ), (I − F), and (I − Ω) are all nonsingular.

In addition, we can see that the WF requirement that det[I − ε(A + C)] is positive for all 0 ≤ ε ≤

1 also implies that the real eigenvalues of Ω, AΩ, and F are all less than 1.0 in value.26 To make

that argument, consider the situation when A and C are multiplied by ε, 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1. For very

small values of ε, the matrices Ω, AΩ, and F will all be small so the eigenvalues of all four

matrices in (26) will be close to 1.0 and their determinants will be positive. Now let ε increase

and approach 1.0. If I − ε(A + C) remains nonsingular throughout this process, so too will each

of the three matrices on the left-hand side of (26). Since a real eigenvalue of zero would imply



25
   The identity can be verified by writing out F in the left side of (26), multiplying, cancelling, and inserting C for
Ω − AΩ2.
26
   Here, and often in what follows, I use the fact that the eigenvalues of a matrix of form (I − B) satisfy λI−B = 1 − λB.


                                                           14
singularity for any of the matrices in question, and since eigenvalues are continuous functions of

the matrix elements, the stated result is valid.

   Accordingly, the WF requirement that det[I − ε(A + C)] is positive for all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1 also

implies that the real eigenvalues of Ω, AΩ, and F are all less than 1.0 in value. In addition, the

requirement that the matrix [I − (R '⊗ F) ] be a P-matrix implies that all the real eigenvalues of

(R '⊗ F) will be smaller than 1.0. Therefore, condition (12c), as well as (12a), is satisfied. What

about the remaining condition, for the current-information case, (12b)? Here we recognize that,

by rearrangement of (4), (I − AΩ)-1C = Ω. Accordingly, (12b) becomes Ω′ ⊗ F . But then note

that with the MOD ordering it is the case that all λΩ < 1/λF so all λΩλF < 1. But

λΩλF= λΩλF ≥ Re(λΩλF) so it follows that (12b) is invariably satisfied. Accordingly, we

see that, with current information available during the learning process, the MOD solution would

be learnable, when the model is WF, if all eigenvalues were real.

       Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the real part of all complex eigenvalues will be

smaller than 1.0. The situation is described by Horn and Johnson (1991, p. 123) as follows: “if A

is a [n-by-n] P-matrix ... then every eigenvalue of A lies in the open angular wedge Wn ≡

{z = reiθ: θ < π − (π / n), r > 0} . Moreover, every point in Wn is an eigenvalue of some n-by-n

P-matrix.” But for n > 2, Wn includes points in the in the two left-hand quadrants in the complex

plane. Therefore, we cannot argue that, in general, the WF condition implies LS learnability for

the MOD solution.

       In this regard we note that, since A and C are matrices of real numbers, I − (A + C) will

have only real eigenvalues if A + C is symmetric. And since eigenvalues are continuous

functions of the elements of the matrix in question, these eigenvalues will be real if A + C does

not depart too far from symmetry. Diagonal matrices are of course symmetric, so it is not


                                                   15
surprising that dominant-diagonal matrices have strong properties pertaining to their eigenvalues.

In particular, if a real matrix is positive diagonal dominant (PDD), i.e., is diagonal-dominant

with all diagonal elements positive, then all its eigenvalues will have positive real parts—see

Horn and Johnson (1985, p. 349). Accordingly, if we were to require (as mentioned above) that

I − (A + C), (I − AΩ), and [I − (R '⊗ F) ] were PDD, rather than just P-matrices, then learnability

would be implied. That possibility is not, however, justified by the line of argument used to

motivate the WF condition, i.e., by the desirability of ruling out infinite discontinuities in

impulse response functions (and the model’s steady-state values).

            The argument, then, is that being WF is an additional, distinct, plausibility condition to be

required along with learnability. Only if a RE solution is both learnable, and results from a

model that is WF, would it be considered as a plausible candidate for a RE solution that might

prevail in reality. This may seem like a rather demanding requirement. But most realistic

models utilized in monetary policy analysis easily meet both of these conditions; difficulties

arise primarily in the case of zero-lower-bound situations, very strong policy responses to

expected future conditions, and other extreme conditions.

            In any case, the potential attractiveness of the WF requirement, in addition to that of LS

learnability, is exemplified by an example considered for other purposes in McCallum (2004, p.

59). The example in Table 2 of that paper combines two univariate models of form (1)-(2), one

of which has two explosive solutions and the other of which has two stable solutions.27 Small

off-diagonal elements of the A and C matrices are added to make the combined model a bivariate

example that is not reducible (while barely changing the system eigenvalues). In this bivariate




27
     Incidentally, in that paper’s equation (29), the lower-left element of C is 0.3, not 0.5.


                                                              16
model it is found that there is a unique stable solution.28 Under the current-information

assumption, then, this equilibrium is learnable as well as determinate. It hardly seems plausible,

however, to believe that the combination of an explosive sector plus an indeterminate sector,

with only minimal interaction between them, would result in overall behavior reflecting a well-

behaved, unique equilibrium. Thus the finding that the determinate and learnable solution

pertains to a model that is not well-formulated, is highly relevant and leads to a conclusion that

seems entirely sensible.29 The appropriate conclusion is that this solution is not plausible. The

other solution (of form (3)) is the MSV solution. It is learnable but not dynamically stable.30

Thus the conclusion of an analysis based on the requirement that a plausible RE equilibrium

must be stable, learnable, and WF is that the system under discussion has no such equilibrium.

That seems eminently sensible, for a model that is the combination of one explosive sector and

one indeterminate sector with very little interaction.

          Next we consider learnability for WF models under the second information assumption,

for which the relevant conditions are that all eigenvalues of the matrices in (13a)-(13c) have real

parts less than 1.0. Let us assume that I − (A + C), (I − AΩ), and [I − (R '⊗ F) ] are all PDD

matrices, which makes the MOD solution both learnable and WF. First consider (13a), which

implies that I − A(I + Ω) must have all eigenvalues with real parts that are positive. Using the

definition of F, we can write

(27)     (I − AΩ)(I − F) = (I − AΩ)[I − (I − AΩ) −1 A] = (I − AΩ) − A = I − A(I + Ω).

Now, our discussion above indicates that I − AΩ and I − F will both have eigenvalues with all



28
   Which differs from the minimum-state-variable (MSV) solution in the sense of McCallum (2003b).
29
   The non-WF conclusion is based on violations of both steady-state and impulse response requirements. For the
other solution of form (3), the steady-state WF conditions are violated.
30
   For learning of explosive solutions a modified condition pertaining to shock variances is required. See E&H
(2001, pp. 219-220).


                                                       17
real parts positive under the WF assumption, so (27) indicates that this property would carry over

to I − A(I + Ω). This would not be the case, however, if we only specified that I − (A + C),

(I − AΩ), and [I − (R '⊗ F) ] are P-matrices.

       Even in the more favorable case, with PDD matrices, I have not been able to find any

general results pertaining to conditions (13b) and (13c). The problem is that sums of Kronecker

products do not in general yield matrices for which eigenvalues are cleanly related to those of the

individual matrices. Nevertheless, there are two special cases that can be treated readily. First,

consider the case in which C = 0, so there are no predetermined variables in the solution, which

implies that Ω = 0.    Then we have F = (I − AΩ)-1A = A and thus (13a) becomes the same as

(12a). Furthermore, (13b) is irrelevant with Ω = 0 and (13c) becomes (R '⊗ A) , which is the

same as in (12c). So in this case, the two information assumptions yield the same E-stability

conditions. Second, suppose that C ≠ 0, but that the exogenous variables are white noise, i.e.,

R = 0. Then (13c) becomes (I ⊗ AΩ) and the result based on (I − AΩ)-1 shows that this

condition will be satisfied if the latter matrix is PDD. But conditions pertaining to (13a) and

(13b) are not necessarily satisfied. Of course, it is a simple matter to examine specific cases

numerically.

6. General Issues

       A number of possible objections to the foregoing argument need to be addressed.

Probably the most prominent among researchers in the area would be the fact that our analysis

has been concerned only with solutions of form (3), which excludes sunspot solutions of the

“resonant frequency” type. It is my position, however, that the learning process pertaining to

solutions of this type is much less plausible than for solutions of form (3). In particular, the

solutions are not of the standard vector-autoregression (VAR) form. Therefore, an agent who


                                                 18
experimented with many different specifications of VAR models, using the economy’s generated

time series data, would still not be led to such a solution. Indeed, it seems to me that arguments

suggesting that that type of learning could exist in actual economies are utterly implausible. Of

course, literally speaking, RE itself is implausible—as early critics emphasized. Nevertheless

RE is rightly regarded by mainstream researchers as the appropriate assumption for economic

analysis, especially policy analysis. That is the case because RE is fundamentally the

assumption that agents optimize with respect to their expectational behavior, just as they do

(according to neoclassical economic analysis) with respect to other basic economic activities

such as selection of consumption bundles, selection of quantities produced and inputs utilized,

etc.—for a necessary condition for optimization is that individuals eliminate any systematically

erroneous component of their expectational behavior. Also, RE is doubly attractive (to

researchers) from a policy perspective, for it assures that a researcher does not propose policy

rules that rely upon policy behavior that is designed to exploit patterns of suboptimal

expectational behavior by individuals.

       Another issue is the possible use of learning behavior not as a device for assessing the

plausibility of rational expectations equilibria, but as a replacement for the latter. This type of

approach is discussed by E&H (2001, Ch. 14) and has been prominent in the work of Orphanides

and Williams (2005), among others. Use of constant-gain learning (E&H, 2001, pp. 338-341)

provides a sensible alternative to the decreasing-gain learning implicit in the LS learning/E-

stability literature. I do not believe, however, that this approach solves the “startup” problem,

i.e., the issue of how the economy will behave in the first several periods following the adoption

of a new policy rule or the occurrence of some other structural change. I doubt that economies

move promptly to new RE equilibria following such a change, and I would doubt that they move




                                                 19
promptly to a modelled learning path. In both cases, I share the opinion voiced by Lucas (1980),

to the effect that, after a structural change (including policy regime changes), reliable analysis

should pertain to the economy’s behavior after it has had time to settle into a new dynamic

stochastic equilibrium.

7. Conclusion

       Let us now conclude with a very brief review of the points developed above. First, the

paper reviews a previous result to the effect that, under the “first” information assumption that

agents possess knowledge of current endogenous variables in the learning process, determinacy

of a RE equilibrium is sufficient but not necessary for least-squares learnability of that

equilibrium. Thus, since learnability is an attractive necessary condition for plausibility of any

equilibrium, there may exist a single plausible RE solution even in cases of indeterminacy. In

addition, the paper proposes and outlines a distinct criterion that plausible models should possess,

termed “well formulated” (WF), that rules out infinite discontinuities in the model’s implied

steady-state values of endogenous variables and in its impulse response functions. The paper

then explores the relationship between this WF property and learnability, under the first

information assumption, and finds that (although they often agree) neither implies the other.

Extending the P-matrix requirement, implied for specified matrices by the WF property, to one

that demands positive dominant-diagonal matrices would guarantee both WF and learnability,

but a suitable rationale for such a requirement has not been found. Finally, under the second

information assumption, which gives the agents only lagged information on endogenous

variables during the learning process, the situation is less favorable in the sense that learnability

can be guaranteed only under special assumptions.

         To demonstrate that a very wide variety of linear RE models can be written in form (1)(2),

consider the formulation of King and Watson (1998) or Klein (2001), as exposited by McCallum

(1998), as follows:

Here vt is an AR(1) vector of exogenous variables (including shocks) with stable AR matrix R

while xt and kt are m1×1 and m2×1 vectors of non-predetermined and predetermined endogenous

variables, respectively. We assume without significant loss of generality that B11 is invertible31

and that G2 = 0.32 Then we define yt = [xt’ kt’ xt-1’ kt-1’]’ and write the system in form (1) with

ut = vt and the matrices given as follows:

This representation is important because it is well known that the system (A-1) permits, via use

of auxiliary variables, any finite number of lags, expectational leads, and lags of expectational

leads for the basic endogenous variables. Also, any higher-order AR process for the exogenous

variables can be written in AR(1) form.33 Thus we have shown that the Evans and Honkapohja

(2001) formulation in their Section 10.3 is in fact rather general, although it does not pertain to

asymmetric information models.
31
   For the system (A-1) to be cogent, each of the m1 non-predetermined variables must appear in at least one of the
m1 equations of the first matrix row. Then the diagonal elements of B11 will all be non-zero and to avoid
inconsistencies the rows of B11 must be linearly independent. This implies invertibility.
32
   If it is desired to include a direct effect of vt on kt+1, this can be accomplished by definition of an auxiliary variable
(equal to vt-1) in xt (in which case vt remains in the information set for period t). Also, auxiliary variables can be used
to include expectations of future values of exogenous variables.
33
   Binder and Pesaran (1995) show that virtually any linear model can be put in form (1), but in doing so admit a
more general specification than (2) for the process generating the exogenous variables.
