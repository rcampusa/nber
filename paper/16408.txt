                                             ABSTRACT

Excess body weight or body fat hinders performance of military duties. As a result, the U.S. military
has weight-for-height and percent body fat standards for enlistment. This paper estimates the number
and percent of military-age civilians who meet, and do not meet, the current active duty enlistment
standards for weight and body fat for the four major armed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
Corps), using data from the full series of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys that
spans 1959-2008. We find that the percent of civilian military-age men and women who satisfy current
military enlistment standards for weight-for-height and percent body fat has fallen considerably. This
is due to a large increase in the percentage who are both overweight and overfat, which roughly doubled
for men and more than tripled for women between 1959-62 and 2007-08. As of 2007-08, 5.7 million
men (11.70%) and 16.5 million women (34.65%) of military age exceed the U.S. Army’s enlistment
standards for weight-for-height and percent body fat. The implications of rising obesity for the U.S.
military are especially acute given its recent difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of new high
quality service members in the midst of combat operations overseas.

Introduction

           The Department of Defense (DoD) is the largest employer in the United States (NRC,

2006); in 2008 there were over 1.4 million men and women on active duty and 1.1 million men

and women in the military reserves (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Approximately 184,000 new

military personnel must be recruited each year to replace those who leave the service because of

retirement or other reasons (U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics, 2009). In the past decade, recruitment

has become more challenging for the U.S. military, which has been strained by two major

overseas operations: Operation Iraqi Freedom (March 20, 2003 – September 1, 2010), which

recently became Operation New Dawn (September 1, 2010 – present), and Operation Enduring

Freedom – Afghanistan (October 7, 2001 – present). These operations, which increased the

military’s demand for recruits (in particular, by the Army and Marine Corps) have also decreased

the supply of applicants because they raise the risk of injury and death (Asch et al., 2010). In

order to meet its recruiting targets, the U.S. Army was forced to substantially expand the

availability and size of enlistment bonuses between 2004 and 2008 (Asch et al., 2010).

           This paper focuses on the implications for U.S. military recruiting of one important trend

over the past several decades: the rise in overweight and obesity. Between 1959-62 and 2007-

08, the age-adjusted prevalence of overweight (defined as a body mass index2, or BMI, of 25 or

higher) among adult males in the U.S. rose from 47.4% to 68.3% and the prevalence of obesity

(defined as a BMI of 30 or higher) among adult males in the U.S. tripled from 10.7% to 32.2%

(Flegal et al., 1998; Flegal et al., 2002; Flegal et al., 2010). The prevalence of obesity defined

using percent body fat (instead of BMI) has also increased dramatically in the past five decades

(Burkhauser et al., 2009).

    Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

                                                          2
       Physical fitness in general and body weight and body fat in particular are highly relevant

to military occupations (Institute of Medicine (IOM), 1990, 2004; Naghii, 2006). Militaries

worldwide have long valued a physically fit appearance as an important signal of strength,

discipline, and professionalism, and consider it important for morale and pride and thus

effectiveness (IOM 2004; Yamane, 2007; McLaughlin and Wittert, 2009). Military service often

requires muscular and cardio-respiratory endurance, which can be hampered when body fat is

excessive (U.S. DoD, 2004). Several studies have found that heavier individuals, especially

women, are more likely to fail basic training than healthy weight individuals (Jones et al., 1988;

Knapik et al., 2001; Poston et al., 2002). Among Navy personnel, men and women with high

weight-for-height are more likely to fail their semi-annual Physical Readiness Test (Bohnker et

al, 2005). It is estimated that, among U.S. active duty military, overweight and obesity are

responsible for 658,000 missed work days (absenteeism) and the equivalent of 17,000 missed

work days due to lower productivity while at work (presenteeism), for a total productivity cost of

$105.6 million per year (Dall et al., 2007). TRICARE, the military health insurance program,

spends $1.1 billion annually treating obesity-related illness (Dall et al., 2007). For comparison,

that is more than it spends annually treating illnesses related to tobacco ($564 million) and

alcohol consumption ($425 million) combined (Dall et al., 2007). The IOM has warned that

obesity “threaten[s] the long-term welfare and readiness of U.S. military forces” (IOM, 2004,

p.1) and an association of retired generals and admirals has declared that rising youth obesity

threatens the future strength of the U.S. military and thus U.S. national security (Mission:

Readiness, 2010).

       Because of the importance of healthy body weight and percent body fat for military

readiness and effectiveness, the military imposes weight-for-height and percent body fat



                                                 3
standards for enlistment. The high and rising prevalence of obesity in the civilian population

makes it more difficult for the military to find acceptable numbers of quality recruits (Yamane,

2007; McLaughlin and Wittert, 2009). Excessive weight and/or body fat is now the most

common reason for medical disqualification, leading to rejection of 23.3% of all applicants to the

military (NRC, 2006). For comparison, the second most common reason is smoking marijuana,

which leads to rejection of 12.6% of applicants (NRC, 2006). Roughly 15,000 applicants to the

military are rejected each year for exceeding the standards for weight and body fat (Mission:

Readiness, 2010).

       This paper estimates the number and percent of the civilian military-age population that

satisfy current active duty enlistment standards for weight-for-height and percent body fat.

Results are reported by gender and separately for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.

We document both current levels and trends over the past five decades. We also examine the

personal characteristics associated with meeting those enlistment standards.

       This paper relates to several previous studies. Recently, a collection of retired generals

and admirals issued a report, “Too Fat to Fight,” which expressed concern that the increase in

youth obesity may compromise military readiness and national security (Mission: Readiness,

2010). That report listed the percentage of 18-24 year old Americans who were overweight or

obese in 2006-2008, but did not calculate what fraction met military enlistment standards for

weight-for-height and percent body fat. Moreover, the estimates of the prevalence of overweight

and obese were based on self-reported weight and height, which tend to be substantially

underreported (e.g. Rowland, 1974; Cawley and Burkhauser, 2006), potentially resulting in

severe and systematic misclassification error (Nieto-Garcia et al., 1990). Other studies have used

a subset of the data examined in this paper to calculate the percent of Americans meeting



                                                4
military weight-for-height standards in a narrow span of years; e.g. Nolte et al. (2002) examines

1988-94 and Yamane (2007) examines 2001-04. Those papers did not examine whether subjects

met the military standards for percent body fat.

         This paper offers four improvements over the previous literature. First, we examine

levels and trends over a much longer period: 1959-2008. Second, we examine not only whether

civilians satisfy the military enlistment standards for weight-for-height but also those for percent

body fat. Third, weight and height are measured by medical professionals rather than self-

reported as in Mission: Readiness (2010). Fourth, we investigate which personal characteristics

predict meeting the standards.

         Defense economists have noted that there has been relatively little research on the

economics of military manpower and human resource issues in the military (Sandler and Hartley,

1995).3 This paper represents a contribution to the literature, as “There is scant literature

covering civilian obesity levels and military recruitment” (Yamane, 2007, p. 1160).



Military Standards for Weight-For-Height and Percent Body Fat

         General physical standards for enlistment in the American military can be traced back to

1775, when Congress called for “able bodied” men to be formed into militia (Johnson, 1997).

Weight-for-height standards for enlistment were first issued in 1887 for men and in the 1940s for

women; initially their primary function was to exclude those who were underweight (Johnson,

1997), but in recent years far more applicants are excluded for being overweight (NRC, 2006).4



3
  Reviews of the research on the economics of military manpower are provided by Sandler and Hartley (1995),
Warner and Asch (1995), and Warner et al. (2007).
4
  Economic historians have extensively studied the historic data on weight and height of conscripts and recruits, for
example using them to track long-term trends in standards of living and health; see e.g. Komlos (1987) and Costa
(1993, 2004).

                                                          5
The exact standards for weight have evolved continuously since they were first implemented

(Johnson, 1997).

         Today, the DoD mandates that each military service enforce standards for recruiting that

include weight-for-height limits and maximum percent body fat (U.S. DoD, 2004).5 Although

the DoD provides general guidance, each service can determine its own minimum and maximum

weight and percent body fat limits for enlistment (NRC, 2006; Yamane, 2007). Current weight-

for-height and percent body fat standards for enlistment in active duty forces are listed in

Appendix Table A (Army), Appendix Table B (Navy), Appendix Table C (Air Force), and

Appendix Table D (Marine Corps). There is considerable variability across the services on

several dimensions. The weight-for-height standards of the Army and Marine Corps vary with

age (permitting older recruits to be heavier), whereas the Navy and Air Force have a single set of

standards that applies to all ages. The Air Force has a single set of weight-for-height standards

that applies to both men and women, but the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps have gender-

specific standards of weight-for-height. For men, the Marine Corps has the most lenient weight-

for-height standards, perhaps to allow for more muscular recruits. For women, weight-for-height

standards are strictest in the Army and Marine Corps. Weight-for-height standards are expressed

in pounds for a given height in inches, but they are easily converted to BMI. Across the services,

maximum allowable BMI is generally in the range of 26-28 for men (the Marine Corps is the

exception, allowing BMI as high as 31) and 25-27 for women. The Navy is the only service with

no minimum weight requirement.




5
  All military services also have a set of weight standards for those already in the service that are equal to, or more
stringent than, those applied to new recruits (IOM, 2004).

                                                            6
        The services also differ in the range of acceptable heights. Acceptable heights are 58-80

inches for the Army6, Air Force, and Marine Corps, but the Navy accepts both shorter and taller

recruits, with an acceptable range of 51-86 inches.

        There is also variation across the services in the enlistment standards for percent body fat.

Those of the Army, Navy, and Air Force rise with age, whereas the Marine Corps has a single

percent body fat standard for all ages. Each service permits a higher percent body fat for women

than men. The maximum allowable percent body fat is lowest in the Marine Corps, which

allows no higher than 18% for men and 26% for women. In contrast, the maximum allowable

percent body fat by the Army increases with age from 26% to 30% for men and 32% to 36% for

women. Despite these substantial differences in standards across services, the National Research

Council notes that “There is no rationale given for this variability” (NRC, 2006, p. 117).

        Each service has a unique eligible active duty enlistment age range, although none permit

those under age 17 to enlist.7 The allowable age ranges are 17-42 years for Army, 17-34 for

Navy, 17-27 for Air Force, and 17-28 for Marine Corps.

        Applicants to the military receive medical examinations at military entrance processing

stations (MEPS). Each of the four services uses a two-stage process to screen weight and body

composition (NRC, 2006). The first stage is to measure weight and height; if the applicant is in

the range of acceptable weight-for-height, then no further screening is required. If the applicant

exceeds the maximum weight-for-height, then percent body fat is assessed using height and the

circumferences of some combination of the abdomen, waist, hip, and neck (the measurement

sites vary by service). If the applicant’s percent body fat is in the acceptable range, then the

maximum weight-for-height requirement is waived and the applicant is classified as meeting the

6
  The Army’s range of acceptable heights is 58-80 inches for women, but 60-80 inches for men. The Air Force and
Marine Corps range of acceptable heights is 58-80 inches for both women and men.
7
  Potential applicants who are under age 18 must have a parent or guardian's permission to enlist.

requirements. Applicants who exceed both the weight-for-height and percent body fat thresholds

are disqualified from enlisting and are encouraged to lose weight and then return to the MEPS

for another assessment; under current regulations they must wait four days for every pound of

weight to be lost (NRC, 2006). Disqualified applicants have the option of applying for a waiver;

each service has its own policy on granting such waivers; see NRC (2006).



Data: the NHES and NHANES Series (1959-2008)

       This study utilizes the full series of nationally representative, cross-sectional health

surveys sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention. The National Health Examination Survey, Cycle I (NHES) was conducted

during 1959-1962. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)

program began with NHANES I, which was conducted 1971-1975, and was followed by

NHANES II (1976-1980), NHANES III (1988-1994), and NHANES Continuous (1999-2000,

2001-02, 2003-04, 2005-06, and 2007-08). For information on the sampling frame and methods

of data collection in these surveys, see National Center for Health Statistics (1965; 1977; 1994;

2000) and McDowell et al. (1981). In each of these surveys, a nationally representative sample

of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population was selected using a complex, stratified,

multistage probability cluster sampling design. These are the best available data for estimating

trends in the number and percent of U.S. military-age civilians who meet the current weight-for-

height and percent body fat requirements of the military, as the data are nationally representative,

frequently collected over the past five decades, include demographic information such as age and

gender, and, most importantly, contain measurements of weight, height, and other

anthropometrics that can be used to calculate percent body fat.



                                                 8
         Each NHES and NHANES survey included physical examinations conducted in a

specially-designed and equipped mobile examination center where a scientific team including a

physician and medical and health technicians measured weight, height, and skinfold thickness at

the tricep and subscapular region (which is below the shoulder blade). Additional measures of

fatness were recorded in certain surveys, but the only fatness measures that were collected

consistently from NHES until NHANES 2007-08 are weight, height, and the two measures of

skinfold thickness.

         The maximum weight that could be measured was not binding in NHES, and was 400

pounds (182 kg) in NHANES I and II. In NHANES III it was again not binding and in

NHANES Continuous it was 440 kg (968 pounds). The top-coding of weight does not affect our

classification of individuals, as everyone with the maximum weight -- regardless of height -- is

not weight eligible for enlistment in the military.8

         Skinfold thickness at the tricep and subscapular region were assessed using calipers. The

NHES and NHANES medical technicians were trained in measuring skinfold thicknesses to

ensure accuracy and reliability (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000). The NHANES III

and NHANES Continuous noted when a skinfold exceeded the capacity of the calipers. We

recode the skinfold size of such individuals to the maximum caliper size, but this top-coding

does not affect estimates of eligibility for enlistment in the military because such individuals are

not eligible whether their skinfold is set equal to the maximum caliper size or an even larger

number.9 In addition to recording whether the skinfold exceeded the maximum caliper size, the


8
  The tallest height listed in any of the military standards is 86 inches and the maximum allowable weight for that
height is 263 pounds, which is well below the top-coding of weight in the NHES or NHANES.
9
  The percentage of our analysis sample with tricep skinfolds larger than the maximum caliper size is as follows:
1.78% in NHANES III and from 3.08% to 4.91% in each of the five surveys in NHANES Continuous. The
percentage of our analysis sample with subscapular skinfolds larger than the maximum caliper size is as follows:
2.46% in NHANES III, 4.26% in NHANES 1999-2000, 1.41% in NHANES 2001-02, 1.7% in NHANES 2003-04,
1.85% in NHANES 2005-06, and 2.26% in NHANES 2007-08.

                                                         9
NHANES III and NHANES Continuous indicated if the examiner could not obtain a

measurement (presumably for reasons other than the skinfold exceeding the maximum caliper

size). When the skinfold could not be obtained, we impute it separately by sex using the other

skinfold thickness (either tricep or subscapular), measured height and weight, age, age squared,

race, and ethnicity; this prediction equation is based on respondents with complete information.10

These regression models explain between 54.87% and 78.54% of the variance in skinfolds,

implying that the imputation procedure provides reasonable predictions for missing skinfolds.

        Skinfold thicknesses at the tricep and subscapular region are used to calculate body

density using the equations in Durnin and Womersley (1974). Body density is then used to

calculate percent body fat (Siri, 1956; Durnin and Womersley, 1974).

        All analyses exclude pregnant women and (for the surveys that provide such information)

women who were pregnant in the past year.11 For each service, we examine only those civilians

who are age-eligible to enlist: those aged 17-42 for the Army, 17-34 for the Navy, 17-27 for the

Air Force, and 17-28 for the Marine Corps. After excluding respondents that did not provide

valid responses to all survey items of interest the final combined sample size is 34,994.12




10
   The percentage of our analysis sample for whom tricep skinfold thickness could not be obtained was 0.58% in
NHANES III, 0.42% in NHANES 1999-2000, 1.18% in NHANES 2001-02, 1.15% in NHANES 2003-04, 1.18% in
NHANES 2005-06, and 0.71% in NHANES 2007-08. The percentage of our analysis sample for which subscapular
skinfold thickness could not be obtained was 3.12% in NHANES III, 9.57% in NHANES 1999-2000, 11.68% in
NHANES 2001-02, 10.95% in NHANES 2003-04, 13.81% in NHANES 2005-06, and 11.94% in NHANES 2007-
08.
11
   We exclude from the sample women who are currently pregnant (for each survey) and, when known, women who
were pregnant in the past two years (NHANES III) or one year (NHANES I and II).
12
   Final analysis sizes in each survey are: 3,414 for NHES; 6,545 for NHANES I; 5,464 for NHANES II; 7,233 for
NHANES III; 2,393 for NHANES 1999-2000; 2,628 for NHANES 2001-02; 2,446 for NHANES 2003-04; 2,484 for
NHANES 2005-06; and 2,387 for NHANES 2007-08.

                                                     10
Methods

        In order to estimate the number and percent of military-age Americans who meet the

military’s enlistment standards for weight-for-height and percent body fat, we use the military’s

two-stage process. First, we compare the subject’s measured weight and height to the active

duty enlistment standards of a specific armed service (e.g. Army). A subject who is shorter than

the minimum height or taller than the maximum height is coded as not meeting the standard. If

the subject is in the range of acceptable weight-for-height, then the subject is classified as

meeting the standard. A subject whose weight is below the minimum weight-for-height is coded

as not meeting the standard; percent body fat is not relevant if the subject is underweight. If the

subject’s weight-for-height exceeds the maximum, then the subject’s percent body fat is

compared to the maximum threshold for that service. If the subject’s percent body fat is less

than the maximum allowable, then she is classified as meeting the standard. Subjects who

exceed both the weight-for-height and percent body fat thresholds are coded as not meeting the

standards. This process is followed for all four armed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine

Corps) using only the civilians who are age-eligible to enlist in that service.13

        Population sample weights for the sample that underwent medical examinations are used

when estimating the percent of military-age respondents who meet each armed service’s

standards in each survey: NHES, NHANES I, NHANES II, NHANES III, and NHANES

Continuous. We test the hypothesis of equality across surveys (and, therefore, across time) in

these estimates.




13
  We are unable to examine trends in eligibility to enlist in the Coast Guard because the Coast Guard standards are
based in part on wrist circumference -- a proxy for body build -- which is not available in the NHES or NHANES
surveys.

                                                        11
        We use the sampling weights for those who underwent medical examinations to estimate

the total number of Americans meeting, and not meeting, the enlistment standards for weight and

percent body fat.

        We also examine the personal characteristics that predict the probability of meeting the

current active duty enlistment weight and body fat standards by estimating gender-specific

maximum likelihood probit models using the most recent data, the NHANES Continuous (1999-

2008). Specifically, we estimate probit regressions in which the dependent variable is an

indicator for whether the subject satisfies the weight and body fat enlistment standards of a

particular service. Regressors include: age (20-24; 25-29; 30-34; 35-39; and 40-42 with 17-19 as

the omitted category), real family income ($0-4,999; $5,000-9,999; $10,000-14,999; $15,000-

19,999; $20,000-24,999; $25,000-34,999; $45,000-54,999; $55,000-64,999; $65,000-74,999;

and $75,000+, with $35,000-44,999 as the omitted category)14, education (less than high school,

some college, and college graduate, with high school as the omitted category), marital status

(divorced/widowed/separated and never married, with married as the omitted category),

race/ethnicity15 (black, Hispanic, and other, with white as the omitted category), and survey fixed

effects (NHANES 1999-2000 as the omitted category). We estimate the reduced-form body

fatness production function in equation (1):

(1)                                   Pr( M it  1)   ( 0  1' X it   2' Dt )   it

Where M it is an indicator for meeting current active duty enlistment standards for weight and

body fat in a specific military service for individual i in survey t, X it is a vector of personal

   The NHANES 1999-2008 provides family income in categorical form. To account for inflation during this period
the categorical variables were converted into a pseudo-continuous variable by assigning the mid-point to each
category, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index was then used to convert all values to 2007 dollars,
and the inflation adjusted family income was converted back to an 11 category variable.

Results

         The percent of age-eligible U.S. civilians who satisfy military active duty enlistment

requirements for weight and body fat, over time, are listed in Tables 1A (Army, men), 1B

(Army, women), 2A (Navy, men), 2B (Navy, women), 3A (Air Force, men), 3B (Air Force,

women), 4A (Marine Corps, men), and 4B (Marine Corps, women). Each row of these tables

corresponds to a specific survey conducted in certain years: NHES (conducted 1959-62),

NHANES I (1971-75), NHANES II (1976-80), NHANES III (1988-94), and the various

NHANES Continuous surveys (1999-2000, 2001-02, 2003-04, 2005-06, and 2007-08). Graphs

of the percent satisfying enlistment standards for weight and fat, over time, are provided in

Figure 1 for men and Figure 2 for women.16

         For each military service (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps) and for both men and

requirements dropped significantly between the earliest (1959-62) and the most recent (2007-08)

surveys. For example, Table 1A, column 4, shows that the percentage of age-eligible (i.e. 17-42

years) male civilians who satisfy the Army’s weight-for-height and percent body fat

requirements declined from 92.02% in 1959-62 to 85.17% in 2007-08, which is a decrease of

6.85 percentage points or 7.45%, which is statistically significant. The final column in Table 1A

indicates that the percentage of male civilians who are both too heavy and too fat to enlist in the

Army more than doubled, from 5.55% in 1959-62 to 11.70% in 2007-08. In the most recent data

(2007-08), more than three times as many males fail the Army’s enlistment standards for being

both overweight and overfat (11.70%) than fail them for being underweight (3.13%).

       Patterns for men are similar for the other services. Between 1959-62 and 2007-08, the

percent of age-eligible men who satisfy both the weight-for-height and percent body fat

requirements fell by 7.45% for the Army (Table 1A, column 4), 9.82% for the Navy (Table 2A,

column 4), 11.90% for the Air Force (Table 3A, column 4), and 7.21% for the Marine Corps

(Table 4A, column 4); each of these declines is statistically significant. Between 1959-62 and

2007-08, the percentage of age-eligible men who are both overweight and overfat and are thus

disqualified from enlistment rose 110.91% for the Army (Table 1A, final column), 99.65% for

the Navy (Table 2A, final column), 91.04% for the Air Force (Table 3A, final column), and

131.61% for the Marine Corps (Table 4A, final column).

       Figure 1 shows the variation over time in the percent of male military-age civilians who

satisfy each service’s enlistment requirements for weight-for-height and percent body fat.

Historically, the largest percentage of military-age civilian men satisfy the current weight-for-

height and percent body fat requirements of the Marine Corps and the smallest percentage satisfy

the current requirements of the Air Force. As of 2007-08, 88.45% of military-age civilian men



                                                 14
satisfy the weight-for-height and percent body fat requirements of the Marine Corps (see Table

4A, column 4) and 78.09% satisfy the requirements of the Air Force (see Table 3A, column 4).

       For each service, the percentage of the population that satisfies the enlistment standards

for weight-for-height and percent body fat has declined more for women than men. For

example, Table 1B, column 4, shows that the percentage of age-eligible (i.e. 17-42 years) female

civilians who satisfy the Army’s weight-for-height and percent body fat requirements declined

from 78.14% in 1959-62 to 59.54% in 2007-08, which is a decrease of 18.59 percentage points

or 23.80%, which is statistically significant. The final column in Table 1B indicates that the

percentage of female civilians who are both too heavy and too fat to enlist in the Army more than

tripled, from 11.46% in 1959-62 to 34.65% in 2007-08. In the most recent data (2007-08), more

than six times as many females fail the Army’s enlistment standards for being both overweight

and overfat (34.65%) than fail them for being underweight (5.14%).

       Patterns for women are similar for the other services. Between 1959-62 and 2007-08, the

percent of age-eligible women who satisfy both the weight-for-height and percent body fat

requirements fell by 23.8% for the Army (Table 1B, column 4), 25.24% for the Navy (Table 2B,

column 4), 21.38% for the Air Force (Table 3B, column 4), and 27.09% for the Marine Corps

(Table 4B, column 4); each of these declines is statistically significant. Between 1959-62 and

2007-08, the percentage of age-eligible women who are both overweight and overfat and are thus

disqualified from enlistment rose 202.21% for the Army (Table 1B, final column), 311.15% for

the Navy (Table 2B, final column), 368.87% for the Air Force (Table 3B, final column), and

269.93% for the Marine Corps (Table 4B, final column). Increases in overweight and overfat

among women explain more than 100% of the decline in eligibility because over the same period

the percentage of women who are disqualified for being underweight fell by 46-48%.



                                                15
       Figure 2 shows the variation over time in the percent of female military-age civilians who

satisfy each service’s enlistment requirements for weight-for-height and percent body fat.

Historically, the largest percentage of military-age civilian women satisfy the current weight-for-

height and percent body fat requirements of the Navy and the smallest percentage satisfy the

current requirements of the Marine Corps. As of 2007-08, 69.15% of military-age civilian

women satisfy the weight-for-height and percent body fat requirements of the Navy (see Table

2B, column 4) and 54.07% satisfy the requirements of the Marine Corps (see Table 4B, column

4). A comparison of Figures 1 and 2 shows that far smaller percentages of civilian women than

civilian men meet current enlistment standards for weight and fat.

       We calculate the total number of military-age men and women who would be disqualified

from enlistment for failing to satisfy current weight and fat enlistment standards; results are

listed in Table 5A for the Army, Table 5B for the Navy, Table 5C for the Air Force, and Table

5D for the Marine Corps. In each table, the upper panel is for men and the lower panel is for

women. As of the most recent data (2007-08), the number of age-eligible civilian American men

who exceed both the weight-for-height and percent body fat enlistment standards of the armed

services was 5.7 million for the Army, 6.1 million for the Navy, 3.4 million for the Air Force,

and 2.4 million for the Marine Corps. (Note that these numbers differ across services because of

different standards regarding age as well as weight-for-height and percent body fat.) For each

service, a far greater number of women than men exceed both the weight-for-height and percent

body fat enlistment standards; in 2007-08, the number of women exceeding the standards was:

16.5 million for the Army, 9.8 million for the Navy, 5.9 million for the Air Force, and 7.7

million for the Marine Corps.




                                                 16
         We investigate the correlates of meeting current active duty enlistment standards for

weight and body fat. Tables 6A and 6B report the results for men and women of probit

regressions of meeting the enlistment standards (that is, the dependent variable equals one if the

respondent satisfies the requirements for weight-for-height and percent body fat). Models are

estimated using data from the NHANES Continuous (1999-2008) for those who are age-eligible

to enlist in the particular service17. There are separate columns for each armed service.

Averages of individual marginal effects are reported in square brackets. Table 6A indicates that,

for men, those in the lowest category of family income (0-$4,999) are 8.12 percentage points

more likely to meet the weight and fat standards of the Army, 8.39 percentage points more likely

to meet those of the Navy, 10.12 percentage points more likely to meet those of the Air Force,

and 8.02 percentage points more likely to meet those of the Marine Corps. Among men, college

graduates are more likely than high school graduates with no college to meet the weight-for-

height and body fat requirements; specifically: 4.13 percentage points more likely to meet those

of the Army, 10.48 percentage points more likely to meet those of the Air Force, and 11.11

percentage points more likely to meet those of the Marine Corps. Men who have never been

married are 3.51 percentage points more likely to meet the weight and body fat standards of the

Navy and 3.26 percentage points more likely to meet those of the Marine Corps. Relative to

white men, African American men are 2.39 percentage points less likely to meet the weight and

fat standards of the Army, and Hispanic men are 3.47 percentage points more likely to meet the

standards of the Army and 4.79 percentage points more likely to meet the standards of the

Marine Corps.

  Observations with missing information on income, education, and marital status are dropped from the analysis
sample; this sample is slightly smaller than the sample used in the estimation of percent and number eligible for
military service.

       Results for women are reported in Table 6B. For women, there is a consistent negative

relationship between age and the probability of meeting enlistment standards for weight and

body fat. For example, consider the standards for the Army. Relative to women aged 17-19

years, those who are 20-24 are 6.02 percentage points less likely, those who are 25-29 are 14.04

percentage points less likely, those who are 30-34 are 12.6 percentage points less likely, those

who are 35-39 are 10.71 percentage points less likely, and those who are 40-42 are 13.25

percentage points less likely, to meet the standards. Women in the highest income category

($75,000 a year and higher) are 7.64 percentage points more likely to meet the weight-for-height

and percent body fat standards of the Navy and 8.68 percentage points more likely to meet those

of the Marine Corps. These findings are consistent with the negative correlation between income

and body weight among women in the U.S. (see, e.g., McLaren, forthcoming). Relative to

female high school graduates with no college, female college graduates are between 11.29 and

16.20 percentage points more likely to meet the weight-for-height and body fat standards of each

service. Compared to white females, African-American females are between 14.73 and 16.70

percentage points less likely to meet the weight and body fat standards of each service, and

Hispanic females are between 4.32 and 7.29 percentage points less likely to meet the standards

of the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.



Extensions

       We pursue two extensions. First, we examine several historic sets of weight standards for

the Army. Second, we briefly discuss results for the military reserves, National Guard, and

military academies.




                                                18
       This paper focuses on the current active duty enlistment standards of the armed services.

However, we have located four historic sets of Army active duty enlistment standards for weight

and body fat: those issued in 1961, 1969, 1976, and 1991. The 1991 regulations were the first to

include a percent body fat maximum; earlier regulations relied solely on weight-for-height. (The

Army standards used earlier in the paper were issued in 2007.) A comparison of the four historic

sets of standards reveals that weight-for-height standards became much more lenient in 1991. In

2007-08, roughly 85-87% of military-age American males met the current (2007) and 1991

Army standards, but that percentage would be roughly 79-80% if the 1976, 1969, or 1961

weight-for-height standards had been in place. The trend in the percent of American men who

would satisfy each set of Army weight-for-height standards is shown in Figure 3. The decrease

in eligibility we document in Tables 1A and in Figure 1 would have been even greater if the

military had not relaxed its standards in 1991.

       In addition to the standards used in this paper, which apply to enlistment for active duty,

separate standards for weight and body fat exist for the military reserves, the National Guard

(Army and Air), and the three major military academies (i.e. the Army’s United States Military

Academy at West Point, New York; the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland;

and the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado). We find that the

percentage of military-age civilians who meet each of these sets of standards has fallen

significantly and substantially between 1959-62 and 2007-08. For the sake of conciseness we

omit tables and detailed discussion of these results, but they are available upon request.




                                                  19
Limitations

       The limitations of this paper include the following. A recruit who fails to pass the

weight-for-height and percent body fat standards can petition to be re-measured at a later date.

We are unable to determine which rejected subjects in our sample might have been able to “make

weight” at a later date. We estimate body fat using skinfold thicknesses at the tricep and

subscapular regions, whereas the services measure it at a variety of other sites such as abdomen,

waist, hip and neck (NRC, 2006); however, each is considered an accurate measure of body fat

(Heymsfield et al., 2004). We examine only the standards regarding weight-for-height and

percent body fat, whereas many other factors, such as standardized test scores and performance

on tests of physical fitness determine whether a recruit is eligible for enlistment. Thus, our

estimates of the number of civilians that meet the standards for weight-for-height and percent

body fat are greater than the number that would pass all military enlistment standards. However,

the purpose of this paper is not to estimate the number of civilians who pass all of the military

enlistment standards, but to document how rising obesity disqualifies increasing numbers of

civilians from military enlistment.



Discussion

       The high and rising prevalence of obesity represents a substantial challenge for military

recruitment. The percentage of civilian military-age men and women who satisfy military

enlistment standards for weight-for-height and percent body fat has fallen considerably since

1959. For example, between 1959-62 and 2007-08, the percentage of civilians aged 17-42 years

who exceed the Army’s enlistment standards for weight and body fat has risen by 110.91% for

men and 202.21% for women. As of 2007-08, there were 5.7 million men and 16.5 million



                                                 20
women between the ages of 17 and 42 who exceeded the Army’s enlistment standards for weight

and body fat. As a result, the rise in obesity among the civilian population “may pose significant

problems for national defense” (Yamane, 2007, p. 1163).

       The implications of the rise in obesity for military recruitment depend in part on the

number of military recruits needed. If the U.S. completes Operation New Dawn in Iraq and

Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and downsizes its military, the impact will be less

than if an additional major threat or conflict arises that requires a substantial expansion of the

military, in which case rising obesity may represent an even greater obstacle to recruiting a

sufficient number of high quality candidates, particularly among females.

       The problem would be particularly acute if the U.S. was forced by wartime demands to

return to a system of conscription or draft that sought to enlist a high percentage of civilians.

Under conscription, military enlistment standards and exemptions can have the unintended

consequence of incentivizing certain behaviors in order to avoid military service. For example,

the Vietnam-era draft, by exempting those attending college, increased college attendance by 4

to 6 percentage points (Card and Lemieux, 2001). Also during the Vietnam draft, a removal of

the exemption for married childless men but retention of the exemption for married men with

children led to a spike in fertility (Kutinova, 2009). Johnson (1997) contends that, historically,

some potential draftees sought to gain weight to disqualify themselves from military service.

Yamane (2007) argues that the rise in weight in the civilian population implies that there is a

large number of potential draftees close to the maximum allowable weight, for whom it would be

relatively easy to intentionally gain a sufficient amount of weight to avoid military service.

       The percentage of military-age civilians who meet weight-for-height and body fat

standards decreased considerably more for women than men. Although women constitute the



                                                 21
minority of each U.S. armed service, the percentages are nontrivial; women represent 6.2% of

the Marine Corps, 13.4% of the Army, 14.8% of the Navy, and 19.4% of the Air Force (U.S.

Census Bureau, 2010). However, that is subject to change. When engaged in wars that are

intense or long in duration, nations tend to enlist individuals previously thought less suited to

service. For example, prior to 1860, the enlistment of large numbers of African Americans in the

U.S. armed forces was never seriously considered but that changed with the demands of the Civil

War (McPherson, 1988). Several nations, including Israel, require mandatory military service of

women (Poast, 2006). Future threats or conflicts could lead the U.S. to enlist large numbers of

women in its armed forces. Thus, rising obesity among women, not just that among men,

represents a concern for national security.

       A simplistic response is to relax the enlistment standards to allow heavier and fatter

recruits into the military. However, high weight and body fat have been linked to worse job

performance in military occupations (IOM 1990, 2004; Naghii, 2006), and cost the military

billions in job absenteeism and health care spending (Dall et al., 2007). The IOM reports that, of

the recruits who exceeded the weight-for-height standards but subsequently entered the military

because they passed the standards later or received a waiver, 80% left the military before

completing their first term of enlistment but after the expenditure of training costs (IOM, 2004).

Thus, relaxing the standards could entail substantial costs. It is beyond the scope of this study to

calculate the optimal weight standards from a cost-benefit perspective, but that is an important

direction for future research.

       Our probit results indicate that in recent years (1999-2008), African American females

are between 14.73 and 16.70 percentage points less likely than white females to meet the weight

and body fat standards of the military services. In addition, Hispanic females are between 4.32



                                                 22
and 7.29 percentage points less likely than white females to meet the weight and body fat

standards of the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. African American males are 2.39

percentage points less likely than white males to satisfy the weight and body fat standards of the

Army. These disparities represent a substantial challenge for the U.S. military, which actively

seeks to recruit a labor force that is representative of the nation but has experienced declining

enlistments by minorities, especially African-Americans (Asch et al., 2009).

       These implications for military recruitment represent an underappreciated cost of the

obesity epidemic, and thus represent an additional reason for the U.S. government to invest in

prevention of obesity. Cost-effective school-based interventions to prevent childhood obesity

have been identified (Wang et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2007; Cawley, 2007). In addition, both the

Federal and state governments can mandate that private health insurance plans cover cost-

effective methods of preventing and treating youth obesity (Homer and Simpson, 2007; Cawley

2010) and can cover such methods in their Medicaid programs. There is a precedent for

concerns about military readiness leading to government policies to reduce obesity. Singapore,

which is ruled by a military government and has universal male conscription, became concerned

about rising obesity among military conscripts and in response implemented in 1992 a broad

campaign to reduce youth obesity (Walsh, 2004). Even in the U.S. there is precedent for the

military advocating policies to ensure healthy weight among youths; the Mission: Readiness

(2010) report notes that, after World War II, General Lewis Hershey, the Director of the

Selective Service, convinced Congress to pass the National School Lunch Act “…as a way to

improve the nutrition of America’s children, increase their height and weight, and ensure

America’s national security” (Mission: Readiness, 2010, p. 1). Ironically, the modern school

lunch program has been identified as a contributing factor to childhood obesity (e.g.,



                                                 23
Schanzenbach, 2009). As a result, retired generals and admirals are now calling for the removal

of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods from schools and for improving the quality of the school

lunch program (Mission: Readiness, 2010).

        The trends documented in this paper suggest that retaining already-fit members of the

military may be increasingly cost-effective relative to finding and recruiting civilians who meet

military weight and body fat requirements. A direction for future research is to examine whether

cost effectiveness considerations justify shifting resources away from recruitment and toward

retention.

        The trends documented in this paper also suggest that the military may need to

increasingly engage in factor substitution. As obesity raises the cost of recruiting an additional

soldier who meets military weight requirements (and as excess fatness lowers the marginal

product of labor), it may be cost-saving to substitute away from labor and toward capital. The

military has recently engaged in such factor substitution, e.g. moving from manned to unmanned

aerial vehicles (e.g. Predator drones); additional substitution of capital for labor could help the

military deal with a shrinking pool of high-quality recruits.

        Another possibility is to substitute not from labor to capital but from one type of labor to

another type of labor. During the War on Terror, the U.S. military has increasingly outsourced

activities to private military companies, which can recruit from a broader, international, labor

pool (Singer, 2003). Though perhaps repugnant to some (Roth, 2007), such outsourcing of

military functions could alleviate the burden on the U.S. military to find a large number of fit

military recruits.

        An ongoing challenge for the military is how to accurately measure fitness for service.

Initially the military used weight-for-height, in part because it is easy to assess, but it is a noisy



                                                  24
measure of fatness (Cawley and Burkhauser, 2006), and had the undesirable consequence of

excluding men with high muscle mass, so the military now admits applicants who exceed the

weight-for-height standard as long as their percent body fat is under a certain threshold (Johnson,

1997). Moreover, the services have varying standards of weight-for-height and body fat with no

clearly articulated rationale based on difference of needs (NRC, 2006). A direction for future

research is to determine the measure of fatness, and the enlistment standards based on that

measure of fatness, that are optimal for each service.

Notes: Percent eligible and ineligible is calculated by applying current Navy weight standards to historical data. See Appendix Table B for current
Navy enlistment weight standards. Eligible age range is 17-34 for enlistment in Navy active duty. Historical sampling weights and adjustment for
strata employed. Standard errors clustered around primary sampling unit are reported in parentheses. Observations with missing information and
pregnant women excluded from the analysis sample. The current Navy enlistment standards do not include a minimum weight and thus there is no
column for percent underweight.
