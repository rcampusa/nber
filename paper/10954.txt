I.   Introduction


Ken Rogoff (2003) elaborates on some favorable factors
that have been helping to drive down global inflation in
the 1990s. An hypothesis, which he put forth, is that the
“globalization—interacting     with    deregulation     and
privatization—has played a strong supporting role in the
past decade’s disinflation.”


It is interesting to explore what has guided monetary
authorities in the pursuit of low inflation in the 1990s, in
the presence of strong forces of globalization.


This note considers how the output-gap and inflation
weights, in a utility-based loss function of the monetary
authority, are affected by opening of the country to trade
and by the liberalization of the international capital
flows.
II. Utility Based Welfare Criterion


Michael Woodford (2003, Chapter 6) demonstrates how
to derive a quadratic loss function from a standard
welfare criterion of a representative household. The
welfare criterion, from which he derives a quadratic loss
function, is the expected utility of the representative
household, given by
 ⎛ ∞        ⎞
E⎜ ∑ β tU t ⎟
 ⎝ t =0     ⎠

Where,
U t = ⎡u (C t ; ξ t ) − ∫ w(ht ( j );ξ t )dj ⎤
                         1

      ⎢⎣                 0                   ⎥⎦
                                                  .

Ct     is an index of differentiated products that constitutes
aggregate consumption,                            ht ( j ) is   the labor supply to, and
At f (ht ( j )) is   the production function of variety j, and ( At ,                 ξt )   are
productivity and preference shocks. The aggregate output is
                                                      θ
                                        θ −1
                             ⎡1               ⎤ θ −1
specified            as Yt = ⎢∫ yt ( j ) θ dj ⎥ ,           and    Pt   is the corresponding
                             ⎣⎢ 0             ⎦⎥

aggregate price level.
                                                1
Let      ν ( y t ( j )) ≡ w( f −1 ( y t ( j )      ).   Then, using the closed economy
                                                At

condition                           C=Y,                        and              the             production
function y ( j ) = At           t   f (ht ( j )) ,   we get:
      ⎡                 1                           ⎤
U t = ⎢u(Yt ; ξ t )) − ∫ ν ( y t ( j );ξ t , At )dj ⎥ .
      ⎣                 0
                                                    ⎦



Real marginal costs are:
s ( y ( j ), Y ; ξ , A) = v y ( y ( j );ξ , A) / uc (Y ; ξ ) .



It follows that the elasticity of                                     v y ( y ( j );ξ , A)   with respect to y
is given by ω , and the elasticity of real marginal cost s with
respect to Y is given by
           Y ucc
σ −1 = −         > 0.
            uc



Efficient Level of the Output Gap


The steady state level of output is given by
                                                     (1 − τ )
s (Y , Y ;0,1) = v y (Y ;0,1) / uc (Y ;0) =                     ≡ 1− Φ
                                                        µ                ,


The symbol                Φ     Summarizes the overall distortion in the steady
state output level as a result of both taxation and market power:
(1)   τ   is the Woodford-Rothemberg sales-subsidy (financed by
lump sum taxes) that aims at neutralizing the monopolistic
competition inefficiency in the steady state); and
             θ
      µ=
(2)        θ −1    is the mark up as a result of producers’ market

power.
Efficient (zero mark up) output is thus given by
s (Y *,Y *;0,1) = 1 .

Note that         Y /Y *   Is a decreasing function of Φ , equal to one
when Φ = 0 .
This property enables us to get the approximation
log(Y / Y *) = −(ω + σ −1 )Φ   .
We can naturally define                x* = log(Y / Y *) = −(ω + σ −1 )Φ   as the
efficient level of the output gap.
Quadratic Approximation for U


A quadratic approximation of the utility function is given by

E j y t ( j ) = γ y t (1) + (1 − γ ) y t (2)

Cross-Variety Dispersion Measure in the Utility Criterion


Equation (3) can be rewritten

                   ⎨(ω + σ )( x t − x*) + (ω + θ ) var j y t ( j )⎬ .

Where, the term (ω + σ −1 )( xt − x*)2 originates from
 ⎡             ⎤
 ⎢u(Yt ; ξ t ))⎥ ,
 ⎣             ⎦
                                            ∧
And the term (ω + θ −1 ) varj y t ( j ) originates from

 ∫ ν ( y ( j );ξ , A )dj .

The familiar Dixit-Stigliz preferences over differentiated goods
imply
                           −θ
                   ⎛ p j) ⎞
   y t ( j ) = Yt ⎜⎜ t ⎟⎟
                   ⎝ Pt ⎠
  log y t ( j ) = log Yt − θ (log p t ( j ) − log Pt )
  ⇒
   var j log y t ( j ) = θ 2 var j log p t ( j )


  Ut = −
            Y uc
             2
                   {                                                      }.
                 (ω + σ −1 )( x t − x*) 2 + θ (1 + ωθ ) var j log p t ( j )




  Inflation and Relative Price Distortions


We postulate a             (γ ,1 − γ ) split       between the goods prices that are fully
flexible (group 1) and the good prices that are set one period in
advance (group 2).
  The aggregate supply relationship is:


  π t = E t −1π t + κx t
          γ σ −1 + ω
  κ≡
        1 − γ 1 + θω

  .
  Now we exploit the property that
log pt( 2 ) = Et −1 log pt(1)
log Pt = γ log pt(1) + (1 − γ ) log pt( 2 )


⇒
π t − Et −1π t = γ [log pt(1) − Et −1 log pt(1) ]
= γ [log pt(1) − log pt( 2 ) ]
⇒
var j log pt ( j ) = γ (1 − γ )[log pt(1) − log pt( 2 ) ] 2


    1− γ
=          [π t − Et −1π t ] 2
      γ

And substituting this relationship into U, yields




Ut = −(constant )Lt



                             1  γ  σ −1
                                        +ω
    Lt = (π t − Et −1π t ) +
                          2
                                           ( xt − x*)2
                             θ 1−γ 1+θω

    x* = (ω +σ −1)−1Φ

.
This means that Aggregate output and inflation
variations are proper arguments in the welfare
function. It is the output gap and the unexpected
inflation); and the relative weight that is placed
upon the two objects is related to slope of the
aggregate supply.
     III. The Open Economy


Razin and Yuen (2002) extended this closed-
economy                       framework                     to         an         open                economy.
Specifically, they derive the slope of the aggregate
supply relationship for various openness regimes.


Perfect Capital Mobility


If capital is perfectly mobile, then the domestic agent has a
costless access to the international financial market. As a
consequence, household can smooth consumption similarly
in the rigid price and flexible price cases.


 =>         Cˆ t = Cˆ tN




The Aggregate-Supply curve is:


                      γ ⎡ nϖ ˆ h ˆ N (1 − n)ϖ ˆ f ˆ N ⎤ 1 − n ⎛ 1                                 ⎞   ,
π t − E t −1π t =                  (Yt − Yt ) +        (Yt − Yt )⎥ +   ⎜⎜       eˆt − E t −1 eˆt ⎟⎟
                    1 − γ ⎢⎣1 + ϖθ              1 + ϖθ           ⎦   n  ⎝ 1 − γ                   ⎠
where, ê is a proportional deviation of the real exchange rate from
its corresponding steady state level, and                    Ŷt f   is a proportional
deviation of the rest-of-the-world output from its corresponding
steady state level.
The approximate utility function is:
U t = −(cons tan t ) Lt



                              1 γ       nϖ
Lt = (π t − E t −1π t ) 2 +                  ( x t − x*) 2
                              θ 1 − γ 1 + ϖθ

x* = (ω + σ −1 ) −1 Φ

Where, n denotes the number of domestically produced
goods, and 1-n denotes the number of imported goods. .


Closing the Capital Account


If the domestic economy does not participate in the
international financial market, then there is no possibility of
consumption smoothing, and we have that:


Cˆ t = Yˆt ; Cˆ tN = Yˆt N
In this case, the Aggregate-Supply Curve is:


                      γ ⎡ nϖ + σ −1 ˆ h ˆ N (1 − n)ϖ ˆ f ˆ N ⎤ 1 − n ⎛ 1                       ⎞
π t − E t −1π t =         ⎢        (Yt − Yt ) +        (Yt − Yt )⎥ +   ⎜⎜    eˆt − E t −1 eˆt ⎟⎟
                    1 − γ ⎣ 1 + ϖθ              1 + ϖθ           ⎦   n ⎝1− γ                   ⎠

                                                                   , where, e denotes the real

exchange rate.


The Loss function is:
U t = −(cons tan t ) Lt



                                1 γ 1 γ           nϖ
Lt = (π t − E t −1π t ) 2 +                            ( x t − x*) 2
                                θ 1 − γ θ 1 − γ 1 + ϖθ

x* = (ω + σ −1 ) −1 Φ




Closing the Trade Account (Back to the Closed
Economy)


If both the capital and trade accounts are closed, then the
economy is an autarky, completely isolated of the rest of
the world. In this case, all the goods in the domestic
consumption index are produced domestically, which
means that n = 1.
The Aggregate Supply Curve becomes:


                   ⎛ γ     ⎞⎛ ϖ + σ −1 ⎞ ˆ h ˆ N
π t − E t −1π t = ⎜⎜       ⎟⎟⎜⎜        ⎟⎟(Yt − Yt )
                   ⎝1− γ    ⎠⎝ 1 + ϖθ ⎠

The loss function is:
U t = −(cons tan t ) Lt



                                 1 γ 1 γ σ −1 + ω
Lt = (π t − E t −1π t ) 2 +                             ( x t − x*) 2
                                 θ 1 − γ θ 1 − γ 1 + θω

x* = (ω + σ −1 ) −1 Φ




IV. Comparing the Output Gap and Inflation Weights
                                        in the Loss Function


The weight of the output gap in each one of the openness
scenarios is given by:


               1      γ nϖ
(i)   ψ1 =                                            (Perfect International Capital and
              θ (1 − γ )(1 + θϖ )

Goods Mobility)
               1 γ ( n ϖ + σ −1 )
(ii)    ψ2 =                         (Closed Capital Account and Open
               θ (1 − γ )(1 + θϖ )

Trade)


             1 γ (ϖ + σ −1 )
(iii)   ψ3 =                         (Fully Closed economy)
             θ (1 − γ )(1 + θϖ )



We can see that,
  ψ1 <ψ 2 <ψ 3 .

(Note we implicitly assume that the price-setting fractions
(γ ,1 − γ )    across the different openness scenarios are the same;
empirically this assumption can be relaxed).


This means that successive rounds of opening reduce the
output gap weight in the utility-based loss function.


V. Conclusion


Global inflation has dropped from 30 percent a year to
about 4 percent a year. At this period a massive
globalization process also swept emerging markets in Latin
America and East Asia. This note put forth the hypothesis
that globalization induces the monetary authority, guided in
its policy by the welfare criterion of a representative
household, to put more emphasis on reducing inflation, at
the expense of larger output gaps. In such an endogenous
policy set up, globalization motivates central banks to
engage in pro-active disinflation policies.
