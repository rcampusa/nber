                       Bonuses and Employment in Japan




                                   ABSTRACT




     Japan has a relatively unique system of labor compensation. Most Japanese
workers are paid large bonuses twice a year. This paper examines the cyclical
movement of bonuses compared with wages and the relation of bonuses to
employment in the context of the Weitzman "share economy."
     The paper makes three basic points:
      (1) The Japanese bonus is much more pro-cyclical than Japanese base wages,
but not as cyclically variable as profits. Bonuses can be interpreted as con-
taining a quantitatively significant revenue or profit—sharing component.
      (2) Bonuses have quite different employment consequences than do base
wages. Even after controlling for other economic factors, bonuses are positi-
vely related to employment, whereas base wages are negatively related to
employment.
     (3) The bonus system of paying workers, while far from explaining the
whole macroeconomic story in Japan, seems to play a role in helping to stabilize
Japanese unemployment at comparatively low levels.

                         Bonuses and Employment in Japan


     The bonus payment system, by which Japanese workers receive upwards of one

quarter of their yearly pay in the form of semi-annual bonuses, is one of the

exotic features of Japanese labor markets that have long fascinated outsiders.

Recently interest has been heightened by the realization that the bonus system

may have important macroeconomic implications along the lines of a "share

economy."1 It is at least conceivable that some part of Japan's remarkable abi-

lity to stabilize unemployment at low, steady rates is due to the automatic pay

flexibility that comes.with profit or revenue sharing. For a subject of such

potential importance, the Japanese bonus system has been relatively little

studied.

     This paper reports the results of a detailed empirical analysis of Japanese

labor market data designed to address certain fundamental questions about the

bonus system. In it we analyse data on bonuses and other labor market variables

at the one and two digit industry level from 1958 to 1983, as well as data from

a case study of an individual firm. Our interpretations have been guided by the

results of interviews with Japanese employer federation representatives and

labor union officials.

I. Background

     The purpose of this section is to place the subject of the Japanese bonus

system in a broader context. This is important because the bonus system is only

one part of the complicated, interrelated web of institutions and attitudes

that constitutes Japanese labor relations. Although we have tried hard to guard

against a mono-causal interpretation of the Japanese labor market, it is quite

possible that in analyzing the bonus system we inadvertently overlook other

important aspects of the industrial relations system which have also influenced

the behavior under study.
                                        2

     The following stylized facts might be taken as roughly descriptive of how

the "Japanese model" of the labor market differs somewhat from others..2

     (1) Firms h-ire workers directly out of school for "lifetime employment"

(the shushin koyo system). In fact this -is done primarily by the large firms,

and only for their so-called "permanent" or "regular" employees(who constitute,

typically, half of all workers and three-fourths of those in manufacturing).

Nevertheless, the "lifetime commitment mentality" seems to be a fair charac-

terization of the Japanese system as a whole.3

     (2) There is a steep age-earnings profile for permanent workers up to

retirement age of 55 or, more recently, 60. Pay is influenced greatly by

seniority. (This nenko system is beginning to erode in many places as it

increasingly comes to be viewed as anachronistic.)4

     (3) The Japanese workplace is a relatively cooperative and egalitarian

environment. There are few work rules, job reassignments are common, and a high

degree of company loyalty motivates productivity-enhancing behavior.5 Unions

are organized along enterprise or company lines and include white collar as well

as blue collar workers. In addition, blue and white collar workers in the same

firm are comparatively less differentiated than elsewhere in terms of perquisi-

tes, treatment, method of payment (monthly salaries rather than hourly wages--

with meaningful bonus payments), and how much they are paid.

     (4) Japanese society as a whole displays a relatively intense commitment

at a grass-roots level to maintaining full employment. Companies and unions

seem almost ashamed to lay off workers outright. Moreover, layoffs are not

generally by seniority. There appears to be a high degree of social respon-

sibility in wage setting in Japan, as was dramatically shown by labor heeding

the 1975 call for wage restraint in the face of strong inflation caused by the

first oil shock. Work sharing is common, as Japanese firms tend to adjust hours
                                      3


more than employment and also to hoard more labor in downturns compared to most

other developed countries.6

     (5) Bonuses are important quantitively in the average worker's pay

(upwards of one-quarter of pay is in the form of a semi-annual bonus.) They

are also large relative to reported company profits, ranging from from 42—76

percent of operating profits before taxes from 1965 to 1983, and have come to

constitute roughly 10 percent of net domestic product.7

     The typical Japanese worker's pay is divided into two categories. The

first component is officially called kimatte shikyusuru kyuyo, "the wage that is

surely paid," which we will refer to simply as base wages, ---   although they
are not hourly wages at all, but rather a monthly salary. (Actually the concept

of "overtime" payments and work is not sharply differentiated in Japan,

suggesting that employment rather than person-hours is the fundamental Unit of

labor usage for regular workers.) The second component is called "special cash

payments" in the official statistics and the defining characteristic is held to

be that it is a payment made "temporarily, unexpectedly, or erratically at the

discretion of the employer." This category consists overwhelmingly of bonus

payments, even though their terms and amount are often established by collective

agreements and they are sometimes far from temporary, unexpected, or erratic.

     Bonuses are usually paid twice a year-- in summer (mostly June and July),

and at year end (December). Insignificant amounts are sometimes paid in August,

March, and January. Although blue-collar and low status white collar workers

before the war often received a lump sum of money twice a year in addition to

their regular pay, the small amount of money involved was in no way comparable

to the significant semi-annual profit—sharing bonuses received by high—status

white-collar employees with advanced educational backgrounds. It is only after

the Second World War that the payment system emerges in its present form, as
                                        4


part of a broader trend. The main feature of this trend was a de-emphasis, to

the point of near-elimination, of the invidious status categories of prewar

Japan with their implicit legacies of a feudal past. As one byproduct of the

immediate postwar process of democratizing the workplace, which the unions fully

supported, all regular employees-- blue collar and white-- were henceforth to be

paid a monthly salary instead of an hourly wage, supplemented by meaningful

semi-annual bonuses for every regular employee irrespective of category.8 The

bonus payments constituted less than two months' worth of supplement after the

war, rose gradually to over four months by 1973 and fell back to slightly more

than three and a half months currently.9

     The bonus system is widely viewed as serving three purposes. One purpose,

of particular relevance to this study, is that the bonus system provides some

pay flexibility to help firms maintain the lifetime employment commitment over

bad times and good. Another purpose is to compensate individual effort. Since

the bonus is more discretionary than the base wage of the neriko system (which

'is primarily related to length of service), management typically makes some part

of a particular employee's bonus depend on the merit appraisal of the individual

worker's job performance.10     Finally, the bonus emphasizes, symbolically and

practically, the common bond linking the company's well being with the well-

being of its regular workers.

     The timing of wage and bonus decisions generally differs. Across many

unionized companies base wage determination is the primary concern of the

economy—wide pattern-bargaining spring wage offensive (shunto) which usually

starts in February and peaks in April. Negotiations over bonuses are typically

done after wages are settled; and, according to management and labor represen-

tatives, are more sensitive to a company or industry's specific circumstances

than base wages, which are primarily dependent on the economy's national perfor-
                                          5
mance.

     Firms that consistently do well generally succeed in paying a fairly steady

number of months' wages as a bonus, so that in prospering sectors and times,

their bonuses are unlikely to vary much with cyclical conditions. An oft-cited

example of a firm that maintains such a policy is Toyota, which has paid about

the same months' worth of bonus in each year since 1968. But for every Toyota

Motor Company there are companies in, say, machine tools or shipbuilding where

bonuses may vary from two to ten months' pay in extreme economic conditions. At

one such firm, Okuna Machine Works, the standard deviation of the percentage

change of wages from 1957 to 1985 was 7, compared to a standard deviation of the

percentage change of bonuses of 29. Bonuses varied from 9 months to 2 months of

pay -in post-war years. The majority of firms hold a position in between

Toyota and Okuna. For all manufacturing firms aggregated together, the standard

deviation of the log change in bonuses from 1959 to 1983 was .072 compared to a

standard deviation of the log change of wages of .055.12

    Surveys conducted by Nikke-iren, the employers' federation, show that most

firms think of bonuses as being influenced by profitability. Among corporations

that make an explicit agreement with employees about bonus payments, some 15 of

such contracts contain profit-sharing clauses.13

The Key Issues

     There are three critical issues in evaluating the macroeconomic implica-

tions of the Japanese bonus system.

     First -is the extent to which bonuses are more "flexible" with respect to

profits or revenues than are wages, and thus operate as a form of profit or

revenue sharing.

     Second is the effect of bonuses on employment. If bonuses are a cost to

employers similar to wages, with no share component, bonuses plus wages are the
                                        6


relevant variable defining labor demand, with increases in bonuses reducing

employment just as increases in wages do; contrarily, if bonuses have a non-

negligible profit-sharing component, they might have a very different relation

to employment.

    The third, and perhaps most difficult issue to assess is the contribution

of a bonus system that operates along share economy lines to the overall perfor-

mance of the Japanese labor market.

     The remainder of the paper examines these three issues. Sections II and

III analyse the determinants of bonuses and the link between bonuses and

employment using data for the entire Japanese economy, for manufacturing, and

for more disaggregated two digit industries, largely within manufacturing.

Section IV turns to the macro-economic implications of our findings.

II. Economic Fluctuations and Bonuses

     Are bonuses more responsive to economic conditions than are wages, or are

bonuses simply a markup of wages?

     One direct way to examine the relative flexibility of bonuses and wages to

economic conditions is to regress the ratio of monthly bonuses to monthly wages

(the number of months of salary paid in bonuses, which is how most Japanese

think of them) on measures of aggregate or industry economic conditions, con-

ditional on past values of wages and bonuses.

     Table 1 contains the results of such an analysis for all industry and for

manufacturing in Japan. The dependent variable is the log of the ratio of bonu-

ses to wages from the series of the Japanese Ministry of Labor. To measure

economic conditions we have used: the log of profits (TT) as reported in the

Statistical Survey of Corporate Enterprise series of corporate operating profits

for firms of all sizes; and two related measures of revenues: net domestic

product (NDP) taken from the Japanese Economic Planning Agency data on net out-
                                        7



put by industrial origin at market prices; and corporate value added (VA) as

reported in the Statistical Survey of Corporate Enterprises. All of the nominal

variables are deflated by the wholesale price index series of the Bank of Japan,

with the manufacturing price series used for manufacturing, and all three indi-

cators of economic conditions are measured over the Japanese fiscal year (April

1-March 31), which correlates them more closely with the largely spring time

determination of upcoming wage and bonus levels than calendar year data. In

addition to the measures of economic conditions, the equations include a linear

and quadratic function of time, and lagged values of bonuses (B_i) and wages

(W..1) introduced separately to allow for differential autoregressiveness of the

series.

     The calculations provide a clear answer to the question of the relative

responsiveness of wages and bonuses to economic conditions: in every case, the

coefficient on the measure of economic conditions is positive and significant,

indicating that bonuses are more responsive to economic conditions than are

wages. Moreover, the coefficient on lagged bonuses is positive and that on

lagged wages is negative, of roughly comparable magnitude, indicating that a

"partial adjustment" type model of the bonus to wage ratio with persistence of

bonuses and wages over time is consistent with the data.

     To see whether the results hold up at a more disaggregated level of analy-

sis, we have estimated equations for the ratios of bonuses to wages for 2 digit

industries over the same time period. The results of this analysis are given in

table 2 in terms of the number of industries in which bonuses are more (less)

responsive to the relevant explanatory variable than are wages, categorized by

the size of the t statistic. As can be seen, the analysis supports the finding

that bonuses are more responsive than wages to revenues and profits at the two-

digit level of aggregation, with the vast majority of industries obtaining posi-

tive and often significant (t>2) impact coefficients. We conclude that although

bonuses are not a simple proportion of profits or revenues they depend substan-

tially on those variables, to a much greater extent than wages, and thus vary

more with economic conditions than do wages.

     How do bonuses and wages, taken as separate variables, respond to economic

conditions? Do both wages and bonuses both respond positively to conditions with

the table 1 results due to the greater responsiveness of bonuses, or are bonuses

responsive and wages inflexible?

     To answer these questions we have estimated the following equations:


     (la) log B A + AalogTT (or R) + (1-X)log B1 +      CT

     (ib) log W A' + bA'logTT (or R) +   (1-A')log   w-i +   c'T

    While the results of our analysis, given in table 3, show that bonuses are

invariably more responsive to conditions than are wages, the estimated coef-

ficients tell a somewhat different story for the effect of revenues than of pro-

fits on the two measures of pay. While both bonuses and wages are positively

related to revenues, only bonuses are significantly affected by profits. Since

our measure of profits is an "after-bonus" measure the finding of a positive

profit—bonus relation is particularly striking.14     Finally, note that

interpreting the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable as a partial

adjustment parameter, the implied adjustment parameter A is invariably larger in

the bonus than wage equation, strengthening the conclusion that bonuses are more

responsive than wages.


Alternative Specifications

    Thus far, we have estimated models in which bonuses and wages are endoge-

nous variables. Given the timing of negotiations noted in section 1, it is also

reasonable to examine a model in which wages are exogenous (given, say, by the
                                                11


Shunto Offensive) and bonuses dependent on wages and economic conditions.          If

bonuses are simply a markup of wages, as has sometimes been alleged, then the

profit or revenue variables would not have a significant effect in this

regression. Contrarily, if bonuses were determined solely by "sharing," the

wage term would not enter significantly.15

      To examine this possibility we estimate the following equation for all

industry and manufacturing:

       (2) log B= A + XalogTT (or R) +            (1-A)log    B_1 + AclogW + dT

     The results given in lines 1 and 2 and 5 and 6 of table 4 show that while

contemporaneous wages are closely related to bonuses, profits or revenues also

have highly significant effects, indicating that bonuses depend on both factors.

They are neither a pure markup of wages nor a pure markup of profits. Finally,

in the simple share economy model workers are presumed to be paid a fixed pro-

portion of profits per worker. To see whether our data are consistent with this

view we estimate an equation in which we replace profits and revenues by profits

per worker and revenues per worker. We record these results in lines 3 and 4

and 7 and 8 of table 4.          In this calculation we have simply divided fiscal year

profits (revenues) by fiscal year employment; we have also experimented with

calculations using last period's employment (see table 6). As employment is

relatively stable and profits highly variable it does not matter substantially

how we model the profit/employment or revenue/employment variable. As can be

seen in table 4, the resultant estimates ar-c consistent with our interpretation

of bonus determination as paying a share of profits per worker.

      Comparing our results to those of other scholars, we are in accord with

Koshiro and Weitzman, (who use somewhat different data) in finding bonuses to

depend significantly on profits; in addition, however, we find bonuses are

related to another measure of economic performance, revenues. With respect to

the responsiveness of wages to profitability, we cannot find any formal sta-

tistical evidence that base wages alone respond to profits, though we do find

that wages respond to revenues. Some of the Phillips-curve-like pay-formation

regressions in the literature have picked up, we note, a dependence of pay upon

profits.16 But in these exercises the authors typically attempt to explain the

formation of total pay--defined as wages plus bonuses and profits may be pri-

marily affecting the bonus component. On the basis of our findings the entire

subject of empirical Phillips curve measurements for Japan is worthy of reexami-

nation, with more careful attention focused on separating out base wages from

bonuses in the pay—formation process.

     Leaving aside the controversial issue of whether or not base wages them-

selves are more responsive to conditions than in other countries, we conclude

that in Japan bonuses respond more than base wages to economic conditions.

III. How Do Bonuses Affect Employment?


    The finding that bonuses contain at least some "share" component raises the

possibility that they have a different impact on employment than wages. In this

section we estimate several demand for labor type models designed to examine

the possibility. We start with a simple null hypothesis: that bonuses are

simply part of normal labor costs comparable to wages, so that the appropriate

measure of cost is (W+B), with the division of compensation between wages and

bonuses having no effect on outcomes. In particular we estimate two comparable

partial adjustment for-ms of a demand relation between employment (E), bonuses

(B), wages (W), and measures of the level of demand (X):


     (3a) ln E= A + bln(W + B)       +   XclnB + AdX   +   (1-A)ln     E_1 + eTime

     (3b) in E= A' +   A'b'lnW   +   X'c'ln(W   +   B) +   X'd'X   +   (1—X')ln E_1 + e'Time

     In equation (3a), the hypothesis that bonuses are just part of normal labor

cost -is tested by the coefficient on in(S): if the form of compensation is

irrelevant   to employment and the data are determined by demand forces, the coef-

ficient on in (B) will be (approximately) 0 while that on in (W + B) will be

negative. In equation (3b), the test of the hypothesis that the composition of

compensation is irrelevant to employment is that the coefficient on ln(W + B) be

negative and that on in W be zero. By including both bonus and wage variables

as separate factors in the equation our model differs from those of other ana-

lysts of demand for labor in Japan.17

     As the reader will note, it is the log form of the demand equations which

dictates estimation of the two comparable forms. If we modelled demand as a

linear equation, one of the two equations would be redundant.

     A significant problem with demand relations of this form relates to the

measurement of "level of demand" factors. Som analysts enter output measures

or output measures instrumented on other variables to measure the level of

demand. Other analysts prefer to exclude such variables due to the production

function relation between output and employment. Such exclusions yield reaso-

nable demand relations for some European countries but not for the U.S. (see

Symons and Layard). To make sure our results do not depend on how we treat

demand shift-variables, we include output measures in some regressions and

exclude them from others, with, as will be seen, little effect on our findings.

     Another problem with models of this form relates to specifying the causa-

lity as going from wages (bonuses) to employment in an aggregate economy with

extremely low unemployment. Most analyses of labor demand, in fact, focus on

manufacturing where one can plausibly argue that wages are set economy-wide,

making employment a function of wages at the sector level. A priori, one anti-

cipates that a demand model will fit a single sector better than it will fit an

entire essentially full-time employment labor market.

   Table 5 presents our estimates of the impact of wages, wages plus bonuses,

and of bonuses, on employment. Panel A treats the manufacturing industries where
                                        16


our results are particularly striking; Panel B treats the entire economy. The

even-numbered equations exclude output; the odd-numbered equations include out-

put as a measure of the level of demand. In addition to the calculations in the

table, we experimented with various other demand-shift variables (including

profits) and with instrumental variable estimates of demand shifts, instru—

nienting output on such factors as exports, money supply, etc. Because inclusion

of the output variables has only a modest impact on our estimated bonus and

wage coefficients, the way in which we treat demand shift variables is not a

critical issue in the analysis, (in contrast to the importance of output terms

in U.S. labor demand equations).

    The key finding, which runs through all the calculations, is that bonuses

have a markedly different effect on employment than do wages, obtaining positive

rather than negative coefficients in the estimates. When our two variables are

bonuses and bonuses plus wages the, coefficient on bonuses is significantly posi-

tive while the coefficient on wages plus bonuses is significantly negative.

When bonuses plus wages are included with wages, the wage term obtains a nega-

tive coefficient while the bonuses plus wage yields a positive coefficient.

    The strength of our finding differs, we note, between highly cyclical manu-

facturing and the rest of industry. In manufacturing, the two elements of com-

pensation have such different effects that we can fairly readily reject our null

hypothesis. In all industry, the weaker estimated negative effect of wages

(wages plus bonuses) on employment gives a more equivocal result, although even

here it is apparent that bonuses have a positive impact on employment different

from the effect of wages.18


Probing the Results

   The finding that bonuses are positively rather than negatively associated

with employment, (in contrast to wages) is sufficiently striking as to merit

additional probing.

    Could the result be due to some type of aggregation bias?

    To see if the result holds up at a more disaggregated level we estimated

equations like those in table 5 for separate two digit industries and found

results consistent with those in the table. In these calculations bonuses

obtain positive coefficients in 6 of 10 manufacturing industries in (3a) and

bonuses plus wages obtain positive coefficients in the same 6 in equation (3b),

with 5 of the positive coefficients having t>1.19 In 6

industries, by contrast, the results were weaker, which is consistent with the

weak economy—wide results obtained in panel B of the table.2° Our
                                                                      strongest

finding is clearly for manufacturing.

    Could the result be due to some form of reverse causality or related problem

in which bonuses and employment are positively correlated because increases in

employment (reflecting good times) cause higher bonuses?

    To examine this possibility we have estimated two lagged models which enable

us to "testt' whether employment determines bonuses or bonuses determine

employment by examining the lagged impact of bonuses on employment and of

employment on bonuses in the spirit of Sims-Granger causality tests. For

simplicity, we report results where all variables are defined on a calendar

year basis; the results with bonuses related to fiscal year variables as in our

earlier tables gives comparable results to those in the table. The results,

given in table 6, suggest that the causal link is from bonuses to employment

rather than from employment to bonuses.      In manufacturing, lagged bonuses have a

positive effect on employment (in contrast to the negative effect of lagged

wages on employment), while lagged employment has a negative effect on bonuses.

In all industry, bonuses have an insignificant positive impact on employment

(contrasted to a negative effect for wages) whereas employment negatively
                                         19
effects bonuses. These results are inconsistent with an employment causes bonu-

ses model but are, we note, consistent with a share model interpretation of the

data, as increases in employment reduce workers' earnings from profit sharing in

the share model.

    Taking our finding of a positive bonus-employment relation at face value,

how might we go about interpreting it?

    There seem to be two basic modes of interpretation: one in which bonuses

are viewed as operating along theoretic share economy lines; and one in which

bonuses are taken as an indicator of the level of demand in a given period.

     First, from a share economy perspective, one may want to read the result as

indicating that bonuses, while part of the attractiveness of jobs to workers,

are not fully part of the marginal cost of employment to firms. From this

perspective the data suggest that we are estimating a mixed supply and demand

reduced form equation, with W + B primarily reflecting supply influences on

employment and W primarily reflecting demand influences, with the gap between

them indicating the "excess demand" for labor in a share system.21

     What might one do to test such an interpretation? A purist would develop a

detailed econometric model of supply and demand disequilibrium to estimate the

"structural equations" and to evaluate the predicted excess demand for labor.

To implement such a program in practice would require more data on the Japanese

labor market than the wage, employment, and bonus series that we have analysed

here. For example, one would want some direct measure of the share parameter

that in principle determines the contract, rather than measures of bonuses.

(Bonuses differ significantly from share parameters -in that they change for two

reasons: changes in labor's share of profits (revenues) or changes in the level

of profits (revenues).) One would also want direct measures of vacancies by

sector and over time to indicate potential changes and differences in "excess
                                         20

demand for labor" as bonuses vary. It would also be useful to have evidence on

patterns of recruitment of new workers. In the absence of such data, and the

need to make specific and somewhat arbitrary assumptions about disequilibrium

forms, we are loathe to pursue this line with our data. Virtually any reaso-

nable disequilibrium formulation will end up with reduced form mixed supply and

demand equations like those we have estimated, with predicted coefficients

having signs like those we have found.

    A second possible interpretation of our finding is that bonuses are a

"proxy" for shifts in labor demand. We do not think that this offers as good an

interpretation of the data. First, we have attempted to control for such demand

shifts by the explicit inclusion of output terms, yet the signs on bonuses and

wages were unchanged. Additionally, the causal lag relation between employment

and bonuses we've found is inconsistent with this view. Furthermore, it is not

enough for a particular firm or sector to "demand" more labor in a full

employment economy; a plausible story must be told about how the labor is

obtained-—- e.g., through increased pay (W + B) on the supply side. Of course

it is still logically possible to argue that bonuses are a superior measure of

the level of the labor demand schedule. (After all, we did find them to vary

substantially with the cycle.) Even this interpretation, however, clearly sup-

ports the notion that bonuses are not part of normal labor cost.

    In any case, whatever the ultimate explanation, bonuses are different from

wages in Japan, in their effects on employment as well as in their sensitivity

to economic conditions. Without pushing the "share economy" interpretation of

the data too far, our results do seem to have the "flavor" of such a system.

IV. Macroeconomic Implications of the Bonus System

    We come now to the difficult question of whether the Japanese bonus system

influences macroeconomic performance, and more particularly, whether it helps

account for the low unemployment rates found in Japan over the last quarter

century.22 Other things being equal, it stands to reason that the existence of a

bonus component of pay with a more automatic pro-cyclical link than base wages

should help an economy to maintain a higher level of employment than if wages

alone were paid. But how important a factor, quantitatively, is this likely to

be in the Japanese case?   Given the current state of macroeconomics, with

widely divergent schools of thought, it is not clear how to pose the appropriate

hypothesis formally so that the existing data might, at least in principle,

allow us to extricate a reasonably controversy-free answer. Rather than trying

to confront the issue head on with a formal model, we limit ourselves here to

some rough calculations designed to give likely orders of magnitudes of effects.

    The bonus itself is about one fourth of an average worker's total pay.      By

running regressions in logarithms we have estimated the elasticity of aggregate

bonus response to changed aggregate profits at about .09 (see line 3, table 3).

Converting this parameter to a linear equivalent, the same elasticity of .09 is

obtained if 9 of the bonus payment is strictly proportional to profits, while

the other 91 is like a fixed constant. The folowing crude imputation can then

be made. About 2.259 (9 x 25) of a Japanese worker's total pay can be treated

as genuine profit sharing income, compared with the other 97.75, which for

economic purposes is better described as being like an imputed base wage.

    A rough check on this calculation is possible using our equations linking

bonuses to revenues. The elasticity of aggregate bonus payments with respect to

aggregate value added, or revenue, was estimated to be about .44 (see line 1)

table 3). Converting to an equivalent-elasticity linear revenue-sharing formula

makes 44 of the bonus payment strictly proportional to revenues, while the other

56 is like a fixed constant. If aggregate imputed base wages are roughly three

fourths of aggregate revenues, that leaves one fourth for gross profits. By

this calculation, 11(l/4 x 44%) of the bonus payment is strictly proportional to
                                                  23

 profits, while the rest is like a fixed constant. Following this line of

 reasoning, about 2.75 (11% x 25) of a typical Japanese worker's total pay can

be treated as genuinely proportional to profits, while the remainder is like an

 imputed base wage.

      Splitting the difference between the high (2.75) and low (2.25) calcula-

tions, we can make the following very rough statement:                        in any year about 97.5

of an average Japanese worker's total pay is like a fixed imputed base wage,

while 2.5 automatically responds directly to profits. If pay contracts are

annually renegotiated, the marginal cost to the employer of hiring an extra unit

of labor in any given year is just the (imputed) base wage, as opposed to total

pay.23 The relevant theory then predicts that the Japanese economy should

behave like an otherwise absolutely identical (but hypothetical) wage economy

whose wages are 2.5 lower than actual Japanese pay (base wages plus bonus) but

whose maintained levels of aggregate demand (autonomous spending, the money

supply, and world demand for Japanese exports) are the same.24 In other words,

-if someone who thought that Japan was a wage economy and has just now been

informed that it is in fact (partially) a revenue or profit-sharing economy

wants to know what difference that makes, the answer is: the same difference

as if money wages were perpetually 2.5 lower than what they appeared to be.

     While the exact ramifications of a 2.5 wage cut depend on the macro model in

which it is embedded, our reaction is neither to dismiss this effect as negli-

gible nor to argue that it is likely to represent an overwhelming factor in the

economy. At one extreme, assume a Keynesian monetarist-type model, in which a

2.59 reduction -in wages reduces prices by 2.5. Supposing, further, that this is

equivalent to a 2.5 expansion in output, then employment will increase 2.5?

(given constant returns to scale). At another extreme, assume that a 2.596

reduction in wages does not affect prices at all (they are set on world markets)
                                       24


so that the reduction in wages raises employment along a demand curve. If the

elasticity of demand is taken conservatively to be about one half, we would have

1 higher employment, giving us a range of employment effects from 13 to 2i.

    This kind of counterfactual historical exercise should be understood in

proper perspective. First of all, the calculations are extremely crude.

Secondly, they are based on a particular interpretation of a particular theory.

Thirdly the "thought experiment" is necessarily artificial.   (If there were

lower bonuses but higher base wages, it could be argued, wages might become more

flexible, timing in the economy might be altered, or fiscal or monetary policy

might be changed, perhaps thereby neutralizing some of the effects calculated

here.)

    These limitations notwithstanding, we think the exercise is useful for

gaining some rough insight into the likely size of what might be called the

"pure bonus effect." We interpret the orders of magnitude involved as

suggesting that the Japanese bonus system may have exerted a non-negligible

macroeconomic influence by helping automatically to boost employment without

inflationary pressure. But the significance of an "as if" 3 money wage cut

is not nearly so great as to account for the entire unemployment story, nor to

eliminate output fluctuations,25 nor to do away with the need for discretionary

policy to maintain full employment, especially in the face of severe economic

shocks.

    That the bonus system alone cannot possibly be explaining the entire

macroeconomic adjustment story is made abundantly clear by the extreme example

of Japan's response to the energy crisis. After the first oil shock, in 1974,

consumer prices increased by about 25 and wholesale prices by over 3O; output

in manufacturing and mining fell by 1O. At first the unions had no better pre-

monition than anyone else that a permanent terms—of—trade deterioration was
                                        25


underway, and were concerned to recoup lost purchasing power as well as to

obtain their customary pay increase. In the spring offensive of that year, base

wages jumped by 33, strike days lost were 2.? per 10,000, a rate double that in

previous years and above the rate -in the U.S. in many years. An observer

looking simply at these figures would have predicted that the Japanese economy

would have been more likely to have gone into a major stagflation decline than

the U.S. or European economies. But such was not the case. At this point, when

the mechanics of a potentially vicious wage—price spiral started to become evi-

dent, the famous Japanese consensus took over. Government officials, labor

experts, businessmen, and labor union leaders began preaching wage and price

restraint. The 1975 shunto saw base wages increase by only 13, and they have

been held to the single digit range since then; the consumer price index rate

of increase fell to 10.4, and while output -in manufacturing and mining declined

by 4.4 -in 1975 it rose by 10.8 in 1976. Strike days lost fell sharply to 0.9

per 10,000 in 1976 and to virtually zero in succeeding years.26

    Because base wages constitute three fourths of Japanese pay, and only part

of bonuses are responsive to profits (revenue), the deceleration of wage

increases was quantitatively more important -in stabilizing employment than was

the adjustment of bonuses. However much the Japanese bonus system may be

helping as an automatic employment stabilizer (months of bonus pay declined

sharply after 1974-- see the Appendix figures), in stepping back from high

inflation in the mid-1970s Japan relied upon flexible wage-setting to a greater

extent than flexible bonuses, as it had to, given the share of wages in total

compensation and the magnitude of the macroeconomic shock.

Conclus ion

    In this paper we have examined a relatively unique aspect of the Japanese

labor market -- payment of bonuses which constitute a quarter of workers! pay.
                                         26


Our analysis has rejected the notion that bonuses are just another form of wage

payment on two grounds:   (1) bonuses behave differently than wages over the

cycle, responding to profits and responding more to revenues than do wages; and

(2) bonuses affect employment differently from wages, having a positive rather

than negative link to employment. While bonuses are not set by pure share eco-

nomy principles,they are sufficiently responsive to profits or revenues and

affect employment in ways that have the flavor of a share economy. Our estimate

is that they contribute somewhat to the success of the Japanese economy by auto-

matically helping to stabilize unemployment at relatively low levels. The impor-

tance of reductions in the rate of change of base wages during the first oil

crisis, however, makes it clear that, as presently constituted, the bonus system

in Japan is by no means the main factor behind Japanese ability to weather

severe shocks of that kind better than most other developed countries. This

example highlights our basic conclusion. The bonus system helps Japan to main-

tain relatively tight labor markets, but so too do other, probably complementary

aspects of the Japanese system beyond the focus of this study.

 3. Koike (1983a), (1983b), and references therein, sometimes argues the

     contrary view that Japanese industrial relations, and particuarly the

     lifetime employment system, are not nearly so unique as is sometimes made

     out. He has a point when he does not push this view too hard. Another view

     is contained in Hashimoto and Raisian (1985). Tachibanaki notes that much

     of the difference in job tenure in Japan and the U.s. results from workers

     obtaining permanent jobs directly out of school in Japan whereas in the U.S.

     workers job shop before taking a permanent job.

    equation as a proxy for the omitted variable.

21. In terms of the usual supply-demand graph bonuses are a measure of the gap

   between supply and demand along the cost axis at the point where employment

    is set in a share economy.


22. It should be noted that Japan's number one status in having the lowest

    unemployment rate among major industrialized economies did not emerge until

    the 1970's. In the 1960's, some other countries like Germany had equally

   good employment records. There has been some discussion in the literature

    about the extent to which Japanese statistics may underestimate the

    unemployment rate by international standards. Taira (1983) and a few others

    have tried to argue this case. But it is not very convincing (see, e.g.,

    Sorrentino(1984), Hamada and Kurosaka(1985)). The basic point is that when

    reasonable adjustment measures are applied uniformly to all countries in an

    attempt to make international standards more uniform, then all

    countries' unemployment rates increase slightly, but without much altering

    their relative standing. Japan's unemployment record remains outstanding

    even after playing the readjustment game.


23. If the relevant contract adjustment period is more than a year, due to pay

    parameter stickiness, the profit-sharing component grows in importance rela-

    tive to the base wage component because of the distributed-lag difference

    equation buildup. In that case the effect of profit-sharing is somewhat

    more pronounced. It is hard to imagine how imputed base wages as seen by

    the employer could decline much more than about 56 below total pay.


24. See Weitzman(1985). The basic idea is that the effect on the firm of con-

   verting 2l of pay from base wages to profit shares is to lower wages by

    three percent while simultaneously being subjected to a compensating tax on

    profits.
                                         31

25. Depending on how output is detrended from its high growth rates, Japanese

    output stability might be judged outstanding or mediocre. Actually, Japan

    has the steadiest growth rate among all OECD countries over the past quarter

    century if it is measured by relative deviations from a standardized

    mean. In terms of absolute deviations from a non-standardized mean,

    Japanese growth shows much more cyclical variability. Note that, with a

    sprinkling of temporary price stickiness, the relevant model of a

    profit-sharing economy would predict relatively full employment but some

    building up of inventories, make-work, or labor hoarding during slack

    periods. Thus, the large Okun coefficient for Japan (see Hamada and

    Kurosaka (1984)) is not in itself a theoretical contradiction with share-

   economy-like interpretations.

                         January 1st of each year were shifted to a calendar year

                         The number of regular workers employed in establishments
                         with at least 5 regular workers, by industry, was esti-
                         mated with the following methodology:

                         A number of regular workers in firms with 30 or more
                         regular workers, available for December 31st of each
                         year. Japanese Ministry of Labor, Yearbook of Labor
                         Statistics, Labor Turnover Survey.

                         B= total number of employees in firms with 5 or more
                         regular workers. This data was available for December
                         31st of 1957, 1960 and 1963; data for other years were
                         interpolated between these figures. Japanese Census of
                         Establishments, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of
                         the Prime Minister.

                         C= total number of employees in firms with 30 or more
                         regular workers. Availability and source same as for B.

                         This series was then calculated as A*(B/C).
                         The ratio B/C is used as an estimate of the ratio of
                         regular workers in firms with 5 or more regular workers
                         to regular workers in firms with 30 or more (the actual
                         ratio was unavailable except for 1960.) A comparison
                         of the two ratios for 1960 by industry was favorable,
                         indicating that the estimate is a fairly good one. The
                         end of year data for 195863 was scaled to a first of
                         year basis based on the 1963/1964 comparison. The
                         first-of-year series was then shifted to a calendar year
                         average.

                           C= ratio of total employees to regular workers in firms
                           with 5 to 29 regular workers, for 1960. Japanese Census

                           This series was then calculated as A + (BxC). This end
                           of year data for 1958-63 was scaled to a first of year
                           basis based on the 1963/64 comparison. The entire
                           series was then shifted to a calendar year average.

                           Planning Agency overhauled its system of national
                           accounts, resulting in some discrepancies in the time
                           series. Because of this the 1970-79 (ARNA) series is
                           spliced on to the 1979-83 (ARNA) series, and 1958-74
