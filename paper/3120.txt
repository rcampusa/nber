               ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A CROSS SECTION OF COUNTRIES


                                    ABSTRACT

    In neoclassical growth models with diminishing returns to capital, a

country's per capita growth rate tends to be inversely related to its initial

level of income per person. This convergence hypothesis seems to be

inconsistent with the cross-country evidence, which indicates that per capita

growth rates for about 100 countries in the post-World War II period are

uncorrelated with the starting level of per capita product. However, if one

holds constant measures of initial human capital—measured by primary and

secondary school-enrollment rates—there is evidence that countries with

lower per capita product tend to grow faster. Countries with higher human

capital also have lower fertility rates and higher ratios of physical

investment to GDP. These results on growth, fertility, and investment are

consistent with some recent theories of endogenous economic growth. With

regard to government, the cross-country data indicate that government

consumption is inversely related to growth, whereas public investment has

little relation with growth. Average growth rates are positively related to

political stability, which may capture the benefits of secure property

rights. There is also some indication that distortions of investment-goods

prices are adverse for growth. Finally, the analysis leaves unexplained a

good deal of the relatively weak growth performances of countries in

sub- Saharan Africa and Latin America.

    In neoclassical growth models with diminishing returns to capital, such

as Solow (1956), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965), a country's per capita

growth rate tends to be inversely related to its starting level of income per

person.1 Therefore, in the absence of shocks, poor and rich countries would

tend to converge in terms of levels of per capita income. However, this

convergence hypothesis seems to be inconsistent with the cross-country

evidence, which indicates that per capita growth rates are uncorrelated with

the starting level of per capita product. Figure 1 Shows this type of

relationship for 98 countries. Using the data from the Summers-ileston (1988)

international comparison project, the average growth rate of per capita real

GDP from 1960 to 1985 (denoted CR6085) is unrelated to the 1960 value of real

per capita GDP (GDP6O)—the correlation is •Ø9•2 Although inconsistent with

standard neoclassical growth theories, these findings accord with recent

models, such as those of Rebelo (1987) and Lucas (1988), that assume constant

returns to a broad concept of capital, which includes human capital. In

these models the growth rate of per capita product is independent of the

starting level of per capita product.

    Models with constant returns to physical and human capital together also

allow for transitional dynamics. Rebelo (1987) and Lucas (1988) use a




'The idea is that the starting level of per capita income is a proxy for the
capital-labor ratio. The smaller the ratio the further the distance from the
steady state and the higher the transitional rate of per capita growth. For
further discussion, see Rebelo (1987).

two-sector production model, where one sector produces the usual kind of

product (consumables and capital goods) and the other sector produces human

capital. In this framework, the initial ratio of human to physical capital

can depart from its steady-state value. For example, if human capital is

high relative to physical capital (as in post-war situations where the main

wartime destruction applied to physical capital), the subsequent path way

feature high rates of physical investment and per capita growth. Then the

prediction is that a country's rates of physical investment and per capita

growth are increasing in its starting ratio of human to physical capital.

    Becker and Murphy (1988) also consider transitional dynamics related to

the level of human capital per person. They allow the rate of return on

human capital to increase over some range, an effect that could arise because

of spillover benefits from human capital. That is, the return to some kinds

of ability (such as talent in communications) is higher if other people are

also more able. [n this setting, increases in the quantity of human capital

per person tend to lead to higher rates of investment in human and physical

capital, and hence, to higher per capita growth. (This conclusion applies in

the Becker-Murphy model if the initial level of human capital per person is

high enough to escape a trap of underdevelopwent.) A supporting force is

that more human capital per person reduces fertility rates, because human

capital is more productive in producing goods or additional human capital

rather than more children.

   The existing theories suggest that growth rates and ratios of investment

to GDP may relate to the starting value of human capital differently from the

starting value of physical capital, which includes natural resources as well

as reproducible capital.     In• my empirical analysis, I use a proxy for human
                                                               3




capital that is based on school enrollment rates, and use initial real per

capita GDP to measure the starting value of physical capital. That is, given

the human capital proxy, differences in per capita GDP would reflect

differences in reproducible capital or natural resources.



Basic Results f.t Growth Rates

    Table 1 shows regressions f"r annual average growth rates of per capita

real GD?. Most of the results apply from 1960 to 1985 to a cross section of

98 countries (the largest number of countries on which I have been able to

assemble data on the variables employed). Since heteroskedasticity could be

important across countries, the standard errors for the coefficients are

based on White's (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix.

However, these standard rrors do not differ greatly from those obtained by

ordinary least squares. The table also includes regressions in which the

observations are weighted in accordance with the levels of gross domestic

product or population.

    The GD? data come from Summers and Heston (1988), while other variables

(to be detailed in a forthcoming data set) are from the United Nations, the

World Bank, Banks's (1979) data base, and some other sources. Means,

standard deviations, and definitions for all variables appear in Table 5, and

a list of countries is in Table 6. For the moment, I will concentrate on

results related to the initial (1960) values of per capita GD? and the human

capital proxies. The other variables, discussed later, are not strongly

correlated with these variables.
                                                                   4




    The two main proxies for human capital are the 1960 values of school-

enrollment rates at the secondary (SEC6O) and primary levels (PRIM6O).3

These variables, based on information from the United Nations, measure number

of students enrolled in the designated grade levels relative to the total

population of the corresponding age group. (Because of this definition it is

possible for the values to exceed 1.0.) Vith these school-enrollment rates

(and, less importantly, the other explanatory variables) held constant, thc

estimated coefficient on starting per capita product, GDP6O, in regression I

of Table 1 is negative and highly significant: - .0075, s.e. = .0012.    Since

GDP6O is measured in thousands of 1980 U.S. dollars, the result means that an

increase in per capita real GOP by $1000 lowers the real per capita growth

rate (CR6085) by .75 percentage points per year. Figure 2 plots CR6085, net

of the value predicted by all explanatory variables except GDP6O, versus

GDP6O. That is, the figure shows the partial correlation between CR6085 and

GDP6O. In contrast with Figure 1, there is now a strong negative

relationship (correlation =   - .74).   Thus, the results indicate that—holding

constant a set of variables that includes proxies for human capital—higher

initial per capita GDP is substantially negatively related to subsequent per

capita growth. The sample range of variation in GDP6O (in 1980 U.S. dollars)

from $208 to $7380 "explains" a spread in average per capita growth rates of




31t would be better to use proxies for the initial stock of human capital per
person rather than variables that relate to the flow of investment in human
capital. The stock of human capital derived from formal education depends on
current and lagged values of school-enrollment rates. In the subsequent
discussj•on I consider effects from lagged values of the school-enrollment
variables.
                                                                     5




about five percentage points. (The sample range in per capita growth rates

is -   .017 to .074, with a mean of .022.)

       Regression 2 adds the square of GDP6O; that is, instead of a linear form,

the relation between GR6085 and GDP6O is now quadratic. The estimated

coefficient of the square term is positive but only marginally significant

(t-value =    1.4),   while the coefficient on the linear term remains

significantly negative (t-value =      3.6).   A positive coefficent on the square

term means that the force toward convergence (negative relation between

growth and level) attenuates as per capita GD? rises. The point estimates

imply that the relation between growth and level is negative (holding

constant the other variables) only if real per capita GD? is less than

$10800. All values for GDP6O in the sample are below this figure, but values

for several of the industrialized countries exceeded this amount after 1960.

For example, the U.S. real per capita GOP surpassed $10800 in 1977.

       Another result in regressions 1 and 2 of Table 1 is that per capita

growth is positively related to the proxies for initial human capital,

holding fixed GDP6O and the other variables.4 The estimated coefficients of




4As noted before, the quadratic in GDP6O in regression 2 implies that the
marginal effect of the level of GOP on growth becomes nil when GDP6O reaches
$10800. For GDP6O above $10800, the quadratic implies a positive relation
between level and growth, but the true relation may remain close to zero.
That is, the quadratic can be viewed as an approximation to a functional form
that asymptotically approaches a zero relation between growth and level, with
the relation coming close to zero when real GD? is above $10000. The
human-capital variables, SEC6O and PRIM6O, are positively correlated with
GDP6O (correlations of .79 and .65, respectively). However, the
school-enrollment rates each have an upper asymptote of around 1007., and each
rate would typically be close to this asymptote once real GD? reached $10000.
Thus, even considering the interplay between human capital and per capita
CD?, it is likely that convergence effects would be absent once per capita
real CDP was above $10000.
                                                                6




SEC6O and PRIM6O are individually significantly different from zero, with

t-values in regression 1 of 3.8 and 4.4, respectively. A joint test for the

significance of the two school-enrollment variables leads to the statistic,

F5 = 18.5.
    Figure 3 shows the relationship between the per capita growth rate, net

of the value predicted by the regressors other than the school-enrollment

variables, and a linear combination of SEC6O and PRIMCC. (The variable on

the horizontal axis is .0305 x SEC6O + .0250 x PRIM6O, corresponding to the

coefficients estimated in regression 1 of Table 1.) The partial correlation

of CR6085 with the human capital proxy is .73, as opposed to a simple

correlation of .43. (Figure 4 shows the simple relation between CR6085 and

the human capital measure.)

    Note from Figure 3 that the sample range of the human capital proxy

t'explain&' a range of variation in per capita growth rates of about five

percentage points; that is, roughly the same range as that related to CDP6O

in Figure 2. Thus, given the strong positive correlation (.77) between GDP6O

and the human capital measure, the results are consistent with the lack of a

simple correlation between CR6085 and GDP6O, as shown in Figure 1. Increases

in initial GDP per capita that are accompanied by the typical increase in

human capital per person are not systematically related to subsequent growth.

But increases in initial CUP per capita with human capital held fixed are

strongly negatively related to subsequent growth. Similarly, increases in

human capital with CDP6O held fixed are strongly positively related to

subsequent growth.

    The results can be highlighted by noting three kinds of situations where

an imbalance between GDP per capita and human capital leads to significant
                                                                 7




effects on subsequent growth rates. Many of the Pacific rim countries have

initial (1960) school-enrollment rates that are high relative to those

typically associated with the initial value of real GDP per capita. For

example, for Japan, the value of SEC6O is .74, as compared to the value of

.31 that would be predicted from a regression of SEC6O on a quadratic

function of GDP6O. For Korea and Taiwan, the values of PR1M60 are .94 and

.96, respectively, as compared to the corresponding predicted values of .61

and .66. According to regression 1 in Table 1, the relatively high values

for initial school-enrollment rates raised the estimated growth rates by .015

for Japan, .014 for Korea, and .012 for Taiwan. With this effect included,

the fitted value of the growth rate for Japan, .057, is close to the actual

value of .058. For Korea and Taiwan, the adjustments are in the right

direction but are insuffient to explain the high rates of growth: for

Korea, the fitted value is .037 and the actual is .060, while for Taiwan, the

fitted value is .041 and the actual is .057.

    The typical country in sub- Saharan Africa has 1960 school-enrollment

rates that are low relative to the values associated with 1960 per capita GDP

in the full sample. This pattern likely reflects physical capital from the

colonial era that is high in relation to the amount of initial human capital,

as well as relatively high quantities of natural resources. For example, the

relatively low values for school enrollment reduced the estimated growth

rates by .012 for Ethiopia (fitted value for growth of .001 versus an actual

of .003), .011 for Sudan (fitted value for growth of - .003, actual of -   .008),
and by .011 for Senegal (fitted value for growth of .004, actual of .000).

Given the remaining explanatory power of a dummy variable for Africa, as
                                                                 8




discussed later, it may be that the present specification does not capture

this effect fully.

    Finally, the oil-exporting countries typically have high values of GDP6C

relative to their 1960 school-enrollment rates. The sample includes six

members of OPEC: Algeria, Gabon, Indonesia, Nigeria, Iran, and Venezuela.5

For Gabon, the school-enrollment rates are higher than would be predicted

based on GDP6O (which helps to explain Gabon's high growth rate), while for

Indonesia, the discrepancies are small. For the other four oil countries,

the shortfalls of the school-enrollment rates from the predicted values

reduces the estimated growth rate by an average of .012. Except for Iran,

this effect improves the fit for growth rates.



Measurement Errors     Related Issues

    Romer (1989) notes that a result such as that shown in Figure 2 would be

sensitive to measurement error in GDP. If there is temporary measurement

error, future growth rates of GDP will automatically have a negative

correlation with the starting level. However, for this effect to account fo

the findings, measurement error has to be very large, as well as temporary.

For example, a 107. error in GDP that is corrected over the subsequent 25

years affects the computed annual average growth rate by only - .004.   This

value contrasts with the range of variation of about .05 that GDP6O appears




5My earlier study (Barro, 1989a) deleted the oil countries. However, with
initial measures of human capital included along with initial per capita GOP
these countries can be satisfactorily incoporated into the sample. Without
the human capital variables, the oil countries particularly look like
outliers with respect to fertility behavior, which is analyzed later.
                                                               9




to explain. For analogous reasons, business-cycle fluctuations in GDP could

not explain very much of the results.

    If measurement error in GOP were short lived, no estimation problem would

arise in the relation between the 1960 level of per capita GOP and, say, the

average growth rate of per capita GOP from 1970 to 1985 (GR7085). Regression

3 in Table 1 shows that the estimated coefficients for GDP6O, SEC6O, and

PRIM6O are not much affected by this change in the dependent variable. Thus,

measurement errors (or business-cycle effects) can be important for the

results only if they persist in substantial magnitude over periods longer

than ten years.

    Regression 4 shows that the conclusions do not change greatly if GDP7O is

added along with GDP6O (with the growth rate from 1970 to 1985 as the

dependent variable). Although the high correlation (.98) between CDP6O and

GDP7O implies high standard errors, the sum of the two coefficients is close

to that for GDP6O in regression 3. The estimated relation between per capita

growth and level of per capita GOP also looks similar if GDP7O is entered as

a regressor with GDP6O used as an instrument.

    Presumably, measurement error in GDP would be proportionately more

 important for the low-income countries. In fact, the squared residuals from

regression 1 of Table 1 have a correlation of - .23 with GDP6O. Regression 5

shows that the estimated coefficient of GDP6O changes little if the sample is

restricted to the 54 countries for which GDP6O exceeds $1000 per capita.

Regression 6 shows that the results also do not change greatly if the

observations are weighted by the square root of GDP6O (which is appropriate

 if the variance of the error term is proportional to the reciprocal of

 GDP6O). Regression 7 indicates similar findings when the weight is the
                                                                10




square root of population (where population is measured at the midpoint of

the sample for each country). This standard weighting scheme is appropriate

if the variance of the error term is proportional to the reciprocal of

population.6 However, the correlation of the square of the residuals from

regression 1 with population is only - .12.



Other Measures j Human CaDital

    Regressions 8-12 attempt to improve the proxies for initial human

capital.   Regression 8 adds the 1950 values of the school-enrollment rates

(SEC5O and PRIM5O) to a regression for CR6085. From the standpoint of the

human capital available at the start of the sample in 1960, prior values of

school enrollment would be more important than the 1960 values. Although the

point estimate for SEC5O in regression 8 is positive, neither of the 1950

schooling variables are statistically significant. Since the estimated

coefficients for SEC6O and PRIM6O remain significantly positive, the results

cannot be attributed to the high correlation (.83 for secondary and .86 for

primary) between the enrollment-rate variables for 1950 and 1960.

    A possible explanation for the results is that the U.N. data for 1950 are

less accurate than those for 1960 and later years. Some support for this

view comes from regression 9, which includes enrollment rates for 1960 and

1970 in a regression for the growth rate from 1970 to 1985 (CR7085). For the




6This weightin scheme would arise if the growth rate of per capita CDP were
an average of independent values for each person in the population. As many
people have noted, this view is an uninteresting theory of the error term,
since the error would likely vanish in the mean of several million
independent observations. If the error term relates to common aggregate
forces or to model specification, the error variance need not be closely
related to population.
                                                                        11




primary-school variables, PRIM6O is significantly positive, while PRIM7O is

insignificant. Neither of the secondary-school variables are separately

significant because of the high correlation (.94) between SEC6O and SEC7O.

(The correlation between PRIM6O and PRIM7O is only .84.)

    As an attempt to measure differences in the quality of education across

countries, I used data on student-teacher ratios in the initial year, 1960.

Regression 10 for GR6085 shows that the ratio for primary c!ools (S1'TEAPRI)

has a negative coefficient (t-value =     1.9),   which accords with the idea that

a higher ratio signals lower quality education. Student-teacher ratios for

secondary schools in 1960   were   available for only 88 of the 98 countries.

Regression 11 shows that the estimated coefficient of this variable

(STTEASEC) differed insignificantly from zero.

    Regression 12 uses tLe human-capital proxy employed by Romer (1989)—the

1960 adult literacy rate (LIT6O). With the school-enrollment rates entered,

the estimated coefficient of LIT6O is negative (t-value =       2.0),    which is

difficult to interpret. (If the school enrollment variables are excluded,

the coefficient of LIT6O is significiantly positive.) The literacy rate is

attractive in that it relates to the stock of human capital rather than to

the flow of investment. On the other hand, literacy rates appear to be

measured in an inconsistent way across countries, and are particularly

inaccurate for the less-developed countries. The school-enrollment rates,

although not immune from measurement problems, are likely to be more accurate

and more consistent cross sectionally.



Fertility     Investment

    The theories where the initial values of human capital and per capita CDP
                                                                     12




matter for subsequent growth rates also suggest relations with fertility and

investment. Table 2 shows results for fertility. The variable FERT is the

average of the 1965 and 1985 values of the World Bank's estimate of the tota

fertility rate (the projected average number of live births for the typical

woman over her lifetime). FERTNET is FERT x (1 - MORTO4), where MORTO4 is

the average of the 1965 and 1985 values of the World Bank's figures on

mortality rates for children aged zero through four. Thus, FERTNET is the

per woman number of children who will live beyond the age of four.

       Figures 5 and 6 show the strongly negative simple correlations between

FERTNET and GDP6O (-    .74) and between FERTNET and a human capital proxy
(-   .87).   (The human capital measure is 3.01 x SEC6O +   1.56 x PRIM6O, based on
regression 15 in Table 2). In regression 15, the two school-enrollment rates

have significantly negative coefficients,. while the coefficient of GDP6O is

insignificant. Thus, for a given value of per capita GDP, more human capital

is associated with lower net fertility, as would be suggested by Becker and

Murphy (1988), among others. For given human capital, higher per capita CD?

(which means more physical capital or natural resources) has an insignificant

relation with net fertility.

      Regression 16 shows that, with no adjustment for child mortality, gross

fertility (FERT) is positively related to the child mortality rate, MORTO4.

But regression 17 indicates that the estimated coefficient of MORTO4 is no

longer significantly different from zero when FERTNET is the dependent

variable. That is, the adjustment of fertility rates to reflect the fraction

of children that do not survive past the age of four is sufficient to account

for most of the positive relation between gross fertility and child

mortality. (From the standpoint of the costs of raising surviving children.
                                                               13




one would predict, if anything, a negative relation between MORTO4 and

FERTNET.) Regression 18 shows that population growth (averaged for each

country from 1960 to 1985) relates to GDP6O and the human capital variables

in a way consistent with the findings for fertility rates.

    Table 3 contains results for ratios of real physical investment to real

GDP. Regressions 20 and 21 refer to private investment (1Pr1'/), and

regressions 22 and 23 to the total of pi-ivate and public investment (i/y).

The figures on i/y come from Summers and Ileston (1988); note that these

values reflect variations across countries in the ratio of the investment

deflator to the GOP deflator. Values for i"/y equal i/y less estimates of

the ratio of real public investment to real GOP. The data on public

investment are described in Barro (1989a). (Figures on nominal public

investment were divided .y the Summers- Heston deflators for total investment,

and were then divided by real GD?; this procedure is appropriate if the

deflators for total investment are good approximations to the deflators for

public investment.) Values for public investment at the level of

consolidated general government (but excluding most government enterprises)

were found only for the 1970-85 period, and only for 76 countries.

Therefore, 1Pt"1 is an average of values from 1970 to 1985 for this limited

sample.

    The simple correlations of i'"/y are .42 with GDP6O and .64 with a

human capital proxy (.131 x SEC6O + .079 x PR1M60, based on regression 20 of

Table 3)—see Figures 7 and 8. With GDP6O and the school-enrollment

variables entered together, as in regression 20 of Table 3, the estimated

coefficients of SEC6O and PRIM6O are significantly positive, and that on
                                                                  14




GDP6O is significantly negative. That is, holding fixed the human capital

measures, the partial association between jPlS'/y and GDP6O becomes negative.

       Regression 22 shows results for i/y. (This variable is measured over the

period 1960 to 1985, but the main difference from regression 20 is the shift

from private to total investment, and not the change in the averaging

interval for the dependent variable.) The results for total investment are

broadly similar to those for private investment, but the estimated

coefficient on GDP6O is smaller in magnitude.

       The results in Tables 1-3 treat per capita growth, fertility, and

investment as endogenous variables that are jointly determined by the

right-hand side variables (although the exogeneity of some of the explanatory

variables can surely be questioned). In theoretical models, such as Becker

and Murphy (1988) and Barro (1989b), per capita growth and the investment

ratio tend to move together, while per capita growth and net fertility tend

to move inversely. That is, even holding constant the explanatory variables

included in the regressions, the theories predict that the residuals from the

equations for CR6085 and i/y (or CR6085 and i'"/y) would be positively

correlated, while those for CR6085 and FERTNET would be negatively

correlated. The results from Tables 1-3 accord with this pattern. For

example, using regression 1 for CR6085, regression 22 for i/y, and regression

15 for FERTNET, the correlation of residuals is .32 between CR6085 and i/y

and -   .26 between CR6085 and FERTNET. Using regression 20 for            the

correlation of the residuals for CR6085 and iP''"/y (for 76 countries) is

.40.

       Another way to bring out these patterns is to consider regressions for

per capita growth in which an investment ratio and net fertility are included
                                                                       15




as regressors. Regression 24 of Table 4 shows that the estimated coefficient

of i/y is significantly positive: .068, s.e. = .032.        With FERTNET added in

regression 25, the estimated coefficient of i/y is still significantly

positive, and that for FERTNET    is   significantly negative:
                                                                 -
                                                                     .0043, s.e. =
.0014.

    Even with i/y and FERTNET held constant, the coefficient of CDP6O in

regression 25 (- 0fl77, s.e. =   .0009) is about the same as that in regression
1 of Table 1. Therefore, the negative effect of the level of per capita CDI'

on the subsequent growth rate does not work through effects on investment and

net fertility (see regressions 22 and 15). The main channel appears to be a

lower rate of return on investment. On the other hand, the estimated

coefficients on the school-enrollment variables in regression 25 are much

smaller than those in rezression 1. Thus, the positive effects of the

school-enrollment rates on CR6085 in regression 1 reflect partly the positive

relation between school enrollment and i/y (regression 22 in Table 3) and the

negative relation between school enrollment and FERTNET (regression 15 in

Table 2).



Effects of Other Variables

    Government ExDenditures

    In previous analysis (Barro, 1989a, 1989b), I found that the ratio of

real government consumption expenditure to real GDP (gC/y) had a negative

association with growth and investment. The argument was that government

consumption had no direct effect on private productivity (or private property

rights), but reduced saving and growth through the distorting effects from

taxation or government-expenditure programs. Coverninent consumption is
                                                                      16




measured by the Summers-Heston (1988) figures on the ratio of real government

consumption purchases to real GDP, less estimates of the ratio of nominal

government spending on education and defense to nominal 6DP The idea is

that expenditures on education and defense are more like public investment

than public consumption; in particular, these expenditures are likely to

affect private-sector productivity or property rights, which matter for

private investment. I used nominal ratios for education and :fense because

deflators were unavailable. Since the numbers on education and defense are

averages for 1970-85, the data on gC/y are averages over this period.

      The results in Table 1 indicate a significantly negative association

between gc/y and growth; for example, in regression 1 the estimated

coefficient is - .12, s.e. =   .03.7   Figure 9 shows the nature of this

relationship—the variable on the vertical axis is the per capita growth rate

net of the fitted value obtained from all regressors other than gc/y• Table

3 shows that gc/y also has a negative association with private investment;

the estimated coefficient in regression 20 is - .24, s.e. =    .12.        However,

regression 22 shows that the relation with total investment is insignificant

(-   .02,   s.e. =   .11).
      A negative effect of gC/y on investment is one route whereby more

government could reduce growth. However, even with the investment ratio held

constant, the relation between gC/y and growth is significantly negative.

For example, in regression 24 of Table 4, which holds constant i/y, the

estimated coefficient on gC/y is - .12, s.e. =    .03.



7Jf entered separately, the ratios to CUP of overnment expenditures on
education and defense are each insignificant in an equation for per capita
growth. These types of results were discussed in Barro (1989a).
                                                              17




   Regression 26 of Table 4 includes the public investment ratio, g'/y, as

an explanatory variable. The estimated coefficient, .13, s.e. = .10, is

positive, but insignificantly different from zero. I discussed this variable

in my earlier empirical study (Barro, 1989a), and mentioned some difficulties

in interpreting the estimated coefficient in terms of the marginal product of

public services. In any event, regression 27 shows that public investment

plays no special role if the total investment ratio, i/y (for 1970-85), is

also included as a regressor. Given i/y, which includes public investment

one-to-one with private investment, the estimated coefficient on g'/y is

essentially zero. Similarly, regression 28 shows that the estimated

coefficient of the ratio of public to total investment, g'/i, differs

insignificantly from zero.



    Political Instability

    I included two variables from Banks's (1979) data set to measure

political instability. The variable REV is the number of revolutions and

coups per year, and the variable ASSASS is the number per million population

of political assassinations per year. Each of these variables is

significantly negative for growth in Table 1. The variable REV is also

significantly negative for the investment ratios in Table 3, while ASSASS is

significantly negative in regression 20 of that table.8 I interpret these

variables as adverse influences on property rights, and thereby as negative




8With these political instability variables and the school-enrollment rates
included, Gastil's (1987) ordinal indices of political rights or civil
liberties are insignificant for growth, fertility, or investment. Iy earlier
study (Barro, l989a) included the index of political stability as an
explanatory variable.
                                                                  18




influences on investment and growth. However, regression 25 of Table 4 shows

that the coefficients on REV and ASSASS are still negative for growth when

i/y and FERTNET are held Constant. It is possible that these results reflect

a positive influence of growth on political stability, rather than (or in

addition to) the effects of stability on growth.



    Economic System

    Gastil (1987) divided countries into economic systems with respect to the

role of government. I used this breakdown to construct a three-way division

into primarily socialist, mixed between socialist and free enterprise, and

primarily free enterprise. The estimated coefficient on the dummy variable

for socialist (SOC) is negative on growth in regression 13 of Table 1

(t-value =   1.8),   while that for mixed systems (MIXED) is essentially zero.

Since the division of economic systems into groups is subjective and since

there are only nine "socialist" countries in the sample (which excludes the

eastern European countries), these results are not very reliable.



    Market Distortions

    It is often argued that distortions of market prices impact negatively oi

economic growth (see, for example, Agarwala, 1983.). Because of the intimate

connection between investment and growth, such market interferences would be

especially important if they apply to capital goods. As an attempt to

quantify these types of market distortions for a large sample of countries,

considered the purchasing-power-parity numbers for investment goods that wer

computed by Summers and Heston (1988). It is well known (for example, from

Balassa, 1964) that PPP ratios calculated with broad price indices, such as
                                                                    19




GDP deflators or consumer price indices, are systematically related to the

level of economic development and perhaps to the presence of natural

resources and other variables. Figure 10 shows the significantly positive

relation for the 98 countries between the 1960 PPP ratio based on the GDP

deflator (PPPY6O) and GDP6O. This relation presumably reflects the

relatively low prices of services and some other non-traded goods in

low-income countries. On the other hand, Figure 11 indicates the absence of

a regular relationship between the 1960 PPP ratio based on the investment

deflator (PPPI6O) and CDP6O. To proxy for market distortions, I would have

filtered out the normal relation of PPPI6O to variables such as the level of

income. But, given the absence of a systematic relation in Figure 11, I

calculated just the magnitude of the deviation of PPPI6O from the sample

mean. In this view, eitir artificially high investment prices or

artificially low investment prices proxy for distortions.

    The regressions in Table 1 indicate a significantly negative relation

between growth and the magnitude of the PPPI6O deviation (denoted PPI600EV)--

the estimated coefficient in regression 1 is - .014, s.e. = .005.        This result

implies that a one-standard-error (.25) increase in the magnitude of PPPI6O

is associated with a reduction in the per capita growth rate by 4-tenths of a

percentage point. On the other hand, the sign of the deviation does not seem

to matter; if the algebraic value for purchasing-power parity, PPPI6O, is

added to the equation, its estimated coefficient is insignificant (-       .001,
s.e. =    .005),   while that on PPI6ODEV remains significant (- .014, s.e. =

 .007).   Not surprisingly, the results in Table 3 indicate that the algebraic

value, PPPI6O, matters negatively for the investment ratios. (However, this
                                                                 20




 relationship could be induced from measurement error in the investment
                                                                          pric
 deflators.)

     These results on the relation of growth and investment to market

 distortions are preliminary. I plan to look further into alternative

 measures of price distortions, including the indices of effective protectioi

 in manufacturing and agriculture that Agarwala (1983) compiled for a limite

 sample of countries



    Africa and Latin America

    A common view is that countries in Africa or Latin America have poorer

growth performances than other countries. Of course, if the nature of
                                                                          being
in Africa or Latin America is already held constant by the other explanator)

variables, continent dummies would be insignificant in equations for
                                                                        growth,
fertility, or investment. Thus, the finding of significant coefficients on

these dummies would indicate that some regularities are missing from the

model.

    The dummy variable AFRICA equals one for countries in sub-Saharan Africa

and the dummy variable LAT. AMER. equals one for countries in South and

Central America, including Mexico. The estimated coefficient on AFRICA is

significantly negative for GR6085 (Table 1, regression 14) and significantly

positive for FERTNET (Table 2, regression 19).   Although the point estimates

are positive, the estimated coefficients for the investment ratios differ

insignificantly from zero (Table 3, regressions 21 and 23).   Holding fixed
i/y and FERTNET in regression 29 of Table 4, the estimated coefficient of

AFRICA in a growth equation is still significantly negative, with a magnitud

of about one
               percentage point per year. Thus, there appear to be adverse
                                                                 21




effects on growth from being in sub-Saharan Africa, and these effects do not

result from the unexplained behavior of the investment ratio or fertility.

    The variable LAT.AMER. is significantly negative for CR6085 (Table 1,

regression 14) and significantly positive for FERTNET (Table 2, regression

19). For the investment ratios, the point estimates of the coefficients are

negative, but not statistically significant at the 5 level (t-value of 1.3

for Pr1\'1 in regression 21 of Table 3 and t-value of 1.6 for    i/ n
regression 23). Again, the negative effect on growth—with a magnitude of

about one percentage point per year—appears even when i/y and FERTNET are

held constant (Table 4, regression 29). Thus, it appears that something is

also missing to explain the typically weak growth performance in Latin

America.

    Note from a comparis of regressions 1 and 14 of Table 1 that one effect

from the inclusion of the AFRICA and LAT.AMER. dummies is a reduction in the

estimated coefficient of SEC6O in the equation for CR6085 from .0305,

s.e =   .0079, to .0133, s.e. = .0070 (see also regressions 25 and 29 in Table

4). The average value of SEC6O for sub-Saharan Africa is well below the

sample mean (.04 versus .23), while that for Latin America (.19) is slightly

below the sample mean.9 The variables SEC6O and PRIM6O are imperfect proxies

for the level of human capital, which is especially low in Africa.    But,

since these proxies are imperfect, it may be that continent

dummies_especially the one for Africa—retain some explanatory power for

human capital and hence for the rate of economic growth. If this

 interpretation is correct, a better proxy for human capital would eliminate

the AFRICA dummy as a significant influence on growth. However, the

variables considered before—student-teacher ratios, prior values of

school-enrollment rates, and the adult literacy rate—do not eliminate AFRI(

as a significant variable.



Concluding observations

    Using recent theories of economic growth as a guide, this study brings

out some empirical regularities about growth, fertility, and investment for

98 countries in the period 1960-85. Although the simple correlation between

per capita growth and the initial (1960) level of per capita GDP is close to

zero, the correlation becomes substantially negative once initial human

capital per person (proxied by school enrollment rates) is held constant.

Moreover, given the level of initial per capita GDP, the growth rate is

substantially positively related to the starting amount of human capital.

Thus, poor countries tend to catch up with rich countries if the poor

countries have high human capital per person (in relation to their level of

per capita GDP), but not otherwise. As a related matter, countries with hig

human capital have low fertility rates and high ratios of physical investmen

to GDP.

    Per capita growth and the ratio of private investment to GD? are

negatively related to the ratio of government consumption expenditure to GDP

An interpretation is that government consumption introduces distortions, suc

as high taic rates, but does not provide an offsetting stimulus to investment

and growth. On the other hand, there is little relation of growth to the

quantity of public investment.
                                                               23




    Measures of political instability (proxied by figures on revolutions,

coups, and political assassinations) are inversely related to growth and

investment. These relations could involve the adverse effects of political

instability on property rights and the linkage between property rights and

private investment. However, the correlation could also reflect a political

response to bad economic outcomes.

    A proxy for price distortions (based on pirchasing_power parity numbers

for investment deflators) is negatively related to growth. These results are

preliminary but do suggest a payoff to further research on the interplay

between economic growth and government-induced distortions of markets.

    Finally, the results leave unexplained a good deal of the relatively weak

growth performances of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

That is, the analysis do's not yet isolate the fundamental characteristics of

the typical country on these continents that lead to below-average economic

growth.

Notes to Table 1:

See Table 5 for definitions of variables.

Standard errors of coefficient estimates appear in parentheses. Except for
the weighted reressions 6 and 7, the values are based on White's (1980)
heteroskedasticity- consistent covariance matrix.


For regression 6, only the 55 observations with GDP6O above £1000 per capita

were used. For regression 7, the observations are weighted by IGDP6O, and

for regression 8 by 4ii1. In these cases the statistics for It2 and o- shown
in parentheses are the weighted values.
