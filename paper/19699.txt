Accounting for Income Changes over the Great Recession (2007-2010) Relative to Previous

                                            ABSTRACT

With data from the March CPS and using shift-share analysis, we analyze the factors that account
for changes in post-tax post-transfer income during each of the past four recessions. What distinguishes
the Great Recession is that drops in employment rather than wage earnings drove income declines.
In addition, taxes and transfers played a much greater role in offsetting market income losses —a result
largely missed in analyses that do not account for taxes and transfers. This is particularly so among
the bottom quintile of the distribution where lower and increased transfers offset more than one-half
of the market income declines.

       Median pre-tax in-cash income fell more over the first three years of the Great Recession

(2007-2010) and its aftermath than over the first three years of any other recession since the

March Current Population Survey (CPS) first enabled this statistic to be measured annually in

1968. However, there was an unprecedented governmental response in the form of tax cuts and

government transfer increases, including both in-cash (Unemployment Insurance, etc.) and in-

kind (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits (SNAP) or Food Stamps, etc.) benefits. These

tax and transfer responses substantially offset this loss of market income for middle- and lower-

income Americans. Here we estimate the importance of these government actions and other

factors that account for trends in median income as well as mean income in the bottom and top

quintiles over the Great Recession and compare it to previous recessions. In accounting for

income trends, we not only consider government tax and transfer policies, but also the

importance of employment, demographics and source-specific income. Doing so provides a more

complete understanding of why the Great Recession and its aftermath presented policymakers

with a different type of economic crisis and the way they responded to it.

       Using a shift-share analysis to compare the factors underlying income trends in each of

the past four recessions, we show that the falling real earnings of those who remained employed

played a relatively minor role in household income declines during the Great Recession. Instead,

drops in employment primarily drove these income declines, which would have been much

greater, except for the unprecedented role of public tax and both in-cash and in-kind transfer

policies. Because previous decomposition studies have not included the role of either tax policies

or in-kind transfers, they will greatly understate the increasing role that government policies have

played in mitigating median income declines and understate the resources that were available to

Americans over the Great Recession.



                                                 2
Data

         We primarily use the public use March Current Population Survey (CPS) supplemented

with cell-means for top-coded incomes from Larrimore et al. (2008) in our analyses.1 Although

the public use CPS data is commonly used for evaluating U.S. income and income inequality

trends (see e.g. Gottschalk and Danziger 2005, Daly and Valetta 2006, and Blank 2011), it

measures income on a pre-tax basis and only includes transfers when they are received in cash

form. We will refer to this basic Census Bureau measure of income as “pre-tax” income. Since

policymakers are increasingly using tax policies and in-kind transfers to mitigate income

declines during recessions, it is necessary to supplement the CPS data with data on taxes and in-

kind transfers. We will refer to this enhanced income measure which also accounts for taxes and

in-kind transfers as “post-tax” income.

         We generally use the same procedures for estimating the value of in-kind transfers, tax

credits, and tax liabilities as in Armour, Burkhauser, and Larrimore (2013). The Census Bureau

imputes the value of SNAP (food stamps), housing subsidies, and school lunches on an annual

basis. We use these values in our estimates. Each are now generally recognized as important

resources primarily available to low income households, and the Census Bureau now includes

them as resources in their Supplemental Poverty Measure (Interagency Technical Working

Group, 2010).2 We impute the value of tax credits and liabilities using the NBER TaxSim 9.0.

1
  Larrimore et al. (2008) demonstrates that the public use CPS data supplemented with cell-means for top-coded incomes
produces results for income and income inequality trends that closely match those found in the internal CPS data used by the
Census Bureau to produce their official income statistics (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2013).
2
  While there is general agreement that the full market value of these in-kind transfers should be included in any measure of
income, including employer- or government-provided health insurance benefits at their full market value is more controversial.
Some researchers, including Armour, Burkhauser, and Larrimore (2013) and CBO (2012) include health insurance benefits at
their full market value, but they are not included as resources in the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure or at their
full market value for those in poverty in Census Bureau studies (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor and Smith 2013, Interagency Technical
Working Group 2010, and Short, 2012). Here we take the most conservative approach and value them at zero in our analysis, as
the Census Bureau (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor and Smith 2013) and CPS-based researchers (see e.g. Gottschalk and Danziger 2005)
have traditionally done. Including them at their full market value would substantially increase the level of government in-kind
transfers and their growth would offset a portion of the declines in market income over the years of our analysis.


                                                              3
These tax credits and liabilities include federal and state tax liabilities as well as FICA and

SECA taxes based on the tax laws in effect in each year (Feenberg and Coutts 1993, provide an

overview of the NBER TaxSim program). Since the CPS samples households, which may

include multiple tax filing units, we divide each household into tax units prior to imputing tax

liabilities using the same procedure in Burkhauser et al. (2012), which is based on the same

assumptions regarding potential tax units as first used in Piketty and Saez (2003).

          Our unit of analysis is the individual and we adjust our measure of post-tax household

income to account for economies of scale in household consumption by dividing total income by

the square-root of household size and assigning this value to each member of the household.3 All

income is adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index Research Series (CPI-U-RS)

(Stewart and Reed 1999).

Long-term trends in median income

          Figure 1 shows the trends in the median size-adjusted household income of persons

between 1979 and 2012, both using our pre-tax (dashed-line) and post-tax (solid line) income

measures. We normalize income to 1.00 in 1979 to show percentage change since 1979 for all

other years. We denote peaks of each business cycle (1979, 1989, 2000, and 2007) with solid

vertical lines, and troughs (1983, 1992, and 2004) with dashed vertical lines.4

          Regardless of whether it is measured on a pre-tax or a post-tax basis, median income

traditionally has risen over time when compared at equivalent points in the business cycle,


3
  This size-adjustment is commonly used in U.S. and cross-national studies of inequality (see e.g. Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997,
Atkinson and Brandolini 2001, Burkhauser et al. 2011) as well as by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in its official measures of income inequality and poverty (d’Ercole and Förster 2012). It also closely
matches the adjustments for household size implied by the Census Bureau poverty thresholds (Ruggles 1990).
4
  Official NBER macroeconomic business cycle recession years are denoted in gray vertical bars in Figure 1. In our analyses
peak and trough business cycle years are defined by peaks and troughs in median income with one exception. Because median
income only slightly increased in 1983 and unemployment rates persisted above 10 percent for half of that year, we consider
1983 rather than 1982 to be the last year of that recession. In addition, because median income declined continuously in the early
1980s we consider the 1979-1983 double-dip recession as if it was single continuous recession.


                                                                4
although it is sensitive to business cycle variations. This is the case for both the 1979-1989

business cycle—pre-tax income rises by about 9 percent—and the 1989-2000 business cycle—it

increases by about 13 percent. Post-tax income rises by similar amounts over these two business

cycles.

          However, over the 2000-2007 business cycle median pre-tax income stagnates. In

contrast, post-tax median income rises by 2 percentage points over this period. Hence, while both

series record slower growth in median income in the early 2000s, for the first time accounting for

government taxes and in-kind transfers substantially increases the rate of median income growth

over a full business cycle.

          Moreover, the divergence between our pre-tax and post-tax series continues through the

Great Recession. Between 2007 and 2008, while pre-tax median income fell by almost 4

percentage points, post-tax median income fell by less than 1 percentage point. As we will argue

below, this largely reflects the enactment of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and subsequent

temporary tax measures enacted in response to the Great Recession. The Economic Stimulus Act

provided a tax rebate of up to $1,200 for a married couple plus $300 for each dependent child.

The tax rebate in the Economic Stimulus Act was a one-time payment, but it was replaced in

subsequent years by the Making Work Pay Tax Credit in 2009 and 2010, as part of the American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) of 2009, and by a 2 percent payroll tax holiday

starting in 2011 as part of the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job

Creation Act of 2010. We will show that these tax policy interventions, together with increases

in in-kind transfers—both of which are missed by conventional measures of pre-tax income—

substantially cushioned the decline in resources actually available to the average American

during the Great Recession and did so to a much greater extent than in previous recessions.



                                                 5
Hence these interventions and increases should be included in any income measure when

attempting to show the role of government policy in mitigating income losses, or simply tracking

the resources available to American households.

Median income trends during economic declines

        Researchers commonly compare business cycle peaks to peaks or troughs to troughs, as

we did above, to strip income trends of business-cycle variations. But it is also possible to focus

on the relative severity of economic downturns across business cycles by examining similar

periods in each business cycle. This can be done by comparing a fixed length of time after each

peak year. Since two of the last four economic declines lasted just three years, we examine the

recessions by comparing the first three years of economic decline following each business-cycle

peak.

        The first column of Table 1 reports the percentage changes in median pre-tax income

(household size-adjusted pre-tax, post in-cash income of persons) during the first three years of

each recession since 1979. This closely matches the income definition used by the Census

Bureau in their official economic reports (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2013). Using this

income measure, the severity of the most recent recession is evident as median income fell by

almost seven percentage points in real terms from 2007 through 2010. This is more than one

percentage point greater than over the severe 1979-1982 recession and is more than double the

2.59 percentage point decline in median income that followed the peak of 2000.

        But as Column 2 shows this is no longer the case once we include taxes and in-kind

transfers. While doing so adds to the measured drop in median income in the 1980s recession, it

reduces the drop in income over all other recessions. As a result, while the drop in median post-

tax income during the Great Recession remains greater than in the previous two recessions, it is a



                                                 6
less severe decline than that seen over the 1979-1982 recession.

       This pattern is even starker when we focus on the change in the mean income of the

bottom quintile of the distribution in columns 3 and 4. Using a traditional pre-tax measure of

income, the drop in mean income for the bottom quintile is slightly greater over the 1979-1982

recession (-13.96 percent) than over the Great Recession (-12.26 percent), but once taxes and in-

kind transfers are included the gap widens (-13.23 percent vs. -4.10 percent). Once taxes and in-

kind transfers are included, the decline in the post-tax income of the bottom quintile of -4.10

percent during the Great Recession is no greater than they experienced in the previous two

recessions and is the same as the decline experienced during the Great Recession for the median

American (-4.10 percent).

       Government tax and transfer policies during recessions are often thought to account for

less of the change in mean income for the top quintile of the distribution. But given the

progressive income tax structure and the increased use of tax cuts to offset the effects of

recessions on income, this is not always the case. As can be seen in columns 5 and 6, this was

most evident in the 2000 recession, where the passage of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief

Reconciliation Act (“EGTRRA”) in 2001 and the Job Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act

(“JGTRRA”) in 2003 reduced tax liabilities for higher income households and pushed their

income trends positive during this recession. (Appendix Table 1 provides a summary of major

tax policy changes enacted in each year of economic downturns, including those from EGTRRA

and JGTRRA. See Tax Policy Center 2011a and 2011b for a more detailed description of tax

policy changes in each year.) But reductions in tax liabilities also improved mean income trends

for the top quintiles in the 1989 recession and the Great Recession, while increases in tax

liabilities slightly exacerbated their income declines in the 1979 recession. Once again focusing



                                                 7
on pre-tax income, the most basic Census Bureau income measure and the one most often used

by CPS-based researchers, will inaccurately measure actual trends in the resources of Americans

that incorporate taxes and in-kind transfers (post-tax income).

       In what follows, we focus solely on post-tax income and more precisely measure what

sources of income are accounting for changes in median post-tax income and changes in the

mean income of the bottom and top quintiles of the post-tax income distribution.

Method of accounting for shifts in income distributions

       To isolate the factors that account for these changes over the last four recessions, we use

a shift-share analysis similar to Burtless (1999), Iceland (2003), Daly and Valetta (2006), and

Larrimore (forthcoming). Shift-share analysis does not demonstrate causality but it is a common

method for accounting for changes in household income via changes in demographic and source-

level income. It does so by allowing the demographic composition (age, race and marital status)

and the sources of income of our population to change, one factor at a time, thus separately

accounting for changes in income and income inequality. To avoid double counting, we consider

the impact of each factor conditional on previously considered factors. For example, we account

for the importance of declining marriage rates on changes in income, conditional on the age and

race of the individual.

       Embedded within this approach are four distinct techniques for decomposing income

distribution changes. The first considers changes in the fraction of the population in

subpopulation groups, including demographic groups or employment statuses. The second

considers changes to source-level income distributions within these subpopulation groups, but

keeps the rank-correlation of income sources constant. The third considers changes in the

correlation of income sources over time. The fourth and most important for this paper, for



                                                 8
analyzing tax changes, separates the policy-neutral tax liability changes that occur as a result of

changes to underlying taxable income in a progressive tax system from those that occur from

new tax policies.

          The first three of these decomposition techniques are employed in Larrimore

(forthcoming) and Burkhauser and Larrimore (forthcoming). Larrimore (forthcoming) also

provides a further discussion of the decomposition approach, including discussions of robustness

to order of analysis and variants to the sharing unit definition.5

          Changes in the prevalence of subpopulation. Our first decomposition technique is based

on Atkinson (1998) and Burtless (1999). It accounts for changes in the frequencies of categorical

characteristics in the population—including demographic trends. For example, it considers how

an increase in the share of Hispanics in the total population will change the overall income

distribution, holding the income distribution of whites, blacks, and Hispanics unchanged.

          This technique reweights observations from the base year, t, such that the weighted

fraction of the population in each demographic group matches that in future years, t’. We

increase the weight of individuals with characteristics (e.g. Hispanic) that are more prevalent in

year t’ than in year t. This allows us to estimate the impact of changing the prevalence of those in

the total population with this characteristic without altering the underlying income distributions

within each group. In all cases, the base year, t, is the starting year of the business cycle. The

comparison year, t’ , is the comparison year during the trough of the business cycle.

          Changes in source-level income distributions within population groups. The second
5
  As with all shift-share analyses, a potential concern is that the order of analysis may impact the results due to the interaction
between the considered factors. While this concern cannot be completely eliminated without analyzing all possible analysis
orders, it is mitigated here for several reasons. First, in a similar analysis of inequality changes over the past 30 years, Larrimore
(forthcoming) analyzed effects in both the order of those presented here and its reverse and found that the results were largely
consistent. Second, since interaction effects should increase with longer time periods, this concern is smaller for our analysis of
just the recession periods. Additionally, since our primary analysis is comparing effects in the same way across different
recessions, the comparison will be impacted only if interaction effects differ substantially from one recession to the next. Since
there is no reason to expect this to be the case, we do not expect the order of analysis to impact our findings greatly.


                                                                   9
decomposition technique is based on Burtless (1999) and Daly and Valetta (2006). It

incorporates the fact that the income distribution within each subpopulation group is changing as

well. These changes can result from any income source.

       In doing so, note that each individual’s income,      can be represented as the sum of their

incomes from each income source,         through         :

                                                     ⋯                                        (1)

We assign individuals a percentile rank,      , for each income source based on the rank of their

source-level income within their subpopulation group k. For now, the correlations of individuals’

positions in the distribution of source-level incomes (rank-correlations) within each

subpopulation group are assumed to be constant. This allows us to separate the importance of

changes to income from a given income source from the change in the relationship between

separate income sources.

       To estimate the impact that changes to the distribution of source f1 have on income

inequality, each individual’s income from the source f1 in year t is replaced with the income of

the individual at the same percentile rank of the source f1 income distribution in year t’:

                                                 ⋯                            (2)

This preserves the conditional earnings rank of each individual from source f1 and the rank-

correlation of earnings from source f1 with other income sources, while capturing changes in the

source-level income distribution of source f1 within each population group. Since this procedure

combines income across years, prior to the analysis all income is adjusted for inflation using the

CPI-U-RS.

       Changes in income-source rank correlations within subpopulation groups. The previous

techniques hold the rank-correlation of income sources constant. That is, if the male and female


                                                 10
at percentile-ranks      and      in their conditional earnings distributions are married to each

other in one year, we assume the same rank pairing will continue in all future years. By

performing these rank-preserving income exchanges for sources f1 and f2 separately, we are able

to analyze the impacts of the separate earnings distributions without impacting the correlation

between the two:

                        ,                                           ⋯                  (3)

       To update the correlation between sources f1 and f2, rather than dividing income into N

separate sources, we divide income into (N-1) sources such that g1 = f1 + f2 while f3 through fN

are unchanged. We capture the rank-correlation change of sources f1 and f2 by combining these

sources before the rank-preserving income exchange rather than after. Thus, calling each

individual’s percentile-rank in the g1 distribution     , we calculate estimated incomes as:

                                                  ⋯                                    (4)

This updates the correlation between sources f1 and f2 along with their income distributions. We

capture the impact of the changing correlation between sources f1 and f2 by comparing the results

in the case where only their separate income distributions change (Equation 3) with the case

where their joint distribution changes (Equation 4).

       Changes in tax policies. Even in the absence of new tax policies, individuals’ tax

liabilities will change over time in response to income changes. If taxable income increases, then

tax liabilities should as well, partially offsetting the increase in resources from those pre-tax

income gains. Conversely, if taxable income declines then the reduction in tax liabilities partially

offsets the fall in pre-tax income. However, tax liability changes may also result from new tax

policies. Since this distinction is important for interpreting the relationship between taxes and

income trends, we separate these two effects.


                                                  11
          We first consider the policy-neutral tax change. In the sequential analysis, changes to tax

liabilities are recomputed separately from changes to the underlying incomes that feed into tax

computations. The policy-neutral tax change uses the NBER TaxSim program with the tax laws

from year t but the incomes from year t’ to observe how much tax liabilities would have

increased or fallen if tax policies were left unchanged over the period of analysis, given the

income changes previously observed in the analysis. This method for isolating policy-neutral tax

changes is similar to those previously employed in the U.K. by Clark and Leicester (2004), in

European countries by Bargain and Callan (2010), and in the U.S. by Kasten, Sammartino, and

Toder (1994) and Bargain et al. (2011).6 In all cases, constant policy taxes are based on inflation-

adjusted tax brackets, where the brackets from year t are adjusted using the CPI-U-RS up to price

levels from year t’ (see Kasten, Sammartino, and Toder, 1994, for an illustration of how failing

to do so dramatically increases policy-neutral tax liabilities due to inflation pushing individuals

with unchanged real incomes into brackets with higher marginal tax rates).7

          We then rerun the NBER TaxSim program using the actual tax laws in effect in year t’ to

determine the portion of tax changes attributed to new tax policies. The increase or decline in tax

liabilities from this second NBER TaxSim analysis relative to that observed in the policy-neutral

analysis is the change attributed to the new policies.

Accounting for shifts in median income during economic declines

6
  This approach approximates a “constant policy” baseline where tax changes scheduled to take effect in the future are not part of
current policy, rather than a “constant law” baseline, where they are. For example, under the policy-neutral approach the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
(JGTRRA) were assumed to continue to follow the policies from 2007 and would not expire after 2010. Had they expired, this
would have been treated as a policy change even though it would have been due to inaction rather than new legislation.

  This is critically important with respect to the period prior to 1985 when income tax brackets were not automatically indexed to
inflation—that is, when inaction on the part of government allowed inflation to lower the “bend point” in the real income
distribution where the marginal tax rate increased, effectively increasing average and marginal taxes for many individuals. Our
approach to inflate tax brackets using price inflation when separating constant policies from new policies matches that of Bargain
et al. (2011) and Clark and Leicester (2004). Kasten, Sammartino, and Toder (2004) and Bargain and Callan (2010) also inflate
tax brackets, but base inflation on income growth rather than price growth. We are not aware of any previous research that does
not incorporate an inflation adjustment for tax brackets when isolating policy-neutral tax effects.


                                                               12
          The values in Row 1 of Table 2 repeat values first reported in the second column of Table

1—the decline in median post-tax income during the first three years of each economic downturn

since 1979. The rest of the rows in Table 2 show how much each factor accounts for these trends

using the shift-share method described above.

          This analysis starts with three major demographic trends: an aging population, a more

racially and ethnically diverse population, and the decline in the rate of marriage in the

population.8 Rows 2 through 4 of Table 2 illustrate the change in median income accounted for

by changes in the demographic makeup of the country. These estimated effects focus exclusively

on changes in the number of people in the demographic groups and not on changes in the income

gaps between these groups over the various recession years. We will capture this latter change in

the decomposition of changing source-level income distributions below.

          Given that demographic factors generally do not change substantially over the 2- to 4-

year period of a recession, we include these factors largely as controls for demographic patterns

which can influence long-term income distribution trends. These demographic trends, especially

with respect to the growing Hispanic population who typically have lower mean incomes,

provide a baseline level of median income decline in all recessions. Furthermore, this baseline

median income decline is greater in the last two recessions than in the first two. However, with

the exception of the early 2000s recession these factors account for less than 16 percent of

median income declines in each recession and generally cannot explain differences in the

severity of income declines across the recessions.9


8
  Aging patterns are considered using four categorical age groups: children (0-18), young adults (19-44), older adults (45-64) and
the aged (age 65 and older). Races and ethnicities considered are white non-Hispanic, black, and Hispanic. Other races are
included with white non-Hispanics because the small size of these groups prevents analyzing them separately. Marital status is
the marital status of the household head, who can either be married, a single male, or a single female.

  See Burkhauser and Larrimore (forthcoming) for a further discussion of the impacts of changing demographics and the large
racial income gap on long-run income trends, including their expected impacts in future decades.


                                                               13
       The differences between the Great Recession and previous recessions become apparent

when considering the changes in specific income sources. In doing so, we first focus on the

primary members of a household. We separate them into male household heads or the spouses of

household heads, which for short we call “primary males,” and female household heads or the

spouses of household heads, which for short we call “primary females.” (In the CPS data,

individuals are defined as household heads if they are the primary owners or primary renters of

the dwelling.) This separates the impact of working children and other secondary earners from

that of primary males and primary females in our analysis. In rows 5 and 6 of Table 2 we focus

on the employment and earnings of primary males. In rows 7 and 8 we focus on the employment

and earnings of primary females. Together, we observe that the labor earnings of these primary

members of households represented 86 percent of all labor earnings in the United States in 2010.

       During each recession since 1979, the employment rate of primary males declined, which

accounts for a portion of the reduction in median household income (Row 5 of Table 2).

However, the decline in median income that their declining employment accounts for was greater

during the 2007-2010 recession (2.32 percentage points) than any of the previous three

recessions and over one-third of a percentage point greater than during the first three years

(1979-1982) of the 1980s recession.

       In contrast, as can be seen in Row 6 of Table 2, the decline in median income accounted

for by changes in the earnings distribution of primary males who were still employed during the

2007-2010 recession (1.98 percentage points) was substantially smaller than the 4.01 percentage

point decline during 1979-1982. Thus, declining male employment rates—not declining male

wage earnings—was the most important factor accounting for the severity of the first three years

of the Great Recession: a dramatic difference from the first three years (1979-1982) of the last



                                                14
great recession.

       The first four columns of Table 3 provide an explanation for the changing importance of

primary male earnings and employment on median size-adjusted post-tax income. Over recession

years 1979-1982, the decline in primary male full-time employment (5.51 percentage points) was

much smaller than over 2007-2010 (6.85 percentage points). Consistent with findings of Sum

and Khatiwada (2010) of substantial underemployment in the Great Recession, there was also a

concurrent increase in part-time work between 2007 and 2010 exceeding that of other recessions.

However, the mean earnings of full-time primary male workers over recession years 1979-1982,

dropped by 3.90 percent. This compares to a 0.93 percent increase in earnings of full-time

primary male workers for 2007-2010. This may, in part, be because layoffs and reduced hours in

the Great Recession impacted low-wage workers to a greater extent than that seen in earlier

recessions. But it also may reflect more real wage stability in the Great Recession than in earlier

periods of economic decline.

       One potential explanation for this relative decline in the importance of falling earnings

over the Great Recession relative to the early 1980s recession is the different influence of

inflation over the two periods. Over 2007-2010, inflation was at historic lows (1.6 percent

annually) while over 1979-1982 inflation was very high (9.4 percent annually). Given the

evidence of moderate downward nominal wage rigidity, real wages may be less likely to decline

in periods of low inflation (see Kahn 1997 and Card and Hyslop 1997 and Altonji and Devereux

2000 for further discussions of sticky nominal wages). To the extent that wages are sticky and

preventing downward adjustments, this may lead firms to increase their reliance on layoffs to cut

costs during an economic decline. In contrast, during periods of high inflation real wages can fall

more easily without lowering nominal wages. This can then reduce employers’ reliance on



                                                15
reducing employment to cut costs during the downturn.

         A similar picture emerges when considering the employment and earnings of primary

females (Rows 7 and 8, Table 2). During the 1979-1982 and 1989-1992 periods, their full-time

employment grew despite the recession and therefore offset other factors accounting for

declining median income. The strength of the long-term secular movement of women into the

work force during the 1970s and 1980s overwhelmed any cyclical employment declines during

recession years. However, by the 2000s, the secular movement of women into the work force

slowed and no longer offset cyclical declines in female employment during recession years.10

This change in secular patterns, along with the severity of the Great Recession, resulted in

primary female employment declines from 2007 to 2010. Over this period, their employment

declines accounted for a 0.89 percentage point decline in median income, which is a reversal

from 1979-1982. The combined decline in primary male and primary female employment in

rows 5 and 7 of Table 2 accounted for a 3.21 percentage point decline (2.32 plus 0.89) or 78

percent of the 4.10 percentage-point decline in median income over the first three years of the

Great Recession. Thus, while the median income declines in the 1979-1982 recession were

driven by the substantial drop in real earnings of working primary men, the median income

declines in the Great Recession were driven by the declines in employment of primary men and

primary women.

         Row 10 of Table 2 looks at the earnings of all other workers in the household. Although

primary men and women comprise the vast majority of workers, earnings of other members also

fell, accounting for 0.99 percentage points of the fall in median income in the Great Recession.


10
  Blau and Kahn (2007) document the slowdown in female labor supply growth in the 1990s. More recent statistics from
Macunovich (2010) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2011) indicate that female labor force participation for adults age 16 and
over peaked in 2000 and fell over the past decade.


                                                               16
This is less than any of the previous recessions. However, this may actually reflect the severity of

the recession if households combine to weather the economic storm, thereby increasing the

number of employed adults in a household.11 Nevertheless, there is much less variation in its

importance in accounting for changes over the four recessions and these secondary labor

earnings declines reduce household income in all periods.

          Row 11 of Table 2 looks at private non-labor income. It declines in all recession periods

except the recession of 1979-1982 where an increase in this income source offsets the decline in

other sources of private market income. Part of the explanation for this increase may be the high

real rate of return on bonds over this period due to inflation expectations. In contrast, the average

rate of return on bonds during the Great Recession was much lower.

          As we alluded to earlier, market income is only part of the story when considering

income trends during recessions. Tax policies along with public in-cash (e.g. Unemployment

Insurance, etc.) and in-kind (e.g. SNAP, etc.) transfers are important components of many

households’ incomes—especially among those who experience earnings declines or job losses

during the economic downturn. Burtless (2010) observed that the stimulus spending in the

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act represented about 2.5 percent of the national

economy in 2010, so one may expect tax and transfer policies to have played a particularly large

role during the Great Recession. This was the case.

          The first 5 columns of Table 4 report the mean value of public in-cash and in-kind

transfers by their source during each recession. Column 6 reports their sum. While public

transfers increased during each recession, their increase over the Great Recession greatly


11
   For example, during the recession years 1979-1982, the mean household size for the middle quintile of the income distribution
fell from 3.78 to 3.68 people. In contrast, during the recession years 2007-2010 the mean household size of the middle quintile of
the income distribution grew from 3.43 to 3.50 people.


                                                               17
exceeded previous recessions. Mean household size-adjusted public transfers per person

increased by 24.80 percent from 2007 to 2010, more than twice the 10.33 percent increase during

recession years 1979-1982. Over half of the increase in public transfers during the Great

Recession came from increased unemployment, workers’ compensation, and veterans’ benefits.

This reflects the well-documented extension of Unemployment Insurance benefits to 99 weeks as

well as a loosening in eligibility criteria, which greatly increased the availability of benefits to

unemployed individuals (Farber and Valletta, 2013).

       Column 6 of Table 4 also includes the value of in-kind transfers (SNAP or Food Stamps,

housing subsidies and school lunches) that are not included in the Census Bureau’s measure of

pre-tax income discussed in Table 1. SNAP eligibility requirements were relaxed as part of the

Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 and their maximum benefits were increased as part

of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Andrews and Smallwood 2012). As a

result of these policy changes and the depth of the recession, in-kind transfers increased by 72

percent during the Great Recession, compared to a slight fall in the early 1980s. While we are

unable to separate the cause of transfer increases into that due to the economic downturn relative

to policy changes, Ziliak (2013) estimates that approximately half of the increase in food stamp

usage during the Great Recession is due to economic factors and about a third is due to food

stamp policy changes.

       As can be seen in Row 12 of Table 2, even though these transfer programs were primarily

targeted at low income groups, their increase during the Great Recession had a noticeable impact

on median post-tax income trends. During the first three years of the Great Recession, increases

in transfers offset private sector income declines to a much greater extent than that seen in earlier

recessions. While public transfer growth during recession years 1979-1982 only offset declines



                                                  18
in median income by 0.34 percentage points, or 5 percent of the total change, public transfers

mitigated median income declines by 1.70 percentage points, or 42 percent of the total change, in

the 2007-2010 period. They were the single most important factor offsetting the decline in

income over this period. This is consistent with Ziliak’s (2013) observation that the SNAP

program is successfully operating as an automatic stabilizer during the Great Recession.

          Note however that there may be secondary effects of these programs which partially

counteract the increased incomes from the direct effects observed here.12 However, at least in the

short-run, it appears that the direct effects of increases in public transfers—especially the growth

and extension of in-cash unemployment benefits beyond that seen in previous recessions and the

increased eligibility for means-tested in-kind transfer benefits like SNAP—mitigated a

substantial fraction of the decline in market income during the recession on median post-tax

income.

         In addition to transfers, tax reductions and increases in tax credits are a tool increasingly

used by policymakers as a countercyclical tool to offset market income declines. As can be seen

in Column 7 of Table 4, despite the substantial decline in market income during the 1979-1982

recession, this did not occur. Mean taxes paid by households increased slightly despite the

recession. In contrast, during the Great Recession, income declines reducing tax liabilities as

well as changes in tax policies designed to reduce tax burdens resulted in a decline of 12.61

percent in mean tax liabilities paid by households.

         Changes in tax liabilities during a recession come from two distinct sources. The first

occurs in a policy-neutral environment. To the degree that a recession lowers personal income,

12
   Mulligan (2012), for example, argues that the substantial increase in unemployment compensation and other public transfers
could have delayed a return to work and hence partially contributed to the drop in employment. For an early review of the
literature on the relationship between increasing unemployment compensation and the duration of unemployment, see Danziger,
Haveman, and Plotnick (1981).


                                                             19
tax liabilities also fall. The second occurs through legislated tax policy changes that increase or

reduce tax liabilities for individuals.

        During the early 1980s recession, real market income fell and as a result, real tax

liabilities fell when considered in a “policy-constant” setting. We account for this policy-

constant component of tax liability in Row 13 of Table 2. In 1979-1982 falling real incomes

would have reduced the decline in post-tax median income by 6.61 percent with no change to tax

laws.

        But this was a period of substantial inflation and Congress opted not to adjust tax

brackets for inflation (See Appendix Table 1 for a description of tax policy changes enacted

during each year of the four economic downturns). Because the Federal Income Tax during this

period was highly progressive, with higher marginal taxes rates levied on higher income brackets

whose bend points were not automatically adjusted for inflation, this resulted in substantial

bracket creep and increased real tax liabilities.

        Although the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 reduced tax rates in 1981 and 1982, this

was not sufficient to offset the lack of indexing. Inflation-adjusted indexing of tax bracket bend

points was not implemented until 1985. The “policy-change” components of tax liability are

accounted for in Row 14 of Table 2, including both the lack of indexing and the newly legislated

policies in the Economic Recovery Act of 1981. In 1979-1982 this increase in taxes on real

income increased the decline in real income by 6.89 percent, somewhat more than offsetting the

reduction in tax liability observed in the “policy-constant” environment. As a result, the

combined impact of the policy-neutral liability changes and those due to policy changes

accounted for an additional 0.28 percent decline in median incomes.

        Contrast this with either the 2000-2003 recession or the Great Recession. In the 2000-



                                                    20
2003 recession, EGTRRA and JGTRRA substantially reduced tax rates throughout the income

distribution. These policy changes accounted for an increase in median income of 2.95 percent

which, when combined with the policy-constant tax changes, accounted for a 2.82 percent

increase in median incomes. This, in large part, explains why post-tax median income increased

slightly during the first three years after the 2000 recession despite the decline in pre-tax income

over the same period reported in Table 1.

       Similarly, tax changes during the Great Recession were used as a tool to offset falling

market incomes. These changes include the refundable tax rebate in the Economic Stimulus Act

of 2008, the Making Work Pay credit and other tax changes in ARRA in 2009, and the 2 percent

payroll tax holiday in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job

Creation Act of 2010. Tax policy changes since 2007 accounted for a 1.17 percentage point

offset of median income declines during the Great Recession that added to the offset that would

have occurred in a policy-constant environment. As a result, while increases in tax liabilities

reduced median income by 0.28 percentage points in the early 1980s recession, decreases in tax

liabilities in the Great Recession increased median income by 1.99 percentage points.

       When we combine these median income increases from tax changes with those from

public transfers, we estimate that government taxes and transfer policies accounted for a 3.69

percent increase in median post-tax income compared to the 0.06 offset during the 1979-1982

recession. This helps explain the surprising finding in Table 1 that when government taxes and

in-kind transfers are added to pre-tax income, the decline in median post-tax income was smaller

during the Great Recession than during the recession of 1979-1982.

Accounting for shifts at the bottom and top of the distribution

       We use this same shift-share procedure to consider the factors accounting for trends in



                                                 21
the mean income of the bottom and the top of the post-tax income distribution. Table 5 provides

such information for the bottom quintile while Table 6 does so for the top quintile.

       Many of the same patterns emerge when accounting for income trends at the top or

bottom of the distribution as were seen in the middle—although the magnitudes differ. At both

the top and bottom of the distribution, decreases in primary male earnings account for the largest

part of mean post-tax income declines in the early 1980s recession. In the Great Recession

however, the decline in primary male earnings is less important than the decline in their

employment. In the bottom quintile, the drop in primary male employment accounts for the

largest part of the decline in mean post-tax income. But in the top quintile, reflecting the

importance of investment income, the fall in non-labor income accounts for the largest part of the

fall in mean income.

       There are also dramatic differences in the importance of tax and transfer income on mean

income of the bottom and top of the distribution. In the bottom quintile of the distribution,

increases in public transfers are the single most important factor for mitigating income declines.

During the Great Recession, increases in transfer income offset almost 6 percentage points of the

fall in income. This is over 3 times the increase in bottom quintile income accounted for by

increased transfers in any of the previous recessions. Since very little transfer income goes to

households in the top quintile of the distribution, it accounts for only a 0.34 percentage point

increase in the mean income of these households.

       Similarly, while tax legislation enacted during the Great Recession was more broad

based, it still was targeted more towards low income households. For example, the $800

refundable Making Work Pay tax credit represents 6.2 percent of the income for tax units

reporting income at or below $12,903 per year. But this credit is limited to $800 per tax unit.



                                                 22
Hence tax units making above $12,903 got no additional credits and the $800 credit is phased out

at higher income levels. For couples, the credit was completely phased out at $150,000. So it is

less important for higher income households. As a result, for the bottom quintile, reduced tax

liabilities due to changes in tax policy accounted for more than a 3 percentage point increase in

mean income. But for the top quintile, tax policy changes only accounted for a 0.24 percent

increase in their mean income. This is in marked contrast to the 2000-2003 recession, where tax

cuts in EGTRRA and JGTRRA offered substantial tax reductions for individuals at the bottom,

middle, and top of the distribution through reductions in marginal tax rates at every income level.

Thus, in the 2000-2003 recession tax policy changes accounted for a larger, 3.91 percent,

increase in mean income for the top quintile of the distribution than the 2.28 percent increase it

accounted for among the bottom quintile.

Median income over the course of the Great Recession and its Aftermath

       In Table 2 we compared the 4.10 percentage point decline in median income over the first

three years of the Great Recession and the sources that accounted for it with the first three years

of earlier recessions. But, the declines in income across these Great Recession years were not

uniform, nor were the sources of income that accounted for them. In Table 7 we repeat our

analysis of the sources of income that accounted for median income declines over the Great

Recession, but now do so on a year-by-year basis. Row 1 shows a decline in median post-tax

income of 0.82 percentage points during the first year (2007-2008) of the Great Recession,

before falling by over 2.09 percentage points between 2008 and 2009. These two years represent

the official NBER time period of the Great Recession and the deepest drops in median income.

But median income is a lag indicator of economic recovery. So while median income did not fall

during 2009-1010 as it did during 2008-2009, it still fell by 1.19 percentage points. The sum of



                                                 23
these three years of decline equals the decline of 4.10 percentage points for the three year period

reported in Table 2. The last two columns extend our analysis to 2010-2011, the fourth

consecutive year of median income decline (1.80 percent) and 2011-2012, the first year since the

beginning of the Great Recession during which our median post-tax income measure increased

(0.54 percent).13

        The rest of the rows in Table 7 show how much each of our demographic and economic

variables account for these annual declines in median income and provide some insight for the

continuing decline in median income we observe past the official NBER end of the Great

Recession.

        As discussed in Table 2, declines in primary male employment accounted for the largest

single source of median income decline in the Great Recession. As can be seen in Table 7 the

relative importance of primary male employment varied greatly over the four years of median

income decline. In 2007-2008 a drop in the earnings of employed primary males was the most

important factor, followed by a drop in their employment. In contrast, in 2008-2009 the drop in

primary male employment accounted for, by far, the largest part of the decline in median income.

After these official NBER recession years, primary male employment increased and hence

accounted for modest increases in median income over the next three years. However, in 2009-

2010 drops in their earnings completely offset increases in their employment. It was only in

2010-2011 that both their earnings and employment increased. But these modest increases were

completely offset by declines in the sum of the employment and earnings of primary females and

the earnings of others in the household. It was only in 2011-2012 that the sum of all employment

13
  In each year from 2009 through 2012, pre-tax income fell by less or increased by more than post-tax income. As
was previously observed in Figure 1, 2012 was also the first year that size-adjusted pre-tax household income rose.
However, non-size-adjusted pre-tax household income fell slightly in 2012 (DeNavas-Walt Proctor, and Smith
2013).


                                                         24
and earnings factors in Table 7 accounted for an increase in median income.

       The annual decomposition in Table 7 also illustrates the short-term nature of stimulus

programs as they played out in the tax code and in public transfers. During the first official

NBER recession year of 2007-2008, increased transfers accounted for a 0.34 percentage point

increase in median income growth. More importantly, in 2008, the launch of the Economic

Stimulus Act provided up to a $1,200 credit for married couples plus additional credits for each

dependent child (Joint Committee on Taxation, 2008). Largely resulting from this credit, new tax

policies in 2008 mitigated median income declines by 2.39 percent (Row 14).

       In contrast, while tax policies in 2009 were still more generous to the median household

than in 2007 before the recession, 2009 represented the start of the withdrawal of tax stimulus for

the middle of the distribution. Although the implementation of the Making Work Pay credit in

2009 provided a maximum benefit of $800 to a married couple, this was a less generous credit

than the one offered by the Economic Stimulus Act the year before. As a result, changes in tax

policy in 2009 reduced median income growth by 0.74 percent between 2008 and 2009. These

declines were offset, however, by substantial increases in public transfers in 2009 which

mitigated median income declines by 1.46 percent (Row 12).

       Thereafter, decreases in tax-based stimulus programs and decreases in public transfers

both worked in the same direction, each offsetting some of the growth in private market sources

of income as economic stimulus is withdrawn. From 2009 to 2010 transfers fell from their 2009

peak; and, as a result of ending the partial exclusion of unemployment benefits from taxable

income along with some state tax increases, tax liabilities around the median grew. This

reduction in public transfers from the previous year and these increased tax liabilities accounted

for a decline in after-tax median income.



                                                 25
       From 2010 to 2011, tax and transfer stimulus measures were further scaled back,

accounting for additional declines in after-tax median income that offset the growth in private

market income in that year. While public transfers abated in 2012, in part because of the

continued improvement in the private-sector economy, it was the first year since 2008 that tax

policy changes did not account for a year-over-year reduction in median income growth. This

development, along with the continued employment and earnings gains of both men and women,

allowed 2012 to be the first year since the start of the Great Recession that post-tax median

income produced a year-over-year improvement.

       Looking forward, however, phase outs of temporary tax reductions and supplemental

transfer benefits resumed in 2013—the 2 percent payroll tax credit ended in January 2013, the

temporary increase in SNAP benefits expired in November 2013 (Andrews and Smallwood

2012), the sequester reduced the generosity of unemployment benefits starting in 2013 (Rampell

2013), and the extended unemployment benefits which were available through the Great

Recession to varying degrees are scheduled to expire at the end of December 2013 (US

Department of Labor 2013). As a result, even if private market income grows in 2013 it is

possible that the phase-out of these temporary tax and transfer programs will result in an

additional year of post-tax median income declines.

Conclusions

       Using a shift-share analysis to compare the factors underlying income trends in each of

the past four recessions, we show that the falling real earnings of those who remained employed

played a relatively minor role in median post-tax household income declines during the Great

Recession. Instead, employment declines primarily drove these income declines, which would

have been much greater, except for the unprecedented role of public tax and both in-cash and in-



                                                26
kind transfer policies. Because previous decomposition studies have not included the role of

either tax policies or in-kind transfers, they will greatly understate the increasing role that

government policies have played in mitigating median post-tax household income declines and

understate the resources that were available to the bottom half of the distribution of Americans

over the Great Recession.

       However something that cannot be drawn from our analysis is whether this

unprecedented use of tax and in-cash and in-kind benefits indirectly discouraged work over the

period. We cannot rule out the possibility that these policies lengthened unemployment spells

and thus degraded labor-market skills, so that these short-term increases in benefits during the

first three years of the Great Recession made a return to work and wage earnings less likely.

Furthermore, both tax reductions and increased transfers come at the cost of increased public

debt, which is not included in our analysis since it does not impact short-term economic

resources.

       What can be concluded is that the unprecedented importance of the direct effects of

temporary tax and transfer policies for supporting median and bottom-quintile income during the

recession means that their withdrawal—as policymakers shift their focus to deficit reduction and

the scaling down of stimulus measures—is likely to result in short-term headwinds toward

achieving growth in post-tax median income. Hence growth in post-tax median income over the

remainder of the current business cycle will depend on the ability of currently under- or non-

employed individuals to find full-time jobs in a growing economy as we scale back these

temporary public-transfer programs which limited median income declines over the Great

Recession.

Notes: Peak and trough years of business cycles based on pre‐tax median income and, in the case of
1983, unemployment are denoted with solid black and dashed red vertical lines respectively. The
starting year of the period (1979) also represents a peak business cycle year. Official NBER recession
periods are denoted by vertical gray bars. 1983 is treated as the trough of the recession starting in 1979
despite the slight increase in pre‐tax median income from 1982 to 1983 given that unemployment
remained above 10 percent for much of 1983 (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012).

Due to a change in CPS survey collection methods, income trends are not directly comparable between
1992 and 1993 (Ryscavage 1995 and Weinberg 2006 discuss this issue further). Because we assume that
the change in the income series in this year is due solely to collection method differences, in Figure 1,
we assume there is no change in the income series in this year. This assumption matches that described
in Larrimore (forthcoming), which is similar to that used by Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011) and
Burkhauser et al. (2012).
