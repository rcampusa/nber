The Effects of Computers and Acquired Skills on Earnings, Employment and College Enrollment:
Evidence from a Field Experiment and California UI Earnings Records

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper provides the first evidence on the earnings, employment and college enrollment effects
of computers and acquired skills from a randomized controlled trial providing computers to
entering college students. We matched confidential administrative data from California
Employment Development Department (EDD)/Unemployment Insurance (UI) system earnings
records, the California Community College system, and the National Student Clearinghouse to all
study participants for seven years after the random provision of computers. The experiment does
not provide evidence that computer skills have short- or medium-run effects on earnings. These
null effects are found along both the extensive and intensive margins of earnings (although the
estimates are not precise). We also do not find evidence of positive or negative effects on college
enrollment. A non-experimental analysis of CPS data reveals large, positive and statistically
significant relationships between home computers, and earnings, employment and college
enrollment, raising concerns about selection bias in non-experimental studies.

Introduction

        Although the returns to education have been studied extensively, the labor market

returns to computers and the skills acquired in using them are not as well understood. A

few recent studies find higher wages among workers with computer skills, but the

evidence is not as clear as the evidence of positive returns to formal schooling (Card

1999; Dickerson and Green 2004; OECD 2015; Hanushek et al. 2015; Falck, Heimisch

and Wiederhold 2016). 1 Similar to concerns regarding estimating the returns to

education, identifying the causal effects of computer skills on labor market outcomes is

difficult because of unobserved heterogeneity.

        This study takes a novel approach to estimate the labor market returns to

computers and the acquired skills from using them by exploiting a randomized controlled

trial (RCT) providing free personal computers for home use. The field experiment was

conducted with entering community college students in Fall 2006, following them

through their educational and early career labor market experiences. Previous findings

from the experiment indicate that the treatment group receiving home computers had

substantially better computer skills than the control group (Fairlie 2012), and that the

randomly provided home computers were found to have small, positive, short-run (1.5

year) effects on educational outcomes (Fairlie and London 2012). 2 In this study, we




1
  Earlier research found that computer users at work had higher wages than non-computer users,
arguably due to their computer skills (e.g. Krueger 1993). But, whether this estimated computer-
wage premium captures the returns to computer skills or simply unobserved worker, job, or
employer heterogeneity has been questioned (e.g. DiNardo and Pischke 1997).
2
  A growing literature examines the educational effects of home computers and generally finds
mixed results (see Fuchs and Woessmann 2004; Schmitt and Wadsworth 2006; Fiorini, 2010;
Malamud and Pop-Eleches 2011; Vigdor and Ladd 2014; Beuermann et al. 2015; Fairlie and
Robinson 2013; Hull and Duch 2017 for a few examples, and Bulman and Fairlie 2016 for a
review of the literature).
collect new administrative data from three sources for all study participants, and build on

these findings by examining short- to medium-term effects on earnings, employment and

college enrollment. To analyze earnings and employment effects, we obtained

confidential administrative earnings data collected by the California State Employment

Development Department (EDD) through the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system for

all study participants. 3 We also obtained restricted-access administrative data on college

enrollment from the California Community College System and the National Student

Clearinghouse for all study participants. The data on earnings, employment and college

enrollment cover nearly a decade after the computers were randomly distributed,

allowing for a rare analysis of medium-term experimental effects in addition to short-

term effects. Furthermore, the use of administrative data eliminates concerns over

follow-up survey attrition and item non-response, which are often problematic in RCTs

and especially problematic for capturing longer-term outcome effects.

        From the experiment and administrative data on earnings and college enrollment,

we do not find evidence that computer skills have a positive effect on earnings. We do

not find evidence of positive effects on the extensive or intensive margins of labor

supply. We also do not find evidence that computers have a positive effect on college

enrollment, which could explain the null effects on earnings if students delayed entry into

the labor market. The findings across many different specifications, measures and

subgroups are consistent in finding null effects. Although the results consistently show

null effects, one limitation is that the estimates are not precisely estimated. In contrast, a


3
 Employment effects rarely have been examined in the literature because of the focus on
computer use at work as a proxy for computer skills. One exception is Blanco and Boo (2010)
who examine the effects of randomly listing ICT skills on a resume in two Latin American cities
and find that it increases the probability of receiving a call back by roughly 1 percent.


                                                                                                  2
supplementary, non-experimental analysis of CPS data suggest large, positive, and

statistically significant non-experimental relationships between home computers and

earnings, employment and college enrollment. These findings raise concerns about

positive selection bias in non-experimental studies even including those using nearest

neighbor and propensity score matching models.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes

the random experiment in detail. Section 2 reports estimates of treatment effects on

earnings, employment, and college enrollment. Section 3 reports non-experimental

estimates from the CPS. Section 4 concludes.



1. The Field Experiment

        To study the earnings, employment and college enrollment effects of computers,

we randomly assigned free computers to entering community college students who were

receiving financial aid (see Fairlie and London 2012 for more details on the experiment). 4

All of the students attended Butte College full-time in fall 2006 and were followed

through 2013, capturing work while attending college and in the first several years of

their careers. Butte College is a community college located in Northern California and is

part of the California Community College system ― the largest postsecondary system in

the United States, comprised of 113 colleges, enrolling more than 2.1 million students,

and serving one out of every five community college students in the United States




4
  We did not provide Internet service as part of the experiment but found at the end of the study
that more than 90 percent of the treatment group had Internet service. Estimates from the U.S.
Census Bureau (2013) indicate similar level Internet subscription rates among computer owners
in the United States (89 to 95 percent from 2007 to 2012).


                                                                                                    3
(Chancellor’s Office, 2016). In 2006, Butte College had a total enrollment of 15,709

students (Butte College, 2006).

        The focus on workers who attended community colleges is important for

examining computer returns for the middle- to high-end of the skill distribution.

Community colleges provide a wide range of educational pathways, including workforce

training and serving as a gateway to four-year colleges and universities (Bahr & Gross,

2016). Community colleges enroll about half of all students in public postsecondary

institutions in the United States (Bahr & Gross, 2016). 5 Likewise, nearly half of students

who complete a baccalaureate degree attended a community college at some point

(National Student Clearinghouse, 2015). For community college students who do not

transfer to a four-year institution, the returns to a community college education in many

fields are high (see Kane & Rouse, 1995, 1999; Leigh & Gill, 2007; Bahr 2014; Jepsen,

Troske, and Coomes 2014; Stevens, Kurlaender, and Grosz 2015 for example). Thus,

community colleges are an important educational environment in which to examine the

returns to computers.

        In addition, unlike many four-year institutions, community college students

frequently live off-campus, commuting to school (Bahr & Gross, 2016). This limits their

access to large computer labs and other on-campus computing resources, making

personally owned computers potentially important for acquiring computer skills and

knowledge.




5
 In California, the percentage is even higher, representing more than 70 percent of all public
higher education enrollments in the state (Sengupta and Jepsen 2006).


                                                                                                 4
        The computers used in the study were provided by Computers for Classrooms,

Inc., a company in Chico, California, that refurbishes computers. 6 To implement the

study, we first obtained a list of all entering students in the fall of 2006 who received

financial aid. In the fall 2006, there were 1,042 financial aid students who were enrolled

full-time. The Office of Financial Aid (OFA) at Butte College advertised the program by

mailing letters to all of these full-time students on financial aid, and all subsequent

correspondence with them was conducted through the OFA.

        Participation in the experiment involved returning a baseline questionnaire and

consent form releasing future academic records from the college for use in the study.

Students who already owned computers were not excluded from participating in the

lottery because their computers may have been very old, not fully functional, or lacking

the latest software and hardware. The estimates of treatment effects on earnings,

employment and education that we present below are not sensitive to the exclusion of

these students, who represent 29 percent of the sample.

        We received 286 responses with valid consent forms and completed

questionnaires, and received enough funding to provide free computers to a randomly

selected subset of 141 of these students. 7 Eligible students were notified by mail and


6
  The computers were refurbished Pentium III 450 MHz machines with 256 MB RAM, 10 GB
hard drives, 17" monitors, modems, ethernet cards, CD drives, and Windows 2000 Pro Open
Office (with Word, Excel and PowerPoint). Each system also came with a 128 MB flash drive
for printing student papers on campus and a two-year warranty on hardware and software.
Computers for Classrooms offered to replace any computer not functioning properly during the
first two years after students received them.
7
  We compared administrative data for students who applied to the computer giveaway program
to all students at the college who received financial aid and to all students enrolled at the college.
We do not find large differences in racial composition or whether students’ primary language was
English. We do find gender differences, with women overrepresented among applicants to the
computer giveaway program. The distributions of reported goal at college entry are very similar
across groups. In sum, although study participants are a self-selected group of all students
receiving financial aid, they do not appear to be very different in terms of observable


                                                                                                    5
instructed to pick up their computers at the Computers for Classrooms warehouse. More

than 90 percent of eligible students picked up their free computers by the end of

November 2006.

        Butte College provided detailed administrative data on students’ course-taking

and outcomes, receipt of financial aid, assessment test scores, degree completion, and

other outcomes through July of 2008. Additional information about study participants,

was collected in a follow-up survey in the late spring and summer of 2008. 8



Butte College Programs

        Butte College offers a wide range of programs and courses. Appendix Table 1

reports the total number of course enrollments by program type over the 2006/07 to

2013/14 academic years for Butte College and the California Community College system.

The data on course enrollments are from the California Community College Chancellor's

Office, Management Information Systems Data Mart. 9 Butte College, similar to other

community colleges, provides a broad range of educational opportunities for students.



Earnings and Employment Data



characteristics from all students who received financial aid or the entire student body.
Nevertheless, they may differ, however, along dimensions directly related to participation in the
study, and these differences may have implications for our ability to generalize the results based
on study participants to all community college students receiving financial aid. But, students with
limited access to computers and financial resources are the population of most interest for any
policy intervention involving the provision of free or subsidized computers. See Fairlie and
London (2012) for more discussion.
8
  The response rates to the follow-up survey were 65 percent overall, 61 percent for the control
group, and 69 percent for the treatment group. The difference in response rates is not statistically
significant. The baseline characteristics of students who responded to the follow-up survey are
roughly similar to those of the full sample (see Fairlie and London 2012).

                                                                                                  6
       To measure earnings and employment, study participants were matched with

confidential earnings data from the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) system.

Quarterly UI earnings data are collected by the California Employment Development

Department (EDD). 10 These data cover all workers in California except those who are

self-employed, civilian employees of the federal government, military, railroad

employees, and a small selection of others. The data also do not address earnings

garnered in other states (Feldbaum and Harmon 2012).

       In this study, we found that only 2 of the 286 participants had no earnings records

in the system. Nevertheless, to explore the extent to which the exclusions from UI

system data collection may result in noncoverage in our study, we examined microdata

from the 2009-13 American Community Survey (ACS). We focused specifically on ACS

data for individuals living in California who were between the ages of 18 and 34 years,

which captures 75 percent of our study participants’ ages over the study period. We also

further restrict the sample to individuals who have AA degrees. We estimate the

percentage of individuals in the ACS sample who were: i) self-employed, ii) federal

government employees, and iii) military employees. The largest group is self-employed

workers, but they represent only 4.1 percent of individuals in this sample (4.2 percent in

the subsample with AA degrees). Combining all three categories, we find that that only

6.7 percent of individuals are in one of these three uncovered classifications (7.8 percent

in the AA degree subsample. Furthermore, average self-employment earnings were less

than $1,000 per year, and average wage/salary earnings for federal and military work



10
  The earnings data are also used in Bahr (2014) and Stevens, Kurlaender and Grosz (2015) to
estimate the returns to various degrees, certificates and programs in California community
colleges.


                                                                                               7
were roughly $1,000 per year, which is expected given that these groups represent small

percentages of the total workforce for this age group.

       Out-migration is another concern with missing information in the administrative

earnings data. If a community college student moves out of California then we cannot

observe their earnings information. Using the ACS, we find that roughly 2.5 percent of

our sample of California residents do not live in California one year later.

       In sum, concerns over noncoverage appear to be low, but nevertheless we caution

that earnings, as defined in this study, refer to earnings in covered jobs in California.

Likewise, employment (i.e. positive earnings) refers to employment in covered jobs in

California. Examining the data for our cohort of community college students, we find

earnings and employment numbers that seem somewhat low (an average employment

rate of 54 percent, quarterly earnings of $2,600 for the full sample, and quarterly earnings

for workers of $4,900). We do not have an explanation for why these numbers seem low.

It is important to note, however, that unless the treatment has a large effect on self-

employment, military work, and/or mobility then noncoverage cannot have a large effect

on the estimates of treatment effects on earnings and employment presented below.



College Enrollment Data

       College enrollment in a given quarter was constructed by combining information

collected in the administrative database of the California Community College (CCC)

system and the database maintained by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), and

then matching this information to study participants. The CCC system administrative

database addresses all 113 community colleges in California, while the NSC database




                                                                                            8
adds public and private four-year, two-year, and less-than-two-year institutions both

inside and outside of California. In this analysis, we treat college enrollment as a time-

varying dichotomous indicator.



Treatment and Control Group Balance Check

        Table 1 reports a comparison of background characteristics for the treatment and

control groups prior to the experiment. All study participants were given a baseline

survey that included questions on gender, race/ethnicity, age, high school grades,

household income, parents' education, and other characteristics. The average age of

study participants was 25 years. More than half of the students had a parent with at least

some college education, and about one-third of students reported receiving mostly A’s

and B’s in high school. A little over one-quarter of study participants have children, and

one-third live with their parents. As would be expected among students receiving

financial aid, study participants had relatively low income at the beginning of the study,

with only 17 percent having household incomes of $40,000 or more. The majority of

study participants had household incomes below $20,000, and more than half were

employed. Although not reported, the treatment and control groups were also similar in

terms of educational goals reported at the time of college application.

        The similarity on these baseline characteristics confirms that randomization

created comparable treatment and control groups for the experiment. We do not find

large differences for any of the characteristics, and none of the differences are statistically

significant.




                                                                                             9
Computer Skill Effects

        Home computers improve computer skills possibly through increased use time,

flexibility, autonomy, experimentation, and learning by doing. Previous findings from the

field experiment provide evidence of positive effects of home computers on computer

skills (Fairlie 2012). These findings are described in detail in Fairlie (2012), but the

highlights are noted here. Information on self-reported computer skills are provided by

students’ responses to the follow-up survey at the end of the second academic year of the

experiment. The treatment group of students receiving free computers to use at home

was found to have better computer skills than did the control group of students not

receiving free computers. 11 In particular, two-thirds of the treatment group reported

having high-level computer skills compared with only half of the control group. 12

Regression estimates controlling for baseline demographic characteristics indicated a

similar treatment-control difference in high-level computer skills (the coefficient estimate

is 0.17).

        The finding of positive effects of home computers on computers skills also was

robust to using the full range of categorical skill levels. Results from ordered probit

models indicate a large, positive effect of receiving free computers on computer skills

throughout the distribution. 13




11
   Students were asked "How would you rate your computer skills?," and were given the possible
responses of "excellent," "very good," "good," "satisfactory," and "inadequate." This self-
reported, five-point scale is similar to previously used measures of technology skills. Hargittai
(2005) finds that self-reported measures of skill in Internet use have good predictive power for
actual Internet skills.
12
   High-level skills are defined as reporting "excellent" or "very good" computer skills.
13
   Given the categorical nature of the computer skills measure we do not estimate the labor
market returns using this measure and treatment as an IV for it (which would ultimately result in
a scaled up version of the treatment estimate).


                                                                                               10
        Taken together, these findings are consistent with home computers improving

computer skills. These findings are also consistent with previous work using data

containing information on both computer ownership and detailed computer skills.

Although this evidence may be subject to selection bias, it is illustrative. For example,

Atasoy et al. (2013) find that computer owners have substantially higher basic, medium

and advanced computer skills than non-owners. They also find from a battery of survey

questions on skill acquisition that the two most common methods of acquiring computer

skills are "Individually with experience/trial and error" and "With the help of your friends

and family." Both of these methods are facilitated by having access to a computer at

home.

        Using survey data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult

Competencies (PIAAC), the OECD (2015) finds a strong positive relationship between

computer skills and having Internet access at home across countries. Using microdata for

the United States from the same underlying survey, we estimate the correlation between

computer skills and computer use at home and other non-work locations. 14 We find a

strong, positive relationship between skills and home computer use.

        It is important to note, however, that the estimates of treatment effects on

computer skills were measured at the end of the second year of the experiment. Over

time, it is likely that an increasing percentage of the control group purchased computers

and improved their computer skills, allowing them to catch up with the treatment group.

At the same time, with prolonged exposure the treatment group would also experience a

greater improvement in computer skills over time. Unfortunately, we do not have data on


14
  See also Hanushek et al. (2015) and Falck, Heimisch and Wiederhold (2016) for use of the
PIAAC.


                                                                                             11
computer ownership and skills over each of the subsequent years due to the prohibitive

expense of collecting such data. Thus, the results of the study presented here, focusing

on labor market outcomes, should be viewed as the effects of access to computers on

earnings while enrolled in college and in the early career period. 15



2. Empirical Models and Results

          To examine the effects of computers on earnings, we estimate several regressions.

The initial specification is straightforward in the context of the random experiment:

          (2.1)   𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆𝑠𝑠 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where Yit is the earnings of student i in quarter t, measured in CPI-adjusted (2013Q4)

dollars. The use of earnings avoids problems with overly influential zero earnings

observations using logs. Including all observations of zero earnings is essential for

estimating the full treatment effect. The term Xi represents a set of time-invariant pre-

treatment student characteristics, including gender, race/ethnicity, age, parents' highest

education level, high school grades, presence of own children, living with parents, and

family income. These controls were collected in the baseline survey administered to all

study participants or extracted from administrative data provided by the college. Ti is the

treatment indicator, λs are year fixed effects, and ui + εit is the composite error term. The

computers were distributed in 2006Q4, when all students were full-time entering students

at the community college. The sample period covers 7 years (28 quarters) following the

treatment, from 2007Q1 through 2013Q4. The effect of becoming eligible for a free




15
     As shown below, employment rates are high among community college students.


                                                                                             12
computer (the "intent-to-treat" estimate of the program) is captured by δ. 16 In this

specification, δ describes a permanent shift effect of computers on earnings; however, it

is likely that computers have differential effects on earnings over time. This may be

especially true when students are still enrolled in college immediately following

treatment compared to a several years later when many students have completed formal

schooling.

        To allow for a more flexible earnings equation, in alternative Equation 2.2 we do

not restrict δ to be a one-time permanent shift in earnings. Rather, we allow the treatment

effect to differ each year following the treatment.

        (2.2)   𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + ∑7𝑠𝑠=1 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆𝑠𝑠 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

This specification allows for flexibility of computer impacts on earnings over time (i.e. a

separate treatment effect for each year, δ1 … δ7). For example, it allows for the possibility

that earnings might be depressed in the first two years post treatment if there is a positive

effect of computers on college enrollment.

        Table 2 reports treatment effect estimates of Equations 2.1 and 2.2. Both

equations are estimated with ordinary least squares (OLS). Robust standard errors are

reported with adjustments for multiple observations per student (i.e., clustered by

  LATE (or IV) estimates would be larger. We do not report these estimates, however, because
we cannot technically scale up the coefficients with the IV estimator due to differential and
unknown timing of purchasing computers by the control group. In the initial study period from
fall 2006 to spring 2008, it was found that 8 percent of the treatment group did not pick up their
free computers from the experiment, and 28 percent of the control group reported obtaining a new
computer on the follow-up survey collected in the summer of 2008. Fairlie and London (2012)
thus report "lower" and "upper" bounds on their IV estimates for educational outcomes in the 1.5
year study period, and these were approximately 9 to 36 percent larger than the OLS estimates.
Another issue for the current study is that we also would have to adjust IV estimates for each year
of treatment because we are covering a much longer follow-up period than that considered by
Fairlie and London. For these reasons, we focus on ITT estimates.


                                                                                                13
student). For reference, average earnings across all years for the control group is $2,808.

Average earnings across all years for the treatment group is similar at $2,640. The

difference of $168 is not statistically significant. Controlling for baseline characteristics

does not change the results. Estimates from Equation 2.1 reported in Specification 1

indicate that the point estimate on the treatment effect variable is small in magnitude and

not statistically significant. These estimates do not provide evidence of an earnings

differential between the control and treatment groups when averaged over the entire

sample period. Furthermore, a 95% confidence interval around the point estimate rules

out large positive effects. The 95% confidence interval is [-937, 429] relative to a control

group mean of 2,808. Unfortunately, however, the estimates are not precise enough to

rule out even more effect sizes. The upper bound on the confidence interval represents 15

percent of the control group mean, which is not a small effect.

        Specification 2 reports estimates from Equation 2.2 that includes flexibility to

earnings effects over time. The control group experienced steady growth in average

earnings from $1,891 in the first year since treatment to $3,596 in the seventh year after

treatment. Most importantly, the treatment group has similar earnings and experienced

similar earnings growth over that time. None of the estimates of the treatment effects are

positive and statistically significant. In fact, one of the point estimates is negative (but

significant at only the p < 0.10 level). Thus, we do not find evidence that the computers

increased earnings in any of the seven years following their distribution to students.

        These results are robust to the exclusion of controls. In Specification 3 in Table

2, we remove all baseline controls. The treatment effect estimates are thus differences in




                                                                                               14
means between the treatment and control groups for each year. We find very similar

results, mainly that there is no evidence of positive treatment effects on earnings.

       We examined different functional forms to place more structure on the time-series

patterns. In both quadratic and cubic specifications, we find no differences between

treatment and control groups.

       The results are also not due to a few very large earnings outliers. We find that

quarterly earnings exceeded $25,000 ($100,000 annualized) in only 12 person-quarters

with the maximum quarterly earnings of $32,084. In Specification 4, we report estimates

from Equation 2.2 in which we censor (or top-code) the highest earnings observations to

$20,000 per quarter. The treatment effect estimates are similar to those from the main

specification without censoring.

       Finally, we also estimate log earnings specifications (reported in Specifications 1

and 2 of Appendix Table 2). For all zero earnings values and earnings values less than

100 we censor at log(100) to lessen the influence of zero and very small earnings

observations. We find no evidence of treatment effects using the log specifications.

       We also estimate quantile treatment effects. Appendix Table 3 reports treatment

effect estimates for the 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th and 90th percentiles. We do not report

estimates for lower percentiles such as the 10th through 40th percentiles because earnings

are equal to zero at those levels for both groups. The quantile regression estimates do not

reveal treatment effects at other parts of the distribution. We do not find, for example,

that computer skills have large, positive returns for workers at the high end of the

earnings distribution.




                                                                                            15
          We also do not find evidence of treatment effects for subgroups of the participant

population. Our finding of null effects for the total sample might be masking positive

effects for specific subgroups. In particular, we examine treatment effects for minorities,

non-minorities, women, men, younger students, and older students. Focusing on these

particular subgroups is motivated by theoretical reasons. For example, the returns to

computers on earnings may differ between men and women because of different career

life cycles especially for the ages contained in our sample. Minority workers might face

discrimination in the labor market altering job opportunities and the trajectory of

earnings. Also, differential rates of overall access to computers (i.e. the digital divide)

could lead to different experiences with computers and thus returns to computers in the

labor market. Younger students are likely to have less prior work experience altering their

returns to computer skills. For all subgroups, we do not find clear evidence of treatment

effects on earnings or employment. 17



Net Present Value of Earnings Stream

          We also estimate a discounted net present value (NPV) model for earnings in

order to combine the computer effects on earnings in all follow-up years in the data. To

do so, we calculate the NPV for each participant i as follows:
                                         1
          (2.3)    𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 = ∑28
                               𝑞𝑞=1 (1+𝑟𝑟)𝑞𝑞 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


We then estimate model 2.4:

          (2.4)    𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖

                                                                                              16
       We estimate separate models for three different annualized discount rates (r),

including 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07. We use the same baseline controls as used in Equation

2.2, but we use nominal earnings for each quarter in Equation 2.3 instead of the inflation-

adjusted earnings used in Equations 2.1 and 2.2 to ensure a constant a priori discount rate.

       Table 3 reports estimates of the NPV regressions. The point estimates indicate

lower NPV earnings among the treatment group, as compared with the control group, but

the estimated differences are relatively small (roughly $5,000 to $6,000 over a seven-year

period) and are not statistically significant. Thus, focusing on NPV estimates does not

change our conclusions: we do not find evidence that the computers increased earnings.



Employment and Extensive Margin

       Focusing on the extensive margin of labor supply, we also examine computer

effects on employment. Computer skills may be more important for finding employment

than for obtaining higher wages or more work hours, implying that these skills work

more on the extensive margin than on the intensive margin. This may be especially true

while students are still enrolled in community college. For many jobs available to

students, wages might be relatively fixed.

       We estimate linear probability models of the dependent variable employment,

defined as having any positive earnings in quarter q. These models are comparable to

Equation 2.2, earlier. Table 4 reports estimates for treatment effects on employment.

The average employment rate over the period for the control group is 54 percent. The

regression estimates do not indicate any differences between the treatment and control

groups in employment probabilities. Marginal effects for probit and logit models are




                                                                                          17
similar. Computer skills do not appear to have an effect on the extensive margin for

labor supply.



Intensive Margin and Decomposition

       For exploratory purposes, we also investigate treatment and control differences in

earnings conditional on employment which sheds light on potential computer effects on

the intensive margin of earnings. It is important to note, however, that we cannot

interpret these estimates as causal because there is the possibility of selection into

employment. Furthermore, the interpretation of estimates might be unintuitive because

we could, for example, find a negative treatment effect on average conditional earnings

even with positive treatment effects on average employment and earnings. This could

happen if the positive effect is concentrated among new marginal workers finding

employment. Figure 1 displays treatment/control difference in conditional earnings as

well as the treatment/control difference in total earnings. The patterns are similar, and we

do not find evidence of a positive relationship between computers and earnings,

conditional on employment (regression estimates are reported for conditional earnings in

Appendix Table 4 and log conditional earnings in Specifications 3 and 4 of Appendix

Table 2). This is also consistent with not finding treatment effects on employment, which

also suggests that selection in focusing on conditional earnings was not likely to be a

problem here.

       To further examine the roles played by treatment-control differences in the

intensive and extensive margins, we perform a decomposition. Specifically, we

decompose the treatment-control difference in earnings into the part that is due to the




                                                                                          18
treatment-control difference in the extensive (employment) margin and the part that is

due to the treatment-control difference in the intensive (conditional earnings) margin.

The decomposition in the treatment-control difference in average earnings can be

expressed as:

       (2.5)
                 T   C
                          [T   C          CT
                                               ][         T
                Y - Y = ( E - E )Y | E + E ( Y | E - Y | E )
                                                                  C
                                                                      ]
where E T and E C are employment rates for the treatment and control groups, respectively,

and Y | E T and Y | E C are the conditional earnings for the treatment and control groups,

respectively. The decomposition is not unique, however, and an equally valid

representation of the decomposition can be expressed as:

       (2.6)
                 T   C
                          [T   C          T    C
                                                   ][
                Y - Y = ( E - E )Y | E + E ( Y | E - Y | E )
                                                              T       C
                                                                          ]
In both Equations 2.5 and 2.6, the first term in brackets represents the part of the

treatment-control earnings difference that is due to differences in employment rates,

while the second term in brackets represents the part that is due to differences in average

conditional earnings.

       Table 5 reports the results of the decomposition. The treatment-control earnings

difference is also reported for each follow-up year. The contributions from differences in

conditional earnings often represent 100 percent of the total difference in earnings across

years, but all of these differences are small. This is consistent with the finding of similar

patterns in Figure 1 for the treatment/control differences in conditional and total earnings.

Given that we are finding null treatment effects on earnings, employment, and earnings

conditional on employment, the decomposition technique is not overly revealing for this

analysis, but nevertheless could be useful in other settings.




                                                                                             19
College Enrollment

        Computers and the skills acquired in using them might have a positive effect on

college enrollment, which could explain the null effects on earnings and employment. 18

For example, the computers may have increased the number of terms in which students

enrolled in college and thereby depressed their short-run earnings. To check for this

possibility, we first estimate a linear probability model (again comparable to Equation

2.2) in which college enrollment is the dependent variable. The variable college

enrollment includes all types of postsecondary institutions and was constructed by

combining administrative data from the California Community College (CCC) system

and data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), both matched to participants in

the experiment.

        Table 6 reports estimates of treatment effects on college enrollment.

Specification 1 reports estimates with baseline controls, and Specification 2 reports

estimates without baseline controls. The average quarterly college enrollment is 47

percent for the control group, but this average over the seven-year time period masks a

steadily declining enrollment rate from 100 percent in the treatment quarter (2006Q4) to

92.4 percent one quarter later (2007Q1) to 15.9 percent at the end of the sample period

(2013Q4). The coefficient estimates do not reveal a pattern of higher college enrollment

among the treatment group relative to the control group over the study period. None of

the point estimates are statistically significant, nor are they consistently positive or




18
   Another possibility is that the computers change students’ areas of concentration. We do not
find evidence of treatment/control differences in the distribution of courses taken across
departments at the community college.


                                                                                                  20
negative. 19 One problem, however, is that the standard errors are not small (ranging from

0.045 to 0.051).

        Examining a shorter horizon of 1.5 years after treatment, previous findings from

the experiment indicate that the treatment group receiving home computers had slightly

higher educational outcomes than the control group (Fairlie and London 2012). Although

we find some evidence that the treatment group achieved better educational outcomes

than the control group, the estimated effects are not large and for a few measures are

imprecise and cannot rule out zero effects. The estimates presented here for longer term

effects on college enrollment are more clearly indicating null effects. The short run

effects may have just been too small or short-lived to have any lasting effects on

enrollment.

        Another approach to addressing this question is to control for college enrollment

directly in the earnings and employment regressions. Although controlling for

contemporaneous college enrollment in the earnings regression is endogenous (because it

also is potentially affected by treatment), the resulting coefficient estimates on the

treatment effects are illustrative. If we were to find that the treatment effect on earnings

changes dramatically with the inclusion of this control, it would be suggestive that a

treatment effect on college enrollment suppresses earnings.

        Specification 3 of Table 6 reports estimates for earnings. The coefficient on the

college enrollment variable is negative, large, and statistically significant, as one would

expect. Contemporaneous enrollment in school is associated with lower quarterly



19
  We also estimate separate models for 4-year college enrollment and enrollment in other than 4-
year colleges. The estimates do not provide evidence of consistent treatment effects for either
type of college enrollment.


                                                                                              21
earnings. More importantly, however, the estimates of treatment effects do not change

with the inclusion of this variable. The treatment effect estimates are similar when

including or excluding contemporaneous college enrollment in the earnings equation.

       We also estimate a model for employment with contemporaneous college

enrollment included (Specification 4 in Table 6). The inclusion of contemporaneous

college enrollment in the employment regression does not change the treatment effect

estimates.

       Collectively, these results suggest that the absence of an effect of computers on

earnings or employment is not due to increased college enrollment delaying labor market

entry. We do not find treatment effects on college enrollment, and controlling for

contemporaneous college enrollment does not alter conclusions regarding treatment

effects for earnings or employment.



3. Non-Experimental Estimates

       Although we find null treatment effects on earnings, employment and college

enrollment from the experiment, the previous literature tends to find positive estimates

(Bulman and Fairlie 2016). In this section, we investigate these differences by estimating

several non-experimental earnings, employment and college enrollment regressions that

include access to a home computer as an independent variable.

       We estimate non-experimental earnings regressions using the 2011 Computer and

Internet Supplement from the Current Population Survey. 20 Weekly earnings information


20
  The CPS, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is
representative of the entire U.S. civilian non-institutional population and interviews
approximately 50,000 households. The Computer and Internet Supplements are the primary
source of information collected by the Census Bureau on computer ownership.


                                                                                           22
is available for individuals in the outgoing rotations in the CPS, and information on home

computers is available in the Computer and Internet Supplement. We start by estimating

an earnings regression that includes a dummy variable for having a home computer for

the full working-age population. Panel I of Table 7 reports estimates. All specifications

incorporate a set of detailed controls, including state fixed effects, central city status,

gender, race, age, age squared, marital status, living with parents, home ownership,

detailed education level (up to 16 different codes), and school enrollment. The inclusion

of detailed education levels and school enrollment raises endogeneity concerns, but it is

useful for generating a conservative non-experimental estimate of the returns. The base

estimates, which are reported in Specification 1, indicate that quarterly earnings (based

on weekly earnings) are $1,208 higher among computer owners than they are among

those who do not own a computer, all else equal.

        A concern about the estimated relationship using cross-sectional data is that the

computers were purchased contemporaneously with earnings. To rule out this concern,

we take advantage of information available in the CPS on when the newest computer was

purchased. Specification 2 removes all observations in which the newest computer was

purchased in the year of the survey. Thus, all computers in the new sample were

purchased prior to when earnings were measured. 21 Removing these observations has

little effect on the estimates.

        To further investigate the question and control for unobserved heterogeneity, we

estimate the relationship using nearest-neighbor and propensity score estimators (reported

in Specifications 3 and 4, respectively). These models include a large number of variables


21
  Note that computers purchased in 2011 could be a replacement or additional computer for
computers purchased earlier.


                                                                                              23
to match on because of the detailed controls available in the CPS. In both cases, we find

large, positive estimates of the relationship between computer ownership and earnings.

These estimates are larger than those from the OLS specifications.

       Establishing that there is a strong positive correlation between earnings and home

computers using the full working-age population, we now turn to focused populations

that more closely match our experimental population. In Panel II of Table 7 we report

estimates for a sample of individuals ages 18 to 34, which is a range of ages that captures

75 percent of the experimental sample during the sample period. In Panel III, we limit

this sample to only individuals reporting having an associate degree or some college,

which is even more restrictive than our experimental sample. In both cases, we find large,

positive and statistically significant estimates on the home computer variable. Computer

owners have quarterly earnings that are roughly $700 to $1,700 higher than non-

computer owners, all else equal.

       A similar analysis for employment (reported in Table 8) also provides large,

positive, and statistically significant estimates of the relationship between computer

ownership and employment across all of the different samples. These estimates indicate

that weekly employment rates are 7 to 12 percentage points higher, on average, among

computer owners than they are among individuals who do not own a computer.

       Table 9 reports regressions for college enrollment. College enrollment in the CPS

is only defined for the age 18-24 population. Again, we find large, positive, and

statistically significant estimates of the relationship between computer ownership and

college enrollment across all of the specifications. These estimates indicate that college




                                                                                         24
enrollment rates are 12 to 16 percentage points higher, on average, among computer

owners than they are among individuals who do not own a computer.

        These estimates of the effect of home computers on earnings, employment and

college enrollment using the CPS are large, positive, and statistically significant,

contrasting sharply with the estimates of null effects found in our experiment. 22 Also,

although the experimental estimates reflect Intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates "scaling them

up" will not change the null effects finding. This discrepancy raises concerns about

positive selection into computer ownership resulting in an overstatement of the non-

experimental estimates of the effects of home computers on various outcomes.

Furthermore, controlling for a long list of independent variables, a few somewhat

endogenous variables, and techniques such as nearest neighbor matching and propensity

score matching to address selection does not change the conclusion. In all cases, we find

large, positive and statistically significant estimates.



4. Conclusions

        We provide new evidence on whether computers and the skills acquired in using

them have effects on earnings, employment and college enrollment by performing a field

experiment in which community college students were randomly given computers to use

at home and were followed for 7 years after treatment. Restricted-access administrative

data on earnings were obtained from the California State Employment Development

Department (EDD) UI system records and matched to all study participants. These data


22
  We find similar results using microdata for the United States from the PIAAC. For both
earnings and employment, we find large, positive and statistically significant coefficient estimates
on home computer use (or other non-work use) even after controlling for detailed levels of
education and numerous other variables.


                                                                                                 25
allow us to study employment and earnings among covered wage/salary jobs in the state

(i.e. non-federal and non-military). We do not find evidence of treatment effects (either

positive or negative) on earnings. We also do not find evidence of effects on the

extensive or intensive margins of labor supply. The findings of null effects are consistent

across many different specifications, measures, and subgroups. One caveat, however is

that although the results consistently show null effects the estimates are not precise.

       Using matched restricted-access administrative data on college enrollment from

the California Community College system and National Student Clearinghouse, we also

do not find that computers and the skills acquired in using them increase college

enrollment. This is important not only because it contributes to estimates of the effects of

computers on educational outcomes, but because it suggests that the null effects of

computer skills on earnings do not appear to be due to increased college enrollment. We

do not find evidence of treatment effects on college enrollment in the short or medium

run, and controlling for "endogenous" college enrollment in the earnings and employment

regressions has little effect on the treatment effect estimates.

       Importantly, our null effect estimates from the random experiment differ

substantially from those found from an analysis of CPS data, raising concerns about the

potential for selection bias in non-experimental estimates of returns. Estimates from

regressions with detailed controls, nearest-neighbor models, and propensity score models

all indicate large, positive, and statistically significant relationships between computer

ownership and earnings and employment, in sharp contrast to the null effects of our

experiment. It may be that non-experimental estimates overstate the labor market returns

to computer skills.




                                                                                             26
        Our focus in this study was on the labor market returns to computer skills among

community college students. Of course, the returns to computer skills may differ for

other groups, but community college students are an interesting group in their own right.

They represent roughly half of all public college students in the United States and a much

larger share in some states, such as California. Community colleges provide training for a

wide range of jobs of which a large percentage require the use of computers at work (e.g.

Appendix Table 1). Among workers with community college degrees, 85 percent use a

computer at work (OECD 2013). 23 On the other hand, community college students may

have more limited computer skills than do four-year university students because they

have less exposure to computer labs on campus and rarely have the opportunity to live on

campus. 24 We might expect the labor market returns to computer skills to be higher

when those skills are more limited in supply. Thus, the finding of a null effect for

community college students, among whom we might expect larger effects, provides a

useful test of the hypothesis. The null effects might be due to employers training workers

with the technology skills required for jobs, or other skills acquired in community

colleges as being much more important for employment. Alternatively, we cannot rule

out the possibility that the experiment failed to detect an effect because it is difficult to

perfectly alter the computer skills of workers. 25




23
   For comparison, 94 percent of workers with a 4-year university degree use computers at work,
and 59 percent of workers with a high school or lower education (OECD 2013).
24
   Site visits to the campus revealed that the college has only a few very crowded computer labs.
On the follow-up survey, one quarter of students reported experiencing wait times when using
computers at the college.
25
   Similar to concerns regarding educational effects, the entertainment value of home computers
and the Internet might also provide a distraction for users negatively affecting labor market
outcomes thus offsetting potential positive computer skill effects (see Malamud and Pop-Eleches
2011 and Bulman and Fairlie 2016 for example).


                                                                                                27
       Still, the labor market effects of computer skills likely differ across groups and the

experimental results presented here make one contribution to this body of evidence. More

experimental research is needed using different groups, especially from different parts of

the educational distribution.

Notes: The dependent variable is log quarterly earnings from California EDD UI records in
Specifications 1 and 2, and log quarterly earnings conditional on employment (i.e. positive
earnings) in Specifications 3 and 4. Earnings values less than 100 are censured at
log(100). Robust standard errors are reported and adjusted for multiple quarterly
observations for study participants. Baseline controls include gender, race, age, parents'
highest education level, high school grades, presence of own children, live with parents,
and family income.
