                                          ABSTRACT

The 1994 discovery of arsenic in groundwater in Bangladesh prompted a massive public health
campaign that led 20% of the population to switch from backyard wells to less convenient drinking
water sources that had a higher risk of fecal contamination. We find evidence of unintended health
consequences by comparing mortality trends between households in the same village that did and
did not have an incentive to abandon shallow tubewells. Post-campaign, households encouraged to
switch water sources have 46% higher rates of child mortality than those not encouraged to switch.
Switching away from arsenic-contaminated wells also increased adult mortality.

1       Introduction
    Water contamination is a central cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries.
In most settings, the primary water-borne threat is fecal-oral pathogens which lead to diarrheal
disease, the second most common cause of infant and child mortality worldwide (Liu et al.,
2015). However, in Bangladesh and a handful of other countries, toxic heavy metals that nat-
urally leach into ground water are a parallel concern. Based on tests conducted by the British
Geological Survey (BGS) in 1998, an estimated 20 million Bangladeshis had been consuming
well water that contained more than the government’s recommended maximum arsenic level
of 50 µg per liter, and many more above the World Health Organization’s 10 µg cutoff (Mac-
Donald, 1999). Although the health effects of arsenic are poorly understood, many believed
the Bangladeshi population to be in danger of serious health effects from long-term arsenic
exposure (Smith et al., 2000).
    In 1999, with help from international donors and NGOs, the government initiated a mas-
sive campaign to test over 5 million tubewells throughout the country and actively encourage
households to abandon contaminated wells (Ahmed et al., 2006). This international effort
to move households away from water sources containing arsenic constitutes one of the most
successful public health campaigns in recent history. In a strikingly short amount of time,
awareness-building efforts alone led around 20% of the population to transition from backyard
wells to less convenient drinking water sources, including deep tubewells outside of the home
and surface water. According to household survey data from the Bangladesh Demographic and
Health Survey (BDHS), by 2004 there was a high level of awareness of arsenic contamination
in endemic regions, and the majority of households had stopped drinking from wells known to
be contaminated.
    While it reduced chronic arsenic exposure, as we investigate in this paper, the nation-
wide shift away from backyard tubewells also appears to have inadvertently increased rates of
diarrheal disease, with the largest health consequences for children under five (Prüss et al.,
2002). This is because shallow tubewells – which frequently contain arsenic – are also “the
most appropriate technology in terms of microbiologically clean water” (Lokuge et al., 2003).
Tubewell water is very unlikely to be contaminated with fecal bacteria at source, and, because
shallow wells are located inside the residence, faces little risk of becoming contaminated in
storage.1 This makes shallow tubewells an extremely valuable prophylactic in settings such
as Bangladesh, where surface water contamination frequently causes cholera, dysentery and
other potentially fatal water-borne disease. As a result, public health efforts in the early 2000s
to move households away from shallow tubewells contaminated with arsenic made households
more vulnerable to diarrheal disease.
    1
    Proximity of water source is also likely to increase the overall amount of drinking water consumed, further
decreasing mortality from diarrheal disease.
    To investigate this tradeoff, we quantify the impact on child mortality of switching water
sources in response to the arsenic awareness campaign by making use of the high degree of
natural variation within villages in the level of arsenic in backyard groundwater. Small-scale
spatial variability enables us to compare households living relatively close to one another who
tested negative versus positive for arsenic contamination, and hence were differentially moti-
vated to abandon shallow tubewells. To identify households that were encouraged to stop using
shallow tubewells, we collected water samples from each household’s kitchen storage tank and
closest tubewell. Consistent with government water tests (MacDonald, 1999), our tubewell
tests indicate that over 65% of households in our subdistricts had been drawing water from
contaminated tubewells prior to 2000. Meanwhile, our storage tank tests show that only 1%
of households are still drinking arsenic-contaminated water by 2009. This implies that almost
all affected households in our study area switched from shallow tubewells to deep tubewells or
surface water in the decade after testing.
    We then compare health outcomes of children born before versus after well-testing took
place across these two subsamples in a difference-in-difference specification. Although arsenic
in groundwater is concentrated in certain villages due to their position relative to the water
table, concentrations are highly variable over short distances and nearly all contaminated vil-
lages contain pockets of clean groundwater that are impossible to predict. Hence, we include
village fixed effects to absorb differences in mean characteristics between relatively exposed and
unexposed villages arising from potential correlations between the macro spatial distribution
of arsenic and other household characteristics such as income that may influence child health.
In that manner, our identification strategy relies on the fact that the spatial distribution of
arsenic is believed to be quasi-random within distances as small as villages, which our data
support.
    Our results indicate that, while mortality rates were almost identical in contaminated versus
uncontaminated households pre-1999, these outcomes diverged sharply immediately after the
switching campaign: Post-2000, households with arsenic-contaminated wells exhibit a 46%
increase in child mortality relative to those with arsenic-free wells, which coincides with the
moment at which contaminated households were pushed to switch to more remote sources.
    To more firmly attribute the mortality increase to lower use of shallow tubewells, we also
test whether households experience less of a mortality decline when they have access to deep
tubewells, which varies across space and over time. When there is a deep tubewell nearby,
switching away from backyard tubewells should entail little increase in water storage time or
use of surface water, and hence have no adverse effects on child health. As predicted, the
mortality effects of abandoning shallow tubewells increase sharply with household distance
to deep tubewells. Contaminated households with more than one deep tubewell within 400
meters per 10 village child births do not experience a measurable increase in child mortality,
whereas households with no deep tubewell within 400 meters experience a sharp and significant
increase in infant and child deaths. This pattern supports our interpretation that the increase in
mortality post-2000 is driven by a decrease in access to pathogen-free water among households
that are encouraged to abandon arsenic-contaminated tubewells.
    Given the scarcity of microbiologically clean and convenient alternative water sources in
much of rural Bangladesh, this finding raises the question of whether use of shallow tubewells
contaminated with arsenic should continue to be discouraged. Clearly, policy recommendations
must weigh the health effects of contaminated water against the health consequences of arsenic
exposure. However, our estimates of the impact of arsenic exposure on adult mortality indicate
no measurable effect of arsenic ingestion on life expectancy in this setting, increasing the case
for promoting shallow tubewells as a drinking water source – at least for young children – even
when such wells may contain arsenic.


2       Background
2.1     Public health efforts surrounding shallow tubewells
     Largely because of its geographic vulnerability to flooding and high population density,
Bangladesh has historically had one of the highest incidences worldwide of water-borne viral
and parasitic infections and corresponding infant and child mortality. To reduce diarrheal
disease outbreaks, an estimated 8.6 million shallow tubewells were constructed throughout
the country from the 1970s to the 1990s, an effort funded by the Bangladeshi government,
UNICEF, the World Bank, and numerous other public and private organizations. This massive
infrastructure investment succeeded in moving at least 94% of rural Bangladeshis from parasite-
infected surface water to protected ground water (Caldwell et al., 2003).
     Unfortunately, these improvements in sanitation were stymied by the discovery of arsenic in
Bangladesh’s groundwater in the mid-1990s.2 In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO)
publicly declared groundwater arsenic contamination to be a “major public health issue”, and
the following year the World Bank approved a $32.4 million grant to address the emergency
(Caldwell et al., 2003).
     In 1998, the BGS conducted a nationwide study measuring levels of contamination in shallow
tubewells (MacDonald, 1999). Results indicated that 15% of the population was in grave
danger, drinking water with more than 50 ppb (µg) As, and 30% in lesser danger, drinking
water with more than 10 ppb As (MacDonald, 1999).3 In response, the government screened
all shallow tubewells in contaminated regions. Wells that tested positive for arsenic (1.4 million)
were painted red and those tested safe (3.5 million) were painted green (Ahmed et al., 2006).
    2
     Geologists first discovered trace amount of arsenic in 1987, and physical manifestations of arsenicosis, the
disease caused by substantial arsenic ingestion, were first documented in 1994 (Rahman, 2002).
   3
     These estimates have since been increased by the Government of Bangladesh to 30 million and 70 million
(WHO, 2008).
Households were (and continue to be) strongly encouraged to avoid drinking from red tubewells
and switch to alternative sources (Jakariya, 2007).
    However, safe and feasible alternatives are highly site specific, depending on the groundwa-
ter level, water quality and hydrogeological conditions. Arsenic-free alternatives include deep
tubewells, piped water, dug wells, surface water, and harvested rainwater.4 Among these, deep
tubewells are the most commonly promoted alternative. Although they are prohibitively ex-
pensive for most households to build, between 1998 and 2006 the Arsenic Mitigation Water
Supply Project built over 9,000 deep tubewells in 1800 villages (WorldBank, 2007)5 . Two fac-
tors constrained the use of deep tubewells as a safe alternative. First, many villages had limited
access to deep aquifers. Second, an unfounded fear of arsenic contamination in deep aquifers
led the 2004 National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation report to stress a “preference of surface
water over groundwater” (Government, 2004).
    Public education campaigns raising awareness of arsenic and promoting alternative water
sources have been widespread since 1999 (BMOH, 2004). For instance, during the testing
campaign of 1999-2000, UNICEF tubewell testers shared basic information about the dangers
of arsenic ingestion and attempted to dispel common myths before revealing test results. In
more recent years, UNICEF has established an educational curriculum integrating hygiene and
sanitation with arsenic awareness and also involved the community in choosing alternative water
sources. The impact has been considerable: By 2004, an estimated 80% of the population was
aware that arsenic may be a danger (relative to less than ten percent in the late 1990s), and
70% reported changing water source to avoid arsenic (UNICEF, 2008).


2.2     Health benefits of switching away from shallow tubewells
    Arsenic is a known carcinogen that has been shown in laboratory studies to cause or catalyze
several forms of cancer, particularly of the lung and bladder (Kozul et al., 2009). Numerous
field studies have also found a strong dose-response relationship between skin cancer and arsenic
exposure through drinking water (Chen et al., 2006). Hence, it is generally accepted that
exposure to high levels of arsenic (> 100 µg) increases cancer-related deaths and morbidity in the
older adult population. The health effects of low-level exposure are largely unknown. However,
due to the decades-long latency of most arsenic-related health problems, the National Research
Council concludes that “arsenic-related disease due to chronic exposure through drinking water
has a relatively low incidence” in settings with low average life expectancy such as Bangladesh
(Council, 2001).
   4
      It is possible to remove arsenic from water, but the technology is expensive and very rarely used. Though
less emphasized by policymakers, tubewell sharing has been relatively popular in some parts of the country (van
Geen et al., 2003).
    5
      The cost of constructing deep tubewells in most locations is estimated to be around $800, while the cost of
constructing shallow tubewells is around $200.
    An epidemiological study following over 10,000 adults in the Araihazar District in Bangladesh
reached a different conclusion, reporting very high mortality associated with arsenic exposure
(Argos et al., 2010). The authors estimated that approximately 20% of all deaths documented
over nine years were attributable to arsenic, with mortality rates nearly 70% higher for those
exposed to concentrations of over 150 ppb relative to those exposed to less than 10 ppb. An
important shortcoming of this study, however, which was not addressed by the authors, is
that arsenic concentrations in groundwater are not orthogonal to socio-economic status at the
macro-spatial level. As shown in Madajewicz et al. (2007), due to the spatial clustering of
arsenic across the 54 study villages, in this setting uncontaminated wells happen to be concen-
trated in villages with significantly higher average income and assets (with assets 42% higher
and expenditures 16% higher).6 Importantly for this paper, the differences disappear when
accounting for mean levels of village income, however, the Argos et al. (2010) study fails to do
so, and as a result mortality differentials are almost certainly biased upwards.
    On the other end of the spectrum, calculations of the disease burden from arsenic exposure
by Lokuge et al. (2003) that take into account only “strong causal evidence” from existing
studies estimate that arsenic-related disease leads to the loss of 174,174 disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs) per year, which amounts to only 0.3% of the total disease burden. Diarrheal
disease, in comparison, accounts for 7.2% to 12.1% of the total disease burden (Lokuge et al.,
2003). Researchers almost universally agree that the relationship between arsenic exposure
and morbidity and mortality in younger populations is minimal. A handful of studies have
reported reproductive health consequences, although the evidence is mixed (Vahter, 2008; Tofail
et al., 2009; Milton et al., 2005; Liaw et al., 2008). There is also some concern, based on a
highly publicized study of children in Araihazar, that arsenic exposure inhibits the mental
development of children (Wasserman et al., 2004), but the estimates face the same bias that
the larger mortality study face and should thus be interpreted with caution. In general, since
arsenic exposure is also correlated with socioeconomic conditions influencing child development
measures, causality cannot be easily inferred from studies that show a correlation between
arsenic exposure and various health outcomes (Tofail et al., 2009).


2.3     Health costs of switching away from shallow tubewells
   Because shallow tubewells are generally built very close to an individual residence, they are
associated with less water storage and greater water consumption. Water storage time is an
important determinant of water contamination with fecal matter, as water that is not stored
   6
    van Geen et al. (2003) describes these spatial patterns in detail: “Most of the wells with the lowest As
concentrations are located in the northwestern portion of the study area (Figure 4)”, which appears to contain
higher SES villages. According to Madajewicz et al. (2007), there is potentially “a correlation between soil
types and arsenic levels and therefore possibly between arsenic levels and incomes. However, this correlation
would not be likely to appear within villages. The surrounding fields are fairly uniform geologically, while the
dispersion of incomes and wealth within villages is large.”
properly is continuously exposed to dirty hands and cups or utensils. In previous studies,
distance from water source has been found to be directly correlated with the presence of bacterial
infections such as trachoma and diarrheal disease (Esrey et al., 1991). A study in Araihazar
District found that those who abandoned shallow tubewells and switched to a safe well increased
the time spent obtaining water by fifteen-fold (Madajewicz et al., 2007).
    Inconvenience also implies a potential decrease in the amount of water consumed (Hoque
et al., 1989), which can have important health consequences for children facing dehydration
from diarrheal disease. In fact, the quantity of water used has been shown to be a better
predictor of child health than the quality of water used (Esrey et al., 1991). The only water
sources equally convenient to shallow tubewells are surface water sources that are also likely
to be close to the residence. However, while they are free of arsenic, surface water is highly
contaminated with fecal-oral pathogens at source. While water filtering and cleaning methods
can address point of use contamination, survey data indicate that these have largely been
abandoned in rural Bangladesh since the construction of shallow tubewells (Caldwell et al.,
2003). For these reasons, Lokuge et al. (2003) estimate that abandonment of shallow tubewells
would increase a household’s risk of diarrheal disease by 20%. Nonetheless, to date there have
been no empirical investigations into the health costs of moving away from shallow tubewells
and health messages continue to promote alternative water sources in endemic areas.


3       Estimation strategy
3.1     Data and setting
    To study child mortality responses to the discontinued use of shallow tubewells, we capitalize
on extensive household survey data collected by the authors in 2007, which include reproductive
and child health outcomes for all children ever born to the household head. The data cover
3,160 households randomly sampled from 162 villages in two subdistricts of Barisal, one of
the most heavily contaminated districts in the country.7 According to village-level well testing
data collected by the government, over 60% of tubewells in the area were contaminated in 1999.
Barisal was also a relatively “successful” region in terms of the public health campaign that
followed. Data from the BDHS reveal a uniquely high rate of switching away from contaminated
water sources in Barisal Division, attributed largely to the geology of the region, which made
it possible to construct deep tubewells in almost all villages.
    7
     The full household survey collected data from 9,155 households in three districts, only one of which (Barisal
District) is contaminated with arsenic (Caldwell et al., 2006). Households included in the study were randomly
drawn in a two-stage sampling process, in which villages were first sampled from the universe of villages contain-
ing more than 50 and fewer than 500 households, and then 20 households per village were selected at random
from village-level census data. Because the original purpose of the data was the evaluation of an adolescent
girls program operating in the area, households were eligible for inclusion only if they included at least one
adolescent girl.
    In 2009, 3138 (99%) of these households were successfully revisited. At this time, each
household’s closest shallow tubewell was tested for arsenic using a standard field testing kit,
and a brief survey was administered to household heads that collected data on water sources
before and after well testing and respondents’ knowledge of arsenic contamination. Our analysis
sample includes all children born in the residence between 1980 and 2007 to heads of house-
holds.8 The final sample encompasses 2,862 households and 12,277 children, 3,821 of whom
reside in low concentration households and 8,456 in high concentration households.


3.2     Identification strategy
    Our identification strategy makes use of the fact that there is significant small-scale vari-
ability of arsenic concentrations in ground water (Yu et al., 2003) that generates substantial
within-village variation in exposure via well contamination: an estimated 88% of contaminated
wells are located within 100 meters of an uncontaminated well (Van Geen et al., 2002). Fur-
thermore, within a large area, local pockets of contamination are extremely hard to predict and
do not appear to be correlated with observable features of the land.9 Small-scale variation in
arsenic levels is due to heterogeneity of near-surface geology and the resulting biogeochemical
environments, both of which are uncorrelated with agricultural land quality. This variation in
well contamination allows us to compare households residing close to one another who are and
are not exposed to arsenic before 1999 in a difference-in-difference (DID) estimation strategy.
    In particular, we define a binary level of arsenic exposure pre-1999 using two methods. The
first, denoted “measured contamination,” categorizes households as contaminated (or “high
concentration”) if the concentration of arsenic in the shallow tubewell closest to the household
is greater than 60 ppb when measured by our field team in 2009.10 The second, denoted “re-
ported contamination”, categorizes households as exposed if any of the shallow tubewells ever
used by the household are reported to have tested positive for arsenic, been painted red, been
deemed unsafe to use for drinking, been abandoned, or been built less than three years before
the survey.11 The 48% of households that lack this information because the households report
not having used any of the closeby tubewells are categorized using the “measured contamina-
tion” method for both measures. The two measures of contamination correspond for 66% of
    8
      The 2697 children (18%) born after 1980 but before the household moved into the current residence are
dropped from the analysis, although the results are robust to including them. We also exclude from the sample
167 individuals with missing or implausible data on mother’s age at birth. One additional household is dropped
because identifying data do not match well between the baseline and arsenic surveys.
    9
      Because of this difficulty, encouraging households to build new shallow tubewells on uncontaminated land
is not a viable policy alternative.
   10
      We chose 60 ppb as the cutoff to reflect the 50 ppb WHO cutoff, taking into account an estimated 10%
per decade increase in arsenic levels, so that contaminated wells in our sample are those believed to have tested
above 50 ppb in 1999. Relatively constant groundwater As concentrations have been reported in a number of
time series studies (Van Geen et al., 2002).
   11
      The last condition is included because wells installed recently were likely built to replace contaminated
wells.
households. Since our survey data on history of shallow tubewell use indicate a tendency to
underreport use of highly contaminated wells, we deem “measured contamination” to be the
more conservative variable, but present the reported contamination results in appendix table
2.1 for comparison.
    To test the validity of our assumption that within-village variation in arsenic exposure is
orthogonal to household characteristics, appendix tables 1.1-1.2 present mean differences be-
tween low concentration and high concentration households in a large number of time-invariant
characteristics. All rows contain regression-controlled means that account for village fixed ef-
fects, as do reported t-statistics of the differences in means. Only one variable out of 20 -
fraction of children living in household - is significantly different across the two subsamples
at the 10% level under the measured but not the reported contamination measure, and the
point estimate of the difference is extremely small (2 percentage points). An F-test of joint
significance indicates that the samples are balanced on observables within villages, including a
number of indicators of socio-economic status. Importantly, as shown in appendix table 1.3,
the same exercise conducted without accounting for mean differences across villages shows a
high degree of imbalance, as was also observed in the Araihazar study area.12
    Although household characteristics are balanced, appendix table 1.1 also reveals significant
differences in mean levels of infant and child mortality across subsamples: High concentration
households have higher rates of infant and child mortality over the entire period. Note, however,
that there is no indication from sample means alone of corresponding differences in the timing
of births, which could potentially be influenced by differences in child mortality, and would
potentially complicate the interpretation of trend differences. The descriptive data also support
other assumptions in our estimation strategy: The fraction of households that report that their
closest well was tested during the 1998-2000 campaign was 76%, consistent with estimates from
national data.


3.3     Estimating equation
    We test for changes in infant and child mortality associated with the testing campaign by
estimating the following difference-in-difference equation for individual i in village j at time t,
which includes village fixed effects θ:

            Yijt = α + γ × HighConi + δ × Exposuret + β × (HighConi × Exposuret ) + θj + ijt                  (1)

    HighCon is a dummy variable equal to one if the individual is in a household exposed to
arsenic. Exposure denotes the fraction of life that a child was potentially exposed to microbio-
logically unsafe water due to the household switching away from a shallow tubewell as a result
  12
     It is interesting to note that spatial clustering in the Araihazar sample gives rise to a negative correlation
between arsenic exposure and socio-economic status, while across Barisal the correlation is largely positive.
of the testing campaign. Hence, for under 1 mortality, Exposure is a dummy variable equal
to 1 if the child was born after 2000, and for under 2 mortality, Exposure takes a value of 1 if
the child was born after 2000, 0.5 if born in 2000, and 0 if born before 2000.13 Although the
nationwide campaign began in mid-1999, 2000 is our preferred cutoff since behavioral change is
presumed to respond with a lag. In appendix table 2.6 we verify that our regression estimates
are robust to using 1999 as a cutoff point.
    We are interested in the coefficient estimate of β, our estimate of the change in mortal-
ity due to abandoning shallow tubewells. Proper identification relies on the assumption that
other events occurring over the observation period did not differentially affect infant and child
mortality rates for households that were versus were not encouraged to stop using shallow
tubewells. The high variation in arsenic exposure across very small distances and the similarity
across contaminated and uncontaminated households in baseline characteristics lend credibility
to this assumption. However, to account for any differences in baseline characteristics that may
contribute to time trends in mortality, we also estimate versions of equation 1 with basic con-
trols for individual’s sex, birth order, birth year, birth year squared, mother’s age at first birth,
years since birth of last child, parents’ education, household income, and years lived in current
house, and also with a wider set of control variables that additionally includes house value,
solvency, land size, number of rooms, electricity, whether Muslim, monthly income per capita,
and years lived in village. Standard errors are clustered at the village level in all regressions.

sured contamination method to divide the sample into switchers and non-switchers. For the
most part, mortality trends in households with arsenic closely follow those in households with
clean wells until 1998, at which point they diverge sharply. Both child and infant mortality
are substantially higher among individuals in households with contaminated wells immediately
after but not before the arsenic testing campaign, and differences persist to the time of the
survey in 2007. This suggests that most switching, and the resulting health effects of exposure
to bacteriologically unsafe water, occurred immediately after the campaign.

      The maximum number of years of exposure is the mortality age (of one, two, or five years) being measured.

Notes: Data from our 2007 data collection and 2009 tubewell tests. “Under 5 mortality rate” is deaths
between 0 and 60 months of age per 1, 000 births observed in each two-year period, which are plotted as cubic
splines for smoothness. High contamination households defined as those with tubewells that contain arsenic
contamination greater than 60 ppb according to field tests of the shallow tubewells closest to the residence.


4.1     Regression results
    Table 4.1 presents the corresponding regression results from equation 1 for infant, under
two, and under five mortality. As reflected in figure 1, the coefficient estimates indicate a
substantial and statistically significant increase in mortality after 2000 among individuals with
arsenic-contaminated tubewells. As reported in column 2, being born into a household that
has been encouraged to stop using their shallow tubewell is associated with a 1.9 percentage
point (48%) increase in the likelihood of death within 12 months, a 2.9 percentage point (63%)
increase within two years, and a 5.2 percentage point (46%) increase within five years. These
magnitudes imply that mortality from diarrheal disease, which was estimated to account for
approximately one-quarter of deaths under age five in 2000 (Morris et al., 2003), more than
doubled after the well-testing campaign for households that abandoned shallow tubewells.

Notes: Data from our 2007 data collection and 2009 tubewell tests. Linear probability estimates with
village fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the village level. High contamination households defined
as those with tubewells that contain arsenic contamination greater than 60 ppb according to field tests of
the shallow tubewells closest to the residence. Samples exclude children under the age cutoff in 2007, for
whom mortality is censored.



4.2     Robustness checks
    The estimates are robust to a number of alternative specifications, detailed in the appendix.
Replacing early life exposure with the number of years exposed (appendix table 2.2) or a binary
measure equal to 1 if the child was born after 2000 (appendix table 2.3) results in quantitatively
similar but noisier estimates, as we would expect. To gain precision on the date of switching,
appendix table 2.4 makes use of survey data on the year in which a household’s well was reported
to be tested, replacing the binary indicator of a child being born after 2000 with an indicator
of being born after the household’s well was tested. In this specification, the DID estimate is
more precise and comparable in magnitude for deaths under 12 and under 24 months, as one
would expect if we take the survey reports at face value. Using a 50 ppb cutoff (appendix table
2.5), and using 1999 instead of 2000 as the switching date (appendix table 2.6) produce very
similar results.
    Finally, to further test the assumption of parallel time trends between switchers and non-
switchers, we exclude households with arsenic contamination below 60 ppb and run a placebo
check in which we test whether an imaginary cutoff point of 100 ppb produces similar patterns
within the subsample of households that we know were all encouraged to abandon shallow
tubewells (appendix table 2.7). If level of arsenic contamination in groundwater is correlated
with unobservable characteristics of the household that are giving rise to differential time trends
in mortality, we should expect to see positive and significant point estimates on the interaction
terms in both regressions. On the other hand, if we only observe a significant DID estimate
when the true cutoff is used, we can deduce that the estimates reflect the causal effect of
changing water sources rather than time trends in unobservables correlated with arsenic. In-
deed, regression results indicate no significant effect on mortality of arsenic levels above 100
ppb relative to those between 50 and 100 ppb.


4.3     Impact of deep tubewell constructions
    To more firmly attribute the mortality increase to the shift away from shallow tubewells,
we evaluate whether households that had greater access to alternative clean water sources
experienced fewer adverse health consequences when they were encouraged to switch sources.
Although backyard tubewells are always more convenient than sources outside the home, the
increase in water collection cost will be minimal if the external source is very close. For these
households, switching away from backyard tubewells should entail little increase in water storage
time or use of surface water, and hence have little adverse impact on child health.




                      Figure 2: Number of existing deep tubewells per 100
                      births per year since 1998
Notes: Data from our 2007 and 2016 data collection and 2009 tubewell tests. High contamination households
defined as those with tubewells that contain arsenic contamination greater than 60 ppb according to field tests
of the shallow tubewells closest to the residence.



    Access to deep tubewells varies across space and over time in our sample. To test this
hypothesis, we use survey data on the location and timing of deep tubewell construction in
each village that were collected in 2016 to characterize each household in each year according
to its distance to the nearest deep tubewell, and construct a variable equal to the number of
deep tubewells within 400 meters of the home in any given year per 10 births in that year. We
then run a triple-difference regression equivalent to equation 1 that also contains T ubewells
and its interaction with Exposure, HighCon, and their interaction. Our prediction on deep
tubewell access implies a significant negative coefficient estimate on the triple difference term,
which would indicate that mortality effects of the campaign fall with proximity to arsenic-free
water sources.
    As shown in figure 2, there was a large increase in access to deep tubwells over the time
period of the study, largely motivated by the discovery of arsenic in shallow wells. While
there were on average only 4 deep tubewells per study village in 2000, by 2007 there were 7
deep tubewells per village and the average household had 3 deep tubewells within 400 meters
of their home. As predicted, the mortality effects of abandoning shallow tubewells decrease
sharply with household proximity to deep tubewells. Switcher households with more than two
deep tubewells within 400 meters per 10 births do not experience a measurable increase in child
mortality, whereas households with no deep tubewell within 400 meters experience a sharp and
significant increase in infant and child deaths. Regressions controlling for the number of deep
tubewells within 750 meters per 10 births in appendix table 2.8 yield similar but weaker results.
This pattern lends credibility to our interpretation that the increase in mortality post-2000 is
driven by a decrease in access to pathogen-free water among households that are encouraged
to abandon shallow tubewells.

DID, low, median, and high tubewells/births is the effect of switching to pathogenically unsafe water after
2000 for high-contamination households at the 25th percentile, the 50th, and the 75th percentile in deep
tubewells per 10 births.
4.4     Impact of arsenic on adult mortality
    In light of our evidence on the protective health effects of shallow tubewells for infants and
children, it is important to determine whether there are offsetting negative health consequences
of low-level chronic arsenic ingestion that might justify the current policy recommendation that
households avoid arsenic-laden tubewells even when there are no other pathogen-free water
sources available. To estimate the magnitude of health gains from abandoning shallow tubwells,
we use survey data collected in 2011 on the age of death of the mother and father of the
household head - who, according to local custom, are very likely to have lived in the same
household as their son and thus have been exposed to arsenic in the drinking water for a
number of years.
    Our empirical analysis of adult mortality calculates the hazard of dying each year from
1970 to 2010 as it relates to arsenic levels of drinking water.14 As in the child mortality
analysis, we compare households above and below the 60 ppb cutoff, the level of arsenic that
has been deemed unsafe for chronic exposure, and also interact arsenic contamination with an
indicator of Post-2000 (analogous to “Exposure”) to test whether adult mortality improves
when households with contaminated wells are encouraged to stop using shallow tubewells.
    As shown in table 4.3, there is no difference between contaminated and uncontaminated
households in the hazard of dying prior to 2000. While there is some indication that mortality
differences emerge, elevated mortality risk only appears after households with arsenic wells are
encouraged to switch sources. In particular, after 2000, the hazard ratio of dying is 1.27 in high-
contamination households, which implies that adults in high-contamination households had a
risk of dying that is 1.27 times that in low-contamination households (+27%) and statistically
significant.15 The control test in appendix table 3.2 shows that the hazard of dying did not
diverge between high- and low-contamination households at an earlier point in time, indicating
that differences in mortality risk post-2000 are not due to differential time trends in adult
mortality but indeed due to the change in water sources.
    Overall, our findings suggest that arsenic exposure had little direct adverse effect on adult
mortality. Moreover, switching to more inconvenient water sources appears to have decreased
not only child but also adult life expectancy.
  14
      Overall, 39% of mothers and 12% of fathers are still alive at the end of the period. Questions on age of
death were added to the 2016 survey midway through data collection, and we attempted to reach all households
that had already completed the survey by that point by phone. Ultimately, age of death data were collected
from 53% of households, with the majority of attrition due to respondents failing to answer the phone, followed
by failure to recall age of death.
   15
      Displayed hazard ratios are significant if the confidence interval does not include 1, meaning that the hazard
of dying does not significantly differ by group.

5    Conclusion
    Our results show evidence from Bangladesh of strong protective effects of shallow tubewells
on infant and child health that appear to outweigh the health risk they pose in terms of
arsenic exposure. In particular, while the Bangladeshi arsenic mitigation campaign has been
heralded by the international medical community as a life-saving effort, our estimates indicate
substantial negative health consequences of moving households away from shallow tubewells as
sources of drinking water. Using data from a district in which shallow tubewells were readily
abandoned for less convenient but arsenic-free deep tubewells, we find that households that
were encouraged to switch sources experienced a significant increase in the rate of infant and
child mortality, and no evidence of corresponding gains in adult life expectancy. In light of this
evidence, future public health interventions need to reconsider efforts to convince households
to abandon shallow tubewells when alternatives that are equally safe in terms of water-borne
pathogens are not readily available.
