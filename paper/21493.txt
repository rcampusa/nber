Equilibrium Price Dispersion Across and Within Stores

JEL No. D43

                                              ABSTRACT

We develop a search-theoretic model of the product market that generates price dispersion across and
within stores. Buyers differ with respect to their ability to shop around, both at different stores and
at different times. The fact that some buyers can shop from only one seller while others can shop from
multiple sellers causes price dispersion across stores. The fact that the buyers who can shop from multiple
sellers are more likely to be able to shop at inconvenient times (e.g., on Monday morning) causes price
dispersion within stores. Specifically, it causes sellers to post different prices for the same good at
different times in order to discriminate between different types of buyers.

1         Introduction
It is a well-known fact that the same product is sold at very diﬀerent prices, even when
one restricts attention to sales taking place in the same geographical area and in the same
narrow period of time. For instance, Sorensen (2000) finds that the average standard
deviation of the price posted by diﬀerent pharmacies for the same drug in the same town
in upstate New York is 22%. In a more systematic study of price dispersion that covers
1.4 million goods in 54 geographical markets within the US, Kaplan and Menzio (2014b)
find that the average standard deviation of the price at which the same product is sold
within the same geographical area and the same quarter is 19%. Moreover, it appears
that price dispersion is caused by both diﬀerence in prices across diﬀerent stores and
diﬀerence in prices within each store. For instance, Kaplan and Menzio (2014b) find that
approximately half of the overall variance of prices for the same good in the same market
and in the same quarter is due to the fact that diﬀerent stores sell the same good at a
diﬀerent price on average, while the remainder is due to the fact that the same store sells
the same good at diﬀerent prices in diﬀerent transactions taking place during the same
quarter.1

        In this paper, we develop a model of price dispersion across and within stores by
combining the standard theory of price dispersion of, e.g., Butters (1977) and Burdett
and Judd (1983) and the standard theory of intertemporal price discrimination of, e.g.,
Conslik, Gerstner and Sobel (1984) and Sobel (1984).2 Specifically, we build a model of
the market for an indivisible good. On the demand side, there are buyers who diﬀer with
respect to their ability to shop at diﬀerent stores, as well as with respect to their ability
to shop at diﬀerent times: Some buyers can shop from only one seller while others can
shop from multiple sellers, and some buyers can shop only during the day while others can
    1
     These decomposition follows immediately from Table 3 in Kaplan and Menzio (2014b). For a par-
ticular good, the fraction of the price variance coming from across-store variation is given by the sum of
the variance of the store component and the store-good component. The fraction of the price variance
coming from within store variation is the variance of the transaction component.
   2
     Besides intertemporal price discrimination, there are other explanations for why a seller would charge
diﬀerent prices for the same good within the same quarter. First, as in Sheshinski and Weiss (1974),
Benabou (1988) or Burdett and Menzio (2013), a seller may change his nominal price during a quarter
in order to keep up with the movements in the aggregate price level (more or less frequently depending
on inflation and menu costs). Second, as suggested by Aguirregabiria (1999), a seller may change his
price during a quarter in response to changes in his inventories of the good. Similarly, Lazear (1986)
suggests that a seller will follow a non-stationary pricing policy if the good “expires” at a given date.
Finally, as suggested by Menzio and Trachter (2014), a large seller may change his price over time in
order to occasionally price out of the market a fringe of small sellers. In this paper, we abstact from these
additional sources of high-frequency variations in a seller’s price.

shop both during the day and during the night. On the supply side, there are identical
sellers and each seller posts a (potentially diﬀerent) price for the good in the day and at
night.

   We prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium. The equilibrium always features
price variation across stores. Moreover, if the buyers who are able to shop both during
the day and at night can shop from more stores than the buyers who are only able to shop
during the day, the equilibrium also features price variation within stores. In particular,
the equilibrium is such that some sellers post a strictly lower price during the night than
during the day. On the other hand, if the buyers who are able to shop both during
the day and at night can shop from fewer stores, the equilibrium does not features price
variation within stores. That is, sellers do not vary their price over time. Intuitively, price
dispersion across stores arises because sellers meet some buyers who cannot purchase from
any other store and some other buyers who can and–as explained in Butters (1977) and
Burdett and Judd (1983)–this heterogeneity induces identical sellers to post diﬀerent
prices for the same good. Price dispersion within stores arises because–if the buyers
who are more likely to be able to shop at night are also more likely to be able to shop
from multiple stores–a seller can compete more fiercely for these buyers without losing
revenues on the other customers by charging a lower price at night than during the day.

   The paper’s main contribution is to develop a rich theory of price dispersion, where
some of the overall dispersion in prices is due to the fact that diﬀerent sellers set diﬀerent
average prices, and some is due to the fact that the same seller sets a diﬀerent price
at diﬀerent times of the week. The empirical evidence reported by Kaplan and Menzio
(2014b) suggests that both sources of price dispersion are quantitatively important and,
hence, any theory of price dispersion should take both of them into account. Moreover,
our theory shows that price dispersion within and across stores has the very same origin:
heterogeneity across buyers in the ability to shop around (be it at diﬀerent locations
or at diﬀerent times). The empirical evidence in Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Kaplan
and Menzio (2014a, 2014b) suggests that this type of heterogeneity is important, as, for
example, the elderly and the unemployed spend more time shopping than the young and
the employed.

   The main diﬀerence between our model and a standard model of price dispersion is
that, in our model, there are multiple times within a period (i.e., day and night) and
buyers may diﬀer in both their ability to shop at diﬀerent stores and at diﬀerent times.

                                              3
From the substantive point of view, this novel aspect of our model open the possibility for
intertemporal price discrimination and, hence, within store price dispersion.3 From the
technical point of view, this novel aspect of our model implies that sellers post multiple
prices (i.e., a day price and a night price) rather than a single price. In turn, this implies
that the solution technique for the standard model of price dispersion cannot be applied.
Indeed, we develop a new approach to solve for the equilibrium, which is likely to be
applicable to several other models in which sellers set multiple prices (e.g., models where
sellers trade multiple products or models where seller post screening contracts, etc. . . ).

        The main diﬀerence between a standard model of intertemporal price discrimination
and our model is that we study intertemporal price discrimination in the context of an
imperfectly competitive environment in the spirit of Butters (1977) and Burdett and
Judd (1983), where identical sellers have an incentive to set diﬀerent prices. From the
substantive point of view, this novel feature of our model can lead to the coexistence of
within store and across store price dispersion. From the technical point of view, the novel
feature of our model implies that intertemporal price discrimination can emerge even when
the only diﬀerence across buyers is their ability to shop around (at diﬀerent locations and
diﬀerent times). In contrast, the existing models of price discrimination (which do not
generate price dispersion across sellers) assume that buyers diﬀer both with respect to
their valuation of the good and with respect to their ability to shop around (see, e.g.,
Sobel 1984 and Albrecht, Postel-Vinay and Vroman 2013). Finally, our model admits
a unique equilibrium. In contrast, existing equilibrium models of intertemporal price
discrimination have typically multiple equilibria, which creates challenges for estimation
and counterfactual analysis.



2         Environment
We consider the market for an indivisible good that operates in two subperiods: day and
night. On one side of the market, there is a measure 1 of identical sellers who can produce
the good on demand at a constant marginal cost, which we normalize to zero. Each seller
    3
    In Butters (1977), Varian (1980) and Burdett and Judd (1983), each seller is indiﬀerent between
posting any price on the support of the equilibrium price distribution. Therefore, if sellers choose diﬀerent
prices on diﬀerent days, these models would generate price dispersion both across and within stores.
However, this result is not robust to the introduction of menu costs (which would discourage sellers from
resetting their prices if there is not a strictly positive benefit from doing so) or to the introduction of
heterogeneity in the sellers’ cost of production (which would break the seller’s indiﬀerence between any
price on the support of the equilibrium distribution).

                                                     4
simultaneously and independently posts a pair of prices (   ), where  ∈ [0 ] is the
price of the good during the day,  ∈ [0 ] is the price of the good during the night,
and   0 is the buyers’ valuation of the good. We denote as (   ) the distribution
of prices across sellers. Similarly, we denote as  the marginal distribution of day prices
and as  the marginal distribution of night prices. Finally, we denote as  the marginal
distribution of the lowest price of each seller.

   On the other side of the market, there is a measure   0 of buyers of type , and a
measure   0 of buyers of type . The two types of buyers diﬀer with respect of their
ability to shop from diﬀerent sellers, as well as with respect of their ability to shop at
diﬀerent points in time. In particular, a buyer of type  is in contact with only one seller
with probability  ∈ (0 1) and with multiple (for the sake of simplicity, two) sellers with
probability 1 −  . The buyer observes both the day and night price of the sellers with
whom he is contact. The buyer is able to shop from these sellers during both day and
night with probability 1 −   . With probability   ∈ (0 1), the buyer is able to shop only
during the day. Similarly, a buyer of type  is in contact with one seller with probability
 , and with multiple (two) sellers with probability 1 −  . A buyer of type  is able to
shop from the contacted sellers during both day and night with probability 1 −   , and
only during the day with probability   . Both types of buyers enjoy a utility of  −  if
they purchase the good at the price , and a utility of zero if they do not purchase the
good. Without loss in generality, we assume that buyers of type  are in contact with
fewer sellers than buyers of type , i.e.  ≥  .

   The definition of equilibrium for this model is standard (see, e.g., Burdett and Judd
1983 or Head et alii 2012).
Definition 1: An equilibrium is a price distribution  such that the seller’s profit is
maximized everywhere on the support of .

   A couple of comments about the environment are in order. First, we assume that some
buyers are in contact with one seller and others are in contact with multiple sellers. We
think of the contacts as the network of sellers that the buyer can easily access (e.g., the
sellers on the way between the buyer’s home and his workplace, the sellers that are close
to his children’s preschool, etc. . . ), rather than the set of sellers whose price is known to
the buyer. In this sense, we think of our model as a version of Hotelling (1929) where the
buyer’s transportation cost to diﬀerent sellers is either zero or infinity, rather than as a
model in which buyers discover sellers through a search process. Yet, just as in the search

                                              5
models of Butters (1977) and Burdett and Judd (1983), the fraction of buyers in contact
with multiple sellers is the parameter that controls the degree of competitiveness of the
product market.

        Second, we assume that some buyers can shop only during the day, while others can
shop both during the day and during the night. We do not think of day and night literally.
Instead, we interpret the day as the time when all buyers are able to shop and the night
as the time when only a subset of buyers is able to shop. For instance, the day might be
the time when both employed and non-employed people can shop (i.e., after 5 PM), and
the night might be the time when only the non-employed people can shop (i.e., before 5
PM). Alternatively, the night might be one particular day of the week, when only people
with a flexible schedule can shop, and the day might be any other day of the week, when
people with prior commitments can shop. As in Conslik, Gerstner and Sobel (1984) or
Albrecht, Postel-Vinay and Vroman (2013), the fact that some buyers are flexible with
respect to their shopping time and others are not gives sellers the opportunity to price
discriminate.4



3         Characterization of equilibrium
In this section, we show that the equilibrium of our model exists and is unique, and we
find necessary and suﬃcient conditions under which the equilibrium features both price
dispersion across sellers and within sellers. Solving for the equilibrium of our model is
not as simple as in Burdett and Judd (1983). In Burdett and Judd, every seller posts one
price and must attain the same profit everywhere on the support of the price distribution.
It is easy to prove that the support of the price distribution must be some connected
interval [   ] with  = . In light of this property, solving for the equilibrium amounts
to solving one equation (i.e., the seller’s equal profit condition on the support of the
price distribution) for one unknown (i.e., the price distribution). In our model, every
seller posts two prices and must attain the same profit everywhere on the support of
the price distribution. Again, it is easy to show that both the support of the marginal
distribution of day and night prices must be a connected interval. However, this property
of the marginals is not enough to identify the support of the joint distribution. Hence, we
    4
    It is easy to generalize the model to allow for some buyers to be able to shop only during the day,
some only during the night, and others at both times. The analysis would be nearly identical, but the
algebra would become more involved.


                                                  6
cannot solve for the equilibrium by simply solving the equal profit condition with respect
to the distribution.

       We develop an alternative solution technique. In Subsection 3.1, we show that we can
restrict attention to equilibria in which every seller chooses a price for the good in the
night that is non-greater than the price for the good in the day. In Subsection 3.2, we
look for an equilibrium in which the seller’s profit from day sales is constant everywhere
on the support of the marginal distribution of day prices, and the seller’s profit from night
sales is constant everywhere on the support of the marginal distribution of night prices.
We show that–if and only if the type of buyers who is in contact with fewer sellers is
also less likely to be able to shop at night–this equilibrium exists and it features price
dispersion both across and within sellers. In Subsection 3.3, we consider an equilibrium
in which every seller posts the same price in the day and at night. We show that–if and
only if the type of buyers who is in contact with fewer sellers is also more likely to be
able to shop at night–this equilibrium exists and it features price dispersion across sellers
but not within sellers. Finally, in Subsection 3.4, we rule out the existence of any other
type of equilibrium by showing that the seller’s profit from a nighttime trade must be
either constant with respect to the night price (in which case the first type of equilibrium
emerges), or strictly increasing with respect to the night price (in which case the second
type of equilibrium emerges). The solution techniques developed here are likely to be
applicable to other versions of Burdett and Judd where sellers post multiple prices.5


3.1       A general property of equilibrium
As a preliminary step, we show that we can restrict attention to equilibria in which sellers
post prices (   ) such that  ≤  . This is the case because–by assumption–all of
the buyers who can shop at night can also shop during the day and, hence, a seller posting
a higher price during the night as during the day enjoys the same profit and exerts the
same competition on other seller as if he were to post the same price at both times of day.

       To formalize the above argument, consider an equilibrium in which the marginal price
   5
     Indeed, the results in Subsection 3.4 are used by Kaplan et al. (2015) in the context of a model
of multiproduct retailing. Lester et al. (2015) develop similar arguments to solve for the equilibrium
distribution of multiple screening contracts in the context of a model of the asset market. In contrast, these
techniques are very diﬀerent from those used to solve for the equilibrium in the models of multiproduct
retailing of Zhou (2013) and Rhodes (2015). In fact, in these models, the seller’s optimal pricing strategy
is generically unique and there is no need to solve for the equilibrium price distribution.


                                                      7
distributions are continuous functions6  ,  and  . A seller who posts prices (   ) ∈
[0 ]2 enjoys a profit

                   (   ) = [1 + 2 (1 −  ( ))] 
                                                                                                (1)
                              + [1 + 2 (1 −  (min{   }))] min{   },

where the constants 1 and 1 are defined as

                               1 =     +     
                                                                                                (2)
                               1 =   (1 −   ) +   (1 −   )

and the constants 2 and 2 are defined as

                       2 = 2 (1 −  )  + 2 (1 −  )  
                                                                                                (3)
                       2 = 2 (1 −  )(1 −   ) + 2 (1 −  )(1 −   )

Let us briefly explain (1). The seller meets 1 buyers who are not in contact with any
other seller and who can only shop during the day. Each one of these buyers will purchase
the good from the seller at the price  . The seller meets 1 buyers who are not in contact
with any other seller and who can shop both in the day and at night. Each one of these
buyers will purchase the good from the seller at the price min{   }. The seller meets
2 buyers who are in contact with a second seller and who can only shop during the day.
Each one of these buyers will purchase the good from the seller if  is lower than the day
price posted by the second seller they contacted, an event that occurs with probability
1 −  ( ). Finally, the seller meets 2 buyers who are in contact with a second seller
and can shop both during the day and at night. Each one of these buyers will purchase
the good from the seller if min{   } is lower than the lowest price posted by the second
seller they meet, an event that occurs with probability 1 −  (min{   }).

      A seller posting the prices (   ) ∈ [0 ]2 with    enjoys a profit

                             (   ) = [1 + 2 (1 −  ( ))] 
                                                                                                (4)
                                          + [1 + 2 (1 −  ( ))]  

Notice that the seller’s profit does not depend on the night price. Indeed, if    ,
the seller never makes a sale at night. The customers who can only shop during the day
will purchase at the price  . The customers who can shop at both times will choose to
  6
    The assumption that the distribution functions  ,  and  are continuous is for the sake of
exposition only. It is straightforward to generalize Lemma 1 to the case in which these distribution
functions have mass points.


                                                   8
purchase during the day at the price  . Therefore, the seller enjoys the same profit if he
were to post the prices (   ) rather than (   ).

   Now, suppose that there is an equilibrium  in which some sellers post (   ) with
   . Consider an alternative price distribution ̂ in which the sellers posting (   )
with    change their prices to (   ), while the sellers posting (   ) with  ≤
 keep their prices unchanged. Clearly, the marginal price distributions ̂ and ̂
associated with ̂ are the same as the marginal price distributions  and  associated
with . Since the prices (   ) with  ≤  maximize the profit of the seller given ,
they also maximize the profit of the seller given ̂, as the profit function (1) only depends
on the marginals  and  . Moreover, since the prices (   ) with    maximize
the profit of the seller given , the prices (   ) maximize the profit of the seller given
̂, as the seller’s profit function (1) only depends on the marginals  and  and, as
shown in (4), the seller is indiﬀerent between posting (   ) and (   ). Thus, the joint
price distribution ̂ is an equilibrium and it is–along all relevant dimensions–equivalent
to the equilibrium joint price distribution 

   We have therefore established the following Lemma.
Lemma 1: Without loss in generality, one can restrict attention to equilibria  in which
every seller posts a price(   ) ∈ [0 ]2 with  ≤  , and the marginal distribution of
lowest prices,  , is equal to the marginal distribution of night prices,  .


3.2     Equilibrium with price dispersion across and within stores
In this section, we look for an equilibrium  in which every seller posts prices (   ) ∈
[0 ]2 with  ≤  and such that the marginal distribution of day prices,  , and the
marginal distribution of night prices,  , are respectively given by
                                            1  − 

As we shall see momentarily,  is the distribution that makes the seller’s profit from day
trades constant for all day prices  ∈ [   ], and  is the distribution that makes the
seller’s profit from night trades constant for all night prices  ∈ [   ].

    Given the marginal price distributions  and  in (5) and (6), we can identify the
region where the profit of the seller attains its maximum. In general, a seller posting
prices (   ) ∈ [0 ]2 with  ≤  attains a profit of

                             (   ) = [1 + 2 (1 −  ( ))] 
                                                                                                 (8)
                                         + [1 + 2 (1 −  ( ))]  .

The first line in (8) denotes the seller’s profit from day trades and the second line in (8)
denotes the seller’s profit from night trades. If the seller post prices (  ) such that
 ∈ [   ],  ∈ [   ] and  ≤  , his profit is given by

                                      (   ) = [1 + 1 ]                               (9)

where (9) follows from (8) and from the expressions for the marginal price distributions
 and  in (5) and (6). Notice that (9) is a constant. Indeed, the seller’s profit from day
trades attains the same value for all prices  on the support of the marginal distribution
 , and the profit from night trades attains the same value for all prices  on the support
of the marginal price distribution  . Moreover, the overall profit is equal to the profit
that the seller would attain if he were to charge the buyer’s reservation price  at both
times and sell only to those buyers who are not in contact with any other seller.

    If the seller post prices (  ) such that  ∈ [   ],  ∈ [0  ) and  ≤  , his
profit is given by
                                (   ) = 1  + (1 + 2 )
                                                                                                (10)
                                             [1 + 1 ] 
where the first line on the right-hand side of (10) follows from (8) and the fact that
 ( ) = 0 for all  ≤  , and the second line on the right-hand side of (10) follows from
   and  = 1 (1 + 2 ). Therefore, for any (   ) such that  ∈ [   ],
 ∈ [0  ) and  ≤  , the profit of the seller is lower than in (9). This result is
intuitive as lowering the price  below  reduces the profit per sale without increasing
the probability of making a sale to a night shopper. Similarly, for any (   ) such
that  ∈ [0  ),  ∈ [0  ] and  ≤  , the profit of the seller is lower than in
(9), as lowering the price  below  reduces the profit per sale without increasing the
probability of making a sale to a day shopper. Finally, as established in section 3.1, the

                                                  10
seller is indiﬀerent between posting the prices (   ) with    and the prices (   ).

   Taken together, the above observations imply that the seller’s profit attains its max-
imum for all prices (   ) such that  ∈ [   ],  ∈ [   ] and  ≤  , and it
attains strictly less than the maximum for all other prices such that  ≤  . The profit
maximization region is the shaded area in Figure 1. In light of this finding, it follows
that an equilibrium such that all sellers post a night price lower than the day price and
where the marginal price distributions  and  are given as in (5) and (6) exists if and
only if we can find a joint price distribution  such that: (a) the support of  lies in the
region of prices (   ) with  ∈ [   ],  ∈ [   ] and  ≤  (i.e., the support
of  lies in the profit maximizing region), (b) the joint price distribution  generates the
marginals  and  .




   Clearly, a necessary condition for the existence of the desired equilibrium is that
the marginal distribution of day prices first-order stochastically dominates the marginal
distribution of night prices, i.e.  () ≤  () for all  ∈ [0 ]. From (5) and (6), it
follows that  () ≤  () is equivalent to 1 2 ≥ 1 2 . Moreover, the condition

                                                11
 () ≤  () or, equivalently, 1 2 ≥ 1 2 is also suﬃcient for the existence of the
desired equilibrium. To see why this is the case, suppose that the distribution of sellers
over night prices is the  in (6) and a seller with a night price of  posts the day price
( ), where
                                 ∙        µ             ¶        ¸−1
                                             1 1                  1
                        ( ) = 1  +          −                                    (11)
                                 2          2 2                  2
Given that sellers post (( )  ), it is immediate to verify that the marginal distribution
of day prices is the  in (5). Moreover, if 1 2 ≥ 1 2 , it is easy to verify that the
support of the joint price distribution  lies in the region  ∈ [  ],  ∈ [  ], and
 ≤  . The support of the joint price distribution  is represented by the gray curve in
Figure 1.

   Overall, the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of the desired equilib-
rium is
                                          1  
                                              ≥ 1                                        (12)
                                          2  2
In words, the necessary and suﬃcient condition (12) states that the ratio of captive
buyers–i.e. buyers who are in contact with a particular seller and nobody else–to non-
captive buyers–i.e. buyers who are in contact with a particular seller and a second
one–must be greater in the day than at night.

   In what follows, we vary the parameters of the model (         ) and verify
whether condition (12) is satisfied.

Case 1: Buyers of type  are in contact with fewer sellers than buyers of type  and
are less likely to shop at night, i.e.    and      . Using (2)-(3) and (5)-(6),
it is straightforward to verify that    and      imply 1 2  1 2 and
   . Since condition (12) is satisfied, there exists a joint price distribution  whose
support lies on the required region and that generates the marginals  and  in (5)
and (6). Moreover, since    , any such joint price distribution  must be such that
a positive measure of sellers posts a strictly lower price at night than during the day.
Hence, the equilibrium features price dispersion both across stores and within stores, in
the sense that a positive measure of sellers posts diﬀerent prices at diﬀerent times. Price
dispersion across stores emerges because the equilibrium price distribution makes sellers
indiﬀerent between posting a high price, enjoying a high profit margin and selling a small
quantity of the good and posting a low price, enjoying a low profit margin and selling a
large quantity of the good. Price dispersion within stores emerges because, when   

                                               12
and      , sellers have the incentive and the opportunity to price discriminate between
diﬀerent types of buyers. Indeed, since the two types of buyers diﬀer in their likelihood
to shop at night, sellers face a diﬀerent composition of buyers in the two times of the day.
Moreover, since the type of buyer who is more likely to shop at night is also the type of
buyer who is in contact with more sellers, sellers face more competition at night. As a
result, sellers find it optimal to post lower prices–in the sense of first-order stochastic
dominance–at night than during the day.

Case 2: Buyers of type  are in contact with fewer sellers than buyers of type  and they
are more likely to shop at night, i.e.    and      . Using (2)-(3) and (5)-(6), one
can verify that    and      imply 1 2  1 2 . Since condition (12) is
violated, there exists no joint price distribution  whose support is on the required region
and that generates the marginals  and  in (5) and (6). Let us explain this result.
Since the two types of buyers diﬀer with respect to their ability to shop at night, sellers
face a diﬀerent composition of buyers in the two times of the day. Moreover, since the
type of buyer who is more likely to shop at night is in contact with fewer sellers, sellers
face less competition at night. Hence, sellers would like to post higher prices at night than
during the day but this is not compatible with equilibrium, as it would induce buyers who
can shop at night to purchase during the day.

   In between cases 1 and 2, there are two knife-edge cases.

Case 3: Buyers of type  are in contact with fewer sellers than buyers of type , but
are equally likely to shop at night, i.e.  ≥  and   =   . Using (2) and (3), it is
straightforward to verify that  ≥  and   =   imply that 1 2 = 1 2 . In
turn, using (5) and (6), it is immediate to verify that 1 2 = 1 2 implies  =  .
Since 1 2 = 1 2 , we know that there exists a joint price distribution  whose
support lies in the required region and that generates the marginals  and  . Moreover,
since  =  and all sellers must post a nighttime price non-smaller than their daytime
price, the only equilibrium  is the one where every seller posts the same price at both
times of day. Hence, while the equilibrium features price dispersion across sellers, it does
not feature price dispersion within sellers. This result is intuitive. Since the two types
of buyers are equally likely to shop at night, sellers faces the same composition of buyers
and, hence, the same amount of competition in the two subperiods. For this reason, the
equilibrium marginal price distribution is the same in the two times of day. And, since
sellers post a lower price at night than during the day, this implies that every individual

                                             13
seller must always post the same price.

Case 4: Buyers of type  are in contact with the same number of sellers as buyers of
type , but they are less likely to shop at night, i.e.  =  and      . Again, it
is straightforward to verify that  =  and      imply 1 2 = 1 2 and
 =  which, in turn, implies that every seller posts the same price during the daytime
and the nighttime. This result is also intuitive. Since the two types of buyers diﬀer with
respect to their ability to shop at night, a seller faces a diﬀerent composition of buyers
in the two subperiods. However, since the two types of buyers are in contact with the
same number of sellers, this diﬀerence in composition does not translate into a diﬀerence
in competition. As a result, the equilibrium marginal price distribution during the day
is the same as during the night, and every individual seller must always post the same
price.

       The above analysis is summarized in Proposition 1.

Proposition 1: An equilibrium  in which sellers post prices (   ) ∈ [0 ]2 with
 ≤  and such that the marginal price distributions  and  are as in (5) and (6)
exists if and only if  =  or   ≥   . If    and      , the equilibrium
features price dispersion across and within sellers. If either  =  or   =   , the
equilibrium features price dispersion across sellers, but not within sellers.

       Figure 2 illustrates the type of equilibrium described by Proposition 1 for  =  =
12  = 05,  = 01,   = 09,   = 01 and  = 1. The black dashed line is the
distribution of day prices  . The gray dashed line is the distribution of night prices
 . As explained above, the distribution of day prices first-order stochastically dominates
the distribution of night prices. The black solid line is the overall price distribution,
 ≡ ( +  )2. All of these marginal distributions are uniquely pinned down. In
contrast, the joint price distribution  is not pinned down uniquely. However, for any
choice of  that is consistent with equilibrium, the model must generate both price
dispersion across sellers–in the sense that there are diﬀerences in the average price of
diﬀerent sellers–and within sellers–in the sense that some sellers must post diﬀerent
prices during the day and during the night.7 For a particular choice of  that is consistent
with equilibrium, we can decompose the overall variance of prices into the variance in the
average price of diﬀerent stores (i.e., across store variance) and the variance of the price
   7
    Here we illustrate the distribution of posted prices and decompose the associated variance into across
and within store components. We could do the same for transaction prices.

                                                   14
of each store (i.e., within store variance). For instance, if sellers post prices (( )  ),
we find that the overall standard deviation of prices is 23%, the across store variance is
56% of the overall variance, and the within store variance is 44%. These numbers are very
close to those found by Kaplan and Menzio (2015), which shows that our simple model
has the potential to match some of the key empirical facts about price dispersion.




3.3    Equilibrium without within-store price dispersion
In this section, we look for an equilibrium in which the joint price distribution, , is such
that every seller posts the same price for the good during the day and during the night
and such that the marginal distribution of day and night prices is given by
                                            1 + 1  − 
                     () =  () = 1 −                   , ∀ ∈ [   ],             (13)
                                            2 + 2 
where the boundaries of the support of the distributions are
                                        1 + 1
                            =                              =                       (14)
                                  1 + 1 + 2 + 2
As we shall see momentarily,  =  is the marginal distribution that makes the profit
of a seller posting the same price  in the day and at night constant for all  ∈ [   ].


                                               15
    First, consider a seller posting the prices ( ) with  ∈ [   ]. This seller obtains a
profit of                     ∙                                         ¸
                                                        1 + 1  − 
                     ( ) = 1 + 1 + (2 + 2 )                   
                                                        2 + 2                                 (15)
                              = [1 + 1 ] .
The first line on the right-hand side of (15) follows from (8) and the expression for the
marginal price distributions  and  in (13). The second line on the right-hand side of
(15) follows from algebraic manipulation of the first. Notice that the second line on the
right-hand side of (15) is a constant. That is, the seller attains the same profit by posting
any prices ( ) on the support of the joint distribution . Moreover, this profit is equal
to the profit that the seller would attain if he were to charge the buyer’s reservation price
 both in the day and in the night and sell only to those buyers who are not in contact
with any other seller.

    Second, consider a seller posting prices (   ), with  ∈ [   ],  ∈ [   ] and
 ≤  . This seller obtains a profit of
                                      ∙                          ¸
                                                1 + 1  − 
                        (   ) = 1 + 2                    
                                                2 + 2 
                                      ∙                          ¸                                 (16)
                                                1 + 1  − 
                                    + 1 + 2                     
                                                2 + 2 

Notice that the derivative of the seller’s profit with respect to the night price,  , is
strictly positive if 1 2  1 2 ; it is zero if 1 2 = 1 2 ; and it is negative if
1 2  1 2 . Hence, if the seller posts prices (   ) with  ∈ [   ],  ∈ [   )
and  ≤  , he attains a profit non-greater than (15) if and only if 1 2 ≤ 1 2 .

    Third, consider a seller posting prices (   ), with  ∈ [   ],  ∈ [0  ] and
 ≤  . This seller’s profit is lower than what he could attain by posting the prices
(   ), as lowering the price  below  reduces the profit per sale without increasing
the probability of making a sale to a night shopper. Similarly, for any (   ) such that
 ∈ [0  ),  ∈ [0  ] and  ≤  , the seller’s profit is lower than what he could attain
by posting the prices (   ), as lowering the price  below  reduces the profit per
sale without the probability of making a sale to a day shopper. Finally, as established in
section 3.1, the seller is indiﬀerent between posting the prices (   ) with    and
the prices (   ).

    From the above observations, it follows that the seller’s profit is maximized everywhere

                                                  16
on the support of the joint price distribution  if and only if
                                         1  
                                             ≤ 1                                      (17)
                                         2  2

In words, the necessary and suﬃcient condition (17) states that the ratio of captive buyers
to non-captive buyers must be greater at night than during the day. Notice that condi-
tion (17) is the opposite as condition (12) and, hence, for any values of the parameters,
there exists either the type of equilibrium studied in Subsection 3.2 or the type of equilib-
rium studied in this subsection. Moreover, the two types of equilibria coexist only when
1 2 = 1 2 , which is a knife-edge configuration of parameters.

   In particular, we have the following cases.

Case 1: Buyers of type  are in contact with fewer sellers than buyers of type  and are
less likely to shop at night, i.e.    and      . When    and      ,
condition (17) is violated and, hence, there is no equilibrium in which all sellers post the
same price at both times of day, and the marginal price distributions  and  are given
by (13). Intuitively, when    and      , sellers face more competition at night
than during the day. For this reason, sellers have an incentive to post lower prices–in
the sense of first-order stochastic dominance–at night than during the day.

Case 2: Buyers of type  are in contact with fewer sellers than buyers of type  and they
are more likely to shop at night, i.e.    and      . When    and      ,
condition (17) is satisfied and, hence, there exists an equilibrium in which all sellers post
the same price at both times of day, and the marginal price distributions  and  are
given by (13). In this equilibrium, there is price dispersion across stores–in the sense that
diﬀerent sellers post diﬀerent prices–but no price dispersion within stores–in the sense
that every seller posts the same price in the two subperiods. Intuitively, when   
and      , sellers face more competition during the day than at night. For this reason,
sellers want to post a night price as high as possible. However, sellers cannot post a night
price higher than the day price or, else, buyers who can shop at night will purchase the
good during the day. As a result, sellers post a night price equal to the day price.

   In between cases 1 and 2, there are two knife-edge cases. In these cases, the type of
equilibrium that we considered in Subsection 3.2 and the type of equilibrium that we are
considering here coexist and coincide.

Case 3: Buyers of type  are in contact with fewer sellers than buyers of type , but are

                                             17
equally likely to shop at night, i.e.  ≥  and   =   . In this case, condition (17) holds
with equality. Therefore, there exists an equilibrium in which sellers post the same price
during the day and during the night, and the marginal price distributions  and  are
given as in (13). Intuitively, when  ≥  and   =   , sellers face the same composition
of buyers during the day and during the night and, hence, they have no incentive to vary
their price over time. Notice that, when  ≥  and   =   , condition (12) holds as well
and, hence, there exists also an equilibrium in which the marginal price distributions 
and  are given as in (5) and (6). However, as discussed in the previous subsection, this
equilibrium is also such that sellers post the same price in the two subperiods. Moreover,
it is immediate to see that the marginal price distributions  and  in (5) and (6) are
the same as in (13). Hence, the two types of equilibria coexist and are identical.

Case 4: Buyers of type  are in contact with the same number of sellers as buyers of
type , but they are less likely to shop at night, i.e.  =  and   ≥   . In this
case, condition (17) holds with equality. Therefore, there exists an equilibrium in which
sellers post the same price during the day and during the night, and the marginal price
distributions  and  are given as in (13). Intuitively, when  =  and   ≥   ,
sellers face a diﬀerent composition of buyers during the day and during the night but this
diﬀerence in composition does not translate into a diﬀerence in competition because both
types of buyers are in contact with the same number of sellers. For this reason, sellers
have no incentive to vary their price over time. Notice that, also when  =  and
  ≥   , this equilibrium coexists and coincides with the one studied in Subsection 3.2.

   The above analysis is summarized in Proposition 2.

Proposition 2: An equilibrium  in which all sellers post the same price in the day as
in the night and the marginal price distributions  and  are given as in (13) exists if
and only if  =  or   ≤   .


3.4    Other equilibria
The final step of the analysis is to rule out the existence of any type of equilibrium diﬀerent
from those studied in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3. To this aim, consider an equilibrium
distribution of sellers over prices, (   ). Let  ( ) denote the marginal distribution
of sellers over day prices and as  ( ) the measure of sellers who post a day price of  ,
i.e. the mass point associated with the price  . Similarly, let  ( ) denote the marginal


                                              18
distribution of sellers over night prices and as  ( ) the measure of sellers who post a
night price of  . In light of Lemma 1, we can restrict attention to equilibria in which
all sellers post a price  ≤  and, consequently, such that the marginal distribution of
sellers over their lowest price,  , is equal to  .

   In equilibrium, a seller posting prices (   ) with  ≤  attains a profit of

                                  (   ) =  ( ) +  ( )                         (18)

where  and  are respectively defined as
                            ∙          µ                      ¶¸

                   ( ) = 1 + 2 1 −  ( ) +  ( )                            (19)
                                                     2

and                           ∙         µ                       ¶¸

                                                       2
In words,  ( ) denotes the seller’s profit from trades that take place during the day.
In fact, during the day, the seller meets 1 captive buyers and 2 non-captive buyers.
A captive buyer purchases the good from the seller with probability one. A non-captive
buyer purchases the good from the seller with probability one if he is in contact with a
second seller whose price is strictly greater than  , an event that occurs with probability
1 −  ( ), or with probability 12 if he is contact with a second seller whose price is
equal to  , an event that occurs with probability  ( ). Similarly,  ( ) denotes the
seller’s profit from trades that take place during the night.

   Every price pair (   ) on the support of the distribution  must maximize the
profit  (   ) of the seller. We use this property to establish several features of the
equilibrium.
Claim 1: The marginal price distributions  and  have no mass points.
Proof : We begin by proving that  has no mass points. On the way to a contradiction,
suppose that there exists an equilibrium  in which  has a mass point at ∗ . Consider
a seller posting the prices (∗   ) with   ∗ . From (18), it follows that this seller can
attain a strictly higher profit by posting the prices (∗ −   ) for some   0 suﬃciently
small. Hence, no prices (∗   ) with   ∗ can be on the support of . Next, consider
a seller posting prices (∗  ∗ ). From (18), it follows that this seller can attain a strictly
higher profit by choosing the prices (∗ − ∗ −) for some   0 suﬃciently small. Hence,
the prices (∗  ∗ ) cannot be on the support of . Finally, since  is such that every seller

                                                 19
posts a price  smaller than  , no prices (∗   ) with   ∗ can be on the support
of . We have thus reached a contradiction. The proof that  has no mass points is
analogous       ¥

Claim 2: The marginal price distribution  has no gaps and  = .

Proof : We first establish that  has no gaps. On the way to a contradiction, suppose
that  has a gap between 0 and 1 with 1  0 . Since  (1 ) =  (0 ), a seller posting
prices (0   ) with  ≤ 0 can attain a strictly higher profit by choosing the prices
(1   ) instead. Hence, the prices (0   ) with  ≤ 0 cannot be on the support of .
Similarly, since  is such that every seller posts a price  smaller than  , no prices
(0   ) with   0 can be on the support of . We have thus reached a contradiction.
The proof that  =  is analogous. ¥

Claim 3: Let  be the lower bound of the support of the marginal price distribution  .
The profit function  ( ) is weakly increasing in  over the interval [  ].

Proof : On the way to a contradiction, suppose  ( ) is strictly decreasing over the
interval (0  1 ), with  ≤ 0  1 ≤ . If this is the case,  ( )   (0 ) for all
 ∈ (0  2 ) where 2  1 . Any seller with a day price  ≥ 2 , will choose a night
price  such that  ≤  and  ∈
                                   (0  2 ). Any seller with a day price  ∈ (0  2 ),
will choose a night price  ≤ 0 . And any seller with a day price  ≤ 0 , will choose
a night price smaller than  . Therefore, the marginal price distribution  has a gap
between 0 and 2 , i.e.  ( ) =  (0 ) for all  ∈ (0  2 ). From (20), it follows that, if
 is constant over the interval (0  2 ), then  () is strictly increasing over the interval
(0  2 ) which contradicts the assumption that  () is strictly decreasing over the interval
(0  1 ). ¥

Claim 4: The function  ( ) is either strictly increasing for all  ∈ [  ], or it is
constant for all  ∈ [  ].

Proof : Suppose  ( ) is strictly increasing over some region (0  1 ), where  ≤ 0 
1 ≤ . This implies that a seller posting a day price  ≥ 1 chooses a night price
 ≥ 1 . A seller posting a day price  ∈ (0  1 ) chooses a night price  =  . And
a seller posting a day price  ≤ 0 must post a night price  ≤ 0 . Therefore, for all
 ∈ (0  1 ), the fraction of sellers with a night price smaller than  is equal to the fraction
of sellers with a day price smaller than , i.e.  () =  () for all  ∈ (0  1 ). Using



                                                20
this fact and  ( ) =  (1  1 ) for all  ∈ (0  1 ), we obtain

                           1 + 1 + (2 + 2 )(1 −  (1 )) 1 − 
      () =  (1 ) −                                                 , ∀ ∈ (0  1 )   (21)
                                        2 + 2                    

Given the expression for  in (21), we can compute the derivative of the function  ( ),
which is given by
                                                   1 + 1
                           0 ( ) = 1 − 2             , ∀ ∈ (0  1 )               (22)
                                                   2 + 2
The derivative is strictly positive if and only if 1 2  1 2 . Thus, if 1 2 ≤
1 2 , the function  ( ) cannot be strictly increasing over the region (0  1 ) and, in
light of Claim 3, it must be constant for all  ∈ [  ].

Conversely, suppose  ( ) is constant over some region (0  1 ) with 0 ≥  . In this
case, we can prove that 1 2 ≤ 1 2 . Thus, if 1 2  1 2 , the function
 ( ) cannot be constant over some region (0  1 ) and, in light of Claim 3, it must be
strictly increasing for all  ∈ [  ]. ¥

   Now, suppose that the equilibrium is such that  ( ) is constant over the interval
[  ]. In this case, it is straightforward to verify that the marginal distribution of night
prices,  , is given as in (5). Moreover, since  ( ) is constant, the function  ( ) must
also be constant over the interval [  ]. It is also straightforward to verify that this
implies that the marginal distribution of day prices,   is given as in (6). Thus, the only
equilibrium with a constant  ( ) is the one characterized in Subsection 3.2.

   Next, suppose that the equilibrium is such that the function  ( ) is strictly increasing
over the interval [  ]. In this case, every seller posts the same price in the day as in the
night and the marginal price distributions  and  are identical. In turn, this implies
that the marginal price distributions  and  are given as in (13). Thus, the only
equilibrium with a strictly increasing  ( ) is the one characterized in Subsection 3.3.

   Thus, we have established the following result.

Proposition 3: Any equilibrium  is such that either: (i) the marginal price distributions
 and  are given as in (6) and (7); or (ii) the marginal price distributions  and 
are given as in (13).

4    Conclusions
We developed a search-theoretic framework that generates equilibrium price dispersion
across sellers and within sellers. Price dispersion across sellers obtains because of the
buyers are heterogeneous in their ability to shop at diﬀerent stores. Price dispersion
within sellers obtains when the buyers who are better at shopping at diﬀerent stores
are also better at shopping at less diﬀerent times and, hence, sellers can discriminate
between diﬀerent types of buyers by varying their price over time. Our model is richer
than standard models of intertemporal price discrimination and standard models of price
dispersion. Naturally, it would be interesting to estimate our model using the econometric
techniques developed by Hong and Shum (2006) and Moraga-Gonzales and Wildenbeest
(2009). Also, it would be useful to intergrate our model with the multiproduct model
of Kaplan et al. (2015) to build a unified framework for studying pricing in the retail
market.
