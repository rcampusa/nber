    This paper evaluates the cases for and against plant closing

legislation. In spite of the growth of legislative efforts in the area,

there has been surprisingly little effort devoted to analyzing what the

effects are of existing plant closing legislation,        of provisions in


privately negotiated collective bargaining agreements that provide for

advance notice in case of plant shutdowns and/or layoffs, and of voluntary

employer provision of advance notice.     The paper summarizes the results of

previous research,    and our own empirical   analyses that used the January

1984 Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Displaced Workers, on the

effects of advance notice on displaced workers' durations of nonemployment

and post-displacement earnings. Based upon these findings,         implications

for public policy are drawn.

 for displaced workers and sane, for example Sweden, have detailed programs

 of labor market services (retraining, placement, public works, wage

 subsidies) to facilitate adjustments. In Canada, both federal and
                                                                   In many of these

 not have a substantial        effect on a crinuaity.

         Plant closing legislation in the United States is much more modest.

 As of early 1988, there is no federal         law and only a few state laws.


 Three states, Maine, Wisconsin and Hawaii, require advance notice of plant

 shutdowns or large scale layoffs (with size class exemptions), and Maine

  also requires one week's severance pay per year of service for workers

 with greater than three years' tenure.          The penalties for noncompliance

  are low   in   Maine (3500 per establishment) and Wisconsin ($50 per

  employee), but high     in   Hawaii   (three months wages and benefits per laid

  off worker).      Connecticut does not require advance notice, but does
                                                                   benefits
  require nonbankrupt firms to maintain health insurance and other

  for workers unemployed by plant shutdowns for up to 120 days.

  firms are urged to provide advance notice and/or continue benefits.

     Interest in plant closing legislation in the United States has       grn
since the deep recession of the mid-1970s and the relatively large number

of plant closIngs and permanent layoffs in major manufacturing industries

since then, undoubtedly stimulated this interes  L    During the 1975—83

period over 125 bills reiating to plant closings were Introduced In 30

states; the majority in the northeast and mlthest, gore than 90 percent

of these bills had provisions requiring advance notice of shutdowns while

substantially moalier percentagesrequired severance pay or econanic

assistance to either workers, employers, local governments, or-potential

buyers

     At the federal level, over 40 bills have been introduced into

Congress since 1979     In April of 1988. Congress voted to include an

arnenthent In the annibus trade bill that would have required employers of

100 or more workers to give 60 days advance notice to workers and local

government officials of a plant closings or a layoff that was planned to

last at least six months that involved at least 500 workers or one—third

of the employer's workforce, Numerous exemptions were included In this

bill that was vetoed by President Reagan.

     Proponents of advance notice legislation argue that advance notice

provisions will ease displaced workers' shock and facilitate their search

for alternative sources of employment or training.     Such notice also

the jobs, such as wage concessions, tax concessions, or seeking new

     Opponents of the legislation argue that, In addition to restricting

the free mobility of capital, advance notice legislation would have a

number of other adverse effects on firms.      They claim It would increase

worker turnover and decrease productivity, as those productive workers

with the best opportunitLes elsewhere would leave and the morale of

remaining workers would suffer.     It   also would decrease the likelihood

that buyers of the plant's prodGt would place new orders, that banks

would supply new credit, that suppliers would continue to provide

services, and that the firm could sell the plant to potential buyers,

Finally, it would depress corporate stock prices.      Such a provision, as

well as others that directly increase the costs of plant shutdowns,

effectively increase the cost of reducing employment and thus should

encourage firms   , to   expand operation or to substitute overtime hours

for additional employment in states where such laws are in effect.

     In evaluating the case for advance notice legislation, it      s   useful

to stress the divergence between private and social costs.       nployers

currently do not bear the full social costs of plant shutdowns, both

because unemployment insurance is imperfectly experience rated and because

the costs these actions impose on cc*mnunitles are not taken Into account

by them.   As such, imposing a   'tax'   on plant closings, or large scale

layoffs, either in the form of advance notice provisions, severance pay

requirements, or maintenance of benefits requirements would offset the
                                                                        3
difference between the social and private costa of plant closings.          These

efficiency considerations suggest the need for federal, rather than state-by-

state rules, to reduce the possibility that locational decisions by firms would
                                              4

    be Influenced by   tax   price' differences. Critics, however, would stress

    that such legIslation might encourage the flight of jobs overseas.

          In spite of the growth of legislative efforts, there has been

    surprisingly little effort devoted to analyzIng what the effects are of

    existing plant closing legIslation, of provisions in privately negotiated

    collective bargaining agreements that provide for advance notice in case

    of plant shutdowns and/or layoffs, and of voluntary employer provision of

    II,
          Lazear (1987) used annual aggregate data for twentythree countries

    over a 29 year period (1956 to 1984) to estimate what the affects of

    iegaiiy mandated severance pay and advance notice provisions for     biue

    collar workers were on the aggregate employment/populationratio,

    unemployment rate, and average weekly hours In manufacturing. Simple

    fixed-effects models (to control for countrrspeclfic omitted variables)

    were estimated and a snail set of control variables (e.g., a linear time

    trend, cyclical factors, demographic factors) were included In the

    analysis, He found that Instituting an advance notice requirement of 60

    days (2 months), oeterls paribus, would decrease the employment/population

    ratio by about    .003 (the U.S. average was .40 during the period), and

    Increase average weekly hours by about 0.7, although these effects were

    not statistically significantly different frcc zero.       He argued that

    apparently advance notice requirements encourage employers to substitute
                                              5

 additional hours    for   additional   employment;   they act like a quasi—fixed
 cost of expanding employment. One must           caution,   hoever, that In most
 countries    In Lazear's sample,   changes   occurred In these requirements only
 once or twice during the period.        Hence, the effects he attributed to

force in the month of the closing.        The latter reflects either labor force

      Another study, Weber and Taylor (1963), focused on

advance notice rarely led to increased quit         rates    or decreased

productivity of workers. Still a third study, Holen, Jehn, and Trost

         Podrsky   and Swaim (1987a) restrIcted their attention to those

 workers displaced durIng the       1979-'Bi   period,   Using a   sliiy different
 set of control variables than Addison and Pedro (1987a) they found that

 advance notice significantly redaced nonemployment durations
                                                              only for

 determinants of postdisplacement earnings for workers who were

subsequently employed full'-time at the survey date,            They found no effects
of advance notice, suggesting that such policies have, at best,

     Finally,   Addison and Portugal (i987b) found that a 10 percent

about 1 percent,     Since their results in this paper (which focused on laid

off displaced workers, as well as those displaced
                                                  by plant closings) also
indicate   that advance notlce reduced duration of
                                                   unemployment by about 25
percent, one can infer that advance notice increases post—displacement

wages by about 2,5 percent. One must caution, however, that their

estimated duration-wage relationship is conditional on a displaced

worker's having remained in the same industry and occupation and
                                                                 they did

IlL     ir   n    Research

        Our own   research,   to be reported in detail in a         forthcing Upjohn

Institute monograph, reanalyzes the                   data making a number   of
methodological innovations.         First,   in the     absence of formal legislation

requiring advance notice, one can view advance notice as an explicit or

implicit contract provision and ask if workers must pay for this provision

in the form of lower predisplacement wages?               That is, we ask if

ccnpensating wage differentials exist for advance notice provisions?                   If

the answer is yes, it is straightiorward to show that people who                  receive

advance notice will appear, ceteris paribus, to suffer oaller earnings

losses, even if advance notice has no true effect on post—displacement
                                                  -


wages.

        Second, as noted      above, the presence of an advance notice provision

is likely endogenous and depends upon both employers' willingness to

supply and employee demand for such provisions. We attempt to formally

model    the determinants of advance notice, including              the magnitude of the


compensating wage differential, and then test if treating advance notice

as endogenous influences subsequent results.

        Third, previous researchers have not            stressed   that about 10 percent

of the males and over 15 percent of the females in the                    suffered   g
spell    of nonemployment after displacement. We estimate separately what

the effect of advance notice was on the probability of a displaced

worker's finding a job without any spell of nonemployment and what it was

on the duration of nonemployment (conditional on a spell existing). We

also estimate what the effects of advance notice were on survey date

wages.
                                         10

     Fourth, since the   Z   contains data on whether workers who received

advance notice quit prior to displacement, we estlmate the determlnants of

-predisplacement turnover and ascertain If there is any evidence that

turnover among firms' most productive workers occurs         Finally, all of our

analyses are done separately for four groups (male/shutdown,

female/shutdown, male/layoff, female/layoff) to see     if   such policies have

differential affects across groups

     Our results Indicate that there is very little evidence that workers

who receIve advance notice pay for it in the form of lower predisplacement

wages.   They also suggest that   1tis   difficult to explaln which displaced
                                                                          -

workers receive advance nttlce prior to dislacement using data on

characteristics   of the Individuals, data on characteristics of the

workforce in the industries in which they were employed, and data on

employment growth and unemployment in the areas and areas/inoustries in

which they were employed.    While some variables prove significant In

 formal probit models of the probability of receiving advance notice (and

 the equations do have some predictive power),    in the main few consistent


 patterns are observed across the four groups.     These results, together

 with the results of exogeneity tests we performed, suggest that analyses

 of the effects of advance notice provisions that use the

 legitimately treat the existence of advance notice as exogenous.

      Our analyses do suggest that having advance notice does significantly

 Increase the probability that a displaced worker will experience      g spell
 of nonemployment. The largest increase is for males displaced due to a

 shutdown and the major beneficiaries within this group are white—collar

 workers.   In contrast, once an individual experiences any nonemployment,
                                                       11

the presence of advance notice has no effect on the ultimate total

duration of nonemployment,4 Advance notice thus seems to help displaced

workers in the             sample only if the individuals can fInd employment

prior to displacement.5

          Analyses of the effects of advance notice on survey data earnings

echo the flnd1ngs of Podursky and Swaim (1987b) that, on average, receIpt

of advance notice has no affect on subsequent earnings once reempioyed

On1       for wlnte—cuilar females who had been displaced-due to a layoff was

there any       ed€rce     that advance notice ieads to higher survey data weekly

earnings and this group makes up less than 15 percent of the                    SN sample.
The major eftect of advance notice on workers in the                        sample then   s
through decreasig the probabihty of observing positive nonemployment

sp&   I    lengths.

          Finally, for the        peope     in the          samp1e who receive advance notice,

we find no systenatic evioence that observea variables that might be

proxtes for product,v;ty (job tenure, age, education, previous earnings)

systematically are assoc,ated with the probability that a worker will quit

prior to displacement. Thus, we find no evidence that advance notice wili

leao a firm's most productive workers to quit, thereby disrupting a firm's

operations in its final weeks.



IV.

          A number   of studies       suggest   that   there    are large private costs of

displacement to displaced workers but that these costs are of tn transitory

in nature.       While sane fraction of these costs may represent the

dissipation of rents,             a   substantial part represents true social costs
                                       12

 (Hamermesh (1987)). Often these costs are transitory   in   nature ——   witness

 the fact that earnings of displaced workers In the     who were reempioyed

_at the survey date were, on average within 5 percent of their predis

placement earnings.   However, sine costs are iongiasting; many people In

 the     were not reemployed at the survey date.

       Our own research and the literature surveyed above suggests that

 advance notice may well facilitate labor market adjustments by allowing

 displaced workers to find employment prior to their date of displacement.

 Advance notice appears to reduce the probability that displaced workers

 suffer any-spell of nonemployment andthus also may well moderate

 tempcrary increases in area unemployment rates.   In both a number of the


 surveyed studies, and our own, advance notices included notice of very

 short duration and thus their results may understate the effects of

 mandated notice of longer duration.   The individual worker based data used

 in all of the underlying studies also did not permit analyses of whether

 advance notice of pending displacements can lead to actions (e.g.,

 reorganization, wage concessions, employee ownership) that help     avert

 displacements,

       Although opponents of advance notice cite potential costs of such

 poiicies, empirical studies have found no evidence that advance notice

 causes firms' most productive workers to leave and that the productivity

 of the remaining workers suffers.   Moreover, save for Lazear (1987), which

 we have criticIzed above, no systematic empirical evidence has been

 provided on the other potential adverse effects of advance notice that

 opponents have enumerated,
                                            13

     While at first glance, this discussion suggests that federally

mandated advance notice for displaced workers may be an idea whose time

has come,   several   oautions are in order,        First, the effects of voluntary

provision of advance notice      in   situations where workers expect Impending

displacement anyway may be very different from the effects of mandated

advance notice   n    situations where the impending displacement is

canpletely unexpected by workers,6         Indeed,    one should recall that the

,    which our research and most of the research we surveyed was based

upon, asked only if workers received advance notice            a expected   their

displacement.

     Future researchers wilj have access to the January 1988 QLY_g.yj

D2Qlaceok             which   specficaJy asks       displaced workers if they

received formal advance notice and,        if so,    how long the notice was.

However, even with these data, to adequately estimate the effects of

advance notce per se will require researchers to try to model what

dspiaced workers' expectations of displacement would have been in the

absence of advance not,ce.       Put another way, researchers need to estimate

if formal advance notice actually crrnunicates new information to workers.

     Second. the observation that the voluntary provision of advance

notice appears to reduce the probability a displaced worker will suffer

any spell of noneniployment does not necessarily imply that mandated

advance notice will increase employment and decrease unemployment rates.

Indeed, one can conceive of situations in which displaced workers compete

for a fixed number of vacant positions that only           a   fraction of them can

obtain.   Advance notice gives those workers who receive notice an

advantage; it increases their probability of finding one of these Jobs
                                      14

prior to displacement.   Hever,    If the number of vacant positions is


truly fixed, by necessity the probability that workers who failed to

receive notice find Jobs would have to go down,    In this case, the gains

to those workers who received notice would come solely at the expense of

those workers who failed to receive notice.    There would be no social

gains from advance notice In the sense that, on average, it would not

influence aggregate employment levels and/or unemployment rates.

     Studies that use individual—based data sets, such as our own and the

others that used the   5,   can not test for the possibility of such

displacement effects.    The only study of U.S, data that addressed this

issue, Folbre, Leighton and Poderick (1984) did find evidence that

voluntary provision of advance notice led   toaller     temporary increases

in area unemployment rates,    However, Lazear's (1987) cross—ccuntry study

found no significant effects of mandated advance notice on national

employment levels and unemployment rates,     Clearly more studies that focus

on the affects of advance notice on area economic outoomes are needed,

     Suppose for a moment, however, that all voluntarily provided advance

notice actually does is 'reshuffle Jobs among displaced workers from

those people who fail to receive notice to those people who do receive          IL

in fact, evidence of this might QtrsflQthln the case for government

mandated advance notice if the people who reoelve notice voluntarily are

the ones least in need of such assistance.     For example,   ,jj   high wage

unionized workers were more likely to receive notice than comparably

skilled lower wage nonunion workers, implementation of federal         legislation

would allow the latter a thetter shots at competing with the former for

the available Jobs when they are displaced,7     One thus might be in favor
                                        Is
of   advance notice legislation because of its potential redistributlve

affects, even if one believes It will have no net affect on employment or

unemployment.

      Ultimately, given all the evdence presented and cIted above, the

position one takes towards advance notice legislation will depend heavtly

on one's preconceptions as to how labor markets function         if one   belevee

labor markets in the   man   are competitIve and Qperate primarily in an

efficient manner, one m.ght argue that the onus is      o   those who propose

government     ntervention to document empr.caliy what the benefits of the

proposed leg:satior are and to document that its adverse side effects

will be nall.     Given such a vIew, one might argue that the evidence

presented here does not support governtent intervention; there are too

many results whose impLcations are ambiguous and too many yet unanswered

questIons.

      if, on the other hand, one oelieves that labor markets in the main

are not conpetitive and/or that important externalities exist when workers

are displaced, one will find the results presented here very supportive of

some form of intervention, perhaps in the form of advance notice

legislation.    Such individuals may claim that we have documented at least

sane private benefits that advance notice seems to produce, without

uncovering any evidence of its costs,

      It is important when designing an intervention, however, to be clear

about the source of public concern,     if the major concern is the

externality imposed on a local connunity     ae   to a plant closing or large

scale layoff, then public policy should specifically address this concern.

Such a concern may argue for advance notice legislation. However, in this
                                        16


case, exemptions based on absolute size, inoluding current proposals,     do not

address this problem as well as exemptions based on size relative    to the

local labor market.    In contrast, if the source of concern is the private

costs workers suffer from displacement,   then severence pay provisions   may-


be a viable alternative and/or addition to advance notice legislation.

     We conclude from the existing evidence that the social costs of worker
                                                                         to
displacement would be substantially reduced by a federal policy relating

advance notice.    There are several policy options.   The federal government

could reduce the costs to firms of providing such notice by funding a share

of the unemployment benefits received by notified workers and/or by reducing

the firms' income tax rates.

     Another alternative is experimental adoption of federal legislation

that provides for advance notice of plant closings or permanent layoffs.

Well-designed   research during the experimental period could be used to

more adequately address issues relating to the macro labor market effects

of the legislation, including whether advance notice of impending displace-

ment can serve to help prevent displacement from occurring,    as proponents

of the legislation often assert.    Since so much of prior resesrch hss

focused on the potential benefits of advance notice legislation,    studies


during the experimental period might also profitably seriously      research

issues that opponents have been concerned about, relating to the costs of

the legislation.
