                                            ABSTRACT

The purported failure of the classical quantity theory of money in the colonial economy is shown to
be a failure of data and not a failure of theory. When new data on the quantity of specie in circulation
is added to the current data on paper money and prices, and econometrically estimated in both short-
and long-run monetary models, the long-debated anomaly regarding the performance of the classical
quantity theory of money in the colonial economy disappears. How paper money was backed and
could be exchanged for specie was important, but not in the way theorists assert.

   Two Theories of Money Reconciled: The Colonial Puzzle
                                                                        *
                         Revisited with New Evidence

       The purported failure of the classical quantity theory of money in the colonial
       economy is shown to be a failure of data and not a failure of theory. When new
       data on the quantity of specie in circulation is added to the current data on paper
       money and prices, and econometrically estimated in both short- and long-run
       monetary models, the long-debated anomaly regarding the performance of the
       classical quantity theory of money in the colonial economy disappears. How paper
       money was backed and could be exchanged for specie was important, but not in
       the way theorists assert. (JEL N11 E42)

       The colonies of British North America were the first modern Western economies to

experiment with large-scale government issuances of fiat paper money. For colonies south of

Massachusetts, West (1978) found no statistical relationship between the quantity of paper

money and prices. This apparent violation of the classical version of the quantity theory of

money (Fisher 1912, Friedman 1956, Lucas 1980) produced two schools of thought regarding

paper money in colonial America. “Backing” theorists (Calomiris 1988a, 1988b; Smith 1985a,

1985b, 1988; Wicker 1985) argue that the value of paper money depends on how that money was

issued, backed, and withdrawn from circulation. If credibly backed, large changes in the quantity

of paper money would have no effect on prices. Conversely, “quantity” theorists (McCallum

1992; Michener 1987, 1988) note that a colony’s total money supply was composed of both

paper money issued by that colony’s legislature and specie coins acquired and lost through

foreign trade (MT = Mp + Ms, respectively). They also claim that Mp and Ms were perfect

substitutes. Any lack of a statistical relationship between Mp and prices may have been due to

currency substitution between Mp and Ms. If MT were related to prices, the classical quantity

theory of money might still hold. However, because no continuous quantitative data on Ms, and
                                                                                                       2


                                                                                               1
hence MT, exist, the debate between these two schools of thought has remained unresolved.

       In this study, I use new data on Ms per year in Pennsylvania—the first of its kind ever

constructed for colonial America—to test the performance of the quantity theory of money using

MT rather than Mp. These tests show that the classical version of the quantity theory of money

performs well. The data also show that while the “quantity” theorists are correct, it is not via the

mechanism they claim. As such, the monetary experience of colonial America, at least for

Pennsylvania, presents no anomaly to the classical quantity theory of money (Fisher 1912,

Friedman 1956, Lucas 1980). There is a strong long-run relationship between money and prices,

but in the short-run large temporary movements in aggregate output (Y) and velocity (V) are still

possible.

                  RETESTING THE WEST (1978) SHORT-RUN MODEL

       Following the classical assumptions of constant long-run growth in Y and V, West (1978)

estimated the model [ln(PI)i = Constant + b*ln(Mp)i], where PI = the price index. For New York,

Pennsylvania, and South Carolina (the only colonies south of Massachusetts for which price

indices exist), even when adding up to two lagged values of Mp, he found no statistically

significant relationship between PI and Mp. The lack of a statistically significant relationship

between PI and Mp for New York and South Carolina could easily be due to poor-quality price

data and small sample sizes. The data for Pennsylvania, however, are generally regarded to be of

superior quality. As such, the lack of a statistically significant relationship between PI and Mp

for Pennsylvania is the empirical cornerstone for the current puzzle over colonial monetary

performance. West’s results for Pennsylvania are reproduced in Table 1—Section I, Part A. He

(1978, p. 5) concluded, “The Philadelphia regressions are interesting and important. They cover

the whole history of paper money in the colony. From the year paper money was first issued,
                                                                                                      3


1723, until 1775, inflation and the issue of paper money seems to be unrelated. One can place
                                                                                          2
great confidence in these results since the price data for Philadelphia are very good.”

                                       [Place Table 1 Here]

       Using the same model and data, West’s (1978) results for Pennsylvania were replicated

in Table 1—Section I, Part B. While the results differ from those originally reported by West,
                                                                  3
they do not differ enough to necessarily overturn his conclusion. Next, West’s model is re-

estimated using MT in place of Mp, see Table 1—Section II. Slightly different years must be

used because Ms, and hence MT, is only known for 1729 through 1775. This difference does not

affect the results. Compared with the results using only Mp, the relationship between PI and MT

is substantially improved, i.e., substantially higher R2s and statistical significance on the money

coefficients. While these results are not overwhelming, they are still strong given that this model

is a short-run test of a long-run proposition. No one claims that ln(Y) and ln(V) are universal

constants with no short-run cyclical movements, i.e., no one claims that b must equal 1 for the

classical version of the quantity theory of money to hold (Friedman 1956; Lucas 1980, p. 1007).

If West had reported the results using MT in Table 1— Section II, it is likely that the subsequent

debate between the “quantity” and the “backing” theorists over colonial monetary performance

would never have occurred.

             LONG-RUN TESTS OF THE QUANTITY THEORY OF MONEY

       The West (1978) model is an improper test of the classical quantity theory of money

because it is a short-run model (Friedman 1956; Lucas 1980, p. 1007; McCallum 1992, p. 157).

The classical assumptions that per capita ln(Y) and ln(V) are long-run constants implies that

money demand or per capita total real money balances (m = ln[MT/(P*Pop)] where P is the price
                                                                                                      4


level and Pop is population) is stable over the long-run, but not necessarily in the short-run. Per

capita real money balances from 1729 through 1775 for Pennsylvania are displayed in Figure 1.

Using these data, the following regression shows that m has no linear trend. Over the long run,

total real money balances grew at the rate of population.

m(i) = 0.347 + 0.002t(i)       {Regression R2 = 0.002; Total R2 = 0.821; DW = 1.889.
       (0.203) (0.008)         Standard errors are in parentheses. Results are AR2 error
                                                                            4
                               corrected for serial correlation. t = time.}

This result also implies that long-run per capita growth in colonial output equals the long-run

growth in the velocity of circulation, i.e., ln(Y/Pop) = ln(V). Finally, the following Augmented

Dickey-Fuller test shows that m follows a stationary process. Shocks to m experienced mean

reversion—with about a three-year half-life to shocks. This long-run stability in m strongly


[m(i) - m(i-1)] = 0.081 - 0.218 m(i-1) + 0.620 [m(i-1) - m(i-2)]

{R = 0.39; DW = 1.80; Dickey-Fuller F-test = 5.32. Standard errors are in parentheses.}

supports the classical version of the quantity theory of money as applied to the colonial

economy, at least for Pennsylvania.

ASSESSING THE MECHANISMS OF ADJUSTMENT IN THE COLONIAL ECONOMY

A. The “Quantity” Theorists’ Model of the Monetary Adjustment Mechanism

       The “quantity” theorists (McCallum 1992; Michener 1987, 1988) offer a model of the

monetary adjustment mechanism in the colonial economy that assumes that Mp and Ms are

instantaneously perfect substitutes at a perfectly defended and forecastable fixed exchange rate

with zero transactions costs. As long as increases in Mp are not so large that they totally drive

Ms out of the colony, changes in Mp would be perfectly off-set by opposite flows (imports and
                                                                                                    5


exports) of Ms leaving MT unchanged. Thus, even large changes in Mp can be unrelated to PI

because MT per capita remains constant. As such, West (1978) style findings that show no

relationship between PI and Mp support rather than violate the classical quantity theory of

money. Only when increases in Mp have totally driven all Ms out of the colony would further

increases in Mp produce increases in PI. These scholars claim to have saved, at least

theoretically, the classical quantity theory of money from the challenges put forward by the

“backing” theorists and by the West (1978) style findings. However, they have saved it by

rendering it useless as an empirical tool for colony-specific or even regionally-specific monetary

analysis—for in their model only the global money supply matters.

       The institutional setting needed to support the required action in this model, however, is

absent. How the model’s assumed fixed exchange rate between Mp and Ms was defended

remains a mystery (Smith 1988). While colonial governments accepted specie and their own

paper money in payment of the taxes they levied at an established rate, what made this rate,

which could be altered at any time by the legislature, equivalent to a perfectly defended fixed

exchange rate regime is unclear. Colonial legislatures did not and could not engage in monetary

micro-management in the very short-run (certainly not like modern central banks). They never

entered the market to buy and sell their paper money for specie neither to affect nor in reaction to

exchange rate movements. And to assume that such a fixed exchange rate regime was perfectly
                                                                                              6
defended by custom or by a conspiracy of myopic merchant-arbitragers stretches credulity.

       The fixed exchange rate assumption of the quantity theorists is also hard to square with

the available data on exchange rates (McCusker 1978). These data are based on the rates stated

in a large sample of merchant account books between pounds sterling and each colony’s paper

money. It reveals considerable variation in each colony’s rate over time. The monthly data from
                                                                                                          6


1740 through 1775 for Pennsylvania are probably the best in terms of frequency, density, and

quality of observations (McCusker 1978, pp. 185-88). For the 432 months over these 36 years,

data for only 34 months is missing, and the missing observations are widely scattered. These

data reveal that in only 11% of the possible paired comparisons were the exchange rates in a

given month the same as in the subsequent month. And in only 4% of the possible paired

comparisons were the exchange rates in a given month the same as in the same month in the

subsequent year. Clearly, the exchange rate was not fixed. Grubb (2003, p. 1786), however,

shows that despite this volatility, several colonies experienced periods of long-run stability in

their exchange rates in terms of statistically insignificant linear trends and statistical rejection of

non-stationarity. But just as periods of constant prices do not imply price controls, periods of

relative stability in exchange rates do not imply a fixed exchange-rate regime. The long-run

stability of these exchange rates can be easily accounted for by the lack of trend in, and by the

stationary behavior of, per capita real money balances (see the prior section). The quantity

theorists have simply confused exchange-rate stability for exchange-rate fixedness.

        Finally, the predictions of the quantity theorists’ model of the monetary adjustment

mechanism have not, to date, been tested because evidence on the yearly amount of Ms in

circulation has been lacking. These predictions are that Mp and Ms per capita are perfectly

negatively correlated, and that Ms must dwarf Mp, i.e., Ms/Mp > 1, by a substantial margin for

PI to remain unrelated to Mp given the observed large movements in Mp. With the new data

series on Ms for Pennsylvania (Grubb 2004) both these implications can now be tested and,

when tested, they both fail. First, Ms never exceeds Mp in any year in the sample (see the data in

the Appendix—Table A). Second, over time Mp and Ms are far from automatically off setting

(see Figure 1 and the data in the Appendix—Table A). Mp and Ms even co-vary positively
                                                                                                       7


during the Seven Year’s War and after 1772. In fact, for the entire sample, 1729-1775, the

correlation coefficient between per capita cash balances in Mp and in Ms is not negative, but

positive (+0.47). Only for the years 1762-1772 do per capita Mp and Ms come close to behaving

like perfect substitutes, with a correlation coefficient in this period of -0.71. For the years before
                                                                      7
1762 and after 1772 combined, the correlation coefficient is +0.51.

       The problem with the quantity theorists’ model of the monetary adjustment mechanism is

that it constrains the classical version of the quantity theory of money to hold perfectly in the

short-run, something it was never intended to do. As such, the model falls victim to the actual

course of events. The history of the colonial economy reveals frequent, and sometimes massive,

short-run off-trend shocks connected to wars, political trade disruptions, and so forth. For

example, the Seven Year’s War occasioned both a massive increase in Mp by colonial

legislatures and a large inflow of Ms occasioned by British military spending, see Figure 1

above. The colonial response to the British credit crisis of 1772 (legislative increases in Mp), and

to British efforts to impose imperial taxes and close Boston harbor (boycotting the import of

British goods thus reducing the re-export of Ms out of the colonies) had a similar result. It led to

simultaneous increases in Mp and Ms. While the econometric exercises in the prior sections

show that the classical version of quantity theory of money performs well in the colonial

economy, substantial short-run off-trend shocks clearly occurred.

       In conclusion, the currency-substitution claims made by the quantity theorists are too

simplistic to account for the empirical evidence. The same evidence shows both that the classical

quantity theory of money performs well, and that the quantity theorists’ model of the monetary

adjustment mechanism fails. Therefore, the quantity theorists’ model of the monetary adjustment

mechanism is not needed to save the classical quantity theory of money in the colonial economy.

B. The “Backing” Theorists’ Model of the Monetary Adjustment Mechanism

       The “backing” theorists’ (Calomiris 1988a, 1988b; Smith 1985a, 1985b, 1988; Wicker

1985) model of the colonial monetary adjustment mechanism makes V a direct negative function

of Mp. As such, increases in Mp can be perfectly offset by reductions in V, and vice versa, so

that PI remains unrelated to changes in Mp. This assumption contrasts sharply with the classical

quantity theory of money that assumes that V is not a direct function of MT in either the short or

long run. At best, V might be an indirect function of MT, but only in the short-run through MT’s

transitional or cyclical effect on P and interest rates (Cagan 1956, Fisher 1912, Friedman 1956).

Given that the econometric exercises in the prior sections show that the classical quantity theory

of money performs well in the colonial economy, especially in the long-run where ln(V) is

assumed to be a constant, the backing theorists’ model of the monetary adjustment mechanism is

only relevant for explaining off-trend or short-run cyclical movements.

       On some margins the institutional setting needed to support the required action in this

model is present, while on other margins it is not. For example, the institutional setting for the

injection and removal of Mp is consistent with backing theory. Colonial governments issued Mp

in conjunction with specific taxes designed to redeem said Mp at future established dates, or as

loans to subjects who pledged their land as collateral and adhered to specific repayment

schedules (Behrens 1923, Brock 1975, Wicker 1985). Colonists could have forecast whether

these future conditions were likely to be fulfilled. By institutionally linking current monetary

action with future monetary action, and assuming that colonists could fully anticipate both

current and future monetary actions, colonists could engage in inter-temporal shifts in savings

and consumption that would fully undo current monetary action (Barro 1977, Sargent and
                                                                                                        9


Wallace 1981). One avenue of response would be for colonists to increase their cash holdings

(decreasing V) when a colony increased its Mp in anticipation of paying the future taxes and

mortgage payments that were directly tied to that current increase in Mp. Another avenue of

response would be for colonists to increase their cash holdings (decreasing V) when a colony

increased its Mp in anticipation of lower future prices produced by the required future reduction

(redemption) of said Mp. This action would in turn prevent the current increase in Mp from

pushing up current prices. Thus, unlike the 19th and early 20th centuries, the colonial
                                                                                  8
institutional setting may have caused V to be a direct negative function of Mp.

       On the other hand, whether Mp served as a vehicle for inter-temporal shifts in savings

and consumption in the colonial economy is doubtful. For large changes in Mp to be completely

absorbed by changes in V implies large changes in the holding of real cash balances. Because

government bonds and deposit banking do not exit in the colonial economy, this possibility relies

on the personal possession of cash being an important asset or store of value rather than just a

medium of exchange (Laidler 1987, Sargent and Wallace 1981). However, evidence from

probate inventories shows that possession of cash comprised only 2.4% of total net worth (Jones

1980, pp. 128-29). The vast majority of wealth was held as land, and the vast majority of

financial assets were held in non-marketable debt claims. Cash served principally as a medium of

exchange and not as a store of value. The circulation of Mp was so frequent that Pennsylvania’s

legislature had to pass, and often renew, an act authorizing the exchange “torn and ragged” bills

for new bills (Statutes at Large, vol. 4, pp. 203, 414; vol. 5, pp. 48, 60, 192; vol. 7, p. 204). The

prerequisite of substantial personal asset-holdings of cash needed for the backing theory’s

monetary mechanism to work does not appear to have been met by the colonial economy.

       In addition, whether current and future monetary actions could be fully anticipated by
                                                                                                  10


colonists is doubtful. The assumption that colonists could fully anticipate monetary actions is

necessary to eliminate the possibility that money is non-neutral in the short run (Barro 1977). If

money is neutral in the short run, then changes in MT can only change P or V in the short run.

The institutional setting in the backing theory eliminates P, thus leaving only V to change in the

short run. However, if colonists could not fully anticipate monetary actions, then the non-

neutrality of money in the short run is restored. In 1764 Benjamin Franklin observed that

injections of paper money “gave new life to business” and “promoted greatly the settlement of

new land” (Nussbaum 1957, p. 27). This raises the possibility that changes in MT caused short-

run changes in Y rather than V, a possibility that backing theory can only eliminate in the

colonial economy by assumption.

       Colonial legislatures engaged in substantive monetary actions in response to large crises,

such as wars, depression, and trade shocks (Brock 1975, pp. 74-84, 353-91; Lester 1938;

Pennsylvania Archives; Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania). Wars and trade shocks were known

to be likely near-term events, though exactly when they would occur was not easy to anticipate.

They were certainly unforecastable five years out. Once a crisis was upon a colony, anticipating

the course of monetary injections was also difficult. For example, during the Seven Year’s War,

while colonial legislatures typically authorized the issuance of a given sum of Mp, the actual

injection of money into the economy to pay soldiers, etc. occurred as needed (Appendix—Table

B). In addition, because the timing of future new injections of Mp were not contingent on present

monetary actions, the exact time-path of future MT, despite the required redemption of current

Mp injections, could not be fully anticipated. Finally, because these monetary injections were

typically government spending—money put in the hands of soldiers who were non-savers—

short-run changes in Y would seem likely.
                                                                                                  11


       Figure 1 shows the existence of large short-run cyclical or off-trend movements in total

real cash balances per capita—ln[MT/(P*Pop)]. This is identical to showing large off-trend

movements in [ln(Y/Pop) - ln(V)]. But because direct credible yearly time series on Y and on V

do not currently exist, determining what share of this off-trend movement is due to V’s response

to MT as opposed to movements in Y is currently impossible. The backing theorists’ primary

empirical test involves finding periods where [ln(Mp/P)] changed by large magnitudes, asserting

that ln(Ms) is unimportant and that ln(Y ) could not conceivably have changed by such a

magnitude, and then concluding, by deduction, that substantial changes in ln(V) must have

occurred. Evidence from the Seven Year’s War provides their key empirical test example (Smith

1985a, 1988; Wicker 1985). Between 1754 and 1759, total real cash balances per capita in

Pennsylvania, for example, increased by 147% (see Figure 1 and Appendix—Table A). On the

surface, the possibility that per capita Y could increase by 147% over a five-year period seems

highly improbable. Thus, by deduction, V must have decreased by a substantial percentage. This

reasoning, however, fails to appreciate the colossal and unprecedented effect the Seven Year’s

War had on real aggregates as well as on monetary aggregates. For example, between 1754 and

1759, the value of British exports to the Thirteen Colonies increased by 69%, and the value of

British export to, minus imports from, the Thirteen Colonies increased by an overwhelming

232% (derived from Egnal 1998, p. 35; Mitchell and Deane 1962, p. 310). The colonies

experienced a massive influx and net retention of goods during these five years. The first half of

the Seven Year’s War, therefore, occasioned both an unprecedented increase in [ln(MT/P)] and

an unprecedented increase in ln(Y) of potentially similar magnitudes. Finally, as the War ended

and [ln(MT/P)] declined precipitously (see Figure 1), Y also declined to depression levels (Egnal

1998, pp. 42-117; Doerflinger 1986, pp. 173-78; McCusker and Menard 1985, p. 63). This
                                                                                                   12


movement in Y could have left little room for the changes in V required by backing theory.

Likewise, substantial short-run cyclical changes in Y occurred during the Revolutionary War

(Buel 1998, Doerflinger 1986, O’Shaughnessy 2000), which makes assessing backing theory

outcomes during the Revolution (Calomiris 1988a) problematic.

       In conclusion, if monetary shocks were largely reflected through Y in the short run and

total real money balances per capita remained constant in the long run, then we are back in a

classical quantity theory of money world. Until more is known about the exact magnitudes of

year-to-year changes in Y and V, the backing theory’s mechanism of monetary adjustment as

applied to the colonial economy must remain speculative.

    SMITH’S DIRECT ECONOMETRIC TEST OF BACKING VERSUS QUANTITY

       Maryland’s paper money emission and method of backing for the years 1733 through

1764 were unique. In 1733 Maryland authorized the issuance of 90,000 Maryland pounds in bills

of credit (paper money). The quantity of bills in circulation at any one time was less than this

authorized sum by varying amounts, see Appendix—Table B. While other colonies backed their

paper money with future taxes and land mortgages, Maryland’s bills were backed through the

creation of a sinking fund. The money for this fund came from the proceeds of a 15 pence tax on

every hogshead of tobacco exported from the colony, and was used to purchase Bank of England

stock. This fund was to be used to redeem the bills in two stages, in each case by converting a

sufficient amount of the sinking fund into sterling bills of exchange and exchanging them for

Maryland pounds at a rate of three pounds sterling for every four Maryland pounds. This rate

was considered the par exchange rate between sterling and Maryland currency. One-third of the

bills were to be redeemed in 1748. The two-thirds not redeemed in 1748 were to be exchanged at

that date for new bills that were then to be redeemed in 1764 in the same fashion as in 1748.
                                                                                                     13


Maryland’s sinking fund provides a yearly measure of the current value of what backed

Maryland’s paper money (Behrens 1923, pp. 12-49; Brock 1975, pp. 99-105, 412-28; Price
         9
1977).

             Smith (1985b, pp. 1200-08) used the unique features of Maryland’s monetary system to

craft a direct econometric test between the quantity of paper money and the backing of paper

money to see which played a greater role in determining the value of paper money. Smith’s test

is the only econometric and statistical exercise published after West (1978) on the debate over

backing versus the quantity of money in the colonial economy. Because Maryland’s backing

provision consisted of an explicit commitment to swap sterling for Maryland pounds, Smith used

the yearly data on the sterling-to-Maryland pound exchange rate (McCusker 1978, pp. 202-03) to

measure changes in the value of the Maryland pound. Given the absence of a commodity price

index and information on the amount of specie in circulation for Maryland, there was no

alternative measure. Smith regressed the deviation of the exchange rate from par [Par(i)] on the

quantity of bills actually in circulation [MMSp(i)], the routine yearly operation of the backing

regime as measured by the current size of the sinking fund relative to its final size in 1764

[F(i)/F(1764)], and the credibility of the promise to redeem these bills at par as measured by

whether Maryland kept its intermediate redemption promise in 1748 [D1748-64 ]. Smith’s results

are reproduced in Table 2—Section I, Part A. Based on these results, Smith (1985b, pp. 1207-08)

concluded that “Clearly the quantity of money alone has no impact on currency

value....[I]ncreases in the market value of the backing for notes result in an appreciation in the

value of Maryland currency....[A] history of honoring promised redemptions… enhance[s] their

value.” Smith’s results, however, are a product of peculiar data interpolations and inappropriate

theoretical and econometric interpretations. When these problems are corrected, his conclusions
                                                                                                        14


fail to stand.

                                       [Place Table 2 Here]

        First, Smith’s results are replicated, using his data and model, to make sure that the

subsequent analysis starts from the same point and the subsequent differences in results are

purely a product of the changes described. Table 2—Section I, Part B—shows that the data and
                                                 10
model used here can replicate Smith’s results.        Second, Smith’s test for whether Maryland’s

honoring of its redemption commitment in 1748 affected the exchange rate is examined. He

modeled this effect by breaking the sample at 1748 and seeing if the years 1748-1764 were

different than the years 1735-1747 [the D1748-64 dummy variable]. The same results, however,

can be obtained when breaking the sample at any year between 1744 and 1756. In fact, the best

econometric result is obtained by dividing the sample at 1744 rather than at 1748. Two of these
                                                                     11
alternative regressions are reported in Table 2—Section I, Part C.        Thus, Smith’s result is not

distinctly an outcome of his hypothesis; a large number of alternative hypotheses could yield the

same result, such as shocks caused by the beginning or ending of major wars (see Figure 1).

Maryland’s fulfillment of its redemption commitment in 1748 had no effect on the exchange rate

distinguishable from any number of other events occurring in the five years on either side of

1748. Therefore, this measure of backing can be discarded. It lacks statistical and interpretive

relevance.

        The third step examines Smith’s measure of the quantity of money in circulation

[MMSp]. Smith’s measure relies on extensive data interpolation. Of the 30 years of data on this

variable, 18 are not observations but interpolations (the bracketed numbers in Appendix—Table

B). In the years before 1756, Smith filled in missing observations with the immediately prior

observation, and filled in missing observations after 1755 by substituting the authorized amount
                                                                                                   15


for the amount actually in circulation. Smith neither indicated that his data were highly

interpolated nor offered any justification for his peculiar method of data interpolation. Based on

the discussions in the original source (Brock 1975, pp. 104, 418-19) I constructed an alternative

set of interpolated values [MMGp], see Appendix—Table B. Simple linear interpolated values

are used in place of Smith’s use of immediately prior observations for missing values before

1756. The paper money authorized in 1756 was put into circulation slowly and then taxed out of

circulation by 1763. To capture this effect, I used two separate linear interpolations, one from

1755 to 1759 and another from 1759 to 1764, in place of Smith’s use of the authorized amount,

for missing values after 1755. When MMGp is used in Smith’s regression model in place of

MMSp a statistically significant relationship between the quantity of money and Par appears, see

Table 2—Section II, Part A. Smith’s (1985b, p. 1207) conclusion, using his econometric

standards, that “Clearly the quantity of money alone has no impact on currency value...”, is

overturned. This result is achieved even without adding the specie component to Maryland’s

money supply, which is currently unknown, as was done for Pennsylvania above.

       The final step examines Smith’s empirical measure of Maryland’s backing regime—the

sinking fund’s value in a given year as a percentage of its final value in 1764. The theoretical

motivation for this empirical measure lacks clarity. Just because a particular backing regime

succeeds in replacing the money-price relationship with a money-velocity relationship, it does

not follow, theoretically, that the routine operation of that regime should be related to changes in

prices or exchange rates. Smith’s interpretation of his econometric model as a horse race

between the backing of money and the quantity of money as to which determines the value of

money, therefore, lacks cogency.

       Alternatively, if Smith’s intention was to measure not the routine operation of the
                                                                                                   16


backing regime, but the likelihood that Maryland would experience a backing regime shift in

1764, then his measure of backing [F(i)/F(1764)] lacks empirical cogency for it does not capture

subjects’ expectations in any year about whether Maryland would be able to meet its promised

redemptions. For example, Maryland would be able to fully redeem its paper money as promised

in 1748 and 1764, i.e., its paper money would be fully backed, if it were accumulating sufficient

money each year in its sinking fund so that by 1748 and 1764 it could cover the promised

redemption. Deviations from this perfect-backing level of accumulation bare little relationship to

Smith’s measure [F(i)/F(1764)]. A measure of the degree of backing credibility that would capture

this expectation would be the deviation from the expected trend accumulation needed to just

meet the promised redemption. The greater the sinking fund’s deviation below this trend, the

greater the expectation that Maryland would be forced to shift its backing regime, i.e., forced to

redeem its paper money in 1764 at less than the promised three pounds sterling for every four

Maryland pounds.

       Several such measures were tried, but because all yielded the same result only one is

reported, see Table 2—Section II, Part B. This measure [Forecasted Backing] equals the

percentage the actual sinking fund at a given date fell below the linear accumulation rate needed

to just fulfill the promised redemption in 1764. If Maryland were on this linear accumulation

rate, they would also be able to fulfill their redemption promise of 1748. This measure assumes

that subjects knew how many of the bills authorized in 1733 the colony would eventually put

into circulation. It also assumes that they knew that per-year tobacco exports, and so the tax

revenue put into the sinking fund each year, would experience zero growth in the long run, and
                                                                             12
that the fund’s stock dividends would largely be offset by commission fees.       Thus, a linear

accumulation rate in the sinking fund between 1733 and 1764 geared to meet the promised
                                                                                                17


redemption of the actual sum to be redeemed in 1764 would correspond to perfect backing.

       The sinking fund was substantially below this “perfect backing” trend accumulation in

most years. For example, the fund was 50 percent below this trend accumulation in 1744 and

again in 1758. Only in 1749, was it above and only after 1762 was it only 5 percent or less

below, this trend accumulation. Maryland actually redeemed its paper currency as promised in

1748 and 1764. They were able to do so because the sinking fund experienced exceptional

growth in the years immediately prior to these redemption dates. This exceptional growth was in

turn due to fortuitous peaks in tobacco exports and hence in the tax revenue contributions to the

fund in 1747-48 and again in 1763-64 (Historical Statistics 1975, part 2, pp. 1189-90). It seems

unlikely that Marylanders could have forecasted such luck.

       If backing matters, and if subjects used the current accumulation trend in the sinking fund

as the forecast of the likely end accumulation, then the coefficient on Forecasted Backing when

used in the Smith-type model should be one. Par was three pounds sterling for every four

Maryland pounds because Maryland promised to swap sterling for Maryland pounds at that rate

in 1764. If the sinking fund in 1764 was, for example, 33.3 percent deficient, then Maryland

could only swap two pounds sterling for every four Maryland pounds—a rate 33.3 percent below

exchange par. Thus, if backing is what determines value, then the percentage the exchange rate

was below par in a given year would be the same percentage by which the sinking fund in that

year was below the trend accumulation needed to just meet the promised redemption in 1764.

The latter percentage was the percentage by which the sinking fund was forecasted to be

deficient in 1764.

       When my measure of backing [Forecasted Backing] and money [MMGp] are used in

place of Smith’s measure of backing [F(i)/F(1764)] and money [MMSp] in Smith’s model, the
                                                                                                    18


coefficients on both the quantity of paper money and the backing of paper money, by Smith’s

econometric standards, are statistically significant with the correct sign, see Table 2—Section II,

Part B. However, the coefficient on Forecasted Backing, while positive, is far from one.

Therefore, backing, as defined by the forecasting of the likely backing regime shift, appears to be

of little importance to determining the value of money in Maryland between 1733 and 1764.

Finally, when this model, or any model in Table 2, is AR1 corrected for serial correlation,

statistically significant results on both the money and the backing variables disappear. As such,

the data for Maryland may not be strong enough to tell us anything about backing versus the
                     13
quantity of money.

                               MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING

       In the literature on colonial monetary behavior what theoretically differentiates the role

of backing from that of the quantity of money has not been well articulated. Fiat paper money,

by definition, assumes some type of backing in order to hold its value above its opportunity

value. Scarcity of paper alone cannot do it. If scarcity alone determined a money’s value, then it

would be a commodity money not a fiat money. Someone, typically the government, must be

willing to accept fiat paper money for some commodity, service, or (tax) obligation at a rate

above its opportunity value, such as above paper money’s value as a bookmark or a fire-lighter.

At this level of analysis, there is no “quantity of money” versus “backing of money” dichotomy.

Even Fisher’s (1912) world of the classical quantity theory of money assumes that banknotes

were convertible on demand into gold. Likewise, the “quantity” theorists’ monetary adjustment

mechanism for the colonial economy discussed above assumes backing, namely, that someone

was willing to exchange fiat paper money for specie at a fixed rate. In other words, the quantity

theory of (fiat) money assumes a backing regime.
                                                                                                    19


        How backing affects nominal values is presented in two ways. First, for a given quantity

of fiat money, a change in how money is backed, i.e., a sudden regime shift might alter the value

of the fiat money (Sargent 1982). It might also change the responsiveness of P, Y, and V to

changes in MT through altering the degree by which future MT can be anticipated. Second, a

particular backing regime might dissolve the long-run money-price connection by substituting a

long-run money-velocity connection in its place (Calomiris 1988a; Laidler 1987; Sargent and

Wallace 1981; Smith 1985a, 1985b, 1988; Wicker 1985). These two ways tend to be conflated in

the literature on colonial monetary behavior—for an example, see the analysis of Smith (1985b)

in the prior section.

        The first way is least controversial because it does not directly challenge the classical

quantity theory of money. While the evidence for colonial America is not strong enough to

support systematic econometric testing, it is highly suggestive that when colonial legislatures

substantially changed their paper money backing regimes, holding the quantity of paper money

constant, nominal values changed in the expected direction. For example, Smith (1985a, p. 552;

1985b, pp. 1189, 1197) identifies likely regime shifts for South Carolina in 1731, North Carolina

in 1748, and Massachusetts in 1749. Grubb (2003, p. 1786) identifies a likely regime shift for

Virginia around 1764-1766. Calomiris (1988a) identifies backing regime shifts behind the

Continental dollar during the Revolution. Massachusetts’ regime shift consisted of going off fiat

paper money, and South Carolina’s regime shift consisted of being prohibited by Parliament

from issuing any new paper money. The other regime shifts pre-revolution typically consisted of

legislatures changing how they redeemed their paper money and what they would accept in

payment of taxes. In some cases they switched between the policy of taxing the money out of

circulation and physically burning it, and the policy of rolling-over issues of paper money as
                                                                                                      20


they where paid in as taxes (Brock 1975, pp. 33-34, 112-13, 120-23; Ernst 1973, pp. 63-75;

Perkins 1991, p. 15).

       One of the clearest demonstrations of this backing regime-shift effect is for Maryland in

1781. Maryland issued three distinguishable types of paper money, namely, “red” money,

“black” money, and “state continental” money in 1780-81. The three monies were backed

differently, some by future taxes and some by the expected sale of confiscated loyalist property,

and they also traded at differing discounts off their face value. Since, by definition, the total

quantity of money (all monies) in Maryland was the same relative to red, black, and state

continental money at any point in time, it is differential backing that likely produced their

differential discounts (Behrens 1923, pp. 69-77).

       Most of the backing literature for colonial America, however, does not focus on regime

shifts, but examines the purported absence of a money-price relationship while holding a

particular backing regime constant (Smith 1985a, 1985b, 1988; Wicker 1985). Most of the

colonies and periods examined, such as those of Pennsylvania and Maryland above, had constant
                                        14
de facto backing regimes through out.        As such, this second way of interpreting how backing

affected nominal values is more controversial. By stressing that it is the particular regime, and

not the shift in that regime, that matters, it directly challenges the classical quantity theory of

money by substituting a long-run money-velocity relationship for the classical quantity theory of

money’s long-run money-price relationship (Laidler 1987, Sargent and Wallace 1981).

       The problem with the above approach to backing is that colonial backing regimes served

two functions concurrently. They served a backing function by holding the value of paper money

above its opportunity value through paper money’s acceptance for tax obligations, and a quantity

function by influencing the quantity of money through the time-path of note redemption. Based
                                                                                                   21


on this discussion and using the evidence for Pennsylvania in Figure 1, an alternative monetary

adjustment mechanism will be offered that combines the backing and quantity mechanisms. The

Pennsylvania legislature could not engage in monetary micro-management in the very short run.

They also could not defend an exchange rate between paper money and specie in the short run.

However, they could and did engage in monetary actions in response to large crises, such as

wars, depressions, and trade shocks (Brock 1975, pp. 74-84, 353-91; Lester 1938; Pennsylvania

Archives; Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania). For example, see Pennsylvania’s response to the

Seven Year’s War (Wicker 1985) and to the 1772 British Credit Crisis (Neal 1990, pp. 170-71;

Sheridan 1960) illustrated in Figure 1. Wars and trade shocks were known to be likely near-term

events, though exactly when they would occur was not easily anticipated. The Pennsylvania

legislature wanted to have a short-run monetary policy to finance wars, and to counter

depressions by stimulating Y, but also wanted a credible long-run price-stability policy. To

accomplish this dual policy, they had to convince their subjects that non-crisis monetary policy

would undo the unanticipated crisis-year monetary injections such that per capita real cash

balances would remain constant in the long run. They accomplished this through explicitly tying

crisis-year monetary injections to taxes and mortgage payments that would be paid in the near-

future non-crisis years. While designed to remove from circulation the prior monetary injection,

the exact time-path of said removal was hard to forecast. The legislature maintained the

credibility of this commitment by letting real cash balances decline during non-crisis periods,

some of which could be quite lengthy, e.g., see 1733-41, 1748-54, and 1762-72 in Figure 1.

       The particular backing regimes used in colonial America were designed to control the

quantity of money in the long run, and to provide credibility to this long-run commitment in the

face of unanticipated short-run deviations during crisis periods. The backing of paper money and
                                                                                                  22


the quantity of paper money cannot be regarded as independent theories here. They are

inseparable elements of a given institutional setting that attempted to control the quantity of

money in the long run, but allow short-run monetary influence over Y. Whether changes in V

over the short-run happened to also undo some of the changes in MT as an unintended side effect

of this monetary policy is still an open question.

                                         CONCLUSIONS

       The long-running debate over the purported failure of the classical quantity theory of

money in the colonial economy is shown to be a failure of data rather than a failure of theory.

Only Pennsylvania has enough high-quality data to support econometric testing. For this colony,

when new data on the quantity of specie is added to the existing data on the quantity of paper

money and estimated in short- and long-run monetary models, the purported failure of the

classical quantity theory of money disappears. From 1729 through 1775, per capita total real

money balances exhibited a stationary process with no trend. The backing theory of monetary

performance, changes in MT undone by changes in V, is potentially relevant only during short-

run cyclical movements. The data on short-run movements in Y versus V, however, are

insufficient to gage the magnitude or even the existence of such an effect in the colonial

economy.

           The slight difference in results is most likely due to how missing values were handled

by the estimation programs.

           These interpolated values are reported in the brackets and their construction is

described in the notes of Appendix—Table B.

       Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. When Total R2 is reported this means that the

results are AR1 error corrected for serial correlation. Par is defined as the percentage the

exchange rate (e) is below the relevant redemption rate, where the redemption rate is 1.0

Maryland pound equals 0.75 pounds sterling and e is defined as the “sterling value of a

Maryland pound note” (Smith, 1985b, p. 1,201). Thus, Par equals [(0.75/e) - 1], which in turn

equals [(Ex*0.0075) - 1] because e equals (100/Ex), where Ex is the exchange rate taken from

McCusker (1978, pp. 202-03), see footnote 10 and Appendix—Table B. MMSp equals Smith’s

interpolation of the quantity of Maryland pounds (bills of credit) in circulation. MMGp equals

my interpolation of the quantity of Maryland pounds in circulation. (F(i)/F(1764)) equals the value

of the sinking fund as a percentage of its value in 1764 which was its terminal and maximum

value. D equals one for the years indicated and zero otherwise. Forecasted Backing equals the

percentage by which the actual sinking funds accumulated at a given date falls below the linear

accumulation rate, from 1733 through 1764, needed to fulfill the promised redemption in 1764.

       Notes: All nominal values are expressed in Pennsylvania pounds. For population

estimates linear interpolation between the decadal data points is used. Implied Total Specie =

[(Ratio: Specie to Paper) * (Outstanding Pennsylvania Paper Pounds)], i.e., Ms = Ms/Mp * Mp.

This method assumes that the velocity of circulation of paper money (Vp) equals the velocity of

circulation of specie (Vs). Thus, in the quantity theory of money formation (Fisher 1912):

[Mp*Vp + Ms*Vs] = [Mp + Ms]*V = MT*V. The Average Current Commodity Price is taken

from the 20 commodity unweighted arithmetic price index for Philadelphia [base year equal to

1741-45] reported in Bezanson, et al. (1935, pp. 429, 433). This price index is converted to the

Average Current Commodity Price in PA Pounds by multiplying the index number by the

summation of the 20 commodity prices for the base year, dividing this number by 100, dividing

this number by 20 (the number of commodities), and then dividing this number by 20 (to convert

shillings to pounds).

       Sources: The data on outstanding Pennsylvania pounds are taken from Brock (1975, pp.

82-83, 386-87; 1992, p. 113); the ratio of specie to paper currency from Grubb (2004); the

Pennsylvania population from Historical Statistics (1975, part 2, p. 1,168); and commodity

* These values are transcription errors by Smith (1985b, pp. 1,204-05) from the original source.

** The original source states that in 1749 “…there were some 62,000 in bills, new and old, in

circulation” and that no new bills were issued until 1756 (Brock 1975, pp. 104, 418).

*** The original source states that the 40,000 in new bills authorized in 1756 “…were not

thrown at once into Circulation but paid out from time to time to the Troops…”, that total bills in

circulation reached a peak of 96,018, and that “By October, 1763, the sums arising from the

various taxes had proved more than sufficient to retire the 30,000 in new bills issued by the act

of 1756, together with the 4,015 in unexchanged conversion bills that had been paid out.” (Brock

1975, pp. 418-19).

       Notes: Where data were missing in the original sources, interpolated values are

substituted in brackets. Simple linear interpolations are used throughout except for [MMGp]

between 1756 and 1764. The interpolation for these years is derived from the statements in the

above notes. Smith (1985b, pp. 1,204-05) provided no interpolated values for [F] and [Ex], but

instead left these values blank. Thus, they were treated as missing values in the replication of his

econometric results in Table 4—Section I, Parts B and C. His interpolated values for [MMSp]

appear to be a combination of filling in missing values with their immediate prior observation for

observations before 1749, and substituting “authorized” amounts for the amounts actually in

circulation for observations after 1755. For [Ex] par was defined to be 133.33, or one Maryland

pound equaled 0.75 pounds sterling.

      The modern protagonists in this debate have added little new or original to the arguments that

were prevalent and well articulated among the colonists themselves, other than the translation of

these arguments into modern pedagogy (for just a few of the many examples, see Archives of

State of New Jersey, 1st series, vol. 5, pp. 120-22, 156-57; Davis 1964, vol. 4, 377-405; Ernst

1973, pp. 63-64; Marchione 1983, pp. 325-30; various editorials on money in the Maryland

Gazette between 1780 and 1782 and in the Pennsylvania Gazette between 1739 and 1760;

Newell 1998, pp. 130-31, 145-46, 214-35; Nussbaum 1957, p. 27; Pennsylvania Archives, 8th

series, vol. 6, pp. 4516-30; Perkins 1991; Webster 1969, pp. 139-61). The contribution of the

modern protagonists in this debate is applied. They selectively marshaled the evidence gathered

by other scholars long ago to support their respective theoretical positions. They, however,

undertook no econometric estimation or statistical testing, with the notable exception of Smith’s

(1985b) work on 1735-1764 Maryland—which will be addressed below.
  2
      The post-West (1978) quantitative studies of colonial monetary performance cover the colonies

of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York,

Rhode Island, and Massachusetts (McCallum 1992; Michener 1987; Smith 1985a, 1985b, 1988;

Wicker 1985). All of these studies, however, are non-econometric and provide no statistical testing,

with the one exception noted in footnote 1. In addition, price data were not used, because reliable

price data do not exist, for North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.

Finally, none of these studies have information on the specie component of the yearly money

supply.
                                                                                                     38

      Several reasons account for why my replication of West’s (1978) model differs from his

original results. West used the Bezanson (1935) price index as reproduced in Cole (1938). I used

the original price index as reported in Bezanson that differed from that reproduced in Cole by

being carried to one more decimal place. West used the Brock (1975) data on paper money. I

used the Brock (1992) data on paper money that corrected Brock’s earlier data for minor errors.

Finally, West used Cochrane-Orchutt while I used the more efficient Yule-Walker technique to

correct for serial correlation.
   4
       The average price rather than the price index is used because the difference between the

natural logarithm of the index and that of its average price is almost imperceptible, i.e., yielding

less than a 0.0002 and 0.000005 difference in the coefficient and standard error on the variable t,

respectively. By using the average price the actual current total-real-money-balance per capita in

Pennsylvania pounds can be easily calculated by taking em for that year. t = (Year - 1728). The

results also do not perceptibly change when using slightly different sample end points, i.e., 1730-

1775 and 1729-1774.
   5
       When using Dickey-Fuller critical values for m(i-1) and the Dickey-Fuller F-test, non-

stationarity is rejected. See Enders (1995, pp. 221-23, 257, 419, 421).
   6
       The variant of the quantity theorists’ model that relies on merchants to maintain the fixed

exchange rate between paper and specie right up to the point where all specie disappears from

the colony (Michener 1987, p. 264) is inconsistent with rational expectations. Given an increase

in the quantity of paper money by the legislature, merchants would revise their expected

probability that the legislature might in the near future continue this practice and so drive the
                                                                                                      39



colony over the zero-specie threshold. Given this increased expected likelihood, merchants

would begin to demand higher prices in paper money per unit of specie well before the zero-

specie threshold was reached, and vice versa. A rational expectations mechanism of monetary

adjustment by merchant arbitragers would lead to a variable exchange rate between paper and

specie even when considerable specie was still in circulation in the colony. Thus, paper and

specie would be less than perfect substitutes, and the door would be opened to changes in the

quantity of paper money affecting prices even when specie was in circulation.
      7
           All reported correlation coefficients are statistically different from zero above the 0.02

significance level.

  8
      The colonial institutional setting is somewhat reminiscent of the system proposed by Friedman

(1948). It should be noted at this juncture that this institutional linking of V and MT is also not a

violation of the general quantity theory of money (MT*V = P*Y) or the “equation of exchange”

as Fisher (1912) called it. The classical assumption that V is not a direct function of MT is

derived from the particular monetary institutional settings of the 19th and early 20th centuries

where MT is a function of a loosely regulated fractional-reserve private banking system (Fisher

1912, Laidler 1987). Most quantity theorists would agree that V not being a direct function of

MT is neither a universal nor institutionally-invariant condition. Because the colonial economy

had no banks, no fractional reserve banking, no demand or time deposits, no mints for coinage,

no government bonds, and so forth, the colonial world was clearly different enough to warrant

relaxing the classical assumption that V is not a direct function of MT.

          In this period, Maryland occasionally issued a small number of additional bills of credit that
                                                                                                    40



were backed, as other colonies backed their bills, through future taxes and land mortgages, and

not by a sinking fund whose current value was directly measurable. See Brock (1975, pp. 99-

105, 412-28).
 10
       Smith (1985b, pp. 1201-05) states that e denotes the sterling value of a Maryland pound

note, that the redemption rate is four Maryland pounds for three pounds sterling, that Par = .75e

– 1, that Par is the percentage the exchange rate is above the relevant redemption rate, and that

the exchange rate (Ex) is the number of Maryland pounds per 100 pounds sterling (Appendix—

Table B). These statements are mutually inconsistent, and if followed exactly cannot replicate

his econometric results. It appears that Smith’s statement that [Par = .75e – 1] is erroneous. It

should be [Par = .75/e – 1] which in turn equals [(Ex*0.0075) - 1] because e equals (100/Ex). If

[Par = .75/e – 1] is used, then Smith’s econometric results can be replicated. This also implies

that Par is the percentage that e is below the relevant redemption rate.
  11
       The same results are found for all subsequent models estimated in Table 2. In addition, the

standard Chow Test cannot reject the absence of a structural break at 1748 (F-statistic = 2.28).

The Chow Test is only relevant when using the correctly specified data and variable

construction, i.e., the last regression reported in Table 2. Dickey-Fuller tests show that from

1735 through 1765 both Par and ln(Ex) are trend-stationary, and Perron (1989, pp. 1380-83)

tests show a structural break in these trend-stationary processes at 1748. However, the same

results are found when the break is modeled to be either in 1749, 1750, or 1743. These results

are available from the author upon request, or the reader can replicate them directly using the

data in Appendix—Table B. Finally, even if there were structural breaks in Par and ln(Ex) at

1748, it would be impossible to distinguish between whether such breaks were caused by
                                                                                                 41



Maryland’s successful currency redemption or by the shock to real trade flows occasioned by the

end of the War of the Austrian Succession. In conclusion, Smith’s (1985b) dummy variable

measure of backing

[D1748-64] lacks both statistical and interpretive relevance.

Historical Statistics (1975, part 2, pp. 1189-90). See also McCusker and Menard 1985, p. 121.

On commission fees, see Price (1977).
  13
       Inspection of the Maryland exchange rate data (McCusker 1978, pp. 202-03) indicates that

substantial measurement error may be present. The yearly exchange rate in many cases is derived

from only a single observation in a particular merchant account book, and said observations

across years are derived from different merchants reporting at different times of the year.
  14
       For example, the Currency Acts of 1751 and 1764 imposed on the colonies by Parliament

did not produce effective backing regime shifts in most colonies. These acts required that

colonial paper money not be made legal tender and that future taxes be put in place to redeem

said paper money in a timely fashion (Ernst 1973, Wicker 1985, Grubb 2003). Most colonies,

such as Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, had been backing and redeeming their paper

money with explicit future taxes long before these acts. The removal of paper money’s legal

tender status by these acts also did not produce an effective regime shift. Because colonial

legislatures had and continued to accept their own paper money in payment of the taxes they

imposed and land mortgages they held, their paper money had de facto legal tender status for

public debts. This, in turn, served as an effective nominal anchor for its use as a tender for

private debts.
