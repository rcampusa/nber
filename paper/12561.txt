Do Television and Radio Destroy Social Capital? Evidence from Indonesian Villages
Benjamin A. Olken
NBER Working Paper No. 12561

JEL No. Z13

                                               ABSTRACT

In "Bowling Alone," Putnam (1995) famously argued that the rise of television may be responsible
for social capital's decline. I investigate this hypothesis in the context of Indonesian villages. To identify
the impact of exposure to television (and radio), I exploit plausibly exogenous differences in over-the-air
signal strength associated with the topography of East and Central Java. Using this approach, I find
that better signal reception, which is associated with more time spent watching television and listening
to radio, is associated with substantially lower levels of participation in social activities and with lower
self-reported measures of trust. I find particularly strong effects on participation in local government
activities, as well as on participation in informal savings groups. However, despite the impact on social
capital, improved reception does not appear to affect village governance, at least as measured by discussions
in village-level meetings and by corruption in a village-level road project.

1.   Introduction
        Robert Putnam, in a series of books and articles, famously argued that social capital in

the United States has been declining over the past 40 years – and that the rise of television is a

major factor behind this decline (Putnam 1995, 2000). Empirically testing this hypothesis,

however, is challenging. While there are many correlational studies on the relationship between

television watching and participation in social groups, establishing a causal relationship is more

difficult. Putnam, for example, acknowledges the paucity of causal evidence on this point, and to

establish a casual link relies on only one study, based on the introduction of television in three

isolated Canadian communities in the 1970s (Williams 1986, Putnam 2000). 1

         In this paper, I examine the link between media exposure and social capital in over 600

villages in two Indonesian provinces, East Java and Central Java. Rural Java is a particularly

attractive setting for studying this question, for several reasons. First, the area is rich in social

capital – the typical village contains 179 groups of various types, or one for every 15 adults.

Second, the setting provides plausibly exogenous variation in television and radio use, which

allows me to investigate the causal impact of television and radio on social capital. My findings

suggest that television and radio do appear to reduce social capital, measured either by

participation levels in social groups or by self-reported measures of trust.

         To identify this relationship, I exploit the fact that that the mountainous terrain of parts of

East and Central Java generates plausibly exogenous variation in the ability of villagers in rural

areas to receive television and radio signals. I show that the variation in television reception

within rural districts is uncorrelated with village characteristics such as population, education

1
 Several authors have recently used the diffusion of radio in the United States to study the impact of media on
public finance (Stromberg 2004) and the diffusion of television in the United States to study its impact on voter
participation and education (Gentzkow 2006, Gentzkow and Shapiro 2006). However, the relative scarcity of
detailed data on social participation from the 1950s and earlier have meant similar exercises have not been
conducted for participation in social groups.


                                                          1
rates, and poverty. Furthermore, I use a model of electromagnetic signal propagation, combined

with GIS data on the location of transmission towers and the topography of the area, to verify

that the results are robust to using only the variation in signal strength caused by mountains

located in between the villages and the transmission towers.

       Using the variation in signal reception within rural districts, I find that that each

additional television channel whose signal is strong enough to be received over-the-air is

associated with villagers watching, on average, about 4.1 minutes of additional television per

day. I also find that an additional channel of television reception is associated with respondents

listening to an additional 5.4 minutes of radio each day, which likely reflects the high correlation

between radio and television signals. Since I do not observe radio reception directly, and since

even if observed it would likely be collinear with television reception in any case, I consider the

total effect of an additional channel of better TV reception to be the additional 9.5 minutes per

day spent watching television and listening to radio, and do not attempt to separate television

from radio. Overall, this represents about a 5% increase in time spent watching television and

listening to radio for each additional television channel received.

       The results show substantial negative impacts of improved reception, and hence of time

spent watching television and listening to radio, on participation in a wide range of village

activities. Reception of an extra channel of television is associated with a decline of about 7

percent in the total number of social groups in the village, and with the typical adult in the

village attending 11 percent fewer group meetings. The effects are particularly strong among

community self-improvement activities, neighborhood associations, school committees, and

informal savings groups. These declines in social participation represent a net decline in social

activity, rather than a shift from formal social groups to informal gatherings. Overall, the




                                                  2
estimates imply that villagers spend between 0.14 - 0.16 fewer hours in group meetings for every

additional hour they spend watching television or listening to radio.

       In addition to participation in social groups, another form of social capital that has been

frequently discussed in the literature is trust (e.g., Knack and Keefer, 1997, La Porta et a. 1997).

Consistent with the results on participation in social groups, I also find that additional television

and radio exposure is associated with substantially lower self-reported levels of trust, as

measured using the same type of World Values Survey trust questions that have been widely

used in the literature and that have been shown to be correlated with real trustworthy behavior

(Glaeser et al. 2000, Karlan 2005). The results show that the impact of television and radio on

social capital are similar across these two very different measures of social capital.

       A large part of the interest in social capital stems from a related argument advanced by

Putnam (1993) that lower levels of social capital translate into worse governance. In the data, I

observe several measures of governance associated with a village-level road building program

that took place in all 600 villages during the period the data was collected. The process for

building and supervising these village roads was supposed to be participatory – construction was

planned at open village meetings, and subsequent village meetings were held at which the

construction team had to account for how they used funds. Enumerators attended these meetings,

and consistent with the results on participation in social groups, areas with greater television

reception had lower attendance at these village-level planning and monitoring meetings.

       Despite the impact of better television reception on attendance at meetings, I find little

evidence that this translated into worse outcomes for the road project. Even though it reduces

attendance, greater television reception does not change the number of people at the road-

building meetings who talk, the probability that a corruption-related problem was discussed at a




                                                  3
meeting, or the probability that the meetings dedicated to project accountability voted to take any

serious action, such as firing someone or calling for an outside audit, to resolve a problem.

Moreover, better television reception was not associated with greater theft of funds from the road

project, as measured by the difference between the road’s official cost and an engineer’s ex-post

estimate of what the road actually cost to build. Though television and radio broadcasts are

largely national, and rarely if ever report on the individual villages I study, it is of course

possible that media exposure affects village level governance through channels other than social

capital. Considerable caution should therefore be used in interpreting the results on governance

as identifying the causal effect of social capital per se on governance. Nevertheless, the results

here stand in contrast to cross-country studies, which tend to show a negative correlation

between corruption and average levels of trust and social participation (La Porta et al. 1997,

Bjornskov 2004).

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the setting and

discusses the data used in the paper. Section 3 discusses the empirical strategy, shows that the

residual variation in television reception I use appears unrelated to village characteristics such as

population, education rates, and poverty, and presents the model of electromagnetic signal

transmission used to explicitly identify the variation in television reception due to topographic

features. It also shows that better reception does indeed lead to more time spent watching

television and listening to radio. Section 4 presents the main results on the impact of television

and radio on social capital. Section 5 discusses the impact of television reception on village

governance, as measured through the monitoring process and final outcomes of a village-level

road building project. Section 6 concludes.

2.   Setting and Data
        This study examines 606 villages in Indonesia’s East Java and Central Java provinces. As

the data used in this study come from a study of rural road projects, all villages in the study were

selected because they were about to begin building a 1-3 km road project under the auspices of

the Kecamatan Development Program (KDP), a project funded by the central government from a

loan from the World Bank.

        Rural Java is one of the most densely populated rural areas in the world, with over 750

people per square kilometer. 2 Consistent with this high population density, districts (kabupaten)

in Java contain almost one million people on average, but are relatively small geographically – a

typical district contains only 1,100 square kilometers, equivalent to a square 33 km on each side.

(A list of the various administrative units in Indonesia with their relative sizes is shown in Table

1.) Districts are broken into subdistricts (kecamatan), which are in turn broken into villages

(desa), each of which contains an average of about 4,500 people. Villages are subsequently

broken up into hamlets (dusun), blocks (RW), and neighborhoods (RT). All specifications will

include fixed effects at the district level, to control for the administrative, locational, and cultural

differences that exist across the different parts of East and Central Java.

        The data used in this paper come from several surveys designed by the author and

conducted between September 2003 and August 2004. In the remainder of this section I describe

the data for the three main types of variables used in the study – data on social organizations

from a survey of the head of each hamlet, data on television reception from a household survey

and television transmitter locations from the Indonesian government, and data on governance

population densities of similar magnitude among rural areas in developing countries.

from a field survey used to measure corruption in the road project and from a first-hand report of

attendance and discussions at village meetings associated with building the road.


2.1. Social organizations
      Javanese villages have a complex network of social groups. As discussed in Alatas et al.

(2002) and Miguel et al. (2005), a typical Javanese village includes a wide variety of social

organizations, including religious study groups, neighborhood associations, rotating savings and

credit associations (ROSCAs, known as arisan in Indonesian), and women’s groups of various

types. Javanese villages also have a strong tradition of community-self help, or gotong royong, in

which villagers work together to improve community infrastructure.

       While many of the groups are formed independently by villagers, some are local chapters

of larger organizations. Many of the Islamic study groups, for example, are loosely affiliated

with the two national Islamic umbrella organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and

Muhammadiyah, though they essentially operate independently in each village. In addition,

under the Soeharto regime, neighborhood associations (RTs and RWs) and the national women’s

organization (PKK) were formalized and encouraged by the central government. Since the end of

the Soeharto regime in 1998 and the introduction of regional autonomy in 2002, these groups

have been essentially left on their own, with relatively little subsequent support or

encouragement from the central government.

       To measure the prevalence and activity of these various types of social groups, I use key

informant surveys, which allow me to construct a list of all social organizations in the village. In

particular, in each hamlet, the surveyor interviewed the head of the hamlet, and asked him for an

exhaustive list of all groups, organizations, activities, meetings, or programs that exist in his

hamlet. To ensure that the list was complete, the hamlet head was prompted with a list of 12

different categories of social groups, with each category containing a list of the four or five most


                                                  6
common activities in that category. For each group, the hamlet head was asked what type of

group it was and whether the group included only members from one neighborhood (RT),

members from one neighborhood in the same block (RW), members from multiple areas in the

same hamlet (dusun), or members from the entire village. 3 In addition, in one randomly selected

hamlet in each village, for each group the hamlet head was also asked about the frequency of

meetings, the date of the most recent meeting, the number of men and women who attend a

typical meeting, and whether the group meeting included a rotating savings and credit

association (ROSCA).

         I aggregate these data across all hamlets to obtain a picture of the all groups in the

village. Table 2 presents summary statistics of the data. As shown in Table 2, on average there

are 179 total groups in each village. This works out to about 1 group for every 15 adults in the

village. Using the more detailed data on the average number of attendees and frequency of

meetings, I also compute the average number of times an adult in the village attended a meeting

in the past three months. On average, each adult attended approximately 11 meetings over the

three months prior to the survey, or about 1 meeting each week.


2.2. Television reception
      Indonesia has 9 major television channels that broadcast over the air. These channels

include one government-run channel (TVRI), three major networks (RCTI, SCTV, and Indosiar),




3
  Hamlet heads typically know the activities in their hamlet in great detail. However, in hamlets with multiple blocks
(RWs), hamlet heads may not know about neighborhood organizations in blocks other than the block where they
live. Thus, if there are multiple blocks in the hamlet, the hamlet head was asked to list all neighborhood-level (RT)
activities only for his block (RW). For all other organizations (i.e., any organization that contains members from
multiple neighborhoods (RTs)), he was instructed to list all organizations in his hamlet. Accordingly, to calculate the
total number of organizations in the hamlet, I multiply the number of organizations at the neighborhood (RT) level
by the average number of blocks (RWs) per hamlet in the village.


                                                          7
one all-news station (Metro TV), and four minor networks (ANTV, TV7, TransTV, and TPI). 4

All of the private channels (except Metro TV) have a range of entertainment programming, such

as sitcoms, soap operas, movies, and religious programs, and in addition the government run

channel and the major networks all have daily national news shows.

         Data on the ability of households to receive each of these channels comes from the

household survey. Respondents were selected from a stratified random sample of households in

the village. 5 In that survey, each respondent was asked, for each of the 9 networks in Indonesia,

whether “as far as they know, this station could be received in this village clearly enough to

watch.” As shown in Table 2, on average, households report being able to receive about 5

stations, with virtually universal coverage for two of the major networks (RCTI and Indosiar)

and much lower coverage rates for the minor networks.

         For the main measure of television reception I use in the paper, I average the number of

channels received over all respondents in a subdistrict. 6 In constructing this average, I only use

the data on television reception from those households that have televisions, excluding the 3

percent of households who also own a satellite dish, which yields an average of 20 datapoints on

television reception for each of the 155 subdistricts in the sample. The correlation of these

individual responses within a subdistrict is 0.70, which suggests that averaging over 20

households should produce an estimate of the number of channels received with relatively little

measurement error.




4
  There are two other even more minor national stations, Global TV and LatTV. These two stations were not asked
about explicitly in the household survey, but some households reported receiving them under the category of ‘other’.
Although I do not include these stations in the main analysis, adding them does not substantially affect the results.
5
  The sampling strategy for the household survey is discussed in detail in Olken (2006).
6
  Averaging television reception at the village level, rather than the subdistrict level, produces very similar results.
This is not surprising, given that television reception is highly correlated across villages in the same subdistrict. All
standard errors are clustered by subdistrict to account for the geographic clustering of television reception.


                                                           8
       On average, 69 percent of sampled households report owning a television, and 71 percent

report owning a radio; only 12 percent of households own neither. Overall, respondents reported

spending an average of 123 minutes per day watching television and 55 minutes per day listening

to radio. The survey also included a series of trust questions similar to those in the World Values

Survey, which will be discussed in more detail below.

       In addition, I also obtained data from the Indonesian Department of Information and

Communications on the locations and signal strengths of all television transmitters in Indonesia.

In Section 3.2, I use this data, combined with GIS maps of Java, to predict television reception in

each village as a function of the topography between the transmitters and each village in the data.

This approach allows me to verify that the variation in television reception is indeed coming

from geographic features of East and Central Java.


2.3. Governance
      Two types of data on governance are used in the paper. The first measure of governance I

examine is data from the open village meetings that were part of the road construction project.

Enumerators attended four meetings in each village – one meeting where construction was

planned, and three meetings (after 40%, 80%, and 100% of funds were spent) where those who

implemented the project had to account for how they used project funds. The enumerator took

attendance at the meeting and recorded all of the issues that were discussed at the meeting, as

well as how each issue was resolved.

       Second, I measure “missing expenditures” in each of the road projects that were built in

the project. Specifically, after the road projects were completed, engineers dug core samples in

each road to estimate the quantity of materials used, surveyed local suppliers to estimate prices,

and interviewed villagers to determine the wages paid on the project. From these data, I construct

an independent estimate of the amount each project actually cost to build, and then compare this


                                                 9
estimate with what the village reported it spent on the project on a line-item by line-item basis. 7

The difference in logs between what the village claimed the road cost to build, and what the

engineers estimated it actually cost to build, is the measure of missing expenditures I examine. I

examine four versions of this measure: missing expenditures for the road project, missing

expenditures for the road and ancillary projects (which includes accompanying projects such as

culverts and retaining walls), missing prices (i.e., the difference in logs between the prices

reported by the village and those found in the price survey, weighted by the reported shares of

each commodity the village reports it uses), and missing quantities (i.e., the difference in logs

between the quantities the village reports and those found in the engineering survey, weighted by

the village’s reported prices).



3.     Empirical Strategy

3.1. Determinants of Television Reception
      The empirical strategy is to use television reception as an exogenous determinant of

television watching. It is important to use an exogenous determinant of television watching to

isolate the causal effect of media exposure because of potential reverse causality issues. For

example, if the number of social groups was low for some other reason – say, the village head

who organizes the social groups was incompetent – households might respond to the lack of

available social activities by watching more television.

           The key issue in doing this is to ensure that television reception is orthogonal to other

village characteristics that might also affect social capital. In particular, the placement of TV

stations, particularly for the minor networks, is determined primarily by the major cities of East

and Central Java – in particular, Surabaya, Semarang, and the combined media market of


7
    Additional details about this measurement can be found in Olken (2005).


                                                          10
Surakarta and Yogyakarta. This can be seen in Figure 1, which shows television reception in

different geographic areas of East and Central Java (lighter shading indicates higher elevation,

and larger circles indicate better television reception). As can be seen in the Figure, the largest

circles, corresponding to the best television reception, are all in areas with direct lines of sight to

Surabaya, Semarang, Surakarta, and Yogyakarta.

         In all specifications, I therefore include district fixed effects, which captures 95% of the

variation in the distance between the subdistrict and the closest of the three listed major cities

above. (Districts borders are shown in black in Figure 1; subdistrict borders are shown in gray.)

Not surprisingly, as shown in Table 2, removing district fixed effects also removes 75% of the

variance from the number of channels variable. Including district fixed effects also removes most

of the relatively subtle variation in economic or social structure across East and Central Java. In

addition, in all specifications, I also include as control variables both the distance and travel time

from the village to the nearest district capital town or city, to further capture locational

differences within districts. 8

         Once proximity to the television transmission sites has been removed, the major

remaining determinant of television reception is geography. In particular, in some areas,

mountains block television transmission, whereas in others they do not. As villages in

mountainous areas may have different social structures from villages in low plains, I control for

elevation, which may be correlated with reception, though doing so does not substantially affect

the results. In all specifications, I include a control for the average elevation in the subdistrict;

controlling instead for a flexible spline of elevation to capture non-linear effects of elevation

produces similar results.

8
  In addition, I have also verified that all of the results in the paper are robust to including a quadratic of the distance
from the center of each subdistrict to the closest of these three major cities – Surabaya, Semarang, or Surakarta /
Yogya – to further capture differences in distance to the major cities within the district.


                                                            11
         Table 3 examines whether, once district fixed effects are removed and elevation is

controlled for, the number of television channels appears unrelated to other, presumably

exogenous, village characteristics. Specifically, I report the results of the following OLS

regression:

    NUMCHANNELS sd = α d + X vsd δ 1 + δ 2 ELEVATION sd + ε vsd                                         (1)

where v represents a village, s a subdistrict, and d represents a district. NUMCHANNELS is the

average number of channels reported by all TV-owning households (except those who also own

a satellite dish) surveyed in the subdistrict, αd are district fixed effects, ELEVATIONsd is the

average elevation in the subdistrict, and Xvsd is a set of other village characteristics – log adult

population, the log number of hamlets in the village, the mean years of education of adults in the

village, and the village poverty rate, and the distance and travel time to the nearest city. Standard

errors are adjusted for clustering at the subdistrict level.

         The first column of Table 3 shows that, after controlling for district fixed effects and

elevation, the number of channels received appears weakly negatively correlated with the

number of hamlets in the village and with average education levels. The p-value from a joint test

of all village characteristics (log adult population, log number of hamlets in the village, the mean

education of adults in the village, distance and travel time to nearest district capital, and the

village poverty rate) is 0.12. As shown in columns (2) and (3), even these weak correlations are

driven by a few outliers on the television reception variables. In column (2), I drop the highest

and lowest subdistrict in terms of TV reception (after having removed district means) – i.e., I

drop 2 subdistricts out of 155 in the sample. 9 In column (3), I further drop the highest and lowest


9
  These two subdistricts really are outliers -- the lowest subdistrict in terms of number of channels received is 3.5
standard deviations below the mean, whereas the second-lowest subdistrict is only 2.6 standard deviations below the
mean. Similarly, the highest subdistrict is 3.9 standard deviations above the mean, whereas the next highest
subdistrict is only 2.4 standard deviations above the mean.


                                                         12
2.5% of subdistricts in terms of television reception, which increases the P-value on the joint F-

test to 0.56. To be conservative, I focus on results where I restrict the sample to this third sample

(i.e., the sample in column (3) of Table 3) where the number of channels variable appears

empirically unrelated to these other village characteristics, though I have verified that the results

in the paper are similar (and, in fact, even stronger statistically) if these outlying subdistricts are

included in the sample as well. 10

        Given these results, it therefore seems reasonable to treat this variation as exogenous with

respect to social capital. With the exception of purchasing satellite dishes (which are extremely

limited, as discussed below), there is little villagers can do to increase reception. As concerns

about reverse causality are limited, and as just demonstrate the residual variation in television

reception appears orthogonal to other village characteristics, I use observed television reception

as the main independent variable in the paper, controlling in all specifications for district fixed

effects and the village controls examined in this section.


3.2. Identifying the role of topography directly
       Although I have argued that the residual variation in television reception must be due to

geographic idiosyncrasies, I have not yet provided direct evidence that this is the case. In this

section, I use a physical model of electromagnetic signal propagation, combined with data on the

locations of television transmitters and the topography of East and Central Java, to specifically

isolate that part of television reception that is due to the topography between villages and

television transmission locations.

        In the absence of mountains, air, or other factors, the strength of electromagnetic signals

declines proportionally with the inverse square of the distance between the transmitting and


10
  Another robustness check is to examine the relationship between number of channels and land values; in results
not reported, I find that number of channels received and land values are uncorrelated.


                                                       13
receiving location. In practice, the decay rates of television and radio signals are a much more

complex function of the mountains that block signals, diffraction caused by the air, and the

curvature of the earth. As shown in Figure 2 (reproduced from Ellington et al 1980), the

strongest signals are received in areas with direct lines of sight to the transmitter. If mountains

block sight lines, signals can diffract around the mountains to some extent, but they will be less

powerful than if the receiver had a direct line of sight. The degree to which this diffraction takes

place, and thus the strength of the signals that can be received behind mountains, depends on the

frequency of the signal (higher frequencies diffract less). As illustrated in the right section of

Figure 2, in the presence of multiple mountain peaks these diffraction patterns can become quite

complex.

         To calculate the impact of topography on actual transmission patterns, I use the Irregular

Terrain Model (Hufford 2002), a modified version of the Longley-Rice model of electromagnetic

propagation over the Earth’s surface (Longley and Rice, 1968). The model takes as inputs the

geographic location and height of the transmitting and receiving antennas, as well as the

frequency of transmission and several characteristics about the surface and air. The model uses

GIS software, combined with elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (NASA

2005), to look up the topography between the transmission and reception points. I also obtained

the geographic coordinates of each village in the sample, as well as of each television

transmitter. 11 For each village - television station pair, I use the ITM model to calculate the

actual signal loss between the village and each of that television station’s transmitters throughout

East and Central Java. I then subtract the signal loss from the television station’s transmission


11
  I take the center of the village as the geographic coordinate of the village. For the transmitters, when the specific
mountain or location of the transmitter was specified, I used that location; if not, I use the coordinate of the center of
the village where the transmitter was located. When heights or signal powers of transmitting towers were missing, I
used the values from similar-sized stations located in similar areas.


                                                           14
power to obtain, for each village-transmitter pair, the predicted signal power a receiver would

get. For each village-channel pair, I take the maximum of these predicted signal powers in that

village across all transmission towers as the “predicted signal strength” of that channel in that

particular village.

        This “predicted signal strength” captures both the effects of topography as well as the

facts that some villages are simply closer to transmission locations than others. To isolate the

effect of topography, I do an analogous exercise, also using the ITM model, to get the “predicted

free-space signal strength” for each channel in each village, i.e., the signal strength that would

have obtained in that village if there was a direct line of sight between the transmitter and the

receiver. By controlling flexibly for the “predicted free-space signal strength” of each channel, I

can isolate the variation in signal strength that is due only to topographical idiosyncrasies and the

curvature of the earth.

        To examine whether the model of signal transmission accurately predicts television

reception, Figure 3 shows the relationship between predicted signal strength and actual reception.

For each channel, I plot the results of a Fan (1992) non-parametric locally-weighted regression,

where the dependent variable is whether the respondent reports that they can receive a particular

channel and the independent variable is the predicted signal strength (labeled “Power” in the

Figure). To parallel the construction of the number of channels variable above, the sample is

limited to those households who own a television. The dashed lines indicate bootstrapped 95%

confidence intervals, where the bootstrap resampling is conducted at the subdistrict level to

account for clustering at the subdistrict level. Figure 3 shows a strong, positive relationship

between predicted signal strength and the number of households who report being able to receive

the channel. This upward sloping relationship appears for all channels except RCTI and Indosiar,




                                                 15
and suggests that with the exception of these two channels (which have nearly universal

coverage anyway), the signal strength data does, in fact, strongly predict actual television

reception. 12

         Given that the model accurately predicts television reception, the next question is

whether there is significant statistical power to identify the residual impact of television using

only the variation in signal strength caused by topography. To investigate this, I estimate the

following model:

                                        (
NUMCHANNEL S sd = α d + ∑ β 1i SIGNALvsdi + β 2i SIGNAL2vsdi + β 3i FREE vsdi + β 4i FREE vsdi
                                                                                          2
                                                                                                                )
                                    i                                                                               (2)
                          + X vsd δ 1 + δ 2 ELEVATION sd + ε vsd

where i represents a channel, SIGNAL represents the predicted signal strength of channel i in

village v, and FREE represents the predicted free-space signal strength of channel i in village v

(i.e. what the signal strength would have been if there was a direct line of sight between the

transmitter and receiver). I include the square of the signal strength variables to capture the

potential non-linear effects visible in Figure 3. As in equation (1), I cluster the standard errors by

subdistrict. In all specifications, I continue to include district fixed effects and all of the village

covariates used in Table 3 above, including distance to nearest city and elevation. Since the

television stations are positioned primarily to capture the major media markets in the cities, once

I control for the free space loss and village elevation, which rural villages receive reception is

driven largely by the happenstance of topography. The coefficients on SIGNAL and SIGNAL2 in

equation (2) capture precisely this effect.



12
   An interesting question is why the data for RCTI and Indosiar does not follow this pattern. Indeed, given the
transmitter locations and power data reported to the Indonesian Department of Information and Communications,
one would not predict nearly as broad coverage as these stations appear to have. One possibility is that these stations
have extra transmitters not reported to the government, or operate their transmitters at a higher-than-approved power
level, though I have no direct evidence that this is the case.


                                                          16
         If I estimate equation (2) without the FREE variables and without district fixed effects,

the F-statistic on a joint test of the SIGNAL and SIGNAL2 variables is 17.03 (p-value < 0.01),

which confirms that the ITM model is doing an accurate job predicting television reception. If I

add district fixed effects, the F-statistic falls to 5.81 (p-value < 0.01), and when I add the FREE

variables in addition to district fixed effects, the F-statistic on a joint test of the SIGNAL and

SIGNAL2 variables is 2.15 (p-value < 0.01). 13 These lower F-statistics are not surprising given

that, as shown in Table 2, district fixed effects alone capture 75% of the variation in television

reception. However, they do raise potential concerns about weak instruments (although weak

instruments tends to bias the results towards the OLS results, whereas the IV results below tend

to be substantially larger than the OLS results, suggesting that weak instruments is not a major

problem).

       There are advantages and disadvantages to using only the variation from the ITM model to

analyze the impact of television reception. The advantage of this approach is that it allows me to

precisely identify the exact source of the variation in television reception I am using. It also may

potentially help correct for measurement error in the number of channels variable. The

disadvantage of this approach is that it discards other potentially valid variation in reception that

is not captured in the ITM model. For example, reflections off buildings and air quality affect

television transmission, and these factors are not captured in the ITM model. Furthermore, the

information on transmitter locations and signal strength provided by the Indonesian Department

of Information and Communications may not be entirely accurate, making the instrument less

than a perfect predictor of reception. Given all these factors, in the remainder of the paper, I


13
   These F-statistics are conservative, in the sense that I have chosen the level of clustering that produces the
smallest F-statistics. If I cluster at the district level, an even higher level of aggregation (with 30 districts), the F-
statistics are substantially higher, at 9.5 (with district fixed effects but without controlling for FREE and FREE2) and
8.00 (with district fixed effects and controls for FREE and FREE2).


                                                           17
report two sets of results – one set of results using the full residual variation in number of

channels received (as in Section 3.1), and one set of that isolate the effect of topography by using

SIGNAL and SIGNAL2 as instruments for the number of channels received, controlling for

FREE and FREE2. I focus my discussion on the results using the full residual variation, viewing

the second set of results as a useful complement.


3.3. Impact on Media Use and Ownership
      Having explored the determinants of reception, the next question is whether better

television reception is associated with more time spent watching TV and listening to radio. I

focus on the total number of minutes spent watching TV and listening to radio, since villages that

receive better television reception may also receive better radio reception. 14 I estimate the

following OLS regression:

     MINUTEShvsd = αd + β NUMCHANNELSsd + Yhvsd γ + Xvsd δ + εhvsd                                           (3)

where h represents a household, MINUTES is the number of minutes per day spent watching

television and listening to radio, Y is a vector of household controls (gender, predicted per-capita

expenditure, and whether household has electricity), X is the vector of village controls used in

Table 3 (including elevation and distance to nearest city), and αd are district fixed effects. 15 Note

that while I include all of the village level covariates in Table 3 in all regressions, the results are

similar if they are not included. I estimate this regression via OLS at the household level, and

adjust the standard errors for clustering at the subdistrict level.

14
   I do not have independent data on how many radio channels the households receive, so it is not possible with the
data to separately identify their effects; even if I did have data on radio reception, the two types of signals are likely
to be collinear in any case.
15
   Note that one of the household controls is per-capita expenditure. This is not actual expenditure (which was not
measured), but rather predicted per-capita expenditure, where the prediction is based on the household’s assets. (See
Olken 2006 for more details on predicting expenditure from assets in this context.) In the version of predicted per-
capita expenditure I use in this paper, I do not include ownership of television, radio, or satellite dish in the
expenditure prediction equation. Note also that for all household-level equations, the ‘number of TV-channels’
variable is an average of all households in the subdistrict except the household in question, to avoid mechanical
biases that this might introduce.


                                                           18
         The results, using the full residual variation in reception, are presented in column (1) of

Panel A of Table 4. They show that each additional television channel that people in the

subdistrict can receive is associated with an extra 10 minutes per day spent watching television

and listening to radio, about a 5 percent increase from the mean level. In columns (2) and (3), I

re-estimate equation (3) separately for minutes per day spent watching TV and for minutes per

day spent listening to radio. The results suggest each additional channel of television that can be

received leads to an additional 4.3 minutes of television watching per day and an additional 5.5

minutes of radio listening per day. 16 As discussed above, the positive effect on radio is not

surprising, given that radio and television signal reception are likely highly correlated. Since I

cannot separately identify the impact of reception on television and radio, for the remainder of

the paper, I therefore interpret the effect of television reception as the total effect of greater

media exposure – i.e., the extra 10 minutes that a respondent spends each day watching

television and listening to radio.

       In Panel B of Table 4, I present the results using the television transmission model to

isolate the impact of topography. Specifically, I re-estimate (3), adding FREEivsd and FREE2ivsd

as control variables (to control for loss in signal strength that would have occurred had there

been a direct line of sight between transmission towers and receivers) and using SIGNALivsd and

SIGNAL2ivsd as instruments for NUMCHANNELS. The results are broadly consistent with the

results in Panel A, with larger but less precisely estimated coefficients. In particular, the Panel B

results show that each additional television channels is associated with a statistically significant

23 minutes of additional television watching per day, as opposed to the 10 minutes per day in

16
   Note that the sample includes all households, including those that do not own televisions, because television
ownership is potentially endogenous and also because many people who not own televisions watch television at
friends’ or relatives’ houses and still may listen to radio. In practice, however, I find that the effect of additional
channels on television watching comes almost entirely from those households that own a television (results not
reported).


                                                            19
Panel A. This increase in coefficients is consistent with the presence of measurement error in the

number of channels received variable. The Panel B results also suggest that about three-fourths

of this increase is due to increases in time spent listening to radio, as opposed to just over one-

half estimated in Panel A.

       A natural question is whether better quality television reception leads to a change on the

extensive margin of television ownership. In column (4), I estimate the same equation, where the

dependent variable is whether the household owns a television. To simplify interpretation of

coefficients with binary dependent variables, throughout the paper I report results from linear

probability and linear IV models; results are qualitatively similar with Probit and IV Probit

models except where explicitly noted. Column (4) shows no effect of television reception on

television ownership, which suggests that the impact of more channels is only on the intensive

margin of television watching, rather than the extensive margin of television ownership.

      If over-the-air television reception is poor, wealthy households can use an alternate, much

more expensive technology – satellite dishes. These are quite rare in rural Java – only 2.1 percent

of the sample owns a satellite dish – so they are unlikely to substantially mitigate the overall

effect of poor television reception on the village. However, if the television reception variable

really is capturing the quality of over-the-air television, we would expect that households where

over-the-air television reception is better would be less likely to purchase satellite dishes.

Column (5) of Panel A shows that this is, indeed, the case – each additional channel of television

reception is associated with a 0.8 percentage point decline in the likelihood of owning a satellite

dish. Somewhat puzzlingly, however, the results in Panel B give results of the opposite sign,




                                                  20
though this is likely due to problems with the linear probability IV model with fixed effects when

the probability of the dependent variable being 1 is very small. 17


4.     Impacts on Social Capital

4.1. Participation in Social Groups
      The first measure of social capital I examine in this paper is participation in social

groups. This was the primary measure used by Putnam (1993), and it has in many ways become

the canonical measure of social capital in the literature. Overall, as discussed above, a typical

village with 2,600 adults has 179 groups of various types, and a typical adult participates in

about 1 meeting each week.

         Table 5 investigates the impact of better television reception on the number of social

groups and the frequency with which they meet. As in Table 4, I present both results using the

full residual variation in number of channels received (Panel A), and results that use the

television transmission model to explicitly isolate the effect of topography (Panel B).

         In Panel A I estimate the following equation via OLS:

     LOGGROUPSvsd = αd + β NUMCHANNELSsd + Xvsd δ + εvsd                                                    (4)

Column (1) of Panel A of Table 5 shows the results, where the dependent variable,

LOGGROUPS, is the log of the total number of social groups in the village. I estimate this

regression in logs, controlling for the log adult population and log number of hamlets, to allow

the baseline number of groups in the village to vary flexibly with the size and structure of the

village. The regression includes district fixed effects and the same set of village-level controls

used in Table 3 above, and clusters standard errors by subdistrict. The results suggest that adding

an extra channel of television – or about one standard deviation on the de-meaned television

17
   In fact, if I re-estimate Column (5) using Probit and IV Probit models, I obtain virtually identical estimates for the
OLS specification in Panel A, but the coefficient IV specification in Panel B, while still positive, is no longer
statistically significant (p=0.47).


                                                           21
variable – is associated with 7.2 percent fewer groups existing in the village. As with the

previous analysis of media use in Table 4, the results in Panel B using the ITM model show

larger effects, which though less precisely estimated are still statistically significant.

         An alternative measure of participation considers not just the number of groups, but the

frequency with which they meet and the number of people that attend each meeting. This

represents the intensity of social interactions in the village. To examine this, Column (2) of Table

5 presents the results from re-estimating equation (4) where the dependent variable is the log of

the total number of times each adult in the village attended a group meeting in the last 3 months.

The results show that each extra television channel is associated with 11 percent lower

attendance at meetings per person over a 3 month period. Once again, the point estimates in

Panel B are even larger, though given the increased size of the standard errors they are no longer

statistically significant.

         To gauge these magnitudes, it is useful to compare these estimates with the estimated

impact of television reception on media usage reported in Table 4. In Panel A of Table 4, we saw

that each additional channel was also associated with about 10 minutes of additional time spent

watching television and listening to radio per day. Combined, this adds up to about 15 hours of

additional time spent watching television and listening to radio over a 3 month period. If we

assume that each group meeting takes an average of 2 hours, the comparable estimates in Panel

A of Table 5 suggest that each additional channel was associated with about 2.4 fewer hours

spent at meetings over a 3 month period. 18 Combined, these two estimates suggest that each hour

spent watching television or listening to radio results in a reduction of about 0.16 hours



18
  To see this, note that a typical village adult attends 11 meetings over a 3 month period, and each additional
channel of television reduces this by 11 percent. So 11 meetings * 2 hours / meeting * -.11 change = -2.42 hours in
meetings per 3 months.


                                                         22
participating in social activities. 19 Doing the analogous exercise using the coefficients from

Panel B of both tables yields a very similar estimate – each hour spent watching television or

listening to radio results in a reduction of about 0.14 hours participating in social activities.

         To investigate whether there is a differential impact of media exposure on different types

of groups and organizations, I re-estimate equation (4), splitting the dependent variable

separately by non-religious and religious groups. On average religious groups make up only 21

percent of the number of groups in the village, but represent 41 percent of attendance at group

meetings. This is because these religious groups, which tend to be various types of Koran and

religious study groups, meet quite frequently. The results, presented in Table 6, show substantial,

robust declines in both the number non-religious groups and the frequency of participation in

such groups. In results not presented in the table, I further decompose these non-religious groups,

and find that the largest single effect is coming from groups associated with local village

government, which consists of volunteer labor for public goods maintenance (called gotong

royong in Indonesian), neighborhood associations, and school committees. Other types of groups

also show declines; only health and women’s groups to not seem to be affected. 20 For religious

groups, the evidence is more mixed, with the results showing smaller, and generally not

statistically significant, declines.

         Finally, as shown in the last two columns, there appears to be a decline in rotating

savings and credit mechanisms (ROSCAs), a very common form of small scale savings

mechanism in developing countries (Besley, Coate, and Loury 1993). Many groups in Java

involve a ROSCA as part of their regular meetings. Overall, the number of groups that include a
19
   Since the total time budget does not change, it would be interesting to know what other activities are crowded out.
Unfortunately, since the data do not contain complete time diaries, this question cannot be answered using this data.
20
   One reason women’s groups may show a smaller effect is that women’s media consumption is less elastic with
respect to the number of channels available; re-estimating equation (3) interacting the number of channels with
gender shows that women watch television and listen to radio only about 6 additional minutes per day for each
additional channel they can receive, as compared to 10 minutes per day for men (results not reported).


                                                         23
ROSCA as part of their regular meetings declines by 15-27 percent with each additional

television channel in the village, and participation in such groups declines by 20 percent with

each additional channel. Since ROSCAs are a potentially important savings mechanism for

villagers, this suggests that the decline in social capital may have productive costs as well.

       Thus far, I have only examined participation in organized social groups. However,

television and radio may be associated with substitution from participation in organized social

groups to more informal gatherings at houses of friends. For example, one might imagine that

people would gather at the home of a friend to watch television. To investigate this, I use data

from the household survey, in which respondents were asked to report on social visits to and

from friends and neighbors over the past week. In results not reported here, I find that, if

anything, these reported social visits also seem to decrease in areas with better television

reception, although the results are not statistically significant. This suggests that the reduction in

participation in social organizations represents a net decline in social capital, rather than merely a

substitution from one form to another.


4.2.    Trust
        In addition to the work on participation in social groups, the literature on social capital

has also focused on a second, very different measure of social capital – trust. For example,

Knack and Keefer (1997), in their cross-country study, find that economic growth is associated

with greater self-reported trust, rather than participation in formal social organizations, and La

Porta et al. (1997) find self-reported trust is associated with greater judicial efficiency and less

corruption. In both of these studies, the trust question people examine is the question from the

General Social Survey and World Values Survey, which asks: “Generally speaking, would you

say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?”

Glaeser et al. (2000) and Karlan (2005) show that these self-reported answers predict real


                                                  24
economic activity; in particular, they are correlated with trustworthy play in the trust game and

with repayment rates for microcredit.

        I therefore examine whether increased media exposure affects answers to this self-

reported trust question. In addition to asking the question for ‘people in general,’ the household

survey also asked the same trust question about a variety of other groups, including people from

the same neighborhood, from the same village, the government, the President of Indonesia, and

so on. I define the TRUST variable as a dummy equal to 1 if the respondents say that they would

generally trust a person, and 0 if they say that that you can’t be too careful in dealing with

people. I then re-estimate equation (3), using the individual responses to the TRUST question as

the dependent variable.

        The results are presented in Table 7. The results in Panel A of Table 7 show that

increased media exposure is associated with declines of about 4 percentage points – or 16

percent from the mean level – in the percent of respondents responding affirmatively to the trust

question. Interestingly, the responses appear similar – declines of 2-4 percentage points – when

more specific trust questions are asked about the respondents’ willingness to trust other groups,

even though the means of the trust variables vary quite considerably, from a low of 26% trusting

‘people in general’ to a high of 72% trusting the village head. The groups which see the smallest

decline in being trusted is ‘people who live in your neighborhood,’ which declines by a

statistically insignificant 1.7 percentage points, and surprisingly, the President of Indonesia,

which declines by a statistically insignificant 1.8 percentage points. The results in Panel B are

qualitatively similar and larger in magnitude, as with the results presented in previous tables.

Interestingly, the fact that the change in trust levels is essentially irrespective of who the

respondent is being asked to trust is consistent with the findings of Glaeser et al. (2000) and




                                                  25
Karlan (2005) that the trust question measures the respondent’s own trustworthiness, rather than

the degree to which the respondent trusts others, although this does not explain the differences in

means between these variables.

         The fact that the two different measures of social capital I examine – trust and

participation – both show similar effects provides confirmatory evidence for the effect of

television and radio. Moreover, the fact that there is an effect on trust suggests that the impact of

television and radio on social capital are not due only to the mechanical effects of a time budget

constraint – television and radio exposure appears to change attitudes as well.


5.   Governance
       The previous sections showed a clear relationship between exposure to television and

radio and social capital, whether measured as participation in social groups or as measured by

trust. This section explores the second half of the social capital equation – the suggestion by

Putnam (1993) and others that lower social capital is associated with worse governance. In

particular, I focus on governance surrounding the road projects that were being built in the

villages at the time the data was collected. 21 I examine three measures of governance in the

projects – attendance at village level meetings that planned and monitored construction, the

quality of discussion at those meetings, and ultimately the percentage of funds used in the project

that could not be accounted for by an independent engineering team. For each of these measures,

I examine whether or not increased television reception, which we have seen is associated with

lower levels of social capital in the village, is associated with worse outcomes.




21
   Another natural variable to examine would be voter turnout, as in Gentzkow (2006). However, turnout in
Indonesia is so high (in part as a holdover from the Soeharto era, when voting was effectively compulsory) that there
is almost no variation in this variable. In fact, in my sample 99% of respondents reported voting in the most recent
national parliamentary elections.


                                                         26
         An important question, of course, is the validity of the implicit exclusion restriction that

television and radio reception affects governance only through the channel of its effects on social

capital. At higher levels of government, this is unlikely to be the case, as the media may have a

direct effect on governance beyond the effect on social capital discussed here. For example,

increasing the population’s access to news reports may provide incentives for politicians to

change their behavior (e.g., Stromberg 2004). For the level of governance examined here –

village level road construction projects – this direct effect is unlikely to be present, as television

and radio news reports are largely national in scope and extremely unlikely to cover village

events. Nevertheless, it is possible television may have other effects on governance besides those

through the social capital channels. As a result, while the reduced form estimates of the impact of

television and radio media exposure on governance are well identified, interpreting the results in

this section as identifying the causal effect of social capital on governance is more speculative.

         As discussed above, survey enumerators attended four meetings in each village

associated with the road project – one meeting at which the road project was planned, and three

meetings at which the village had to approve of how the village had spent the funds on the road

project. These meetings were open to the public, and attendance at these meetings was observed

directly by the project enumerator, who circulated an attendance list and noted who on the list

spoke during the meeting. 22 To estimate the impact of media exposure on attendance at the

meetings, I re-estimate a version of equation (4), where each observation is a village meeting. I




22
  As described in Olken (2005), experiments were conducted in which additional invitations to these meetings were
distributed in some villages, and in other villages anonymous comment forms were distributed along with these
villages. These treatments were randomly assigned within subdistricts, so their presence will be orthogonal to the
number of television channels received and other pre-determined village characteristics. Nevertheless, in Table 8 I
control for dummies for the experimental treatments interacted with which type of meeting it was, and in Table 9
below I control for dummies for the different treatment groups. I also control for whether a subdistrict was randomly
assigned to receive external audits of the road project.


                                                         27
include dummies for which type of meeting it was, interacted with the experimental treatments

discussed above.

        The results are presented in Table 8. The results, in both panels of Table 8, suggest that

each additional television channel is associated with a decline of about 2.5-5 percent in the

number of people attending a meeting, though the Panel B estimate is not statistically significant.

This is slightly smaller, but of the same order of magnitude, as the declines in attendance at other

types of group meetings discussed above. I classify all those who attend as either ‘insiders’

(members of the village government, the project implementation team, or other types of informal

leaders in the village) or ‘outsiders’ (everyone else). Somewhat surprisingly, the lower

attendance associated with media exposure appears more pronounced among insiders than

among outsiders, with the Panel B results actually showing increases in outsider attendance. One

possible explanation, consistent with the earlier findings, is that there are simply fewer ‘insiders’

in total in villages with greater media exposure, as some people spend more time watching

television and listening to radio instead of becoming deeply involved in village government.

        Second, I investigate whether television and radio has an effect on the quality of the

discussion at the meetings. In column (4), I show that even though there are fewer people

attending the meetings, there is no statistically significant reduction in the number of people who

talk at the meetings. In columns (5), (6), and (7), I further examine alternative measures of the

quality of the discussion at the meetings. Column (5) examines the number of problems or issues

that were discussed at the accountability meetings. 23 The point estimate in Panel A suggests that

villages with more media exposure have slightly less discussion at meetings, with fewer

problems or issues being raised, although this effect is not statistically significant and the effect


23
  A “problem” was defined as the topic of any substantial discussion other than the routine business of the meeting;
the median problem reported in the data was discussed for 7 minutes.


                                                        28
does not appear at all in Panel B. Column (6) focuses on whether any corruption-related

problems were discussed, and finds no effect of media exposure. 24 Similarly, Column (7) finds

that there is no effect on the probability of a serious response being taken to resolve a problem at

a meeting. 25 Overall, these results suggest that while television and radio exposure affected the

quantity of participation in the meetings, it did not measurably affect the quality of discussion at

the meetings.

         The third measure of governance I examine in ‘missing expenditures’ from the road

project. As discussed in Section 2.3 above, ‘missing expenditures’ is the difference in logs

between what the village claimed the road cost to build and what an independent team of

engineers estimated it cost to build. The coefficients are therefore interpretable as percentage

point changes in the share of expenditures that could not be accounted for by the independent

engineering estimate.

         The results from estimating equation (4) with missing expenditures as the dependent

variable are presented in Table 9. As in Table 8, in addition to district fixed effects and a set of

village level controls, this specification also includes dummy variables for the experimental

treatments (audits, invitations, and comment forms). I examine four versions of the missing

expenditure variable – missing expenditures in the road project, missing expenditures in the road

project and the ancillary projects that accompanied it (including culverts, retaining walls, etc),

the discrepancy in prices in the road project (i.e. the difference between the unit prices reported

by the village and the unit prices the surveyors found in their independent price survey), and the


24
   The enumerator recorded each problem or issue that was discussed at the meeting, and coded whether the problem
was potentially corruption-related or not.
25
   “Serious response” is defined as agreeing to replace a supplier or village office, agreeing that money should be
returned, agreeing for an internal village investigation, asking for help from district project officials, or requesting an
external audit. Although the probability of these actions being taken is low overall, Olken (2005) reports that the
experimental intervention of introducing anonymous comment forms led to a statistically significant increase in
these actions being taken.


                                                           29
discrepancy in quantities in the road project (i.e. the difference between the quantity of materials

reported by the village and those measured by the engineers).

        The results in both panels of Table 9 show no relationship between television reception

and missing expenditures. In fact, in three of the four specifications, the coefficient is actually

negative (and in one case statistically significantly so) – i.e., more television reception, and

hence lower social capital, is associated with fewer missing expenditures, rather than more. This

is inconsistent with the cross-country evidence, which tends to show a negative correlation

between average levels of trust and social participation and corruption (La Porta et al. 1997,

Bjornskov 2004), though as discussed above, considerable caution is needed when interpreting

the reduced form results on the impact of television reception on corruption as being about the

effect of changes in social capital. These results are, however, consistent with the experimental

evidence presented in Olken (2005), which showed that increasing participation in the

monitoring meetings through an experimental intervention also had no statistically significant

impact on missing expenditures from the road project.


6.   Conclusion
       In this paper, I use variation in the number of television channels households can receive

due to the topographical features of rural Java to explore the relationship between television and

radio and social capital. I show that this variation in television reception appears to be plausibly

exogenous with respect to the variables of interest here, and that that villagers in areas with

better reception are likely to watch more television and spend more time listening to the radio.

On average, each additional channel of television reception is associated with 10 additional

minutes per day spent watching television and listening to the radio.




                                                  30
        I find a substantial impact of better television reception on participation in social groups.

On average, the main results suggest that each additional channel of television reception is

associated with 7 percent fewer social groups existing in the village, and with each adult in the

village attending 11 percent fewer group meetings. These estimates imply about 0.16 fewer

hours spent in social activities for each hour spent watching television or listening to radio. I find

particularly strong effects of reception on community development activities, neighborhood

associations, and informal savings associations. I also find that greater television reception is

associated with lower levels of participation in village development meetings, and with lower

levels of self-reported trust.

        I then examine the relationship between television and radio exposure and governance.

Despite the impact of better television on attendance at village meetings, I find no impact on

what happens at the meetings. I also find no relationship at all between television reception and

‘missing expenditures’ in the road project. Together, these results suggest that that to the extent

that television reception leads to plausibly exogenous variation in social capital, this does not

translate into worse governance outcome, at least as measured here.

Notes: Each observation represents one meeting. Columns (1) – (4) include both the planning meeting and the three accountability meetings; columns
(5) – (7) include only the accountability meetings. All regressions are estimated with linear probability models with kabupaten fixed effects, as well as
fixed effects for meeting type interacted with experimental treatment. Robust standard errors in parentheses, adjusted for clustering at subdistrict level.
All specifications include district fixed effects and the village covariates from Table 3. In Panel A, number of TV channels is average number of
television channels households in the subdistrict can receive, excluding the respondent’s own answer. In Panel B, number of TV channels is the same as
in Panel A, but instrumented with SIGNAL and SIGNAL2 for each channel. Panel B also includes FREE and FREE2 for each channel as control
variables. Sample drops highest and lowest 2.5% of subdistricts in terms of number of channels, as in column (3) of Table 3; results are similar if entire
sample is included.

Notes: Background colors indicate elevation, where green represents sea level and yellow indicates mountainous areas. Each blue
circle represents one subdistrict (kecamatan), where larger circles indicate more TV channels and smaller circles indicate fewer
channels. Circles are only shown in the subdistricts included in the sample. Dark black lines indicate district (kabupaten) borders; faint
gray lines indicate subdistrict (kecamatan) borders. Note that all regressions in the paper include fixed effects for each district
(kabupaten).

Figure 2: The Physics of Broadcasting




Notes: The dotted areas denote reduced reception; the hatched areas show regions of almost nil reception. In mountain to the left, the area of nil
reception is caused by the tight angle of refraction required. In the mountain to the right, the area of nil reception is caused by double-refraction off
the primary and secondary peak. Figure and description reproduced with permission from Ellington et al (1980).

Notes: Each graph shows the results of a Fan (1992) regression for a particular television channel. The independent variable is the
predicted signal strength of each channel (in decibels below the power required for top quality signal reception), and the dependent
variable a dummy for whether a given household reports that the channel can be received in his or her village. Sample is limited to
those household who own a television. Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are shown in dashes, adjusting for clustering at the
subdistrict level.
