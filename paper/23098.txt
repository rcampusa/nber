The Distortionary Effects of Incentives in Government: Evidence from China's ‚ÄúDeath Ceiling‚Äù
Program

                                          ABSTRACT

We study a 2004 program designed to motivate Chinese bureaucrats to reduce accidental deaths.
Each province received a set of ‚Äòdeath ceilings‚Äô that, if exceeded, would impede government
officials' promotions. For each category of accidental deaths, we observe a sharp discontinuity in
reported deaths at the ceiling, suggestive of manipulation. Provinces with safety incentives for
municipal officials experienced larger declines in accidental deaths, suggesting
complementarities between incentives at different levels of government. While realized
accidental deaths predict the following year's ceiling, we observe no evidence that provinces
manipulate deaths upward to avoid ratchet effects in the setting of death ceilings.

1      Introduction
The tradeo between motivating agents and distorting their eorts is central to incentive

design. As emphasized in Holmstrom's (1979) classic model, this tradeo is starker for dicult

to observe objectives, or those subject to manipulation.          In these cases weak or even at

rewards may be optimal.         Holmstrom's insight in turn has implications for the design and

assignment of tasks within an organization (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991), and even the

assignment of tasks across organizational types: when viewed through the lens of incentive

design, non-prots or government may be seen as a contractual solution to the problem of

imperfect observability (see, for example, Easley and O'Hara (1984) and Dixit (1997)).

     Against this backdrop, there has been an active debate - both in academic and policy

circles - on the appropriateness of using performance incentives in bureaucracies. Such prac-

tices are common: teachers are assessed based on standardized test-based value-added scores

(Springer et al, 2014), FBI agents on the production of intelligence leads (Gulati et al, 2009),

and police ocers on arrest and crime data (Eterno and Silverman, 2012). In each of these

settings, much of the debate has centered around the extent to which outcome metrics are

manipulable.

     We study the eect of incentives on the manipulation of reported outcome measures in

the context of a high-stakes safety targeting program implemented by the Chinese central

government.        Our primary contribution is to show that, even under conditions where ex

ante one would expect that gaming of the outcome measure would be dicult or impossible,

there is still widespread manipulation. This naturally raises concerns about the ever wider

application of incentives in bureaucracies.

     In February 2004, the State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS), the national safety

regulatory authority, announced a set of province-level safety targets, or `death ceilings,'

across a range of causes of accidental death, mostly workplace related.
                                                                               1 SAWS' head at the

time, Wang Xianzheng, described the measure as a response to a worrying increase in severe

(and well-publicized) accidents in the preceding months. The new rules targeted a reduction

in accidental deaths of 2.5 percent for 2004, with further targeted reductions expected in

future years. Provinces were required to develop their own plans for getting accidental deaths

below the mandated ceilings, and to provide quarterly reports on workplace deaths for a

number of industries (e.g., coal mining; agriculture; manufacturing), and also total deaths

from trac accidents or re.

     SAWS publicized provinces' quarterly death numbers by category, along with their year-

end ceilings, via news releases that were in turn published in the national newspaper, the

People's Daily.     At least supercially, these reforms were a resounding success: deaths across

                                                    2
all categories fell by about 45 percent between 2005 and 2012, an annual decline of nearly 8

percent.

     When we delve more deeply into the public data, however, we show that it was very

likely that manipulation of death statistics played a signicant role in the reduction. Using

McCrary's (2008) test for manipulation of a running variable applied to the distributions of

year-end deaths-to-ceiling ratios in each category, we nd a clear discontinuous drop in the

density function around one, an indication of `sorting' of reported deaths around the ceiling.
2   By contrast, we observe no discontinuity for cumulative deaths through the rst three

quarters of the year.

     We next examine cross-province heterogeneity in hitting safety targets, in particular ex-

amining the eects of No safety, no promotion (NSNP) laws for local regulators. As noted

above, the 2004 SAWS directive gave considerable discretion to individual provinces in im-

proving safety performance. Starting in 2005, provinces established rules for disaggregating

province-wide death ceilings into municipal-level ceilings, and some went as far as tying local

ocials' promotion to hitting their (local) targets. We show that the provision of local in-

centives via NSNP was eective in reducing province-level deaths (though this relationship is

signicant only at the 10 percent level). This is consistent with a complementarity between

local and province-level governments in achieving safety targets.

     If reducing deaths below government-mandated ceilings comes in part through manipula-

tion, it raises the question of why we observe any discontinuity at all: why not manipulate

reported deaths       well   below the ceiling? There are a number of potential explanations. First,

death misclassication may be costly, and plausibly convex in the extent of manipulation,

an issue we discuss in Section 2.2. Further, if ceilings are set as a function of past reported

deaths, reducing deaths by too much could lead to a ratchet eect with ever-lower ceilings

as a result of performing too well in the present year. As evidence that ratchet eects would

present a concern to ocials, we show that year-end deaths are an extremely strong predictor

of the following year's ceiling, even after accounting for lagged ceilings. Despite this, we do

not nd any evidence that ocials went so far as to manipulate reported deaths                     upward   to

secure more favorable ceilings in future years, based on a comparison of pre- versus post-

2004 growth rates in industrial workplace deaths. The bottom quartiles of the pre-2004 and

post-2004 distributions are virtually identical, so that provinces were just as likely to have

very low reported deaths before and after the advent of death ceilings.                   The distributions

diverge primarily at positive growth rates, consistent with strong pressures to report declines

in accidental deaths in the post-2004 period.

     We conclude our overview of the results by emphasizing that we cannot rule out a real

    2 For   severe accidents and re deaths, we observe relatively modest discontinuities. We argue these cate-
gories may be less subject to manipulation and/or control.




                                                        3
response from the imposition of death ceilings. While the sharp discontinuities around the

ceiling that we document in our main analysis are most easily reconciled with responses to

safety incentives via manipulation rather than real safety improvements, we cannot distinguish

whether safety improvements occurred as well. The clustering in reported deaths we observe

around 90 to 100 percent of the ceiling could be the result of a real drop in high-mortality

outcomes (accompanied by manipulation to ensure the nal gure remains below the ceiling).

It could alternatively be reconciled with a pure manipulation story with an audit probability

that is greater just below the ceiling. In the absence of reliable data on industry output or

safety expenditures, we cannot fully rule out these types of alternative explanations.

   Our paper contributes to the large body of work within economics on the consequences

of high-powered incentives, and the challenges of incentive design more broadly. While this

work has primarily involved for-prots (see, for example, Oyer (1988) for a classic study on

the topic), we examine the increasingly common phenomenon of high-powered incentives in

governmental and/or non-prot settings. Recent work in economics has considered specically

how these incentives lead to manipulation of reported outcomes, in China and elsewhere. Most

notably, Young (2003) argued that China's extraordinary GDP growth during the last two

decades of the twentieth century was the result of distortions in reporting.
                                                                                     3 Two recent papers

study manipulation of outcomes around a threshold to study agents' responses to incentives,

using approaches similar to ours. Duo et al (2013) analyze the manipulation of pollution

data by third-party auditors of industrial plants in Gujarat, while Dee et al (2011) study

whether New York City teachers alter students' Regents' exam scores (the authors attribute

manipulation to teachers' desires to help their students rather than concern for their own

evaluations).

   The results we present have particular relevance for the literature on the tradeos asso-

ciated with decentralization. As Mookherjee (2006) emphasizes in his survey on decentral-

ization in hierarchies, central administrators may have limited knowledge of local conditions,

and their interests may diverge from those of local ocials. This may lead to moral hazard

that undercuts the benets of local knowledge.            Our study brings this tradeo into sharp

relief in an empirically important setting, given its distorting eects on reporting behavior.

A further benet of decentralization emphasized by more recent research is that it allows

higher-level policymakers to assess bureaucrats' quality (Mookherjee, 2015). Our results sug-

gest, however, that the tournament model of government promotion may be undermined if

performance metrics are subject to manipulation. In our context reported safety outcomes

may still contain some information - as in the earnings management literature, a manager

only misses the mandated target if his organization is in truly terrible shape (Burgstahler

and Dichev, 1997) - but it does not provide the ne-grained signal that would be obtained in

  3 Others   have strongly disputed these claims. See Chow (2006) and Holz (2014).




                                                     4
the absence of manipulation.

     Finally, our ndings also may serve as a counterweight to the trend toward increased

focus on evaluation based on observable performance metrics, providing a cautionary tale

on the complications associated with the use of metrics-based evaluation and incentives for

hard-to-measure outcomes that are subject to manipulation. The outcome we focus on here

- accidental deaths - is one that is plausibly less subject to manipulation than many other

outcomes of social interest.

     In the next section, we provide background information on the safety reforms of 2004 and

an overview of the data. In section 3 we present our main results. We provide concluding

comments in section 4.




2      Background and Data
2.1 The death ceiling system in China
     On January 9, 2004, the State Council of China, the country's highest administrative

authority, issued a document whose title translates roughly as          Decision of the State Council on
Further Enhancing Work         Safety.4 In addition to re-emphasizing the importance of workplace
safety, the decision stated as an objective that by 2020, China's safety record should be

comparable to those of other middle-income countries.                The document also specied that

safety targets would need to be set at the national and subnational levels, starting in 2004.

Finally, the decision specied that beginning in 2004, provincial governments would have to

provide quarterly reports on accidental fatalities to the State Administration of Worker Safety

(SAWS), which in turn would publicize these reports. (SAWS is the country's workplace safety

regulator, reporting directly to the State Council.)

     As a response to the State Council decision, the Work Safety Commission of the State

Council issued a further directive,        Opinions on Setting up a Death Ceiling System,            which

provided a specic target of 2.5 percent for accidental death reductions nationally. Working
                                                                                                 5

with SAWS, the Work Safety Commission further set safety targets for each province in China,

providing ceilings for a variety of industries, including: Agriculture; Chemical production;

Coal mining; Construction; Fireworks; Railway; and Industrial, Non-coal mining, commercial,

and trade (IMCT). Additionally, ceilings were assigned by severity of workplace accident,

    5 The   Work Safety Commission is a unit of the State Council.   The Commision's director is typically a
vice-premier of China, and the chief ocer of SAWS serves a vice-director.      Other non-director members
are vice-ministers of other central government departments. The text of the Commission's opinion may be

                                                     5
including Severe (3 or more deaths) and Very Severe (10 or more deaths). Two nal categories

- which included both workplace and non-work fatalities in their totals - were also assigned

ceilings:   Road and Fire.      We conjecture that these were included because they are more

visible and salient to the general population than, say, fatalities due to poisoning or falls,

which are nonetheless the cause of a high proportion of accidental fatalities. Finally, a ceiling

was assigned for the overall number of deaths across all industries and categories (Overall).

   In practice, gures for a number of less prominent categories went unreported, and in

what follows we focus on the year-end ceilings in the eight categories where at least half of

province-year death totals and ceilings were available, including Overall; Agriculture; Coal

mining; Fire; Road; Railway; IMCT; and Severe.                Given the non-independence of these

categories (e.g., many severe accidents take place in coal mining, and all subcategories sum

to the overall gure) and potential serial correlation, we will allow for province-level clustering

of standard errors.

   Starting in the second quarter of 2004, SAWS collected reported deaths and death ceilings

on a quarterly basis, which were then published in the         People's Daily.    In the program's rst

year, most categories went unreported, so we begin our sample in 2005.                   SAWS stopped

publishing reported deaths and death ceilings at the end of 2011, and the gures were not

reported in the rst and third quarters of 2007 and 2008, as well as the rst half of 2005. We

requested information on reported deaths and ceilings from SAWS for the dates that were not

publicly available, and received supplemental data for 2007 and 2008, as well as the fourth

quarter of 2012.
                    6 While the target system remained in place at the time of writing, data

were no longer reported publicly after 2012. Thus, our data include quarterly observations

from 2005 through to the end of 2011, as well as the year-end total for 2012.

   As part of their eorts at meeting province-level ceilings, some provinces adopted No

safety, no promotion (NSNP) policies that made promotion of local government ocials

contingent on meeting the death ceilings set for their region by the provincial government.

Guangdong was the rst to adopt this policy in 2005, while others followed suit only several

years later.   As of June 2015, 20 provincial authorities, out of a total of 31, had adopted

NSNP policies.     Note that NSNP applies to local ocials - that is, it is set by             provincial
ocers to evaluate     local   ocials.   We list the dates of the passage and implementation of

NSNP policies for each province in online Appendix Table A1, which shows that a number

of NSNP laws were passed during our sample period of 2005 - 2012. This will allow us to

exploit within-province variation in identifying the eects of NSNP on accidental deaths.

  6 SAWS    stated that, since gures were not published in the rst two quarters of 2005 and 2012, they
could not provide the information to us, and we cannot infer from their response whether they simply do not
have the information, or have it but are unwilling to share it. For the third quarter of 2012, SAWS did not
collect accidental death information from provincial governments, because of the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China.




                                                    6
2.2 Anecdotal evidence of gaming of deaths
    From the outset, the death ceiling system was controversial, with manipulation of reported

gures thought to be widespread. An in-depth report published in the                  Southern Weekly    (Hao,

2007), for example, described one common (albeit costly) means of manipulating road deaths:

If an individual was severely wounded in a trac accident, it would be classied as a road

accident (and count toward the road ceiling) only if the individual died within seven days. If

the death occurred eight or more days after the accident took place, it would be classied as

a natural death. This created an incentive to keep accident victims alive for at least a week,

especially when close to the year-end ceiling.

    For workplace deaths, problems around ambiguities in death classications led SAWS to

issue a     Note on problems in identifying workplace accidents           on October 9, 2007.
                                                                                                   7 The note's

issuance provides evidence in itself of the inevitable discretion involved in classifying deaths.

It claries, for example, that accidental deaths at unlicensed rms should be classied as

workplace deaths. However, as pointed out by Su (2011), the note had no legal authority, and

the various liberties in classifying deaths that it describes likely continued after its publication.

    Deaths were also thought to be under-reported by the local governments responsible for

providing these gures to provincial ocials (Shanghai Law Journal, 2007), following the Chi-

nese adage that translates as Village tells a lie to town, town then tells another lie to county,

until the lie reaches the state council.
                                               8 As we argue below, the imposition of No safety, no

promotion laws may have helped to better align the interests of ocials at dierent levels of

government, thus improving their ability to collude on reported deaths.



2.3 Data
    We hand collected province-level quarterly reported deaths and corresponding death ceil-

ing data for each category from the          People's Daily       for 2005 - 2012. For most categories in

most years, we have data for all quarters except, as noted in Section 2.1 above, the rst two

quarters of 2005 and the rst three quarters of 2012.

    Reported deaths in category         c   in province    p   and year   y   is denoted by  Deathscpy . For
quarterly data we add an appropriate sux to the variable.                     For   example, Deaths_Q3cpy

denotes     cumulative   deaths through to the end of the third quarter. We similarly append the

relevant sux when a set of analyses focus on a specic category (e.g.,                 Deaths_IM CTpy ).
    Our main interest will be in analyzing the relationship between reported deaths and

Journal, May 30, 2007.

mandated death ceilings, denoted by              Ceiling cpy , at the province level. Our main outcome of
interest is the deaths-to-ceiling ratio,         Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy , where ocials faced an incentive
to keep this ratio at less than or equal to one. In Online Appendix Table A2, we provide a

matrix showing, by year, the categories where year-end data on                     Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy were
available.

     Table 1 provides summary statistics on annual deaths,                Deathscpy     , as well as the deaths-

to-ceilings ratio,       Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy .     Road deaths constitute nearly 80 percent of deaths

in the Overall category.            Given that Road and Fire are the only non-workplace categories

included in Overall, a ratio of 80 percent is in line with comparable gures from other coun-

tries. (For example, the ratio of trac deaths to workplace deaths in the U.S. is about eight

to one. )
           9

     The gures in Table 1, when put in per capita terms, also suggest that under-reporting was

likely a serious problem even in the earliest years of the death ceiling program. For example,

there were 98,738 reported Road deaths in 2005, or about 7.6 per 100,000 population, about

half the trac fatality rate in the United States in that year.
                                                                           10 Such dierences are one reason

that public health researchers question the veracity of China's safety gures. A 2011 article

in   The Lancet       argued that the problem of misrepresenting trac fatality gures has increased

since 2004, precisely the period we consider in our analysis (Alcorn, 2011). Aggregating across

all categories of workplace fatalities, the ocial gures in Table 1 imply a Chinese workplace

death rate in 2005 of 1.8 per 100,000 population, virtually identical to the U.S. rate.
                                                                                                        11 Given

the two countries' very dierent levels of development, this is again suggestive of large-scale

under-reporting.

     We next dene an indicator variable              N SN Ppy    to denote the province-year observations

when No safety, no promotion regulations were in place; it takes on a value of one starting

in the year following the passage of NSNP regulations (though our results are not sensitive

to this treatment of the year of implementation).

     For most accidental death categories, data are unavailable outside the public reporting

window of 2005 - 2012. However, deaths in the IMCT category are available through a variety

of sources for 1993 - 2003, excluding 1998. The 1993 - 1997 IMCT death data were collected

from the China Labor Yearbooks; 1999 from the China Economics and Trade Yearbook; and

2000 - 2003 from China's Worker Safety Yearbooks.
                                                                    12 These data will allow us to compare

Also note that the province of Chongqing was classied as a municipality of Sichuan Province prior to 1997,
so we have one observation less for these early years.

the distributions of changes in fatalities pre- and post-2004 for the IMCT category.

      Finally, province-year level economic indicators such as GDP per capita are drawn from

the   Regional Economy Database         at GTA, a Shenzhen-based data vendor which provides -

nance and economics databases on Chinese listed rms and the Chinese economy. We also

obtained the real GDP growth targets that each province set for itself via government annual

reports. For each province these are available online. We combine the GDP growth targets

with realized real GDP data (GDP Growthpy ) to dene              GDPpy /GDP T argetpy ,      the ratio of

actual to targeted (real) GDP. This ratio provides an output-based analog to our measure of

safety compliance (though for economic output a high value indicates greater compliance).

3.1 Discontinuities around the targeted number of deaths
      We begin with a series of graphs showing of the distribution of            Deathscpy /Ceiling cpy ,
disaggregated by death category    c, and test for manipulation around the SAWS-mandated
ceiling (recall that p indexes province and y indexes year). We use McCrary's (2008) test for a

discontinuity in the distribution of     Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy     around a value of one, the threshold

for meeting the safety target. McCrary's test involves estimating local linear regressions of

the density on either side of the cuto (in our case, around one), and using a Wald test to

check whether the predicted number of observations at the cuto is the same for the two local

linear regressions. If the predicted frequencies are dierent, it suggests that sorting around

the cuto is non-random.
                              13

      In Figure 1, we show a histogram of       Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy      for overall province-level ac-

cidental deaths, with a bin width of 0.077, chosen to match the bin width that will be used

by McCrary's density test. A discontinuity is clearly discernable at one. Figure 2 presents

the McrCrary density test, providing the local linear regressions on either side of 1 (as noted

previously with a bin width of 0.0077). The gap between the density estimates on either side

is -2.72, and a z-statistic of the dierence of -4.23 (p-value < 0.001).            In Online Appendix

Figure A1, we provide graphs of the local linear regressions and discontinuity estimates for

Deathscpy /Ceiling cpy     for all other death categories.       In every case there is a statistically

signicant discontinuity at one.        Notably, the discontinuity is smallest for Severe accidents

(workplace accidents that lead to three or more fatalities) and Fire, which are plausibly less

amenable to reclassication or concealment

 13 This   test has been employed primarily in research using regression discontinuity methods, where it
is used to assess whether the distribution of the running variable is smooth around the cuto, which
is necessary for the RD design to be valid.       The Stata code to implement the test is available at
http://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/ accessed on June 2, 2016.

     In Online Appendix Figure A2 we show histograms for each category of the distribution

of   Deaths_Q3cpy /Ceiling cpy ,         i.e., reported accidental deaths at the end of the third quar-

ter as a fraction of the year-end ceiling. In contrast to the year-end reported death ratios,

the third-quarter distributions are smooth.             We can, for example, reject the presence of a

discontinuity at 0.75 at least at the 10 percent level for all categories except coal, where we

obtain a p-value of the dierence at the cuto of 0.028 - an even sharper discontinuity occurs

at a value of 1 for coal, however, as many observations are already close to the year-end

threshold by the end of Q3. Thus, the discontinuity in the distribution of accidental deaths

emerges only in the nal quarter of each year.



3.2 Eect of local incentives
     We next assess whether provinces are better able to improve their safety records (and

meet their safety targets) after implementing No safety, no promotion (NSNP) incentives

for local ocials.       We do so by comparing death rates and probabilities of meeting safety

targets, pre- versus post-NSNP. Owing to the relative sparseness of the data, we perform this

analysis for the pooled sample of all accidental death categories.
                                                                                  15 We use a specication

that controls for category-year and category-province eects, as well as the extent to which

a province achieved its targeted level of economic growth:




 I(Deathscpy > Ceiling cpy ) = Œ≤1 ‚àóN SN Ppy +Œ≤2 ‚àóGDP py /GDP T argetpy +¬µcy +œÖcp +cyp                        (1)



The outcome variable,         I(Deathscpy > Ceilingcpy ),       is an indicator variable denoting whether

deaths in category-province         cp   exceeded the ceiling in year     y;   in all specications we cluster

standard errors at the province level. This addresses potential within province-category au-

tocorrelation, as well as the covariance within each province-year grouping that results from

the non-independence across categories.

     In column 1 of Table 2, we show the results of specication 1, including only year, province,

and category xed eects. We nd a weak negative relationship (p-value of 0.21) between

NSNP       and the deaths-to-ceiling ratio. While we present results for the full sample, we are

most interested in provinces that implement NSNP rules during our sample period, which

allows for within-province variation in the province-year variable                  N SN Ppy .    In column 2

accidents in coal mining. See, for example, Graft in China Covers Up Toll of Coal Mines, (    New York Times,
April 10, 2009) for a discussion of a company's attempt to coerce victims' families into maintaining silence
about a multi-fatality mine collapse.      Yet the very fact that these were reported on in the media is some
indication of the diculty in concealing such information.
  15 For   the high-death categories of overall accidental deaths and road deaths, there is not a single case that
Deathscpy > T argetcyp in province-year observations with N SN P = 1, though there are only 3 failures       (of
66 data points) for N SN P = 0 observations, so it is hard to draw strong conclusions from this result.




                                                        10
we limit the analysis to provinces that implemented                  NSNP    incentives during 2005 - 2011,

which we refer to as the           V ar(N SN P ) > 0      sample.    The coecient on          NSNP   doubles in

magnitude to -0.089, though it is not signicant at conventional levels (p-value of 0.11).

In column 3, we include            GDP py /GDP T argetpy ,      which controls for the extent to which a

province has met its GDP growth target. The coecient on              N SN Ppy increases to -0.098 (p-
value 0.09); interestingly, the coecient on          GDP py /GDP T argetpy is negative, which suggests
that provinces which meet (self-imposed) GDP growth targets also tend to meet the central

government's safety targets.            In column 4 we add year" industry and province" industry

xed eects, which has very little impact on the estimated coecients. While the coecient

on    N SN Ppy       is noisily measured across all specications, its economic magnitude is large,

indicating that NSNP laws are associated with a 10 percentage point decrease in the likelihood

of exceeding the year-end ceiling. Given the average probability that                Deathscpy /Ceiling cpy >
0   of 0.19 for     N SN P = 0     province-year observations, this implies a 50 percent reduction in

the likelihood of exceeding the ceiling as a result of NSNP incentives. (Our regression results

are roughly in line with the simple pre-versus-post dierence in means for provinces that

implement NSNP incentives during our sample period, of 0.19 versus 0.12.)
                                                                                               16

      In Figure 3 we show the cumulative density functions for Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy across all
categories, disaggregated by   N SN P status. Interestingly, for the portion of the distribution
below Deathscpy /Ceiling cpy = 1, the cdf for N SN P = 1 province-year observations is virtu-

ally identical to that of the cdf for N SN P = 0 observations, before diverging just below one.

This suggests that         NSNP     incentives reduced deaths primarily by lowering the likelihood of

exceeding safety targets - conditional on meeting the target, the two distributions are quite

similar.



3.3 Death targets and ratchet eects
      If manipulation is responsible for much of the discontinuity around safety targets, it nat-

urally raises the question of why bureaucrats do not manipulate gures downward to an even

greater extent. Convex manipulation costs and, relatedly, higher audit probabilities for sus-

piciously low values, are possible reasons that reported deaths might not be manipulated far

below the ceiling.         There must be at least some cost to manipulation under some circum-

stances, else provinces would never exceed their ceilings at all (though we have no record

of government investigations related to manipulation beyond the non-binding guidelines re-

ported in Section 2.2). If ocials wish to avoid attention or scrutiny, there would again be

    16 If   we employ the continuous measure of safety compliance,   Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy ,   the estimated coe-
cients on      NSNP   are all negative, though none is signicant at the 10 percent level. This is consistent with
NSNP acting rst and foremost to motivate provinces to get deaths gures below their ceilings, but the data
are far too noisy to distinguish between a general decline in deaths and a drop only below the ceiling.




                                                          11
at least some check against extreme manipulation.

    A further explanation may be due to concerns over a ratchet eect, where good perfor-

mance - beating the death ceiling by a wide margin - induces a harsher (i.e., lower) ceiling

the following year. Ratchet eects may appear in any setting where next period's target is

a function of this period's performance. In Figure 4, we show the raw relationship between

log(Deathscpy‚àí1 )       and   log(Ceilingcpy ).   Observations line up on or near the 45 degree line.

(The very strong one-to-one relationship persists even if we remove province, category, and

year eects.) The same pattern could be generated by persistence in target-setting, for exam-

ple, given the high concordance between targeted and reported year-end deaths. In Table 3,

we attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities by including both     log(Deathscpy‚àí1 )
and log(Ceiling cpy‚àí1 ) as regressors in predicting the current target log(Ceilingcpy ). As shown

in columns 1 and 2, each variable is highly signicant when included on its own (p-value <

0.001). When both are included together in column 3, the coecient on               log(Ceiling cpy‚àí1 ) de-
clines by about 85 percent, whereas the coecient on             log(Deathscpy‚àí1 ) is virtually unchanged
(though its standard error increases somewhat, the p-value remains below 0.001). In column

4 we allow for the interaction of lagged reported deaths and              I(Deathscpy‚àí1 > Ceiling cpy‚àí1 ),
to account for the possibility that bureaucrats, recognizing concerns over ratchet eects, un-

tether the link between reported deaths and next year's ceiling at lower deaths-to-ceiling

ratios. The interaction term is small in magnitude (-0.006) and statistically insignicant; we

thus nd no evidence that the relationship between lagged deaths and current ceiling changes

as lagged deaths move below the ceiling.

    If the static impact of death ceilings is a downward manipulation of reported deaths (as

documented in the rst part of our paper), dynamic concerns may create incentives for up-

ward manipulation in order to secure a more favorable ceiling the following year.
                                                                                                       17   We

attempt to shed some light on the question of upward manipulation by comparing the pre-

and post-2004 distributions of accidental deaths.              As we note in the Section 2.3, the only

category where pre-2004 death gures are available is IMCT. If upward manipulation takes

place to secure favorable future targets, we expect that the accidental death growth rate,
                        Deathscyp
%‚àÜDeathscpy =           Deathscpy   ‚àí 1,   would have relatively few low values for post-2004 data, as

compared to the pre-2004 data. In Figure 5, we show the cumulative density functions for

the pre- and post-2004 distributions of           %‚àÜDeaths.     Interestingly, the two functions are near-

identical over the bottom quartile of their distributions; if death gures had been inated as

a result of ratchet eects, we would have expected the post-2004 distribution to be shifted

to the right at low levels. We thus nd no obvious indication in the data of upward manipu-

lation in deaths in response to ratchet eect concerns. At about the 25th percentile, just as

  17 In   contrast to downward manipulation, we know of no clearcut anecdote of fabricated deaths to articially
raise the accidental death count closer to the ceiling.


                                                        12
the growth rate approaches -10 percent, the lines diverge sharply, a natural eect of death

ceilings being set relatively close to lagged values of   Deaths (and hence the ceiling constraint
starting to bind at this level).




4     Conclusion
    We examine the consequences of a high-stakes incentive program that aimed to improve

safety practices in China.   We argue that the sharp discontinuities in the deaths-to-ceiling

distributions across all accident categories are strongly suggestive of a downward manipulation

of reported deaths.

    Our ndings may be seen as a cautionary tale on the use of incentives based on performance

metrics in bureaucracies. However, in the absence data on actual accidental deaths or credible

data on industrial production, there are several caveats in considering the policy implications

of our results. First, it is dicult to assess whether the incentive program we study had     any
real eect on safety (as distinct from the eect on manipulation) or economic activity. This

limits our ability to make a general assessment of the welfare eects of the program. Nor can

we say denitively whether the program was suboptimal in its design: that would require a

full-blown cost-benet assessment that included assumptions about what safety might have

been like under alternative regimes.

    We note nally that it is not clear whether the death ceiling program failed to achieve

its objective, from the perspective of the implementing authority, as that would require a

further set of assumptions about the China State Council's objective function. China's cen-

tral government is plausibly interested in dissent minimization.        If this is accomplished by

reporting year-on-year death reductions across all accident categories, regardless of realities

on the ground, then performance improvements through manipulation may be a perfectly

acceptable result.

    These caveats nonetheless suggest a number of ways forward. First, more detailed data

or a dierent setting may allow for a more ne-grained distinction between manipulation and

eort as the source of reported improvements.        More importantly, we may be able to use

the choice of incentives to better understand the functioning and objectives of governments

themselves.

category at the province-level. The second set of columns provide summary statistics on the year-end ratio
of reported deaths to the government mandated death ceiling. The IMCT category includes workplace
deaths in industrials, non-coal mining, commercial, and trade; severe accidents are deaths in accidents that
involve three or more fatalities. Other death categories are self-explanatory (see text for details).

Notes: Standard Errors clustered at the province level. All analyses use province-year level data for the
sample period 2005-2012. The dependent variable in all columns an indicator variable denoting whether
Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy (strictly) exceeds one. NSNP is an indicator variable denoting whether the province
has passed ‚ÄúNo safety, no promotion‚Äù legislation by year y. See text for additional details on variable
construction and definitions. The V ar(N SN P ) > 0 sample is the set of 15 provinces that passed NSNP
legislation during the sample period 2005-2012 (and hence have within-province variation in NSNP). *

Notes: Standard Errors clustered at the province level. All analyses use province-year level data for the
sample period 2005-2012. The dependent variable, log(Ceilingcpy ) is the natural logarithm of province
p‚Äôs assigned death ceiling in category c and year y, while log(Ceilingcpy‚àí1 ) is the lagged value of this
variable. log(Deathscpy‚àí1 ) is the lagged value of the natural logarithm of reported deaths. I(Deathscpy >
Ceilingcpi ) is an indicator variable denoting whether reported deaths exceed the mandated ceiling in year
y ‚àí 1 . * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.

Notes: The figure provides McCrary‚Äôs density test for discontinuity in the distribution at 1, for the ratio of
overall reported accidental deaths to the government-mandated ceiling. The sample includes province-year
observations during 2005-2012.. The t-statistic for the significance of the discontinuity at 1 is listed just
below the graph. The t-statistic for the significance of the discontinuity at 1 is listed just below the graph.

Notes: Each line shows a cumulative density function for the ratio of reported deaths to government-
mandated ceiling, Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy . The solid line employs data from province-year observations
where ‚ÄúNo safety, no promotion‚Äù legislation had been passed (NSNP=0), while the dashed line employs
observations where such legislation was in place (NSNP=1).
            Figure 4: Relationship between lagged reported deaths and current death ceiling




Notes: The graph uses data from all category-year-province observations during 2005-2012. It shows the
relationship between the natural logarithm of reported deaths in year y ‚àí 1 and the natural logarithm of
the death ceiling in year y .

Notes: The graph depicts cumulative density functions for the annual change in accidental deaths, at the
province-level, for industrial, non-coal mining, construction, and trade (IMCT) for the years 1993-1997,
1999-2003, and 2005-2012. We split the sample by 2004, the year of implementation of death ceilings. See
Section 2 for details on the variable definition and sources.
