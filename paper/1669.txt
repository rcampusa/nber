                            The Changing Behavior of the
                          Term Structure of Interest Rates


                                     ABSTRACT


     We reexamine the expectations theory of the term structure using data at

the short end of the maturity spectrum. We find that prior to the founding of

the Federal Reserve System in 1915, the spread between long rates and short

rates has substantial predictive power for the path of interest rates; after

1915, however, the spread contains much less predictive power. We then show

that the short rate is approximately a random walk after the founding of the

Fed but not before. This latter fact, coupled with even slight variation in

the term premium, can explain the observed change in 1915 in the performance

of the expectations theory. We suggest that the random walk character of the

short rate may be attributable to the Federal Reserve's commitment to

stabilizing interest rates.

     The most prevalent explanation of fluctuations in the yield curve is

 the expectations theory, which posits that the slope of the yield curve

reflects the market expectation of the future change in interest rates.

Numerous studies, however, present evidence that the data are Inconsistent

with the joint hypothesis of the expectations theory and rational

expectations.1 Indeed, the rejections of the expectations theory date back

at least to Macaulay (1938, p. 33]. who pointed out the implications of the

theory but concluded that "experience is more nearly the opposite."

     Perhaps the most striking rejections use data at only the short end of

the maturity spectrum. Recently, Fain (1984], Jones and Roley (1903],

Hankiw and Summers (1984], and Shiller, Campbell, and Schoenholtz (1983]

all conclude that yields on Treasury bills of less than one year do not

obey the expectations theory. While stories of highly variable risk

premiums, changing asset supplies, or segmented markets might explain the

failure of very long—term yields to behave according to the theory, such

stories seem less plausible applied to the markets for three—month and

six—month bills.2

     Although the number of studies rejecting the theory Is large, the

results of these studies are not independent. Indeed, they examine almost

identical periods of history, primarily the 1960s and 1970s. the period

during which an active market in three—month and six-month Treasury bills

existed. It is reassuring that these studies reach the same conclusion.
                                  —2—

but confirmation requires examination of truly independent data.

     In this paper we examine the term structure of interest rates at the

short end of the •aturity spectru. for the period from 1090 to 1979. We

divide our sample into different monetary "regimes" to examine whether the

failure of the expectations theory is robust. Our goal is to identify the

conditions under which the expectations theory works badly and the

conditions, if any, under which it works well.

     In Section II we briefly review the expectations theory. The theory

posits that there are no expected profit opportunities. it implies that

the spread between the long rate and the short rate predicts the path of

the short rate.

     We discuss the data in Section III. Prior to the founding of the

Federal Reserve System, the National Monetary Commission in 1910 collected

extensive data on interest rates and banking. We have extended the data on

three—month and six—month time rates through 1958. This data set provides

an opportunity both to reexamine findings based on more recent data and to

expand our understanding of the earlier historical period. We argue that

it provides a good data set with which to examine the expectations theory.

     In Section IV we present tests of the expectations theory both

with the older data and with Treasury bill data from the 1960s and 1970s.

The results are surprising. While we confirm the failure of the

expectations theory using recent data, we find that the expectations theory

works •uch better during some previous monetary regimes. In particular,

for data prior to the founding of the Federal Reserve, the slope of the

yield curve has substantial predictive power for the path of the short
                                     —3—

 rate.

         In Sections V and VI we propose an explanation for the difference in

the perfor.artce of the expectations theory in the different periods. If

the term premium varies through time, then the expectations theory will be

rejected using the standard test. The extent of the failure, however,

depends on the variance of predicted changes in the short rate. We argue

that the relative success of the theory with the data from before the

founding of the Fed is attributable to the greater predictable changes in

the short rate.

     In Section VII we discuss the role of the Federal Reserve and its

relation to the performance of the expectations theory. With the creation

and increased activism of the Fed, changes in the short rate became less

predictable and the expectations theory performed more poorly. We

speculate that the failure of the expectations theory using post—Fed data

may be due to the Federal Reserve's commitment to stabilizing interest

rates.

     We conclude in Section VIII by discussing the implications of our

results for the expectations theory of the term structure under recent

monetary and fiscal regimes.


                II. The Expectations Theory of the Term Structure


     In this section we briefly review the expectations theory for one—

period and two—period bills. Let rt be the yield on a one-period bill, and

let Rt be the yield on a two—period bill. The expectations theory posits that
                                          —4—


(1)       Rt • 9 +             Crt •

where   Et denotes the expectation formed at ti•e t. The current two—period
yield is an   average   of the current one—period yield and the expected one—

period   yield, plus a constant term premium, 9. The return from investing

in a two—period bill equals, up to a constant, the expected return from

investing sequentially in two one—period bills.4

      Equation (1) is easily rewritten as


(2)        (Etrt+j —     rt)    =   —2   9 +     2 (Rt —    rt).
The theory relates the expected change In the short rate, (Etrt+i —                 rt),   to

the slope of the yield curve, (Rt —            rt).   In other words, the spread between

the long rate and the short rate reflects the market's forecast of the path

the short rate will follow. The test of the theory entails examining

whether this forecast is a rational one, that is, whether the market's

expectations is correct on average. More formally, we write the realized

future short rate as the sum of the expectation and a forecast error:


(3)        rt+l =    Ert+i      +


where vt+l is orthogonal to information available at time t. Equation (2)

becomes


(4)



where, according to the theory, a — '-2 8 and $ — 2.               under the null

hypothesis, the     error   ter. in equation (4) is orthogonal to the right—hand
                                  —5—

side variables; ordinary least squares therefore produces consistent

estimates of the coefficients.


                                 III. Data


     We apply the test in the previous section to data from several monetary

regimes. Our first data set is on three—month and six-month Treasury bill

yields during the first week of the quarter from 19591 to 1979:2. As we

note above1 much research analyzes these data; we present results for this

period as a contrast to our results using data from 1890 to 1958. We end

this first sample in 1979 because the behavior of interest rates appears

substantially different since the Fed's announced change in operating

procedure in October 1979. In the last section, however, we return to

discuss the implications of our results for this alternative •onetary

regime.

     Our other data are on the time rates available at New York banks from

1690 to 1958. In 1910. the National Monetary Commission compiled these data

from 1690 to 1909 by tabulating them from the Financial Review, a periodical

that analyzed current financial market developments. We updated this series

to 1958 using the Review and the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, which

took over the Review in 1921. We examine in this paper the yields on

three—month and six—month time loans during the first week of the quarter.6

     We divide the period from 1B90 to 1956 into four regimes. The first

regime is from 1890:4 to 1914:4, which ends at the founding of the Federal

Reserve System. The second regime is from 1915:1 to 1933:4. This second

regime ends at the introduction of the New Deal banking reforms, which is
                                  —6—

also th. approximate end of the classical gold standard and the approxi.ate

beginning of Interest rate pegging. The third regime Is from 1934:1 to

1951:1, which ends at the Accord, the agree.ent between the Fed and the

Treasury Department that the Fed would no longer peg interest rates. The

fourth regime is from 1951:2 to 1950:4. ending at the time when an active

market in both three-month and six—month Treasury bills begins.7

     These time rates are the interest rates banks charged for loans of

fixed maturity. We believe these rates represent the equilibrium of a com-

petitive and large credit market, even at the begining of our sample.

First, lien York was the major financial center of this time, when there were

between 10,000 and 20,000 commercIal banks nationwide.8 Second, these

short—term loans were a primary loan instrument at the time. James 11976.

p. 61] reports that at the turn of the century most loans in bank portfolios

were short—term; maturities of greater than six months were rare. He also

reports [p. 643 that loans of fixed maturity were more common in New York

than loans without a definite payment period (demand loans). Thus, we are

studying in this paper the interest rates on a primary form of credit

during this period.

     The expectations theory as represented in equation (1) is essentially

an expected arbitrage condition. It states that, up to a constant, the

expected cost of rolling over one-period bills equals the expected cost of

rolling over two—period bills. This calculation is exactly the sort that we

would expect agents obtaining these time loans to make. Moulton [1918)

claims that at least 40 to 50 percent of unsecured loans in major cities

were renewed at maturity (p. 707]; more than 20 percent were used to finance
                                        —7—

fixed capital Investments [p. 646]. Presumably, these debtors would           decide
whether to roll—over short—term or longer—term loans on the basis of

expected cost——precisely the calculation underlying the expectations theory
of the term structure. It thus appears ! priori that the expectations

theory would be a good model for these time loan rates.


                       III. The   Predictive Power of the Spread

       We begin by estimating equation (4) for the data from the 1960s        and

1970s.    The    first column In Table 1   presents   the result, which is similar to
that in other studies. We find a coefficient on          the   spread that, although
positive, is insignificantly different from zero. Moreover, the coefficient
is significantly different from the theoretically predicted value of two; we
can reject the null hypothesis that it equals two at the one percent level.
The adjusted R—squared of 0.01 indicates that that the spread has negligible

predictive power. Contrary to the expectations theory, the slope of the
yield curve appears to contain no information about the path the short rate
will   follow.

       We next go back in time through the various regimes and perform
the same test. Table 1 contains the results. For the subsamples from 1915
to 195B, we obtain results surprisingly similar to that for the recent
sample.    The coefficient on the spread is always significantly different

from two and usually not significantly different from zero. The adjusted

R—squared Is always small. Thus, the slope of the yield curve appears to

exhibit no predictive power at any time since 1915.

       For the period from 1890 to 1914, however, we obtain very different
                                       —8—


results.    While the   coefficient   on the spread is still significantly

different from two,     it   Is three times as large as the one we   obtain   with

data    from the 1960s and 1970s and almost twice as large as that from the
period immediately after 1914. The adjusted R—squared of Q.40 Is an order
of   magnitude larger than any obtained with more recent data. Although data

from this period do not fully confirm the expectations theory, the slope of

the yield curve does contain substantial information on the path of the

short rate.

        The various data sets suggest different conclusions. Confirming many

previous studies, we find that recent data provide no support for the

expectations theory. A similar conclusion applies to the period from 1915

to 1958. Data from 1890 to 1914, however, suggest that expectations are an

important determinant of fluctuations in the yield curve. Our next task is

to explain this difference.

        Before turning to the explanation that appears successful, however, we

briefly discuss two possible explanations that are not consistent with the

data:

        (1) As Miron (1984] discusses, interest rates exhibit a seasonal

pattern prior to the founding of the Fed but essentially no seasonal pattern

starting in 1915. One might suspect that the high coefficient for the early

period is solely due to the seasonal pattern. We test this hypothesis by

examining the non—seasonal variation in interest rates, a task accomplished

by adding seasonal dummies to the equation. Inclusion of seasonal dumies

has little effect on the esti.ated coefficient on the spread, implying that

the relative success of the expectations theory is not wholly attributable
                                          —9—

to seasonal variation.

        (2) Another possibility is that the relative success of the

expectations theory Is due to the fact that there were major financial

panics in 1890. 1893, and 1907. One might argue that since the short rate was

only temporarily high, market participants should percieve this and make the

expectations theory work especially well. Separating the data into a

subsample including the panics and a subsample excluding them, however, does

not show any systematic difference in the performance of the expectations

theory.


                          V. The Role of Predictability


     The essence of the expectations theory is that the spread reflects

expected changes in the short rate. It might appear that a prerequisite for

testing the theory is that interest rates be expected to change at some

point during the sample. Further, one might think that the absence of

expected changes can explain a rejection of the theory. This is not exactly

true, however. If the expected future short rate always equaled the

current short rate, then equation (1) implies that the spread is constant.

If the spread were      constant,   the standard errors of the coefficients in (4)

would be    infinite.    Hence, the absence of predictability alone cannot

explain any statistically significant rejection of the theory.

     Suppose, however, that the term premium, 8, changed somewhat through

time. In this case1 if changes in the short rate were unpredictable, the

spread would always equal the term premium, 8•            Estimation   of equations (4)

would   yield   an estimate of 0    of   zero; with sufficient data, the hypothesis
                                   —10—

that $ equals two would be rejected. Hence, the absence of predictability

together with even slight variation in the term premium can in principle

explain an observed rejection.

    As in Mankiw and Sumiiers t19841, we can show formally how variation in

the term premium can bias downward the coefficient on the spread in equation

(4). If the correlation between et and Ettrt,j is p. then the estimate of

converges to



                      2 02(Ethrt+i) + 4   p a(EAr.1) u(e}
                             + 4   o2(e) + 4 p c(Ethrt+i} °(°t)

where a2(x) denotes the variance and a(x) denotes the standard deviation.

If the short rate is not at all predictable (a(Etsrt+i)=O), then the

coefficient is zero. Moreover, as the variance of expected changes in the

short rate approaches infinity. the coefficient approaches two, the value

predicted by the expectations theory. Only if p is greater than or equal to

zero, however, is the coefficient a monotonic function, as in Figure I. If

p is negative, the coefficient as a function of the predictability of the

short rate has the shape in Figure II; it first falls from the origin, then

rises above two, then falls again to asymptote at two.


                       VI. Evidence on Predictability


     The previous section suggests a natural explanation of the different

results for the various periods. In particular, it suggests that the high

value for the coefficient obtained for the 1890 to 1914 sample may be

attributable to a greater variance of predicted changes in the short rate at
                                  —11—

the turn of the century. To test this hypothesis, we examine a reduced—form

forecasting equation. We regress the future change in the short rate on the

current and lagged short rate and the current and lagged long rate. Table 2

presents the results.

     Even with the more general forecasting equation, the short rate shows

no predictable changes in any subsample since 1915. The adjusted R—squared

never exceeds 0.05. Furthermore, the F—statistic for the null hypothesis

that all the coefficents, except the constant, are zero is never significant

at even the ten percent level using the conventional critical value.9 This

forecasting equation suggests that the short rate is a martingale. In other

words, the best forecast of the future short rate during the recent samples

may have been the current short rate.

     As one would expect from Table 1. the short rate is substantially •ore

predictable in the 1890 to 1914 sample. The adjusted R-squared of the

forecasting equation is 0.41; the F—statistic is significant at the one

percent level using the conventional critical value. It appears that market

participants at the turn of the century would not have always expected the

short rate to remain at its current level.

     Table 3 presents a rough attempt to measure the extent of predicted

changes in the short rate. The top row gives the variance of the change.

It shows that the short rate was •ost volatile at the turn of the century.

The second row gives the variance of the Innovation of the forecasting

equation in Table 2. The third row of Table 3 gives the difference of these

first two variances, which is a measure of the variance in predicted

changes.10 It Indicates that the variance of predicted changes In the short
                                      —12—

rate is substantially greater for the 1090 to 1914 data than for any of the

other data sets. Moreover, the variance of predicted changes is very small

from 1934 to 1958, the period for which the coefficient on the spread in

Table 1 Is negative.

     Figure III displays the estimated coefficient from Table 1 together

with the estimated variance of expected changes from Table 3. This figure

vividly illustrates the high correlation across monetary regimes between

predictability of the short rate and the relative success of the

expectations theory.

     We find further evidence on predictability in the spread between the

long rate and the short rate. From equation (2), we see that, under the

assumption that p Is not too negative, greater predictable changes implies

more movement in the spread. That is. the larger is the variance of

(Etrt+i —   rt),   the larger Is the variance of (Rt —   rt).   This test also

confirms our proposed explanstion. Comparing the last line in Table 3 with

Table 1 shows that the variance of the spread moves closely with our

estimated coefficient.

     A simple univariate examination of the short rate also suggests that

there more predictable movements prior to 1915. Table 4 presents

regressions of the change in the short rate on the two lagged levels of the

short rate. Only for the earliest regime do we obtain a significant

coefficient. During the period from 1890 to 1914. when the short rate is

above Its mean by 100 basis points, one would expect a 5? basis point drop.

That Is, the short rate is mean—reverting. During any of the other regimes.

legged values of the short rate do not appear to provide significant
                                    —13—

information on the following change in the short rate.

     Thus, the evidence from the various regimes appears consistent with our

proposed explanation: The term premium varies somewhat through time. Since

1914. the short rate has been approximately a random walk; this term premium

therefore has dominated fluctuations in the slope of the yield curve. During

the period from 1890 to 1914, however, there were substantial predictable

changes in the short rate; thus expectations played a more important role in

yield curve fluctuations.



            VII. The Expectations Theory and the Federal Reserve


     The failure of the expectations theory using recent data is a

consequence of the random walk character of the short rate.11 A similar

conclusion holds for the period from 1915 to 1956. Our results with the

turn of the century data suggest that If the short rate had, during recent

experience, fluctuated in a more predictable fashion, the long rate would

have moved accordingly. In their study of the expectations theory using

recent data, Shiller, Campbell, and Schoenholtz [1983] conclude:



     The simple theory that the slope of the term structure can be used to
     forecast the direction of future changes in the interest rate seems
     worthless. Of course, some version of the expectations theory ought to
     appear in the data if the Federal Reserve were to create a large and
     predictable pattern of short—term rates. We merely claim that the
     theory Is useless for interpreting the data provided by recent history
     and that forecasting interest rates using the slope of the term stuc—
     ture will only be successful if there is a break in the historical
     interest rate pattern. (Emphasis added.)


Our examinination of data from 1890 to 1914. a very different monetary

regime, supports this conjecture.
                                    —14—

       Our results on the predictability of the short rate suggest at least

two questions: First, why was the short rate partly predictable from 1690

to 1914? And second, why was the short rate not at all predictable from

1915 to 1979?

       That the short rate was partly predictable at the turn of the century

is not surprising. James [1978, p. 142] documents that credit flows were

highly seasonal; interest rates also exhibited a significant seasonal

pattern. Moreover, during this period, there was no lender of last resort

that might stabilize interest rates in the face of financial panics or

other temporary fluctuations in credit demand. Thus, some changes in

interest rates during this period were transitory, making their path

somewhat predictable.

       That the short rate Decame a random walk after the creation of the

Federal Reserve and remained so throughout the period from 1915 to 1979 is

probably a result of Fed policy. During much of this period, the Fed's

announced policy was to stabilize (or even to peg) interest rates.     One

si.ple description of interest rate stabilization is


(10)        hrt+i   0;



that is. the change in the short rate is zero. The data, however, obviously

reject this characterization of the policy, since the short rate did change

throughout this period. A second, less restrictive description of Fed

policy is


(11)      Et £rt.1 s     0;
                                      —15—

 that is, the expected change in the short rate is zero. At each point in

 time, the Fed set the short rate at a level that it expected to maintain.

 Under this characterization of policy, while the Fed might change the short

 rate In response to new information, it always (rationally) expected to

maintain the short rate at its current level.

        It is of course difficult to judge whether equation (11) is a result of

deliberate Federal Reserve policy without an explicit model incorporating

the objectives and constraints of the Federal Reserve.     Explicit modeling
of this problem, however, could easily produce an equation such as (11).

Hall (1970] shows that individuals who desire to smooth consumption and who

face a linear stochastic budget constraint will make consumption a random

walk. We envision a Fed that desires to smooth interest rates but faces

some constraint or has other objectives as well, such as inflation or

output. Depending on the nature of the Fed's trade—offs, its optimal policy

may well entail making interest rates a random walk.

        If equation (11) does describe the policy of stabilizing interest rates.

and market participants knew it was the policy, then the short rate expected

by the market would always equal the current short rate. The spread,

(Rt —   rt).   would always equal the term premium, O. Fluctuations in the

spread would have no predictive power for the path of the short rate.    Thus,

the failure of the expectations theory with data from 1960s and 1970s, a

fact documented here and in many previous studies, may be an ineluctable

result of Federal Reserve policy during this period.12

                             VIII. Conclusions


     In this paper, we reexamine   the   expectations theory of the term

structure using data from different monetary regimes. In contrast to

studies using only recent data, we find support for the view that expected

changes in interest rates are reflected in the slope of yield curve.       We

concur with the conclusion that expectations do not play a key role in

understanding fluctuations in the yield curve from recent history. This

conclusion, however, may be an inevitable result of the policy regime that

was then in effect.

     Our explanation for the performance of the expectations theory assumes

small changes through time in the term premium. We do not, however, isolate

the underlying causes of these movements. Possibilities Include changes in

risk, changes In relative asset supplies, measurement error, and

expectations that are only near rational. The fact that the short rate has

been near a random walk for much of recent history implies that only a small

amount of such "noise" is necessary to generate the observed rejections of

the expectations theory.

     Our analysis focuses on the short end of the maturity spectrum. While

three—month and six—month interest rates provide perhaps the cleanest test

of the expectations theory, the relation between short—term rates and much

longer—term rates (such as those for twenty year bonds) is probably more

important for macroeconomic policy. It would be useful to extend our

results to the market for such long-term instruments.

     Our results have Immediate Implications for current policy discussions.
                                  —17—

First, since the Federal Reserve's announcement in October 1979, the

monetary authority has been less committed to stabilizing interest rates;

therefore, a more predictable pattern of short rates may emerge. If it

does, then the expectations theory may well appear again in the data, as it

did in the period from 1890 to 1914. Unfortunately, there is so far too

little data to test this conjecture.13

    Second, our results lend credence to the view that policies that would

cause future short rates to be higher have an immediate effect on long rates.

This effect is critical to the common claim that the expectation of

persistent Federal deficits is causing long—term interest rates to remain at

a high level. While It may be impossible to document this expectational

effect using recent data, our examination of historical data provides

substantial support for this view.

Notes


1.

     See,   for   example. Kessel (1965] and Shiner [1979). Flavin's (1983]

recent work casts doubt on some of these rejections.


2.

        For discussions of changing risk premiums and the term structure, see

Bodie, Kane and McDonald [1983) and Campbell and Shifler [1964). Friedman
[1977) discusses the role of relative asset supplies in determining the

slope of the yield curve.


3.

        Our working paper contains a data appendix.


4.

        We discuss this linearized version of the expectations theory. For a

discussion of the linearization, see Shiller, CampbelL and Schoenholtz

(1963). Note that we can equivalently write equation (1) as stating that

the expected one—period holding return on a two-period bill, 2Rt —   Etr+j,
equals the one—period yield. rt, plus a constant.


5.

        The rates are reported as a range, which is typically 12 to 25 basis

points in size. We use the •idpoint of the range.


6.

        We have also estimated the equations using monthly data, correcting the
                                        —22—

standard errors for the i.plied KA(2) residual. The results are almost

identical to those reported here. (While using monthly data appears to

triple the number of observations, the new data is clearly not independent

of the quarterly data. The increase in efficiency may therefore be small.)


7.

        Similar results are obtained If we split the data at other points in

time.


8.

        See James (1978, p. 25].


9.

        Dickey and Fuller (1981] show that larger critical values are generally

required to reject a unit root. Thus, the true significance level is likely

even less than it appears in Table 2.



10.

        The assumption of rational expectations implies that the covariance of

the expectation and the forecast error is zero. Therefore, we know that

Var(Art+i} =    Var(Et   Art,i) +   Var(forecast   error).


11.

        We use the ter. "random walk" informally. The data actually suggest

that the short rate is only a •artingale; it appears that the variance of

the innovation •ay be positively related to the level of the short rate.

This property of the higher moments, however, is not important here.

12.

      Whether the change in the short rate process is attributable to a

change in the real rate process or a change in the inflation process is a

topic for future research. See Barsky (1985) for one examination of the

changing stochastic process for inflation.



13.

      When we perform the tests of the expectations theory for the period

since 1979, we obtain standard errors so large that one can reject no

interesting hypothesis.
