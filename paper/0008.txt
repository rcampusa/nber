         In studying the impact of direct investment on the amount, direction,
and composition of international trade we have found that the multinational
firm fits uncomfortably into the usual theory of trade and capital move-
ments.    We attempt here to introduce the fact of the existence of multinational

firms    into the explanation of trade flows and particularly into           the long-

running   debate over the relations among factor       abundance,   factor   prices,

and   trade.*
         Our thinking about the operation of the international economy is
dominated by two sets of theories, one relating to commodity trade and
one relating to factor (particularly capital) movements. Factor propor-
tions theories explain the location of production and the movement of
commodities by differences among commodities in relative factor              requirements

and   differences among countries in relative factor abundance, and therefore
price, under the assumption that resources are immovable across national
borders. Theories of capital movement explain the flow of capital from
one country to another by differences in rateC of return.
         When we consider direct investment or, more generally, the opera-
tions of multinational firms, it becomes          clear that there is much that

cannot    be understood in   terms   of   either of these   sets of theories. For
example, while there may be      great potential returns to the investment of

capital    and various skills in Ruritanian oil exploration, such        capital and

skills may be unobtainable or extremely expensive for the Ruritanian

National Oil Company but readily available to a large international oil

company. And while there may be large returns to the investment of

technology and skills in the production of electronic equipment in

Ruritania, the cost of these factors may be very high for the Electronics

Company of Ruritania but quite low for a large American electronics

company. The existence of multinational firms may make possible a flow

of capital, and also of management skills, technical knowledge, and

marketing experience, that would          never   have been directed to native firms in

the   same industry, and   the    flow of resources may     in turn result   in trade
flows which wou&d not otherwise have occurred. Capital and other resources
might flow more readily from one country to another within an individual
enterprise than from one company          to   another within the sante country. The
multinational company may        then   make its   decisions on the   location of sales,
service, assembly, and manufacturing activities on much the same basis
internationally as it does within a single country, taking account of market
concentration,     transport cost       of both raw materials and finished products,

thecost of labor services, and the possibility of allocating different
phases of production to different locations. The multinational firm thus
introduces some new elements into the situation beyond the familiar ones
of resource endowment and rates of return. Hence, in seeking to explain the
location of production, the level of technology used at each location, the
use   of   productive factors, and the flow of trade and of resources, we must

take into account the effects of the ownership of productive facilities.
                                       —3—


      Why should the existence of the multinational firm have this effect?

Why would   the   factors not move, as portfolio capital or licensing of

technology,   in the absence of such firms? In the case of capital, the
reason is probably that the multinational' s cost for use anywhere in the
world is the cost to the parent corporation, to which the firm will add an
appropriate allowance for any special risks involved in investment in the
recipient country, rather than the higher usual cost to a native firm in
that country. The risk premium added by the multinational firm in its
internal calculations may be lower than that added by developed country
capital markets to the cost of borrowing by a native firm. The multinational
firm may face a lower risk of failure because it possesses complementary
technological factors of production, or because its affiliate has no liquidity
problems, or because it is in a stronger bargaining position vis-a-vis both
host country governments and buyers of its products. In the case of tech-
nology, acquisition in the form of equity capital inflow through the multinational
firm ay be a much lower—risk form of purchase for a recipient country than
licensing or purchase or other nonequity arrangements in which the purchaser
bears most of the risk. In acquiring      technology through   the multinational
firm the host country reduces risk by not taking on any fixed expenses of
purchase or rental, at the cost of losing the possibility of exceptional
gains. Similarly, other factors scarce in the receiving country's
economy might be cheaper for the multinational firm than for the native firm--
for example, knowledge about new technology, about sources of material inputs,
and market conditions around the world. If the crucial cost difference
is that between the expense of transferring resources within a firm and
the expense of transferring them between firms, the advantage of the
multinational firm is much like that of any large firm operating within a
                                      —4—

single market.1



       1
        For discussions of the nature of the multinational firm's advan-

  tages see, for example, Caves [1971] and Kind].eberger 969]. The issue

  is related to those raised in Coase L1937J.



      More   broadly, we can think of factor abundance and factor prices as
being characteristics not only of countries, as is customary in trade theory,
but also of companies. To the extent that inter-company differences in the
abundance and cost of resources outweigh inter—country differences in
determining the location of production we should expect capital-intensive
products to be manufactured not necessarily in capital—rich countries but
by capital-rich companies, and products requiring intricate technology or
high marketing skills by companies rich in those resources.
      What does this   view   of multinational firms imply for the location of
production? If we focus first on capital and labor and ignore, for the
moment, the role of natural resources and other factors of production, and
if we assume that labor (or, in some versions, unskilled labor) is the
expensive factor relative to capital in the United States, we would expect
that labor-intensive industries would locate outside the United States.
american firms operating abroad in these industries would have no advantage
                                            —5—



over   native   firms as   producers. By contrast, American        affiliates would
have an advantage over other foreign firms           in more   capital—intensive

industries because they could raise capital cheaply in the United States

and   transfer   it to the foreign countries.2 If the lower capital costs for



          2
           Kravis      [1956] pointed out that U .S. foreign investment was concen-
   trated in industries with higher capital requirements per dollar of
   output than the        average   domestic industry.


American multinational firms reflected only their access to U.S. capital
on terms no more favorable than those available to American firms in general--
let us call that Assumption 1--we would expect that the most capital-intensive
industries would manufacture In the U • S. and export from here and that indus-
tries   intermediate in capital intensity would combine           U.S. capital and   foreign

labor   in production abroad by U.S. affiliates.

        On the other hand,      if   the lower   capital costs for American multinationals
are specific to the firms, and lower than capital eosts of other American
firms——call that Assumption 2——, we would expect that the               highly capital-
                                                                      most

intensive production would take          place within the multinational firm, regardless
of physical location. If the multinational firms do not enjoy larae economies
of scale in production, they might be expected to place some of the production
outside the      United   States, where they face capital costs approximately the
same as in      this   country but lower labor costs or cheaper access to markets.
      For resource-orjnted industries, the location of which is dependent
on the discovery and development of natural resources, we cannot expect to
predict   location but only ownership given location. The more capital-

intensive of these industries, wherever located, will tend to be owned by

U.S. (or other) multinational firms.

      To the extent that this analysis is valid, it helps to explain the high

capital intensity of U.S. imports found by Leontief and others. We would expect

to find that this high capital intensity was to some extent accounted for by

imports into the United States from foreign affiliates of U.S. firms,             for
which the price of capital was not the high price of the countries in which

they are located but the low U.S. price or the still lower multinational

firm price.

      We have put    this analysis in terms of the         factor proportions character-

izing individual industries, as most authors have done, setting aside the
question of the extent to which firms          in   a given industry adapt their methods
of production to differences among             prices of factors of produc-
                                            countries in

tion. In effect we are assuming that any adaptation is not so large as to
disturb the ranking of industries with respect to capital intensity.3 We


          3
          That   these   rankings   of   industries by factor intensity are similar
   from one country to another was a conclusion of the Lary and Yahr studies.
   See Lazy Q9683 and Yahr 9681J.

have also put most of the empirical analysis in terms of two factors of
production,   capital and labor, but we have divided the former into physical

capital and   human capital.    The same arguments could be made with respect
                                           —7—

to   any   other   factor, such as technological skill, for which the multi-
national firm faces lower costs of purchase or transfer than other firms.
Of these    other factors we analyzed here only research and development
intensity.
       There are a       number of possible variants of the capital—labor ratio
that   can be used. We have followed mainly the approach taken by Lary

l968, chapter 2] who used value added per worker as his measure of total

(physical and human) capital per worker, interpreting the wage component

as a measure       of   returns to human   capital   and the nonwage component as a

measure of returns to physical capital. Lary's measures have some defects

wean correct. Mis nonwage value added includes taxes and certain service

purchases       from other business and    the wage per worker excludes fringe

benefits.       We have therefore substituted employee compensation and
property-type income, as calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see
Walderhaug C19731) for the wage        and nonwage value added used by Lary.

       Several attempts have been made to measure human           capital   intensity

directly from information on the composition of the labor force in each

industry: age, sex, education, skill level, etc. We have included some

calculations based on one of the most recent measures of this type as a

check on conclusions from data on employee compensation per worker.4



            4
             See A.E. Fareed C19723.       The first calculation of human     capital
     intensity along these lines was by Kenen C1965].



       The original approach to the measurement of factor proportions was,

of course, that of Leontief C1956], who calculated capital per manyear,

defining capital as fixed, physical capital. These ratios were derived from
                                          —8—

the 1947 input-output table, and we have used the same ratios in our own

calculations      for that and later years. Leontief's article was based on

the sum of direct and indirect input requirements, but since we wish to

focus on the characteristics of each industry, we have made use of only

the direct coefficients.

         It should be noted that both the Lary and the Leontief factor ratios,

and those we are using, are      computed from U.S. data, and are applied to
both U.S. exports and U.S. imports.

         If   one thinks of research and development expenditures as a separate
form    of capital input, particularly for the United States or for American

multinational companies, we can add, to the measures of human and physical

capital intensity, a measure of R&D intensity. We have calculated that

characteristic as the amount     of   R&D expenditure per   worker.
         If our suppositions about the role of multinational firms     are   correct,

we    should expect that U.S. imports from American—owned affiliates are more
capital—intensive and     more research—intensive than imports from non—U.S.

firms.     That   this is predominantly the case is evident in section A of

Table 1, which shows that the total      value   added per worker embodied   in
imports from U.S. affiliates in 1966 was a third higher than that embodied

in   imports from others, and that research intensity was over twice as high
among imports from affiliates. The       difference in value added per worker
was particularly large for property-type income, smaller, but still over 10

per   cent    for compensation per worker, and very small for directly—measured

human    capital intensity.
         From section B of Table 1 it can be seen that these large    differences
in   capital intensity are heavily influenced by mining and petroleum--two

resource-based industries with high capital intensity. For manufacturing

alone,   excluding petroleum refining, imports from U.S. affiliates appear to

be only about 10 per cent more capital—intensive than imports from others,

and most of the difference is in the employee compensation part of value

added, which we interpret as reflecting human       capital   embodiment. The direct

measure of human capital shows only a 4 per cent margin, close to that for

property—type income per worker. However, the research intensity of imports

from affiliates exceeds that of other imports by a larger margin in manufac-

turing   alone than in manufacturing and mining.
         If we use Leontief's measure of capital    intensity, physical capital

per manyear (Table 2), we find that imports from affiliates were twice as

capital intensive as other imports in 1951 and 1965, and almost twice in 1947.

Again, mining and petroleum accounted for a large part of this difference.

Even   in manufacturing, however, imports   from   affiliates were a third or a
half   more physical-capital intensive than other imports.

       Apparently, U.S. imports produced by American affiliates were distinguished

from imports produced by others mainly in being considerably more capital-

intensive and far more research—intensive. That higher physical capital

intensity   of imports from affiliates was clearest in mining and petroleum,
products for which the location   of production was determined by the location
of   resources. In manufacturing the outstanding difference between the two

sets of imports was the high R&D content of the imports from affiliates.

       These results suggest that some substantial part of the high capital

intensity of u.s. imports might be attributed to those imports that are pro-

duced abroad by U.S. firms facing U.S. rather than foreign capital costs.

We can, then, compare the factor content of imports       from non—U.S. companies
with that of U.S. exports, to ask whether our imports from non-affiliated
companies involve economizing on labor, capital, or research investment.

        The data in Table 3, based on value added per worker, indicate that

exports   were   more capital—intensive than imports from non—affiliates, that

this higher capital intensity of exports applied to both physical and

human capital,        but more strongly to the   latter, and to manufacturing alone

as   well as to manufacturing, mining, and petroleum combined. Exports were
also more research-intensive than these imports, and by a much larger margin
of two—thirds or more. The data for earlier years on physical capital alone,
based   on Leontief's measure of physical capital intensity (Table 4), give the

opposite      result. For manufacturing and mining      together, the physical capital

intensity     of exports was substantially below that of imports from non-
affiliated companies (instead of substantially higher as in Table 3). In
manufacturing     taken alone, the ratios were much closer, but in only      one year
was capital per manyear as high in exports as in imports from non-affiliated

companies. On the other hand, the human capital intensity           measures for
earlier years     show much the same pattern as those for 1966: about 10 to 20

per   cent   higher for exports   than   for imports from non-affiliated companies.

        The   first   set of results in Table 3 suggests that the traditional

expectations about factor       proportions in   U.S. trade   were correct. Imports
not   produced with U.S. capital were from industries with lower physical and

human capital intensity and lower R&D intensity than U.S. exports. According

to these results the relatively high capital-intensity of U.S. imports as a

physical   capital intensities do characterize imports from non-affiliates,

even if these are not quite as capital intensive as imports from affiliates.

        If we accept the results based on value added per worker we are still

left with the question raised earlier of whether the capital or research

costs   of the U.S . -based multinational firms are those of the U.S.
economy as a whole or are peculiar to these firms. Are the MNC' s       only a

conduit   for cheap U.S. capital and R&D or do they have their own low capital
and R&D costs which they wish to exploit both in the United States and abroad?
A test of that propositbn can be performed by comparing the characteristics
of exports by parent firms with those of U.S. exports by other firms.
        As Table 5 indicates, the parent firms are in industries with higher
capital and R&D intensities than other U.S. exporters. The difference
between            and others is larger for physical capital than for
           parent firms

human capital, although it is substantial for both. It is still larger
for   R&D than for either type of capital. Thus the evidence suggests that
the lower capital and R&D costs of these firms with foreign affiliates are
characteristics of the firms themselves rather than of the U.S. economy as
a whole.
        In fact, as can be seen in Table 6, the capital and R&D intensities
of exports by U.S. parent firms resemble those of imports from the foreign
affiliates of these same firms more closely than they do those of exports
by other U.S. firms and the characteristics of imports from non-affiliated
foreign firma resemble those of U •S. exports by non-parents more than they
do those of U.S. imports from affiliates. Thus, these data point to
the distinctiveness of the multinational firms, in both their U.S. and their
foreign operations, from other firms in the U.S. and abroad.

Conclusions
         Our results indicate that U.S. imports from American-owned affiliates
abroad are more capital—intensive, and particularly more research—intensive
than U.S. imports from others. These imports from affiliates account for much
of the   high capital intensity that has been found to characterize U.S. imports.

Using    a measure of total capital intensity we find, in fact, that U.S. imports
from non—affiliated companies embody, on the average, less capital and more
labor than U.S.    exports.   The capital—intensive   and   research—intensive charac
ter of U.S. imports from affiliates appears to reflect mainly the low costs of
capital, research, and possibly other factors of the parent companies, rather
than only the costs to American firms in general. We make that judgment on
the basis of the fact that exports from the United States by these parent
companies are more capital— and research—intensive than exports by other U.S.
companies.
         There appear then to be several roles of American—based multinational
firms.    is the provision of low-cost physical capital for capital-intensive
          One

resource—based industries, the location of which is fixed in foreign countries
by the location of natural resources. Another      is the provision of low-cost
technology (assuming that technology is the fruit of research and development
investment) for the production of research—intensive manufactured products
in foreign countries. In both of these cases the multinational firms appear
to produce using factor proportions far different from those of other
American firms. Presumably, they do so because they enjoy comparatively
low costs for these resources. The evidence also indicates, but not as
strongly, that multinational firms act as a conduit for low-cost human capital
flows to foreign countries.

     All of these calculations are derived from data on the capital- and
research-intensity of whole industries, on the assumption that firms are
identical within an industry and the assumption that an industry is
characterized by the same capital—intensity in each country. Both of these
assumptions are open to question and we plan to investigate the validity of
each in further studies. We will compare multinational parent firms with
others in the same industries in the United States, compare affiliates with
other firms in tfle same industries in the countries in which they operate,
and compare   parent firms'   domestic   operations with those of their own   overseas

affiliates.

     a
       For petroleum, we have assumed that all imports are from U.S. affiliates
abroad, although the published data suggest a considerably lower fraction. The
published data for this industry on imports from affiliates seem extremely
unreliable. One evidence of this unreliability is the fact that exports
to the U.S. reported by affiliates in several areas are substantially higher than
total U.S. imports from these areas. For Canada, on the other hand, reported
exports to the U.S. by affiliates were only 40 per cent of U.S. imports. This
rado seems absurdly low in view of the fact that, according to Canadian data,
 U.S. subsidiaries accounted for 72 per cent of Canadian exports of gas and oil
to all countries, and one might expect the proportion in exports to the U.S.
to be higher than that. Furthermore, that proportion is understated because
Trans-Canada Pipe Lines, a Canadian'owned company, takes title to gas it transmits
even though the gas may originate with a U.S.-controlled subsidiary (see Foreign
Direct Investment in Canada, Information Canada, 1972, p. 159.

      b
       Figure in source was reduced because it was greater than total U.S. imports.
The lower figure used is comparable with the 1970 figure in The Reconciliation of
U.S.-Canada Trade Statistics, 1970 (U.S. Department of Commerce), p. 57.

      d
       Figures revised to agree with U.S. import data.    Amounts subtracted from
published figures for stone, clay, etc. and instruments   were added to the "other"
category.

     Exports and imports for each industry in 1947 and 1951 and direct
labor and capital input coefficients for each industry in 1947 are from
Wassily Leontief, "Factor Proportions and the Structure of American
Trade: Further Theoretical and Empirical Analysis," Review of Economics
and Statistics, Nov. 1956, reprinted in Leontief, Input-Output Economics
(Oxford University Press, 1966), pp. 129—133. These 1947 coefficients
were used in all our estimates of capital per manyear. Data cover manu-
facturing and mining, including petroleum.

      Estimates of the proportion of imports coming from U.S. overseas
affiliates in 1947 and 1951 are from U.S. Business Investment in Foreign
Countries (U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Economics,
1960), and apply to the year 1957.

      We have removed natural rubber from Leontief's Chemicals category
on the ground that it is essentially an agricultural product and that
the capital per worker ratio for the U.S. synthetic rubber industry is
not an appropriate one for natural rubber.
      Proportions for 1965 are from 1966 data, as in Table A—3.
