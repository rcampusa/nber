Are market experts prone to heuristics, and if so, do they transfer across closely related domains
--buying and selling? We investigate this question using a unique dataset of institutional
investors with portfolios averaging $573 million. A striking finding emerges: while there is clear
evidence of skill in buying, selling decisions underperform substantially--even relative to
random selling strategies. This holds despite the similarity between the two decisions in
frequency, substance and consequences for performance. Evidence suggests that an asymmetric
allocation of cognitive resources such as attention can explain the discrepancy: we document a
systematic, costly heuristic process when selling but not when buying.

1       Introduction

A large literature has demonstrated that market participants use heuristics and are
prone to systematic biases. However, the majority of evidence comes from unsophisti-
cated traders such as retail investors, who have been shown to be overconfident (Barber
and Odean 2001), loss-averse (Larson, List, and Metcalfe 2016) and to exhibit limited
attention in their trade decisions (Barber and Odean 2008; Hartzmark 2014). Com-
paratively little is known about the decision-making of market experts and it remains
important to better understand whether they are prone to behavioral biases and, if so,
the extent to which these biases aect performance.

       This paper examines the decisions of sophisticated market participants--experienced
institutional portfolio managers (PMs)--using a rich data set containing the entirety of
their daily holdings and trades. Our data is comprised of 783 portfolios, with an aver-
age portfolio valued at approximately $573 million. The modal PM is hired by a single
institutional client such as a pension fund in a separately managed account to generate
excess returns by forming concentrated portfolios that depart substantially from their
benchmarks. More than 89 million fund-security-trading dates and 4.4 million high-
stakes trades (2.0 and 2.4 million sells and buys, respectively) are observed between
2000 and 2016. We evaluate performance by constructing counterfactual portfolios,
and compare PMs' actual decisions to returns of the counterfactual strategy. Our data
set uniquely allows us to evaluate selling decisions relative to a conservative counter-
factual that assumes no skill: randomly selling an alternative position that was not
traded on the same date.1
       We document a striking pattern: While the investors display clear skill in buy-
ing, their selling decisions underperform substantially. Positions added to the portfolio
outperform both the benchmark and a strategy which randomly buys more shares of
1
    Throughout the paper we construct counterfactuals based on current holdings. In a setting such as
    ours with active managers forming concentrated portfolios subject to short-sales constraints, evalu-
    ating a selling decision relative to a counterfactual which is unrelated to existing holdings (e.g., a
    benchmark index) is not an appropriate comparison. First, because portfolios depart quite a bit from
    the benchmark, selling the benchmark is often not feasible on the margin. Additionally, PMs may
    be selling in order to raise capital to buy, or because their opinion about a security has changed. An
    asset sold may outperform (underpeform) a benchmark index, but the sale may be optimal (subop-
    timal) depending on what is bought with that capital and what other assets could have been sold
    (e.g. an alternative may have gone up even more).



                                                     1
assets already held in the portfolio by over 100 basis points annually per dollar of
purchase volume. In contrast, selling decisions not only fail to beat a no-skill random
selling strategy, they consistently underperform it by substantial amounts. In our pre-
ferred specification, PMs forgo 80 basis points per year relative to a factor neutral,
random-selling strategy.2 We perform a wide array of robustness checks, constructing
counterfactuals that match assets bought and sold on size, value, idiosyncratic volatil-
ity, prior returns, and momentum, and `characteristic selectivity' (Daniel, Grinblatt,
Titman, and Wermers 1997). We also perform sample splits to account for the po-
tential impact of outflow pressure and price impact. Our results are robust to these
alternative specifications both in terms of statistical significance and economic mag-
nitude. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that underperformance in selling appears most
prominently amongst fundamentals-oriented managers who hold more active, concen-
trated portfolios with higher tracking error; PMs who rely on momentum strategies
exhibit the least underperformance in selling. Finally, we show that the decomposed
buying and selling measures have a meaningful relationship with overall portfolio re-
turns: outperforming (underperforming) the counterfactual when buying (selling) is
strongly predictive of higher (lower) excess portfolio returns.3
    Why would a majority of portfolio managers appear to exhibit skill in buying while
at the same time underperforming substantially in selling? At face value, the funda-
mentals of buying and selling to optimize performance are essentially the same: Both
require incorporating information to forecast the distribution of future returns of an
asset.4 Skill in both decisions requires the investor to look for relevant information and
integrate it into the forecast. However, there is reason to suspect that selling and buying
decisions involve dierent psychological processes (Barber and Odean 2013). Recent
2
  As a benchmark, active managers of mutual funds charge between 20 to 50 basis points per year
  in fees, depending on the size of the portfolio. The foregone returns due to poor selling are also
  substantially larger than the average cost dierential (and net-of-fee performance dierential) between
  mutual funds and institutional seperately managed accounts (SMAs) of the sort we have in our
  sample, which is around 10-35 bp per annum (Chen, Chen, Johnson, and Sardarli 2017; Elton,
  Gruber, and Blake 2013).
3
  Moreover, we show that poor selling aects overall performance through two channels: the first is
  through the stocks sold outperforming the counterfatual (direct channel), and the second is through
  `fast' selling leading PMs to prematurely disgard viable investment ideas (indirect channel). As
  evidence for the latter, PMs rarely re-purchase assets that have left their portfolio, suggesting that
  sales eliminate equities from future consideration sets.
4
  As noted in Barber and Odean (2008), `in formal models, the decisions to buy and to sell often dier
  only by a minus sign.'


                                                   2
work from the lab is consistent with this discrepancy: Buying decisions appear to be
more forward-looking and belief-driven than selling decisions in an experimental asset
market (Grosshans, Langnickel, and Zeisberger 2018). Indeed, anecdotal evidence from
our sample points to PMs thinking dierently about and allocating dierent amounts
of eort towards the two decisions; extensive interviews suggest that they appear to
focus primarily on finding the next great idea to add to their portfolio and view selling
largely as a way to raise cash for purchases.5

    We argue that the stark discrepancy in performance between buys and sells is
consistent with an asymmetric allocation of limited cognitive resources towards buying
and away from selling. As a result of this asymmetry, we propose that while buying
will resemble decisions made through standard portfolio optimization, selling decisions
are driven by a two-stage process that has elements of bounded rationality entering at
both stages. First, limited attention leads PMs to constrain their consideration set to
assets with extreme attributes on a salient dimension--prior returns.6 Next, from this
constrained consideration set, PMs choose to unload positions in which they have the
least conviction. The latter eect can generate systematic underperformance if these
positions happen to include neglected, but still viable investment ideas.7

    As a first piece of evidence, we examine the performance trades that occur contem-
poraneously with exogenous events that draw investors' attention to current holdings.
The release of salient and portfolio-relevant information though company earnings an-
nouncements has been exploited to study limited attention in asset markets (Menkveld
2013). Earnings announcements, like other salient news releases, not only draw atten-
tion to specific assets or asset classes, they also provide new decision-relevant informa-
tion (Ball and Brown 1968) on which skilled traders are able to capitalize (Ben-Rephael,
5
  The following quotes are illustrative of this attitude: "When I sell, I'm done with it. In fact, after I
  sell, I go through and delete the name of the position from the entire research universe." "Selling is
  simply a cash raising exercise for the next buying idea." "Buying is an investment decision, selling
  is something else." In section 4.1, we also discuss why certain institutional features of our setting
  might lead PMs to prioritize buying decisions.
6
  Limited attention has been argued to generate a higher propensity to buy and sell assets with extreme
  returns (Hartzmark 2014; Ungeheuer 2017). Various measures of prior returns are among the most
  readily available pieces of information about a security ­ trading terminals and research platforms
  all highlight asset-specific prior returns ­ and research has shown that the salience of these return
  measures can aect investment decisions above and beyond the information they provide about future
  performance (Frydman and Rangel 2014; Frydman and Wang 2018).
7
  Barber and Odean (2008) argue for a similar two-stage trading process, writing that "preferences
  determine choices after attention has determined the choice set."


                                                    3
Da, and Israelsen 2017; Easley, Engle, O'Hara, and Wu 2008; Fedyk 2018; Hendershott,
Livdan, and Sch¨
               urho 2015). We exploit variation in earnings announcements as pre-
determined shifters of attention which may lead PMs to think more deliberately about
positions that they would have otherwise not considered selling. Accordingly, we pre-
dict that earnings announcements broaden the PMs' consideration sets and, as a result,
contemporaneous selling decisions will outperform those made on non-announcement
days. Since attention is already being channeled towards purchases, the performance
of buying decisions will not change on announcement days. In contrast, if the dif-
ference in buying and selling performance is driven by some fundamental discrepancy
between the two decisions, e.g. dierences in skill, then trades should look similar on
announcement and non-announcement days.

   We find that selling decisions on earnings announcement days outperform those on
non-announcement days by more than 150 basis points annually. Whereas sell decisions
on non-announcement days substantially underperform (similar to the overall result),
on average, stocks sold on announcement dates substantially outperform the random-
sell counterfactual. Consistent with PMs focusing on buys throughout, we do not detect
a systematic dierence in performance of buying decisions on announcement versus non-
announcement days. These results suggest that investors do not lack the fundamental
skill to sell well--in fact, the point estimates of buying and selling performance on
announcement days are similar--it is just not transferred.

   As further evidence for the asymmetric allocation of cognitive resources, we docu-
ment that PMs are prone to use a heuristic process when selling but not when buying.
PMs in our sample have substantially greater propensities to sell positions that are
extreme on the salient dimension of prior returns: both the worst and best performing
assets in the portfolio are sold at rates more than 50 percent higher than assets that
just under- or over-performed. Non-psychological instrumental motives do not seem
to explain this pattern: results are robust to controlling for position size and holding
length, and are unlikely to be explained by risk management and tax motives. The
pattern persists even after the inclusion of stock-date fixed eects which absorb a num-
ber of time-varying, stock-specific unobservables. On any given day, the same asset
is more likely to be sold from a portfolio where it exhibits relatively extreme returns
than from a portfolio where its recent performance stands out less compared to other


                                           4
positions held. In contrast, we observe no similar tendency to focus on extremes on the
buying side--unlike with selling, buying behavior correlates little with past returns.8
Prior returns appear to guide the PMs' consideration sets of what assets to sell but
have little eect on decisions of what to buy.

    Next, we show that given the consideration set of assets with extreme returns, PMs
systematically choose to sell those that they have the least conviction in. We define
`conviction' as the extent to which the PM has developed a position as an integral,
active part of her portfolio. This can be measured by examining the asset's weight
relative to the benchmark: assets that score low on this dimension are most likely to
be ideas that the PM began to develop but neglected to do so further. We find that
these `neglected ideas' are associated with much of the underperformance in selling;
moreover, they are most likely to be sold and their sales exhibit the most pronounced
relationship with extreme returns.9 In contrast, sales of `high conviction' assets are
not associated with any systematic underperformance.

    Finally, we present evidence that the heuristic process outlined above is costly.
Our analysis looks at within-manager variation in the propensity to sell assets with
extreme returns. When the same manager becomes more likely to sell extremes (top
quartile), they forgo almost 180 foregone basis points annually; in contrast, sales do
not underperform when managers are least likely to sell extremes (bottom quartile).
These results point to an empirical link between heuristic thinking and overall under-
performance in selling. Moreover, we show that selling performance is further degraded
during periods when attention devoted towards sales is likely to be stretched thin, such
as when PMs are stressed (during periods when the overall portfolio is underwater)
or selling in order to raise cash for buying decisions (attending to their selling choices
even less). Importantly, the link between heuristic use and poor selling does not seem
8
  Since prior returns may reflect changes in relative valuations, it is not unreasonable to see a correlation
  between extreme prior returns and trading behavior. However, the revealed preferences of PMs'
  buying decisions suggest that the public signal provided by recent relative returns has little eect on
  PMs' beliefs about future expected returns. The lack of this correlation for buying decisions suggests
  that such instrumental motives are not the primary driver of behavior on the selling side.
9
  Note that the sale of assets with extreme returns may be su cient to generate systematic underper-
  formance if a large enough number of investors share assets that are categorized as extreme within
  their portfolios An (2015); An and Argyle (2016); Coval and Staord (2007). However, as discussed in
  Section 2.1, this channel is unlikely to be driving the underperformance in selling within our sample
  as PMs tend to hold concentrated portfolios that depart quite a bit from the benchmark. To that
  end, we show that the correlation between assets sold in the cross-section is essentially zero.


                                                     5
to be driven by a persistent trait or lack of skill: consistent with the proposed atten-
tional mechanism, dierences in selling performance are associated with variation in
covariates within-manager rather than in the cross-section.

       Our paper contributes to the literature documenting biased decision-making in
financial markets. The majority of research on investor behavior has focused on retail
traders for whom daily holdings and trade data has been been more readily available
(see Barber and Odean (2011) for review). The selling pattern we document is most
related to the rank eect described in Hartzmark (2014). There, retail investors appear
to exhibit a similar pattern in selling and buying behavior--unloading and purchasing
assets with more extreme returns. However, it is not clear from the data whether these
trading strategies are costly: This set of investors have been found to underperform
the market net of fees and display a host of heuristics and biases.10

       While prior work has documented biases amongst experts in corporate finance set-
tings, e.g. CEOs in charge of mergers (Malmendier, Tate, and Yan 2011) or other
restructuring decisions (Camerer and Malmendier 2007), substantially less research
exists on the behavioral biases of expert institutional investors. A number of papers
have used data on aggregate returns to demonstrate slow and ine cient incorporation
of certain types of signals into asset prices (Chang, Hartzmark, Solomon, and Soltes
2016a; Giglio and Shue 2014; Hartzmark and Shue 2017; Hong, Torous, and Valkanov
2007). Although these findings highlight ine ciencies in the overall market, they can-
not identify bias in expert investors per se. Other work has used the mandated release
of quarterly holdings data to show the tendency of mutual funds to herd on the decisions
of others (Wermers 1999), follow past prices (Gri n, Harris, and Topaloglu 2003), and
display a `reverse' disposition eect (Chang, Solomon, and Westerfield 2016b), but the
coarseness of the data makes it di cult to identify biases from instrumental motives.
As a result, the behavioral finance literature has mostly assumed unbiased institutional
investors exploiting the behavioral biases of retail investors (Malmendier 2018). Our
findings suggest that such an assumption may not be a valid one.

       Our findings speak to the literature examining the performance of institutional
investors. Although much of the research has argued that actively managed funds un-
10
     These biases include the disposition eect (Odean 1998), overconfidence (Odean 1999), and narrow
     bracketing (Frydman, Hartzmark, and Solomon 2017).



                                                  6
derperform the market after fees (Gruber 1996; Jensen 1968), a number of studies have
presented evidence for some skill in managers' ability to pick stocks (see Wermers 2011,
for a review). Using quarterly holdings data, Wermers (2000) shows that stocks held
by mutual funds outperform the market on average, while net returns underperform.
The majority of the dierence can be explained by fees and transaction costs, suggest-
ing skill in managers' ability to pick stocks. Kosowski, Timmermann, Wermers, and
White (2006) employ a bootstrap analysis that identifies a sizable minority of funds
who persistently beat the market even net of costs. Puckett and Yan (2011) argue that
quarterly data may mask skill since interim trades (i.e. trades that are initiated and
reversed within-quarter) can add considerable value to the fund. Finally, other work
has looked at how fund characteristics are associated with performance; for example,
Chen, Hong, Huang, and Kubik (2004) study the eect of fund size on returns and
document a negative relationship.11
     Our results also complement the analysis of Di Mascio, Lines, and Naik (2017) and
von Beschwitz, Lunghi, and Schmidt (2017), who used the Inalytics Ltd database.12
They study the relation between purchase/sale volume (aggregated across PMs) and
market conditions to test predictions of theoretical models of optimal strategic trading
with private information. They find evidence that both opening and closing trades
tend to earn positive risk-adjusted returns. Crucially, the analysis of closing trades in
both papers does not consider feasible alternatives based on existing holdings. As such,
while the papers can speak to skill in security selection, the question of whether or not
PMs over- or under-perform with respect to feasible strategies and whether decisions
are potentially subject to behavioral biases is outside the scope of their investigation.

     Finally, our results also contribute to the literature demonstrating heuristics and
biases amongst experts in domains such as sports (Green and Daniels 2017; Massey and
Thaler 2013; Pope and Schweitzer 2011; Romer 2006), judges (Chen, Moskowitz, and
Shue 2016), professional forecasters (Coibion and Gorodnichenko 2015), monitoring of
corporate actions (Kempf, Manconi, and Spalt 2016), and retail markets (DellaVigna
and Gentzkow 2017). This line of work highlights the persistence of behavioral biases
11
   Papers have also looked at how the presence of institutional investors aects prices (Gompers and
   Metrick 2001), market stability (Brunnermeier and Nagel 2004), and and corporate governance
   (Ferreira and Matos 2008).
12
   Whereas the former also studies a sample of long only portfolios similar to ours, the latter restricts
   attention to a smaller set of 21 long-short hedge funds.


                                                   7
despite significant experience and exposure to market forces.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents
results on performance of buying and selling decisions, while Sections 4 and 5 present
results on the use of heuristics in trading strategies and how those strategies aect
performance. Section 6 concludes.


2       Institutional Sample

This section reviews the data sources which are assembled for our analysis and presents
some relevant background and summary statistics on the data we observe in our sample
of institutional portfolios. Further details are in Appendix sections A.1 and A.2.

2.1       Empirical Setting: Institutional Portfolio Managers

Our primary source of data is compiled by Inalytics Ltd. These data include informa-
tion on the portfolio holdings and trading activities of institutional investors. Inalytics
acquires this information as part of one of its major lines of business, which is to of-
fer portfolio monitoring services for institutional investors that analyze the investment
decisions of portfolio managers.13 The majority of portfolios in our sample are sourced
from asset owners--institutional investors such as pension funds who provide capital
to PMs to allocate on their behalf. In these cases, we see holdings and trades related to
the specific assets owned by the client. The remainder of the portfolios are submitted
by PMs themselves who seek to benchmark their own performance; in these cases, data
will frequently correspond with holdings and trades aggregated over multiple clients.
These data are associated with a single strategy, so we do not observe assets managed
by the same PMs using alternative strategies.

       For purposes of this study, Inalytics assembled a dataset of long-only equity port-
folios spanning from January 2000 through March of 2016. These portfolios are almost
always tax-exempt, hold limited cash, and are prohibited from using leverage or tak-
ing short positions. The portfolios are internationally diversified, including data from
a large number of global equity markets. Data are only available during periods for
which Inalytics' monitoring service is performed. After applying a sequence of filters
13
     We will use the terms fund and portfolio interchangeably throughout our discussion.



                                                   8
described further in Appendix A.1, our final sample includes daily information about
holdings and trades covering about 51 thousand portfolio-months of data, which are
compiled from a set of 783 institutional portfolios. During this period, we have an
average of just over 5 years (65 months) of data per portfolio and observe 89 mil-
lion fund-security-trading date observations, 2.4 million buy trades, and 2 million sell
trades. We convert all market values to US dollars at the end of each trading day.14

     Our sample consists entirely of active managers, and, based on our review of com-
panies' publicly available marketing materials, the vast majority of these PMs iden-
tify mispriced securities through a mix of balance-sheet analysis, conversations with
management, and qualitative judgements. There are only 22 systematic, quantitative
portfolios in our sample, and our results are insensitive to excluding them. Section
A.2 in the Appendix provides a summary of several qualitative characteristics of our
sample. Portfolios are mostly beholden to a single specific institutional client--the
modal portfolio is managed by a PM on behalf of a pension fund.

     Relative to the well-studied universe of mutual funds, the portfolios in our sample
are highly concentrated and have large tracking error budgets.15 These types of high-
conviction PMs are typically hired by pension funds or endowments to generate alpha
as a complement to other managers with more passive strategies. As a consequence, the
PMs in our sample are expected to be concentrated stock-pickers with low correlation to
other assets. Goyal, Wahal, and Yavuz (2020) describe the client's the search process for
managers in detail, where an institutional plan sponsor puts out a request for proposals,
hears presentations from three to five finalists, and finally selects a manager from
amongst this group. The authors find two important factors predict which managers
are selected: past returns and previous interactions.16 Speaking loosely, the selection of
highly active managers requires a record of high past returns and favorable qualitative
                                      17
judgements about their quality.
14
   We compile data on exchange rates from three sources: Datastream, Compustat Global, and Ina-
   lytics' internal database, with Datastream being our primary source. In the vast majority of cases,
   at least two of these sources have identical exchange rates.

   In results presented in Tables 3, A.4, and A.5, we show that tracking error is not likley to be be a
   binding constraint.

      This institutional arrangement has several important consequences. First, because
the sample is made up almost entirely of institutional separately managed accounts
(SMAs), the PMs are subject an entirely dierent flow structure compared to mutual
funds. Mutual funds invest in a common set of securities on behalf of all of their
shareholders, each of whom has essentially been promised daily liquidity. In contrast,
managers of an SMA are typically beholden to a single client, and as a result, direct
outflows are unlikely to cause forced sales. Flows in or out of portfolios tend to either
be small withdrawals for cash flow needs of a pension, which are entirely predictable by
the PMs, or large block withdrawals that come from firing a manager. In these latter
cases, asset owners engage third party transition managers to assist with transfer of
assets to new PMs. As a result, the prospect of unexpected changes in assets under
management (AUM) is unlikely to significantly aect PMs' decision-making and flow-
induced sales tend to be rare (relative to mutual funds).18

2.2     Descriptive Statistics

For each portfolio, we have a complete history of holdings and trades at the daily level
throughout the sample period. Inalytics collects portfolio data on a monthly basis
and extends them to a daily basis by adjusting quantities using daily trades data.
As a result, we observe the complete equity holdings of the portfolio at the end of
each trading day (quantities, prices, and securities held), as well as a daily record of
buy and sell trades (quantities bought/sold and prices) and daily portfolio returns,
though we do not observe cash balances. Each portfolio is associated with a specific
benchmark (usually a broad market index) against which its performance is evaluated.
Our dataset includes an unbalanced panel of both active and inactive portfolios, with
the vast majority of the data collected in real-time, suggesting that incubation and
survivorship biases are not a substantial concern for our analysis.19
   quantitative analysis of the manager's performance track record, and a qualitative analysis of the
   manager's investment process."
18
   Our results support this conjecture: we show that buying and selling performance is not qualitatively
   aected by proxies for flows. This is in contrast to the results of Alexander, Cici, and Gibson (2007)
   who report that flow-induced buys and sells substantially underperform discretionary trades in a
   sample of mutual funds. See also Chen et al. (2017); Edelen (1999).
19
   Furthermore, given that the majority of our analyses involve comparisons of stocks held with stocks
   traded, a number of common portfolio-specific factors which could potentially be associated with
   incubation/survivorship biases are dierenced out via our methodology.

            To complement these data we merge in external information on past and future
     returns (including periods before and/or after we have portfolio data). When possible,
     we use external price and return series from CRSP; otherwise, we use price data from
     Datastream. When neither of these sources are available, Inalytics provided us with
     the remaining price series which are sourced (in order of priority) from MSCI Inc. and
     the portfolio managers themselves. Since PMs in our sample have global mandates and
     tend to hold concentrated portfolios that depart quite a bit from the benchmark, there
     is a fairly low overlap between stocks held contemporaneously by dierent portfolios
     in our sample.

            Using these data we construct a wide array of measures at the portfolio-time and
     portfolio-stock-time (position) level. Table 1 summarizes a number of key monthly fund
     characteristics. For brevity, we emphasize a few key attributes of our sample here and
     relegate discussion of summary statistics for many of these variables to Appendix Table
     A.2 and section A.2, respectively. All portfolios are large, and there is considerable
     heterogeneity in portfolio size.20 In addition, funds dier noticeably in terms of their
     20
          Note that given the size of the portolios (average AUM $533 million), trades in the 1 to 5 million
          dollar range are unlikely to face issues related to price impact, such as di culty exiting from a
          position. These magnitudes are in sharp contrast with trades of big mutual funds (e.g. between $25
          and $200 billion dollars) which have been examined in prior work (Coval and Staord 2007; Lou


                                                        11
trading activity levels. Average monthly turnover is about 4 percent of assets under
management, but some funds are considerably more active in their trading behavior
than others (the standard deviation is 5.7 percent).

     While holding fairly diversified portfolios (average number of stocks is about 78
with a standard deviation of 68), funds in our sample remain active, with positions
that deviate substantially from their benchmarks. This is more concentrated than the
average mutual fund, which holds a median of 92 stocks during our sample period
Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2012). The average tracking error--the standard deviation
of the dierence between the daily portfolio return and the benchmark--is about 0.35
percent per day, or about 5.7 percent on an annualized basis. As discussed in the previ-
ous subsection, this corresponds to portfolios that are substantially more concentrated
and have larger tracking error budgets than the typical passive or retail mutual fund.
On average, a manager will initiate a sell trade for about 10 percent and a buy trade
for about 15 percent of the stocks in his/her portfolio each month. We also character-
ize fund portfolios in terms of factor exposures by computing rolling Carhart 4-factor
regressions (using the prior 1 year of daily data with the Fama-French international
factors), adjusted for asynchronous trading.21 The average market beta is about 1, and
average exposures to the SMB, HML, and Momentum factors are fairly close to zero.

     The average fund in our sample beats its respective benchmark by about 0.22
percent per month, or 2.6 percent per year. This, in conjunction with the fact that
funds' average betas are close to 1 and have little average exposure to the three other
priced risk factors, suggests that these managers are highly skilled.22 We view the
positive selection of managers in our sample as an advantage when studying expertise
and heuristic use: The population we examine is clearly skilled, and thus identifying
biased behavior is likely a lower bound when generalizing the results.

     In Appendix A.2, we summarize a variety of additional attributes of our sample.
Relative to US mutual funds, PMs in our sample have a larger share of international
holdings. Managers have concentrated holdings and long holding periods. Specifically,
   2012).
21
   Following Dimson (1979), we adjust for asynchronicity by including one lag and one forward return
   of each factor. We use these adjustments throughout when estimating daily factor loadings.
22
   Prior work has demonstrated that a subset of insitutional investors do persistently outperform the
   market and generate alpha (Kosowski et al. 2006).



                                                 12
the average holding length is at least 485 calendar days (or about 15 months).23

Dierences from other datasets This sample oers some unique opportunities
to study expert decision-making relative to other datasets in the literature. First, in
contrast to the Large Discount Brokerage dataset of Barber and Odean (2000), which
features portfolio holdings and trades of individual retail investors, our data include
complete portfolio and trade-level detail for a population of professional investors man-
aging large pools of assets.24 Illustrative of this distinction, Barber and Odean (2000)
report that the value of the average portfolio is $26,000 and that the top quintile of
investors by wealth had account sizes around $150,000--the average portfolio in our
sample is almost four thousand times larger. Second, unlike other datasets which
characterize institutional portfolios such as mutual fund portfolio holdings reports and
13-F filings (e.g. Chang et al. (2016b)), we are able to observe portfolio holdings
and changes to those holdings on a daily level. This allows us to test hypotheses
on individual decision-making that are infeasible with quarterly data. Additionally,
in the other most widely used database with institutional trading information--the
Abel Noser/ANcerno database (for an overview, see Hu, Jo, Wang, and Xie 2018)--
researchers often do not observe all trades made by a given institutional investor and
tend to lack timely information on portfolio holdings. Finally, unlike passive and re-
tail mutual funds, our sample is comprised of professional managers who are mostly
beholden to a single client (e.g. pension fund) and are paid to generate alpha through
concentrated portfolios that depart from the respective benchmark. These dierences
are highlighted in Appendix A.2, which compares characteristics of portfolios in our
sample to those in other datasets. As discussed further in Section 3, one notable con-
sequence of this is that PMs are not very constrained by client-mandated flows or tight
tracking error budgets (in contrast to mutual funds, e.g. Alexander et al. (2007) or
earlier studies of pension funds, e.g. Del Guercio and Tkac (2002)). This suggests that
trading decisions are largely up to the managers' discretions.
23
   This is an underestimate: our measure is right censored since we can only measure holding length
   beginning with the first portfolio snapshot.
24
   See Barber and Odean (2011) for a survey of studies using this and other similar datasets.

3      Overall Trading Performance

Having described the basic properties of our dataset, we now examine performance of
PMs' decisions. We begin by discussing our methodology for computing counterfactual
portfolio returns and, accordingly, value-added measures. We then present the first of
our empirical results, which correspond to the average value-added (or lost) associated
with managers' active buying and selling decisions.

3.1     Constructing counterfactuals

Given that PMs in our sample tend to hold limited cash positions and are not generally
permitted to use leverage, the primary mechanism for raising money to purchase new
assets is selling existing ones. Since the portfolios already include stocks that are
carefully selected to outperform their respective benchmarks, the choice of which asset
to sell is far from innocuous. Precisely if managers' use of information makes them
skilled at picking stocks, biased selling strategies have the potential to cannibalize
existing, still viable investment ideas and to reduce the potential value for executing
new ones. It is therefore important to construct the appropriate benchmark to serve as
the counterfactual for evaluating buying and selling decisions. In contrast, we would
expect unskilled investors neither to gain nor lose money (on a risk-adjusted basis) by
relying on a simple rule of thumb for selling existing positions.

      The fact that we observe daily transactions allows us to compare observed buy
and sell decisions to counterfactual strategies constructed using concurrent portfolio
holdings data. Our measures correspond to the relative payos from two hypothetical
experiments: one for evaluating buying decisions, and one for evaluating selling deci-
sions. For evaluating buys, suppose that we learned that a manager was planning to
invest $1 to purchase a stock tomorrow and to hold it for a fixed period of time. We
then suggest that instead of executing the proposed idea, the PM invests that money
in a randomly selected stock from her other holdings. Likewise, we can suggest that
instead of selling a particular stock, the PM randomly sells one of her other positions
to raise the same amount of cash, holding the stock that was to be sold for the same
period.

      Since our conditioning information was also available to the manager and our strate-


                                             14
gies are always feasible on the margin, one would expect decisions of a skilled PM to
outperform our counterfactual.25 Note that the expected payo from the counter-
factual strategy (integrating out uncertainty about which stock is randomly selected)
corresponds to the equal-weighted mean of realized returns across stocks held in the
portfolio, which we denote by Rhold . Similar results obtain if we use lagged portfo-
lio weights to construct a value-weighted mean instead. The manager's decision adds
value relative to the random counterfactual if Rbuy               Rhold > 0 in the first experiment
and if Rhold      Rsell > 0 in the second experiment. Following this logic, we compute
Rbuy    Rhold and Rhold        Rsell over horizons ranging from 1 week to 1 year for all buy
and sell trades, respectively, to characterize the value-added associated with each.

     If the return measure of interest is a cumulative return over the relevant horizon,
these measures capture the impact on benchmark-adjusted returns associated with
switching from the counterfactual to the actual trade, per dollar transacted. According
to our discussions with clients and managers these relative returns are the primary
metric by which our PMs are evaluated.26 That said, given that stocks should earn
ex-ante compensation for systematic risk exposures, our preferred measures will use
"factor-neutral" stock returns, all of which should earn the same expected return per
period. We estimate stock-level exposures to the Fama-French/Carhart 4 factors using
pre-trade data, then use them to adjust stock-level returns to hedge ex-ante dierences
in exposures. Further details about this method are presented in Appendix A.3.

     We aggregate across trades and conduct inference as follows. If multiple stocks are
bought or sold on a given day, we average these measures for buy and sell trades sepa-
rately. Since not all funds trade every day and are not necessarily present throughout
our sample period, this averaging procedure yields a portfolio-day unbalanced panel.
Because some funds trade much more frequently than others--see the dispersion in
25
   In contrast, selling the benchmark to finance a purchase, which implicitly corresponds to the coun-
   terfactual in measuring benchmark-adjusted returns of stocks sold, is likely infeasible for a long-only
   manager who, similar those in our sample, holds a portfolio with a small (relative to the number
   of assets in the benchmark) number of high active share positions and thus deviates substantially
   from the benchmark. Purchasing the benchmark is feasible on the other hand. We discuss concerns
   about transaction costs and price impact below.
26
   These measures also have an alternative interpretation to the extent that buy and sell trades are
   not motivated by a desire to change a portfolio's systematic risk exposures. In that case, we would
   expect loadings on priced factors of the assets being traded and the hold portfolio to be similar
   and these measures would also correspond to dierences in risk-adjusted returns (i.e., "alpha").
   Generally, we find similar results regardless of our approach for correcting for systematic risk.


                                                   15
monthly turnover in Table A.1--we weight observations inversely to a measure of trad-
ing frequency.27 We compute double-clustered standard errors using a panel estimator
similar to Hansen and Hodrick (1980). It allows individual fund time series to be seri-
ally correlated and additionally allows these value-added measures to cross-sectionally
correlated across PMs who place trades at similar times. While the autocorrelation
correction is likely required since our use of long horizon returns potentially introduces
an overlapping structure in the error term of each fund's value-added time series, the
latter adjustment turns out to be small. For further details, see Appendix A.4.

3.2       Overall performance relative to counterfactuals

Figure 1, Panel A shows average factor neutral counterfactual returns for buying deci-
sions. As will turn out to be the case across all of our specifications, we find strong evi-
dence that purchases add value relative to the random buy counterfactual, Rbuy Rhold .
The average stock bought outperforms the counterfactual by nearly 120 basis points
over a one year horizon.

       Figure 1, Panel B presents average value-added, Rhold            Rsell , for sell trades relative
to a factor neutral counterfactual. Recall that our measure is already signed so that
positive values indicate that a trade helps portfolio performance relative to the coun-
terfactual, and negative values point to a trade hurting performance. In stark contrast
to Panel A, these estimates suggest that managers' actual sell trades underperform a
simple random selling strategy. Magnitudes are quite substantial: The value lost from
an average sell trade is indistinguishable from zero at a 1 month horizon but on the
order of 80 basis points at a 1 year horizon relative to a simple counterfactual which
randomly sells other stocks held on the same day.

       To help assess magnitudes associated with these estimates, Table 2 links our per-
formance measures with portfolios' benchmark-adjusted returns. Specifically, Inalytics
provides a daily estimate of the benchmark-adjusted return on each portfolio, and,
for each portfolio, we compute the average of this return compounded over the next
27
     We weight observations inversely to the number of trading days in a calendar year that the fund
     buys and sells a stock. This measure allows for an easier comparison across buys and sells, since we
     use the same weights across both types of trades. We obtain similar results when we instead weight
     inversely to the number of days with trades (buys or sells), which ends up assigning a higher weight
     to funds with higher turnover.

      month, quarter, or year. We regress these measures on averages of our trade-based buy
      and sell performance measures over the same horizons.28 Importantly, both the buying
      and selling performance measures are strongly linked with benchmark-adjusted perfor-
      mance. This is consistent with poor selling imposing nontrivial opportunity costs on
      the PM's potential performance. Given that PMs in our sample have fairly long hold-
      ing periods, coe cients on our performance measures increase as the horizon increases;
      the coe cients on both measures range between 0.22-0.25 over a 1 year horizon. In
      the right panel, we see that results are unchanged if we control for the average dier-
      ence between the hold portfolio and the benchmark, which is somewhat similar to an
      overall attribution measure that can be computed with a single snapshot of holdings.
      28
           Similar results obtain if we weight portfolios by the length of time for which we observe data or use
           value-weighted performance measures in place of our baseline.

Table 2. Linking buying and selling-based performance measures with fund
benchmark-adjusted performance

This table presents the association between factor-adjusted portfolio returns in excess
of the benchmark and our measures of buying and selling performance. A fund's
average performance at holding, buying, and selling (by our measures) is highly
associated with the magnitude by which they beat their benchmark in the cross-
section, even after adjusting for exposures to value, size, market, and momentum
factors. Buy, sell, and hold portfolios are adjusted for factor exposures to value,
momentum, size, and market, calculated for the forward-looking horizons, the Buy -
Hold, Hold - Sell, and Hold - Benchmarks are computed for each fund date and then
averaged across the full sample by fund. Fund returns are similarly calculated on a
rolling basis and then averaged over the full period. Fund returns are not adjusted
for factor exposures, and neither are benchmarks. Benchmarks are assigned based on
what the fund manager has chosen for use with the Inalytics service.

Intriguingly, estimated coe cients on our trade-based performance measures are larger
than the Hold-Benchmark coe cient at longer horizons.

   As with any performance evaluation exercise, a number of questions emerge about
the robustness and interpretation of our main results. Accordingly, we have conducted
a battery of additional tests to address several of potential concerns. Table 3 reports
results from a subset of these tests in which we consider a variety of alternative ways of
constructing our performance measures, either by restricting the set of holdings/trades
used in the analysis or by changing the way in which we construct the relevant long-
short portfolios. See Appendix A.5 for a more detailed discussion and additional tests.

   First, we illustrate the implications of altering the approach for selecting securi-

ties for our no-skill random selling counterfactual. The first approach in row 2 uses
weights proportional to lagged portfolio values in place of equal weights for the hold
portfolio--analogous to selecting a security at random with a probability proportional
to size or selling all holdings pro-rata--and weights multiple buy/sell trades on the
same day proportionally to transaction size. The second approach in row 3 uses ad-
ditional available information to construct the counterfactual. It is rare for PMs to
sell stocks that were recently added to the portfolio (see Appendix Table A.8). Thus,
we construct a counterfactual hold portfolio which excludes stocks which are in the
bottom quintile of the distribution of holding length at each date. Both adjustments
yield modest increases in the buying performance measure and modest decreases in the
selling performance measure.

       Second, a natural concern is that stocks traded tend to have above average expo-
sures to systematic factors linked with expected returns relative to stocks held, meaning
that our estimates could be driven by risk compensation rather than skill. Indeed, any
performance evaluation exercise involves a joint hypothesis about whether the bench-
mark is correct. While our long-short construction dierences out many systematic
exposures which are common between stocks traded and held, there is always a possi-
bility that we are sorting on characteristics which are already known to drive expected
returns, presumably because they proxy for priced systematic factors. Specification 4
of Table 3 also reports estimated return measures from repeating the analysis in Figure
1 using raw cumulative returns. Results are quite similar between our baseline and this
unadjusted specification, so the explicit role of the Carhart risk adjustment procedure
on our overall estimates is small or nonexistent. We also leverage financial information
from the Worldscope database to construct characteristics following the approach of
Daniel et al. (1997) (row 5), matching counterfactual trades based on joint quintiles by
size, book to market, and momentum characteristics. Rows 6-7 match counterfactuals
by quintiles of characteristics which are potentially correlated with propensity to sell
assets (as we show below)--prior returns over the previous quarter and idiosyncratic
volatility.29 While each exercise changes magnitudes to some modest extent, results
29
     Further, to allow for the possibility that PMs adjust position sizes partly to reflect ex-ante expecta-
     tions about benchmark-adjusted returns from systematic factors, we also demonstrate that results
     are quite similar if we select the counterfactuals within the same quintile by position size (row 8).
     We discuss the role of conviction further in section 4.5 below. See also Appendix A.5 for many
     additional tests. Appendix A.9 shows that we find similar results if we express long-short returns


                                                      20
are quite consistent across all specifications: both the annualized outperformance of
buys and underperformance of sells are always statistically significant and economically
meaningful in magnitude.

    Third, we consider the potential role of unobserved transaction costs in driving our
results. Perhaps the hold portfolio includes many illiquid stocks which would be too
costly (whether due to direct trading costs or indirect costs from price impact) to sell.
In this case, our estimates of value-added relative to a feasible counterfactual poten-
tially neglect any dierences in these transaction costs between the security traded
and our proposed alternative. To address this concern, we have conducted a battery
of tests which drop the smallest (by market capitalization) or least liquid (by Amihud
liquidity measures) stocks in our sample (see e.g., rows 9-10) and/or form counterfac-
tuals matched within-portfolio by quintiles of these measures. Similar results obtain if
we omit the smallest or least liquid stocks from counterfactual portfolios only.

    In addition, it is possible that PMs' actual buy and sell trades could be su ciently
large so as to generate price impacts. In that case, we could measure a change in the
price of the security actually traded but fail to incorporate a corresponding change
which would have been induced in the counterfactual portfolio if it was traded instead.
Mean reversion in prices would tend to bias both performance measures downward.
Our approach to addressing this concern is simple: since these direct price impacts
are largely transitory, we can compute performance starting several days after the
transaction takes place, which allows for transitory eects to dissipate (row 11).30 Our
results are not meaningfully aected across these specifications.31
   in the modal currency of each portfolio rather than USD. In addition, Appendix A.10 conducts a
   complementary analysis in which we form long-short calendar time portfolios on the basis of signals
   which are constructed using our trading data. These portfolios, which buy stocks recently sold by
   PMs and short sell stocks recently held, earn very high Sharpe ratios due to substantial benefits
   of diversifying across (largely uncorrelated) positions traded by dierent PMs. For several rea-
   sons which we discuss further there, we prefer our baseline approach to the calendar time portfolio
   method. However, these results are consistent with our main analysis, and these portfolios earn
   Sharpe ratios which are consistent with the degree of diversification implied by standard errors on
   our baseline point estimates.
30
   Further note that the timing over which underperformace of selling, which is most pronounced at
   longer horizons, manifests is inconsistent with a simple price impact explanation.
31
   While these analyses help to rule out a number of concerns related to transaction costs and potential
   price impacts, we acknowledge some potential limitations of these tests. First, we do not observe
   intraday data, so our analysis cannot capture profits which were captured at a very high frequency
   (see, e.g., Puckett and Yan 2011). As a result, while the daily frequency of our data does allow
   us to rule out favorable intraquarter trading as driving our results, we are unable to directly test


                                                  21
      Finally, Appendix A.5 also presents several empirical tests which address the poten-
tial role for position size limits and tracking error budgets in driving our main results.
Once again, we find little evidence consistent with PMs facing constraints which "force"
sales which underperform a random selection of existing holdings. Perhaps most con-
vincingly, we find almost no correlation between the "Buy - Hold" portfolio and the
"Sell - Hold" portfolio (between 1.5% and 2.5%) for buys and sells on the same days,
suggesting that there are not systematic factor exposures matched between buys and
sells within portfolios. If a PM were trying to maximize return within a tracking error
constraint, we would expect trades on each side to have common factor exposures, so
as to not accidentally tilt the fund away from its target benchmark.

3.3     Heterogeneity

Thus far we have presented results based on averages across all PMs. In this section we
consider potential sources of heterogeneity in average buying and selling performance
across PMs in our sample. Figure 2 presents performance results based on a number
of covariates such as turnover, tracking error, and investment style. We find that
underperformance in selling appears most prominently amongst fundamentals-oriented
managers who hold more active, highly concentrated portfolios with higher tracking
error. PMs in this space may have fewer procedures in place to systematically process
information about existing holdings (e.g., one might expect these PMs to prioritize soft
information relative to quantitative relative valuation signals). In other words, if buys
are less related to systematic information, it might be less natural to have eective
systems to assist with selling decisions.
 whether sales are executed at particularly favorable intraday transaction prices. While this could
 be the case, we do observe that both our buying and selling measures predict benchmark-adjusted
 portfolio performance across short and longer horizons. Moreover, if unobserved trading costs were
 driving our results, then basic comparative statics logic would imply that matching on observable
 liquidity proxies and timing adjustments should significantly dampen the eect. We do not find
 evidence for this prediction. In this sense, our analysis parallels an approach taken in the literature
 which tries to test for adverse selection in insurance markets (see, e.g., Einav and Finkelstein 2011,
 for a survey) by testing for selection on observables.Thus, price impacts of the average individual
 trade that are large in magnitude and persistent over substantial periods of time (e.g. longer than
 1 week) could potentially change the interpretation of our selling results. Given the size of the
 portfolios (which is still fairly small relative to total institutional trading volume), the average trade
 size, and the results which omit illiquid securities and microcaps, we consider this possibility unlikely,
 but it is di cult to rule out completely.

Details on characteristics construction can be fund in Appendices A.2 and A.5.




         With respect to style, funds that score higher on momentum appear to perform
     better in selling; funds that score higher on value appear to underperform most in
     selling. Whereas selling is a key component of the momentum strategy, value plays--at
     least in terms of how they are described heuristically--are often more about identifying
     undervalued assets, which seems psychologically more closely aligned with buying. For
     further details, see Appendix A.2.

4      Explaining Underperformance

In this section, we propose a potential mechanism linking the use of heuristics to
systematic underperformance of selling strategies relative to a feasible counterfactual.
We then provide evidence for the mechanism by exploiting the panel nature of our
database to ask whether patterns in funds' actual trading strategies are associated
with predictable dierences in performance.

      We argue that our results can be explained by expertise with the asymmetric al-
location of cognitive resources: PMs focus more on buying and are prone to `fast',
heuristic decisions when selling. This conjecture implies that 1) shifts in cognitive re-
sources towards the latter has the potential to improve performance and 2) heuristics
associated with limited attention are more likely to be observed for selling than buying.

4.1     Potential Reasons for an Asymmetric Allocation of Attention

Our interviews with PMs suggest that decisions are overwhelmingly focused on the
buying domain relative to the selling domain. Why might this be the case? Several
institutional features oer partial explanations. Perhaps the most obvious reason is
that, as noted above, virtually all managers in our sample are fundamental rather
than quantitatively oriented and have very long holding periods. Research, especially
in-depth research that involves constructing custom valuation models and qualitative
judgements via conversations with management of various companies, is costly and
di cult. The fact that search processes emphasize large blocks of unstructured inter-
actions between PMs and clients (see, e.g., Goyal et al. 2020) suggests that being able
to present new investment ideas in a compelling narrative is an important qualitative
signal which helps PMs to win and keep existing business. As such, PMs may devote
the lion's share of their cognitive resources towards finding the next winner to add to
the portfolio.

      At the same time, a manager who is buying based on private relative valuation
judgements can also sell based on similar valuations. In an "information-ratio" cen-
tric world, where managers are evaluated based on bets relative to a benchmark, it
is straightforward to map short-selling type positions to an equivalent underweighted
position relative to a benchmark. For owned positions that make up a small propor-


                                           24
tion of the benchmark, relative value judgements still inform which stocks are best to
eliminate from a portfolio.

      In turn, even taking as given that the client-manager relationship may lead to an ini-
tial asymmetric allocation of attention, the question remains of why professional PMs
have not learned that their selling decisions are underperforming simple no-skill strate-
gies. Indeed, Table 2 suggests that poor selling has a substantial drag on benchmark-
adjusted returns, one of the key metrics which aects PMs' ability to attract clients
(Del Guercio and Tkac 2002). The environment in which fund managers make de-
cisions oers several clues. As Hogarth (2001) notes, learning requires frequent and
consistent feedback. While it is feasible to generate this type of feedback for both
buy and sell decisions, Appendix A.6 discusses how common reporting standards are
much better suited to identify underperformance in buying decisions than selling deci-
sions. Thus, PMs and their clients are more likely to receive frequent, valid feedback
about their purchases than their sales, which can explain the failure to learn about
underperformance in the latter domain.

      Importantly, a PM may have two potential reasons to sell a stock: first, she could
receive negative information about the stock and subsequently decide that its current
price is not justified, and second she could need to raise cash to finance a new buy.
Our results point to the second type of selling decision as being worse relative to a
counterfactual strategy of simply trimming equal amounts from every other position
(on either a value-weighted or equal-weighted basis). The first type of trade seems to
perform well; as we discuss in section 4.3, sales on earnings announcement days, when
PMs are likely to be paying more attention to their trades, perform significantly better
than on other days.

4.2     Bounded Rationality in Selling

How might bounded rationality aect PMs' trading decisions? Many models of decision-
making in psychology (Hauser and Wernerfelt 1990) and economics (Lleras, Masatli-
oglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay 2017) split choices between multiple alternatives--in our
case, choosing what asset(s) to buy and sell--into two stages: generating a considera-
tion set and then selecting an option from that set. Prior work has shown that cognitive
constraints can lead to the use of heuristics in both stages of the process (Hauser 2014).


                                              25
For example, Barber and Odean (2008) posit a two-stage process for both buying and
selling decisions, where limited attention constrains the consideration set to assets with
salient attributes and biases in preferences lead to potentially suboptimal choices from
that consideration set.32 We outline how a two-stage decision-model would operate
in our setting and provide evidence for bounded rationality in both stages of the sell-
ing process but, importantly, not the buying process. We then demonstrate how the
specific heuristics we document can potentially explain the results presented in the
preceding sections, including the underperformance of sales relative to a random-sell
counterfactual.

     In the first stage, rather than considering the entire portfolio, we posit that limited
attention places bounds on the consideration set (Hirshleifer and Teoh 2003). Re-
search in psychology and economics has found that these consideration sets are often
determined by the ranking and filtering of objects based on salient attributes.33 Infor-
mation on prior returns is ubiquitous, and according to models of salience (Bordalo,
Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2013), the high variation around average returns should make
this attribute particularly top-of-mind for a fast-thinking PM.34 In turn, extreme devi-
ations in relative returns in either the positive or negative direction naturally emerge
as candidates for filtering assets to be included in the consideration set.

     In the second stage, the PM must choose which assets from the consideration set to
trade. According to the attribute substitution framework of (Kahneman and Frederick
2002), people making `fast,' heuristic decisions may replace the more di cult question
of "which asset in this set is least likely to outperform in the future" with an easier
question to answer, such as "how much conviction do I have in this position?" or
"how well do I understand this company?" This attribute substitution process can
potentially generate systematic underperformance if it leads PMs to, for example, sell
still-viable investment ideas.
32
   Also see Sakaguchi, Stewart, and Walasek (2017) for how a two-stage model explains the disposition
   eect.
33
   See Lleras et al. (2017) for an overview of such attention-based filtering in decision-making. For
   example, in consumer choice Gourville and Soman (2007) find that people faced with options that
   dier along several attributes end up only considering those that rank on the extreme ends of those
   dimensions.
34
   Consistent with this, former investment banker and Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine writes "The
   rule of thumb wisdom for buying is about fundamentals, but for selling it's usually about price ac-
   tion." https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-10/investors-have-to-sell-stocks-too.



                                                 26
     Consistent with attention-based filtering in the first stage, we first show that ex-
ogenous events which potentially expand PMs' consideration sets by drawing attention
to current holdings--earnings announcement days--are associated with substantially
better selling performance. We then demonstrate that positions with extreme returns
are indeed over-represented in PMs' consideration sets: assets that are in the top or
bottom 5 percent based on prior returns are nearly 50 percent more likely to be sold
relative to those that just over- or underperformed. Importantly, consistent with the
conjecture that more attention is channeled towards buying than selling, earnings an-
nouncement days are not associated with changes in buying performance and prior
returns have no detectable association with purchase decisions.35 Finally, we show
that low conviction assets are significantly more likely to be sold from the PMs' con-
sideration sets and that the systematic sale of these assets can potentially explain the
associated underperformance.

     Note that, at first glance, these results might appear to contrast with those of Bar-
ber and Odean (2008), who find that retail traders' buying decisions are more prone
to attention-based heuristics than their selling decisions. We argue that the two sets
of results are complementary once one considers important dierences in the groups'
decision environments and levels of expertise. Barber and Odean (2008) argue that
salient cues are more likely to aect buying decisions because it is much more di cult
to attend to the entire set of potential buying opportunities than the limited num-
ber of stocks in one's portfolio. On the buying side, PMs are less likely to display
attention-driven heuristics because of the process involved in purchasing an asset. As
is described in Section 2.1, managers spend a great deal of time and resources culti-
vating an investment universe that includes the set of stocks that they are considering
at any given time. Active research identifies potential mispricing and investment op-
portunities, at which point the PM will add the respective assets to their portfolio.36
Moreover, institutional investors are likely to possess expertise that retail traders do
not; as a result, when PMs' cognitive resources are devoted to a decision, those deci-
35
   The results from Hartzmark (2014) oer additional support for our proposed mechanism of expertise
   with asymmetric allocation of cognitive resources: retail investors, who tend to be less sophisticated
   overall, appear to make both their selling and buying decisions based on extreme returns.
36
   This process is described at length in David Swensen's bestselling text titled "Pioneering Portfolio

sions are considerably more likely to outperform those of retail investors.37 Thus PMs'
purchases are less likely to be heuristic-driven because of the combination of exper-
tise and resources devoted to the decision. On the other hand, if PMs are devoting
few resources to their selling decisions, those choices are more likely to be driven by
attentional heuristics. Notably, while the retail traders in Barber and Odean (2008)
hold 4.3 assets on average, PMs in our sample hold 78.5. While it is possible even
for an attention-constrained individual to consider the entire portfolio when it only
includes 4.3 stocks, this is less likely to be the case for a portfolio that is almost 20
times larger. In turn, we would expect that the consequence of asymmetric resource
allocation towards buying decisions would manifest as attention-based heuristics on
the selling side.

4.3     Performance on announcement days

We gather earnings announcement dates from the I/B/E/S database and recompute
our counterfactual return strategies for stocks which are bought/sold on those days,
relative to all other trading days.38 Managers have a strong incentive to pay close
attention to stocks in their portfolios on these dates for several reasons. As discussed
in Section 1, the information in financial statements, associated press releases, and
conference calls (which even oer opportunities for managers to directly address ques-
tions to the company) provide a wealth of new pieces of hard and soft information that
are decision-relevant and can potentially improve trading performance (Easley et al.
2008). This information is both (relatively) easily available and salient, since earnings
announcement dates are known in advance, and results are heavily covered by the fi-
nancial press. In turn, we conjecture that earnings announcements prompt PMs to
broaden their consideration sets of what to sell, potentially mitigating the constraints
imposted by attentional heuristics.

      Panel II of Table 4 presents the dierence in average performance of trades on
announcement versus non-announcement days. Panel A reports the dierence be-
37
   This is reflected in the stark dierence in overall performance. While PMs in our sample largely
   outperform their respective benchmarks, retail traders actually underperform the market (Odean
   1999).
38
   Our results do not change if we look at performance of trades within a 1, 2, 3, or 4 day window of
   the announcement.

  tween average value-added of buy trades executed on earnings announcement days
  compared with average value-added from all other buy trades.39 There is little sys-
  tematic dierence in performance, and whatever dierences exist are not statistically
  significant. This is consistent with attentional resources already being devoted towards
  purchase decisions; information released on earnings announcement days is carefully
  incorporated into purchase decisions just like other forms of information is used on non-
  announcement days. Panel B demonstrates the stark contrast in the performance of
  selling decisions on announcement versus non-announcement days. Selling decisions on
  announcement days add substantially more value than those sold on non-announcement
  days. Our point estimate of this dierence is 154 basis points over a one year horizon
  in the baseline specification, with all estimates at the 180 day horizon and onwards
  being significant at the 5% level. These results hold for raw returns as well.
  39
       Given the much smaller number of observations associated with stocks sold on earnings announce-
       ment dates, the average performance of sells on earnings announcement dates is positive but impre-
       cisely estimated. Accordingly, we emphasize and report dierences between average returns on non
       announcement days rather than levels. Point estimates for non-announcement days are virtually
       identical to the overall numbers in section I of Table 3. When computing a standard error for the
       dierence between the two estimates, we impose the assumption that the covariance between the two
       estimates is zero. This is likely conservative, given that most likely the two estimates are positively
       correlated (e.g., because stocks sold on earnings announcement days might also be sold several days
       later as well), which would have the eect of reducing the standard error on the dierence.



                                                        29
      Finally, Panel II of Table 4 compares the dierence between average performance of
buys and sells on earnings announcement days versus non-announcement days. In the
baseline specification, our point estimate of selling performance on announcement days
is +79 bp at a 1 year horizon, which is only 5 bp lower than the corresponding estimate
for buying performance on those days. In contrast, buys outperform sells by nearly
200 bp at a 1 year horizon on all other dates, and dierences in relative magnitudes
are similarly large at other horizons as well.

      These findings suggest that when contemporaneous predetermined events shift PMs'
attention towards existing positions--leading them consider a wider set of assets and
information than they otherwise would when deciding what to sell--their selling perfor-
mance improves substantially. In Appendix A.8, we present complementary evidence
consistent with better selling performance when PMs are more likely to attend to these
trades. In particular, we argue that larger transactions are more likely to be `slow' de-
cisions that are attended to. Indeed, we show that the largest quintile of sales based
on transaction size does not underperform the counterfactual at longer horizons, while
all other quintiles underperform. Together, this evidence suggests that the overall poor
selling performance is does not seem to be due to a fundamental lack of skill in selling.

4.4     Predicting Buying and Selling Decisions

We now attempt to provide more direct evidence that attention constrains PMs' con-
sideration sets in what to sell--but not in what to buy--by looking at the relationship
between trade decisions and prior returns.

4.4.1     Measuring association between prior returns and trade decisions

For each portfolio-date, we identify a set of stocks (a subset of holdings in the prior day's
portfolio) potentially under consideration to be bought or sold, rank existing holdings
according to past benchmark-adjusted returns, and then ask whether managers are
more likely to trade based on these ranks. Given the size of our dataset, we adopt
a flexible, non-parametric approach to measuring managers' tendency to buy and sell
positions based on past returns. Specifically, for the set of prior holdings which are
included in the analysis, we compute a measure of returns, usually relative to the
benchmark over the same horizon. For each portfolio and trading date, we sort prior

                                             30
positions into 20 bins using these relative rankings, where we set the breakpoint between
bins 10 and 11 equal to zero, so that all stocks in bin 10 and below have declined relative
to the benchmark. We also emphasize within-manager rankings, rather than absolute
levels of these measures, since the definition of "extreme returns" depends on the types
                                                                   40
of assets in a given PM's investment opportunity set.

     While this approach is straightforward for a long-only PM's selling decisions given
that the consideration set for sell trades is composed of the current holdings, con-
structing the consideration set for buying decisions requires taking additional factors
into account. Our first approach looks at purchases of assets that already exist in the
portfolio; this captures the majority of buys, including large ones (adding up to 99 per-
cent to existing holdings). Our second approach, described in Appendix A.7, includes
all purchase decisions--including the opening of brand new positions--and calculates
relative prior returns by broadening the consideration set to assets that are likely being
considered for purchase.

     For this exercise, our preferred measure of prior returns is computed as follows.
For positions which were opened more than 1 quarter (90 days) prior to the date of
interest, we use the benchmark-adjusted return of the stock from 90 calendar days prior
through the trading day before the date of interest. For positions with shorter holding
periods, we change the starting point for computing the benchmark-adjusted return to
the opening date.41 We use this as our preferred measure because performance is often
reported to clients at a quarterly frequency, and, from a more pragmatic perspective,
this construction is less sensitive to fact that position opening dates are left-censored.
However, as we show in Section 4.4.2, results are robust to alternative definitions of
past returns.42
40
   For details on constructing the bins, see Appendix A.7
41
   Results are robust to a wide variety of horizons and whether of not gains and losses are computed
   since purchase or over a fixed horizon. For example, in Appendix Table A.7, we report probabilities
   of buying using a prior return measure which does not depend on the time of initial purchase and
   does not impose the restriction on holding length. In that specification, our main results on the
   relationship between average buying probabilities and prior returns maintain.
42
   We find nearly identical results if we restrict attention to stocks with opening dates that are observed
   during our sample. To avoid a fairly mechanical relationship between our prior return measure and
   the probability that a manager will add to/reduce an existing position from splitting trades across
   adjacent days (see Appendix A.7), we exclude stocks that were bought in the very recent past.
   Related to this concern, our regression analyses below always control for the holding period since
   the position was opened and the holding period since last buy, as well as squared terms of each.



                                                    31
4.4.2   Buying and selling based on past returns

We present results as fractions of positions that are bought or sold within each of
the prior return bins. These fractions, which can be interpreted as probabilities, are
computed by first calculating the proportion of stocks sold within each bin at the
fund-date level, then averaging across all fund-dates in the sample. Figure 3 depicts
the results for selling and buying decisions of assets that are already held graphically
using a variety of dierent prior return measures, with 20 bins formed on each measure.
Bins are sorted from left to right according to prior returns. We begin with the buying
probabilities. The probability of purchasing a stock already held is quite flat across the
bins of prior returns. These results hold across all prior return measures considered
and no pronounced patterns appear as we move towards more extreme bins in all cases.

   A very dierent picture emerges for the selling probabilities. Assets with more
extreme relative returns are substantially more likely to be sold relative to stocks in the
central bins. An asset with a prior return in one of the most extreme bins is more than
50 percent more likely to be sold than an asset with a less extreme return. Moreover,
assets in these most extreme bins (1 and 20) have much higher selling probabilities
than adjacent bins; such discrete jumps are altogether absent for buying probabilities.
Despite the fact dierent specifications use prior return measures calculated over a
variety of horizons, a very pronounced U-shape appears across all.

   In Appendix A.7 and Appendix Table A.7, we report two additional results on
the relationship between prior returns and buying/selling strategies. First, we extend
the analysis to allow for a wider consideration set for purchases; this enables us to
incorporate additions of new stocks into the analysis. As above, we find essentially
no relationship between prior returns and the likelihood that a stock is purchased. In
addition, we look at the relationship between making large purchases or sales (which
more than double or halve the existing portfolio weight) and prior returns. Again, we
find a strong relationship between extremeness of prior returns and selling probabilities,
while seeing no such relationship for purchases.

   The U-shaped selling pattern is similar to the rank eect in Hartzmark (2014),
where retail traders are more likely to buy and sell assets with extreme returns. Hartz-
mark (2014) documents a similar rank eect in mutual funds as well. However, due to

This set of figures reports daily buying (blue) and selling (red) probabilities for stocks in the
portfolio sorted into 20 bins by various past return measures. Panel A sorts on cumulative past
benchmark-adjusted returns since the purchase date or one quarter/year, whichever is shortest.
Panel B sorts on past benchmark- adjusted returns of a position over one quarter and one year.
Panel C sorts on past raw returns of a position over one week and one day. The ten bins on the

returns.

the use of quarterly data, he notes that the behavior can be driven by strategic con-
cerns in response to investor preferences. We show that in contrast to these findings,
expert PMs display this heuristic when selling but not when buying. Additionally, as
outlined in Section 5, our ability we see each manager's entire portfolio and trades over
time allows us to study whether this heuristic is costly for institutional investors. The
richness of the dataset also permits exploring the underlying psychological mechanism,
yielding evidence that the heuristic is driven by an asymmetric allocation of attention
and that its costs are not driven by the unloading of extreme positions per se, but
rather by the types of positions sold from the constrained consideration set.43

4.4.3     Alternative explanations

We now consider several instrumental reasons that could potentially explain our results.
As discussed in Section 2, the vast majority of portfolios in our sample are tax-exempt,
so the U-shaped selling pattern cannot be rationalized with tax concerns. Our finding
that sales are more likely for positions with extreme returns over very long (1 year)
and very short (1 week) horizons makes agency-based explanations--where PMs are
reluctant to report realized losses to their clients--unlikely. Agency-based explanations
also seem unlikely to explain the large jumps in probabilities observed between the 19th
and 20th (1st and 2nd ) bins relative to the 18th and 19th (2nd and 3rd ) bins. These jumps
are consistent with limited attention constraining the consideration set of what to sell,
as the top and bottom 5 percent of returns are much more likely to be displayed and
made salient to PMs (see Ungeheuer (2017) for direct evidence). This also mitigates
concerns about risk management motives, since the relative risk of assets in extreme
bins is likely to be fairly comparable to less extreme adjacent bins.44

     We also examine whether our observed pattern can be explained by other variables
43
   Ben-David and Hirshleifer (2012) document a related phenomenon where retail investors are more
   likely to sell securities with high or low prior returns; An (2015) shows that stocks with such returns
   are more likely to outperform in the following month. This V-shaped trading pattern is distinct
   from ours in that the high or low returns are calculated at the level of the individual security rather
   than with respect to overall portfolio returns. Moreover, the pattern is documented both for buying
   and selling decisions.
44
   In subsequent regression analyses, we will include controls for idiosyncratic volatility, systematic fac-
   tor exposures, and position size, all of which are potentially relevant for risk management. Inclusion
   of these controls generally has a very limited impact on estimates analogous to the nonparametric
   statistics presented above.



                                                    34
which could be correlated with our prior return measures: holding length and position
size. We find that both the U-shaped selling pattern and the flat buying pattern is
observed across the holding length and position size variable sorts. For more detailed
results, see Appendix A.7.

   Finally, Table 5 reports estimates from a series of linear probability models for the
likelihood of selling or buying, which allow us to control for a number of time-varying
fund characteristics (either via controls, fund fixed eects, or fund-date fixed eects),
calendar time eects, as well as other position characteristics. All specifications include
linear and quadratic controls for holding length since the position was opened, holding
length since last buy, and position-level portfolio weight (as a fraction of total portfolio
assets under management). The key regressors of interest are dummies for each of the
prior return categories, which have the same interpretation as the bins used in the
preceding analyses, where the omitted category remains bin 10 (slight loser positions).
Results are similar with dierent prior return measures and dierent numbers of bins.

   We begin with the right panel which characterizes selling probabilities. Across all of
these specifications, the dierence in the predicted probability of selling a stock in bin
20 is at least 50 percent higher than the probability of selling a stock in bins 6 through
15, and always considerably higher than bin 19. Likewise, we observe similar strong
nonlinearities for stocks in bins 1 through 2 relative to more central bins. Column
4 includes stock-date fixed eects as in Hartzmark (2014), so the main coe cients
of interest are identified via variation in the relative return categories across portfolio
managers who hold the same stock on the same date. Even then, we find that positions
in the most extreme returns bins are substantially more likely to be sold.

   Turning to the left panel, the relationship between buying probabilities and prior
return measures is much more muted. In the loss domain, most of the coe cients are
insignificant despite being estimated on a sample of over 50 million observations. Even
the significant coe cients are substantially smaller in magnitude than the coe cients
associated with selling probabilities. In the saturated specification presented in column
5, only the coe cient on bin 1 is statistically distinguishable from zero. Looking at
large positive returns, we observe a greater number of significant coe cients, but the
dierences between central and extreme bins (e.g., bins 16 through 18 and bin 20 or
bins 19 and 20) are very small relative to the same dierences for sales.

     This table presents position-level estimates of a linear probability model (in percentage points) for the likelihood of trading a
     given stock. The key explanatory variables of interest are indicators corresponding to 20 bins of past benchmark-adjusted returns
     capped at one year, where the tenth bin is the omitted category. We control for fund characteristics including lagged log(AUM),
     prior-month turnover, the annual volatility of a funds benchmark-adjusted returns, and prior month loadings on Fama-French
     Cahart regressions (calculated using the Dimson (1979) procedure using 1 year of prior daily returns). We adjust for position-level
     characteristics including linear and quadratic terms in holding lengths (overall and since last buy) and position sizes(% AUM)
     at the beginning of the day. The coe cients and t-statistics are reported for the estimates on each bin. We present versions of
     these estimates which condition on trading (buys for buying probability, sells for selling probability) in Table A.9 in Appendix
     A.7.

      Taking stock, the regression specifications, in conjunction with the nonparametric
evidence in Appendix Table A.8, suggest that the considered sources of omitted variable
bias are unlikely to explain our results. Additionally, Table A.9 calculates the same
model, conditional on a trade (at least one buy on a given day for a given fund when
analyzing buys, and at least one sell when analyzing sells). We find that the results
are qualitatively similar, but with much larger magnitudes for the selling decisions.
Together these results are consistent with non-instrumental motives driving selling but
not buying decisions.

4.5     Selling and Conviction

We now examine which assets from the consideration set PMs choose to sell. As
discussed above, the attribute substitution framework of Kahneman and Frederick
(2002) predicts that people making heuristic decisions may replace the di cult question
of determining which asset is least likely to outperform with an easier question related
to conviction or psychological attachment. To capture this, we order positions based
on their active share, or how much they are overweighted relative to the benchmark
(Cremers and Petajisto 2009). This measure captures how much the PM stands to gain
if the stock beats the benchmark.45 Assets with high active share typically correspond
to positions that the manager has spent a good deal of eort building up over time,
becoming familiar and attached to the firm in the process. This costly procedure likely
generates greater conviction in the position for non-instrumental reasons, such as sunk
costs or psychological ownership (Anagol, Balasubramaniam, and Ramadorai 2018;
Heath 1995; Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1990).

      Positions with low active share can manifest for three main reasons: 1) a position
had a high active share but has done very poorly, 2) the PM has added a position
to the portfolio but has not built it into a larger one, or 3) the PM chooses to hold
a position close to the benchmark weight of a stock which is large in the benchmark
(or underweight, though negative active shares are fairly uncommon).46 The PM may
45
   Active share is calculated by taking the dierence between a PM's weight on a stock in the fund and
   subtracting the corresponding weight, if any, of the same stock in the client-provided benchmark, a
   measure which is provided to us by Inalytics. Since performance is evaluated based on benchmark-
   adjusted returns, an asset that is overweighted generates excess returns when it goes up and excess
   losses when it goes down.
46
   A fourth alternative is that the PM has actively reduced a formerly large position through prior

adjusted returns double sorted with bins of position-level active share, relative to a baseline category

dierent active share bins, along with the dierence across rows between the smallest active share bin
and the average across the other bins (active share bins 2-4). Calculations for 8 categories of prior

probability for the 10th bin in the last row.

      still have conviction in a stock in the first category as she had exerted time and eort
      in building it up in the past. Rather than reflecting a particular view about future
      returns, assets in the third category may be in place to minimize exposure of a fund's
      relative returns to the idiosyncratic returns of large assets in the benchmark.

          In contrast, assets in the second category are most likely to include the PM's `ne-
      glected ideas.' The manager has gathered enough favorable information on each asset
      to add a position to the portfolio, but has not elected to build it up further. In turn,
      heuristic thinking would generate fewer reasons to keep a low active share asset in
      this category. Moreover, time-constrained PMs may monitor them less closely than
      higher conviction positions, especially if other factors draw attention elsewhere (e.g.
      attractive buying opportunities). Thus, in discarding these positions, PMs may be
      throwing out still-viable investment ideas--ones potentially capable of outperforming
      many existing holdings--especially if high conviction positions are more likely to have
      already realized their anticipated upside potential.

                                                       38
       Table 6 documents the PMs' propensity to sell based on active share, both overall
and within each of the 20 bins of prior returns. To construct this table, assets within
each portfolio are sorted into four bins based on their active share. We then construct a
measure capturing the propensity to sell an asset based on its prior returns; specifically,
the dierence in the probability of selling a stock in a given bin of prior returns relative
to the middle one (bin 10, Slight Loser). The last column reports the dierence between
the lowest active share bin and the average across the other three active share bins in
the same row of prior returns. We report baseline probabilities for the omitted bin in
the last row.

       Results are consistent with PMs being most prone to selling neglected ideas, as
measured by low active share, from the consideration set of extreme returns.47 First,
examining the baseline probabilities, we note that low active share positions are sub-
stantially more likely to be sold regardless of the level of prior returns. Second, we
find that stocks in the lowest active share bin are much more likely to be sold when
they exhibit prior returns below the benchmark, especially extreme ones, relative to
high active share assets. The probability of selling a stock with the lowest active share
and lowest prior return bin is 5.6, or 140 percent larger than the baseline probability
of selling, which is 2.3. Assets in these bins are also 155 percent more likely to be
sold than those which experienced similar levels of underperformance (bin 1) but have
the highest active share. Thus, low active share positions are particularly likely to be
discarded when they are in the consideration set of extreme underperformance. Sell-
ing probabilities in the lowest active share bin are relatively less aected by moderate
gains, and responses to the most extreme gains in bin 20 are similar regardless of active
share.

       We then examine whether sales of low active share assets tend to underperform
relative to a random selling counterfactual. Panel A of Table 7 depicts the perfor-
mance of sales relative to a random counterfactual by bins of stocks' active share for
our baseline value-added measure. As above, we sort positions into four bins based on
a prior day estimate of active share, then separately form counterfactual performance
measures for these dierent subsamples of trades. We see a stark contrast in perfor-
mance: assets in the lowest three active share bins underperform substantially more
47
     Consistent with results in the prior section, we find that buying probabilities do not exhibit a
     significant relationship with prior returns.

This table presents the average factor-neutral returns relative to random sell counterfactuals for
sell portfolios sorted by active share. We compute average returns of stock held minus returns of
stocks sold. We rank the active share measures within funds at a daily level and sort them into
four bins from Lowest, Low-Med, Med-High to Highest sizes. For the Lowest Active Share bin, we
further split into two halves by a position's weight: Smaller positions (below the 50th percentile)
and Larger positions (above the 50th percentile), after sorting by active share. Columns represent
sell performance measures at the following horizons: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months,
and 1 year. We report point estimates of average counterfactual returns for each portfolio at
dierent horizons. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors, computed using
the method described in the section A.4, are reported in parentheses.

     than sales of assets in the top active share bin, where the latter performs much closer
     to the the counterfactual. This is consistent with PMs holding on to high active share
     assets when thinking fast; thus, when sales of those positions are observed, they are
     more likely to be informed ones.

            As discussed above, very low active share positions may be held to hedge a fund's
     exposure to idiosyncratic returns of large stocks in the benchmark. These positions
     would appear in the data as having a very low active share and a high portfolio weight.48
     In turn, we separate stocks in the lowest active share bin into two categories based on
     absolute position size, and recompute our counterfactual performance measures for
     these subsamples. Whereas large positions with low active share tend to have positive
     48
          As an example, if Apple is 3% of a PM's benchmark index we might observe a position in Apple
          of 3% which would have an active share of zero, despite the fact that 3% would be a quite large
          absolute position size.



                                                        40
counterfactual performance measures (consistent with these being somewhat passive
positions and good candidates for sales), we find that sales of assets from the second
`neglected ideas' category--low active share and low position size--to substantially
underperform.

     It is tempting to conclude from these results that since the underperformance of
selling strategies is associated with low active share (usually smaller) positions, the
costs in terms of overall portfolio performance associated with these transactions is
likely to be small. However, this reasoning is incorrect provided that changes in port-
folio weights induced by selling smaller initial positions are similar to those from selling
larger ones. Holding trade size as a fraction of portfolio market value constant, the
cost in foregone profits from a suboptimal trade are independent of the initial size
of the position.49 Indeed, we find that average trade sizes for sells are quite similar
across both active share and initial position size bins. Further, recall from Table 2
above that our measures of average selling performance are highly predictive of overall
benchmark-adjusted performance.

     In addition, we note that poor selling is likely associated with performance in two
ways. The first is a direct eect: it changes the weights in the current portfolio. The
second is an indirect eect: `fast' selling of low conviction positions may lead those
stocks to be discarded from the consideration set of future buys. Consistent with the
potential importance of this latter eect, we find that, once sold, assets are substantially
less likely to be purchased again, suggesting that attention-constrained elimination of
small positions may interfere with a PM's security selection process.50

     Note that it is possible that our results may be explained by an alternative mech-
anism which can generate underperformance of sales as a function of only the first
stage outlined above. Specifically, if extreme positions are ranked similarly across a
large enough number of institutional portfolios and sold for reasons unrelated to funda-
49
   Further, since the eect of an idiosyncratic stock return on overall portfolio variance is a convex
   function of the weight, one could argue that the eect on measures of performance that adjust for
   idiosyncratic risk exposures such as the information ratio are larger for small positions.
50
   Before a security has been sold once, there is a 76% chance that the portfolio will purchase a security
   at least once more. After the first time a portfolio sells a security, there is only a 40% chance the
   portfolio will ever increase its position in that security again before liquidating it. Once a stock is
   removed from the portfolio, there is only a 40% chance that the position is ever added back to the
   portfolio. On the intensive margin, the daily probability that a stock is purchased again declines
   from 3.3% to 2.4% once a stock is sold for the first time.


                                                   41
mental value, then the increased propensity to sell them can generate downward price
pressure on current prices. Although the decision to unload an asset by an individual
investor may have been driven by contextual factors specific to their portfolios, if the
asset is categorized as extreme in enough portfolios, then this would lead to perfor-
mance being a function of prior returns at the market level. An (2015) and An and
Argyle (2016) provide evidence from holdings of individuals and mutual funds sug-
gesting that, as selling pressure is reduced over the medium term, subsequent mean
reversion in prices can lead these stocks to systematically outperform on a risk-adjusted
basis going forward.51


5     Heuristic use and Performance

In this section, we exploit the panel nature of our dataset in order to illustrate a more
direct link between the performance of selling strategies and fund-level characteristics,
such as the propensity to sell assets with extreme returns. As in Section 3, we compare
the returns of the actual stocks traded with counterfactual random selling strategies.
We then ask whether patterns in funds' actual trading strategies are associated with
predictable dierences in performance. To operationalize this, we compute several
fund-level characteristics and sort fund-weeks into categories based on these character-
istics, then compute the average value-added associated with PMs' trades in each bin.
Before proceeding, we note that this analysis is only able to identify correlations in
the data, so it is not feasible to rule out other time-varying fund characteristics which
simultaneously drive performance and observable properties of trading behavior.

     We begin by considering the impact of heuristic use on performance. Based on the
mechanism outlined in Section 4.1, we use the greater propensity to sell assets with
extreme returns as a proxy for heuristic use.52 To capture what we term `heuristic
intensity,' positions are sorted into 4 bins based on the fraction of stocks sold that
are located in the extreme bins (Worst Loser and Best Winner) for each fund-week.53
51
   At the same time, as we discuss further in Appendix A.4, we find very little correlation between
   stocks sold at the same time in our dataset. These correlations are slightly positive for stocks sold
   on the same day and slightly negative at other leads and lags, which provides some evidence against
   this channel in our data.
52
   This greater propensity is only a proxy for heuristic use because, as demonstrated in Section 4.1,
   PMs do not randomly sell assets from the consideration set of extreme returns.
53
   For instance, the mean of this heuristics intensity measure is around 0.4 on a monthly basis, which


                                                  42
In order to reduce noise in the measures related to discreteness, we only compute the
heuristic intensity measure for funds which hold at least 24 stocks (i.e., there are 4
stocks on average per bin) and only include fund-weeks in which at least 3 stocks are
traded.54 We then rank fund-weeks into four categories according to this measure to
calculate relative performance of the associated selling decisions. Our primary rationale
for a weekly frequency is that it provides a satisfactory balance between reducing
potential noise in the sorting variable (by averaging over multiple trades) while still
operating at a high enough frequency to capture variation in heuristic-use.

    Panel A of Table 8 presents sample averages of counterfactual returns sorted into
four bins based on heuristic intensity within-fund. Over the course of each PM's time
series, each week is sorted into one of four categories based on its level of heuristic
intensity. We find that our proxy for heuristic intensity is positively associated with
significant underperformance. The highest levels of heuristic intensity are associated
with the worst performance, especially at the longer horizons. Magnitudes are quite
substantial: at a 1 year frequency, the highest level of heuristic intensity predicts an
average of around 220 foregone basis points relative to a random-sell counterfactual.
At the same time, average performance of sales which occur when PMs are selling fewer
extreme positions is statistically indistinguishable from the counterfactual. Appendix
A.8 demonstrates the robustness of our results when using the unadjusted performance
measures. In contrast to these results, we find no similar relationship when looking at
dierences in average heuristic use between -managers, a result which further supports
our assertion that underperformance in selling, rather than being driven by persistent
dierences in skill, is due to the asymmetric allocation of attention.55
    In the preceding section we argued that both stages of the selling process are prone
to heuristic thinking--limiting the consideration set to assets with salient attributes
and then choosing to sell those that the PM has least conviction in. The literature on
heuristics and biases documents that people are more likely to rely on heuristics during
   would imply (through a simple application of Bayes' rule) that the likelihood of a stock being sold
   in the extreme bin is 4/3 the likelihood of a stock being sold in one of the central bins. In Appendix
   Table A.12, we show, perhaps surprisingly, our measure of heuristics intensity is largely uncorrelated
   with a variety of observable fund characteristics.
54
   We lose about one quarter of fund-week observations due to these restrictions.
55
   More specifically, during periods of time when the PM is attending to sales and less reliant on
   heuristics, the performance of her selling decisions increases substantially.

situations when cognitive resources are in higher demand, such as in times of stress or
when attention is otherwise occupied (see Kahneman (2003) for review). Panels B and
C of Table 8 consider two empirical proxies intended to capture periods emblematic of
such episodes. As in Panel A, these measures are computed on a weekly basis and sort
fund-weeks into four categories to capture either between or within-manager variation.

       The first aims to capture performance when the PM is likely to be stressed. Insti-
tutional investors are known to take stock of their own performance based on calendar
time, e.g. on a quarterly or yearly basis. Based on the conjecture that the PMs are
more likely to be stressed when their overall portfolio is underperforming, we construct
a measure that captures portfolio performance relative to the beginning of the preced-
ing quarter. Table 8, Panel B demonstrates that selling quality is worst (relative to
a random-sell counterfactual) when the PM's overall portfolio is underperforming the
most. Panel C considers a measure that proxies for sales that are likely to be driven
by cash raising considerations rather than forecasts of relevant performance metrics.
We posit that observing larger bundles of assets being sold (relative to being bought)
is emblematic of the manager being in "cash-raising mode." We compute the dier-
ence between the number of stocks bought and the number of stocks sold, where both
measures are expressed as fractions of the number of stocks in the portfolio. We find
that the dierence between the number of stocks bought and sold predicts greater
underperformance of the selling decisions.56
       As discussed above, some institutions such as mutual funds face direct pressure
from performance-driven fund flows, creating the possibility that flows induce PMs to
engage in large sales under unfavorable conditions (Alexander et al. 2007). Following
Coval and Staord (2007), we construct daily flows as the portion of assets under man-
agement which are not explained by the previous day's returns, then aggregate them
to a weekly frequency. We test the above hypothesis in Panel D by creating proxies
for flows and sorting fund-weeks into bins based on these proxies. Consistent with our
discussion in Section 2.1 that flow concerns are less pronounced in our institutional
56
     In similar spirit, we present additional evidence in Appendix A.8 which relates performance to
     turnover. There, we sort each portfolio's time series into periods with low and high turnover. We
     find that performance of sales deteriorates during high turnover periods (which are presumably
     characterized by better trading opportunities), while performance of buys remains unchanged. This
     is consistent with a mechanism where better buying opportunities attract the already scarce atten-
     tional resources allocated to sales, further degrading performance in that domain.


                                                   45
context, the performance results--that buys outperform the counterfactual while sells
underperform--are unchanged across the flow measures.


6    Conclusion

We utilize a unique dataset and find evidence that financial market experts--institutional
investors managing portfolios averaging $573 million--display costly, systematic heuris-
tics. A striking finding emerges: While investors display skill in buying, their selling
decisions underperform substantially--even relative to random-sell strategies. We pro-
vide evidence that investors use heuristics when selling but not when buying, and
that these heuristic strategies are empirically linked to the documented dierence in
performance.

    As shown in Section 3, the comparison of trades on earnings announcement versus
non-announcement days suggests that PMs do not lack fundamental skills in selling;
rather, results are consistent with PMs devoting more cognitive resources to buying
than selling. When decision relevant information is salient and readily available--as it is
on announcement days--PMs' selling performance improves substantially. We propose
a mechanism through which overall underperformance in selling can be explained by
a heuristic two-stage selling process, where PMs limit their consideration set to assets
with salient characteristics (extreme prior returns) and sell those they have the least
conviction in. A proxy for this heuristic strategy is associated with substantial losses
relative to a no-skill random selling strategy.

    In light of the imbalance in feedback discussed in Section 4.1 and Appendix A.6 ,
the theoretical framework of Gagnon-Bartsch, Rabin, and Schwartzstein (2018) sug-
gests that PMs may fail to recognize their underperformance in selling even in the
long-run. The authors show that a mistaken theory such as the favorability of selling
positions with extreme returns may persist in the long run because people channel their
attention through the lens of this theory. As in Schwartzstein (2014), errors persist
due to the person ignoring information that seems irrelevant and only updating her
beliefs based on information that is attended to. Our findings imply significant benefits
to creating environments where learning can occur more eectively, such as through
amended reporting standards that emphasize counterfactual sales performance. More-
over, our empirical results on a link between heuristic use and underperformance of

                                            46
selling strategies suggest that PMs adoption of decision aids and/or simple alternative
selling strategies may substantially improve performance.
