This paper generalizes the gross exports accounting framework, initially proposed by Koopman,
Wang, and Wei (2014) for a country’s aggregate exports, to one at the sector, bilateral, and
bilateral-sector levels. Such a generalization requires a conceptual distinction between value
added exports by forward and backward industrial linkages, and a non-trivial way to allocate
bilateral intermediate trade flows into their final destinations of absorption. We present the
disaggregated decomposition results among 40 trading nations in 35 sectors from 1995 to 2011
based on the World Input-Output Database and show how they help us to better understand the
patterns of cross-country production sharing.

1. Introduction

    This paper aims to develop a disaggregated accounting framework that consistently
decomposes gross trade at the sector, bilateral, or bilateral-sector level, into the sum of various
value added and double counted components. For example, gross exports from a particular
country-sector can be decomposed into the sum of value added contributions from its own sector,
other sectors from the exporting country, sectors from all other countries, and double counted
items.

    A common approach in the existing literature is to decompose final demand or value-added
(GDP) by industry using standard Leontief methods that extracts value added from gross outputs
(exports). However, there is additional information about the structure of domestic value added
and double counting in gross trade flows that cannot be captured by the standard Leontief
decomposition. As we will show, these value added and double counted items each have
different economic meanings and their relative importance represents different types of
cross-country production sharing arrangements.

    Estimating value added exports or domestic value added in a country’s gross exports alone
can be accomplished by directly applying the standard Leontief (1936) decomposition, which
does not require decomposing international intermediate trade flows. However, uncovering the
value added structure of gross trade at a disaggregated level requires finding a way to decompose
intermediate trade into value added and double counted parts, which cannot be achieved by
simply multiplying the Leontief inverse and final demand.

    To solve the problem, we propose a method to decompose all bilateral intermediate trade
flows into major final demand groups according to their final destination of absorption and
express gross output in all stages of production as related countries’ final demand. This key
technical step enable us to decompose gross trade flows in any given year ex post into final
products thus laid out the foundation to interpret gross trade in value-added terms in our
accounting framework.

    Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2014), KWW hereafter, have made a first effort in this direction
by providing a unified framework to decompose a country’s total gross exports into nine value
added and double counted components. Conceptually, the nine components can be grouped into
four buckets: (1) domestic value-added in exports that is absorbed abroad, similar to “value

                                                 2
added exports” as defined by Johnson and Noguera (2012); (2) domestic value added that is
initially exported but eventually returned home. While it is not part of a country’s “value added
exports,” it is part of the exporting country’s GDP; (3) foreign value added that is used in the
production of a country’s exports and eventually absorbed by other countries; and (4) what
KWW call “pure double counted terms,” arising from intermediate goods trade that cross borders
multiple times. Other measures of international production sharing in the earlier literature such as
VS (vertical specialization) and its variants, VS1 and VS1*, and the VAX ratio (the ratio of value
added exports to gross exports) are shown to be some linear combinations of the terms in
KWW’s decomposition formula. While the method of KWW (2014) is valid only for a country’s
aggregate exports, our new framework is able to consistently decompose gross trade flows at any
level of disaggregation into the above four buckets. It in fact allows one to further decompose
each of the four buckets above into finer components representing different types of
cross-country production sharing arrangements. For example, we can decompose exports of
domestic value added by different demand channels and trade routes, further identifying whether
they are embedded in final exports, intermediate exports that are absorbed in the direct importing
countries, or intermediate exports that are re-exported and absorbed in home or third countries.

    The main contribution of this paper is to provide such a consistent accounting framework for
gross trade at either the sector, bilateral, or bilateral-sector level. It bridges the standard of System
of National Account (SNA) and trade statistics, laid out the methodology foundation to interpret
official trade data in value-added terms. In addition, it produces a series of decomposition results
to illustrate how such a structural decomposition can help us to better understand the pattern of
international production sharing and discover global value chains-related information masked by
official trade data.
    In order to do the decomposition at such a disaggregated level, we have to make an important
distinction between backward and forward industrial linkages, which enables us to decompose
gross intermediate trade flows based on their final destination of absorption at the bilateral-sector
level. It turns out that separating value added by backward versus forward industrial linkages is a
conceptual breakthrough that allows one to trace the structure of international production sharing
at a disaggregated level. To the best of our knowledge, the literature has not previously made a
clear distinction between them to separate various trade in value-added measures. While KWW
(2014) made a distinction between domestic value added embedded in gross exports versus value

                                                   3
added exports, they do so only at the country aggregate. More importantly, they do not
distinguish backward versus forward industrial linkages – such a distinction is not important at
the country aggregate level, but is crucial at a disaggregated level. In particular, value added via
backward linkages is a crucial measure for many important indicators related to intermediate
goods trade at the sector, bilateral, or bilateral-sector levels.

     By applying our disaggregated decomposition framework to bilateral-sector gross trade flows
in the World Input Output Database (WIOD) (Timmer et al. (2012)), we produce a sequence of
large panel data sets that reveal the value added structure of 35 sectors’ gross bilateral trade
flows among 40 economies over 17 years1. While the paper does not directly investigate the
causes or consequences of patterns of international production sharing, the disaggregated
accounting framework that we developed and the panel data sets that are derived from the
framework can be used by other researchers to enrich the set of possible future research on these
topics.

     Because the full decomposition results take up several gigabytes of space, we illustrate
potential usefulness of the resulting data by a series of examples that utilize different subsets of
the overall decomposition output. For example, we show how we may trace structural changes in
a widely used measure of vertical specialization, initially proposed by Hummels, Ishii, and Yi
(2001), to better understand global production sharing pattern changes over time. We distinguish
two types of “trade in value added” measures and two types of domestic value added embedded
in gross exports based on forward and backward industrial linkages at the country-sector or
bilateral-sector levels and quantify their relationships. These represent significant new progress
relative to KWW (2014).2
     This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our methodological framework and
discusses the relationships among the various value-added trade measures at disaggregate levels
as well as economic properties of various double counted components in gross trade flows.
Section 3 reports selected empirical decomposition results based on the WIOD. Section 4

  The calculation of domestic value added that is ultimately absorbed abroad based on forward industrial linkages
has been done at the bilateral and sector level. Indeed, some examples are given in KWW (2014). However, KWW
did not separately compute the measures of trade in value added associated with gross trade flows. In addition, the
computations of the other two components (foreign value-added and pure double counting) that could sum to 100%
of gross trade flows are only done at the country aggregate level, not at the sector, bilateral, or bilateral-sector level
in KWW.

2. Concepts and Methodology
2.1 The Standard Leontief decomposition and its limitations
    All the decomposition methods in the recent vertical specialization and trade in value added
literatures are rooted in Leontief (1936), who demonstrated that the amount and type of
intermediate inputs needed in the production of one unit of output can be estimated based on
input-output (IO) structures across countries and industries. Using the linkages across industries
and countries, gross output in all stages of production that is needed to produce one unit of final
product can be traced. When the gross output flows (labeled as “endogenous” in a standard IO
model) associated with a particular level of final demand (labeled as “exogenous” in a standard
IO model) are known, value added production and trade can be derived simply by multiplying
these flows with the value added to gross output ratio in each country/industry.
    To better understand how the standard Leontief decomposition works, let us assume a
two-country (home and foreign) world, in which each country produces products in N
differentiated tradable industries. Products in each sector can be consumed directly or used as
intermediate inputs, and each country exports both intermediate and final goods and services.
    All gross output produced by Country s must be used as either an intermediate or a final
product at home or abroad, or
        X s  A ss X s  Y ss  A sr X r  Y sr r, s = 1,2                     (1)
        s                                                           sr
where X is the N×1 gross output vector of Country s, Y is the N×1 final demand vector that
gives demand in Country r for final products produced in s, and Asr is the N×N IO coefficient
matrix, giving intermediate use in r of goods and services produced in s. The two-country
production and trade system can be written as an ICIO model in block matrix notation

After rearranging terms, we have

where Bsr denotes the N×N block matrix, commonly known as a Leontief inverse, which is the

                                                        5
total requirement matrix that gives the amount of gross output required by Country s in
producing a one-unit increase of final demand in Country r. Ys is an N×1 vector that gives global
use of Country s’s final products, including domestic final sales Yss and exports of final products
Ysr. The relationship expressed in (3) reflects the standard Leontief insight. The intuition behind
the expression is as follows: when $1 of export is produced, a first round of value added is
generated (denoted as V). This is the direct domestic value added induced by the $1 export. To
produce that export, intermediate inputs have to be used. The production of these intermediate
inputs also generates value added. This is the second round or indirect domestic value added
induced by the $1 export. Such a process to generate indirect value added continues and can be
traced to additional rounds of production throughout the economy, as intermediate inputs are
used to produce other intermediate inputs. The total domestic value added induced by the $1
export thus is equal to the sum of the direct and all rounds of indirect domestic value added
generated from the $1 of the export production process. Expressing this process mathematically
using the terms defined above, we have
         TVshare  V  VA  VAA  VAAA  ....  V ( I  A  A 2  A 3  ...)  V ( I  A) 1  VB   (4)

     It can be shown that the power series of matrices is convergent and the inverse matrix exists
as long as A is in full rank (Miller and Blair, 2009). It is easy to prove that each element of the
final VB vector equals unity.3 The two-country total value added coefficient (VB) matrix as
named in the input-output literature can be written as:

                            B ss     B sr 
                
         VB  V s          
                       V r  rs                 
                                                s ss r
                                             V B V B
                                                        rs
                                                                       V s B sr  V r B rr         (5)
                           B         B rr 

     The decomposition of the country-sector level value added and final products production as
a direct application of the standard Leontief decomposition can be expressed as follows:

             Vˆ s    0   B ss     B sr  Yˆ s    0  Vˆ s B ssYˆ s     Vˆ s B srYˆ r 

     This matrix gives the estimates of sector and country sources of value added in each
country’s final goods production. Each element in the matrix represents the value added from a
source sector of a source country directly or indirectly used in the production of final goods
(absorbed in both the domestic and foreign markets) in the source country. Looking at the matrix
along the row yields the distribution of value added created from one country-sector used across
all countries-sectors. For example, the first element of the first row, v1s b11ss ( y1ss  y1sr ) is value
added from sector 1 of Country s to produce the final products of sector 1 for domestic sales and
exports. The second element, v1s b12ss ( y 2ss  y 2sr ) , is value added of sector 1 in Country s from
production of intermediates used as inputs to produce the final products of sector 2. The third and
fourth elements, v1s b11sr ( y1rs  y1rr ) and v1s b12sr ( y 2rs  y 2rr ) , are value added of sector 1 in Country s

from the production of intermediate inputs to produce final products in sectors 1 and 2 in
Country r, respectively. Therefore, summing up the first row of the matrix, we obtain the total
value added created by production factors employed in sector 1 of Country s. In other words, it
equals GDP by industry of sector 1 in Country s. Expressing this mathematically,

            Looking at the VˆBYˆ matrix down a column yields the contributions of value added from
all countries-sectors to the final goods produced by a particular country-sector. For example, the

                                           ( y1ss  y1sr ) , is value added created from sector 2 in

in Country s in the production of its final products, respectively. Adding up all elements in the

    In summary, the sum of the VˆBYˆ matrix along a row accounts for how each country’s
domestic value added originating in a particular sector is used by the sector itself and all its
downstream countries-sectors. It traces forward industrial linkages across all downstream
countries-industries from a producer’s perspective. The sum of the VˆBYˆ matrix down a column
accounts for all upstream countries-sectors’ value added contributions to a specific
country-sector’s final products; it traces backward industrial linkages across upstream
countries/industries (as different stages of production) from a user’s perspective. Based on the
identity given by equation (5), all these sources should sum to 100% of the value of the final
products for any given country-sector.
    Therefore, the producer-side perspective (summing elements in a row) decomposes how
each country’s GDP by industry is used, directly and indirectly to satisfy domestic and foreign
final demand, while the user-side perspective (summing elements in a column) decomposes a
country-sector’s final goods and services production into its original country-sector sources. As
an example, in the electronics sector, the producer-side perspective includes the value added
created by production factors employed at the electronics sector and incorporated into the final
goods exports of electronics itself (direct domestic value added exports), as well as in the final
goods exports of computers, consumer appliances, and automobiles (indirect domestic value
added exports). In other words, it decomposes GDP (domestic value added) by industry
according to where (i.e., which sector-country) it is used. Such a forward linkage perspective is
consistent with the literature on factor content of trade. On the other hand, decomposition from a
user’s perspective includes all upstream country-sector’s contributions to value added in a
specific country-sector’s final goods exports. In the electronics sector, it includes value added in
the electronics sector itself as well as value added in inputs from all other upstream
country-sectors (such as glass from country A, rubber from country B, and transportation and
design from the home country) used to produce electronics for exports by the home country
(direct/indirect domestic value added and foreign value added in final goods exports). Such a
backward industrial linkage based perspective aligns well with case studies of supply chains of

                                                                           8
specific sectors and products, as the iPod or iPhone examples frequently cited in the literature.
    These two different ways to decompose value added and final goods production each have
their own economic interpretations and thus different roles in economic analysis. The GDP by
industry decomposition can address questions such as “who is the final consumer of value-added
generated from the Japanese electronics industry?” while the final products decomposition is
able to answer questions such as “what is the difference in the value added source structure
between a car exported from Germany and that from China?” While they are equivalent in the
aggregate since global value added production equals global final demand, they are not equal to
each other at the sector, or bilateral-sector level.
    There are several attempts to estimate trade in value added and to decompose value added
and final goods production based on the standard Leontief decomposition and ICIO database in
recent years. Timmer et al. (2013, 2014) decompose manufacturing final goods production based
on backward industrial linkages. For example, their method provides estimates on how much
contribution an unskilled worker employed in the Chinese steel industry makes to cars produced
in Germany, or how much contribution a skilled US worker in the electronics industry makes to a
computer consumed by Chinese households.
    Johnson and Noguera (2012) and Johnson (2014) estimate value added exports based on
forward industrial linkages. However, they only measure sector value added absorbed by foreign
countries, i.e., part of GDP by industry statistics that are driven by foreign final demand.
Defining the VAX ratio by such a forward linkage method would yield a measure that is not well
behaved at the sector or bilateral level, because domestic value added from other domestic
sectors is not reflected in the forward linkage based calculations, but is quantitatively important
for a typical country-sector. Indeed, the VAX ratio as defined this way could be infinite for
sectors that do not directly export. We will suggest an alternative way to define such a summary
index based on backward industrial linkages which is consistently bounded by zero and one at
any level of disaggregation later in this paper.
    In any case, if one is only interested in computing domestic value added embedded in a
country-sector’s gross exports that is ultimately absorbed abroad, applying the standard Leontief
decomposition is sufficient. However, as pointed out in the introduction, to better understand
different types of cross-country production sharing arrangements, one needs to quantify the
structure of domestic value added and other components of gross exports at the sector, bilateral,


                                                       9
and bilateral-sector levels. In such circumstances, the standard Leontief decomposition is not
sufficient since it does not provide a way to decompose intermediate trade flows across countries
into various value added terms according to their final absorption as it does to sector-level value
added and final goods production illustrated by equation (7).
    In Leontief’s time from the 1930s to the1960s, intermediate goods trade is relatively
unimportant. Today, it is more than half of world gross trade. Most of such trade is two-way
trade in intermediate goods. For example, US exports parts of machineries to China which are
used in the machineries to produce car parts for the US and Germany’s auto industries. So being
able to decompose intermediate goods trade has become crucial in generating a complete value
added accounting of gross trade flows. KWW has made a useful step to perform such
decomposition at the country aggregate level, but as we pointed out earlier, there is no need to
keep track of forward and backward linkages across countries and industries separately at that
level, which makes the job easier. However, one has to confront such technical challenges in
decomposing gross trade flows at the sector, bilateral, or bilateral-sector level, which has to go
beyond a simple application of the standard Leontief decomposition, as we will demonstrate in
detail below.


2.2 Decomposing intermediate and gross trade flows4
    The gross exports of Country s to Country r, 𝐸 𝑠𝑟 , can be decomposed into two parts: final
goods exports and intermediate goods exports based on the following accounting identity:
         E sr  Y sr  A sr X r                                                                     (10)

    As shown in the previous section, final goods exports can be easily decomposed into
domestic and foreign value added by directly applying the standard Leontief decomposition.
However, the decomposition of intermediate goods exports is more complex. It cannot be
achieved by simply multiplying the Leontief inverse with gross intermediate exports (which
leads to double counting) because the latter has to be solved from the ICIO models first for any
given level of final demand. To overcome this problem, all intermediate goods trade needs to be


4
   To help readers understand the derivation of our gross trade decomposition equation, we also extend the
two-country, two-sector ICIO model specified in section 2.1 into a 3-country, 2-sector model as an example in
Appendix A to show how a country’s gross exports can be decomposed into the sum of components that include
both the country’s domestic value added in exports and various double-counted components at the bilateral-sector
level.

expressed as different countries’ final demand according to where they are absorbed before they
can be consistently decomposed. This is what we are going to do next.
     Extending equation (3) to a G country setting, and inserting it into the last term of equation
(10), we can decompose Country s’s gross intermediate goods exports to Country r according to
where they are absorbed as:

     These eight terms5 on the right side of equation (11) collectively decompose Country s’s
intermediate exports to Country r completely according to where they are finally absorbed. It
will be used later to decompose the domestic originated value of a country’s bilateral gross
exports into different value added and double counted components.

     Re-arranging terms:
       X r  ( I  Arr ) 1Y rr  ( I  Arr ) 1 E r*  LrrY rr  Lrr E r*                                                                     (13)

where Lrr  ( I  Arr ) 1 is the local Leontief inverse.

     Inserting equation (13) into the last term of equation (10), Country s’s intermediate goods

exports to Country r can also be decomposed into the following two components according to

where it is used (domestic sales and exports), similar to a single country IO model:
       Asr X r  Asr LrrY rr  Asr Lrr E r*                                                                                                    (14)
It will be used later to decompose the foreign originated value of a country’s bilateral gross
exports into different value added and double counted components.6
     Equations (11) and (14), each completely decomposing Country s’s intermediate exports to
Country r according to where they are finally absorbed, are the key technical steps to fully

    By doing so, we significantly simplify our core decomposition equation (18).

                                                                                                             11
decomposing gross bilateral trade flows, since they convert gross output (and gross exports),
usually endogenous variables in standard ICIO models, to exogenous variables in the gross trade
accounting framework we developed in this paper. Together with the adding-up condition for the
global value added multiplier defined in equation (5) and the local value added multipliers
defined below, they are the major stepping stones for deriving our gross exports decomposition
formula.
     Extending equation (5) to a G country setting, we can obtain Country s’s domestic and
foreign value added (represented by partner Country r and third Country t) multipliers as follows:
                                  G
      V s B ss  V r B rs  V t B ts  u                                                                        (15)
                             t  s ,r

     Defining “#” as an element-wise matrix multiplication operation,7 Country s’s final goods
exports to Country r can be easily decomposed into domestic and foreign value added at the
sector level by applying the standard Leontief decomposition directly:
                                                                         G
      Y sr  (V s B ss )T # Y sr  (V r B rs )T # Y sr  ( V t B ts )T # Y sr                                   (16)
                                                                       t  s ,r


     Similarly, the value of Country s’s gross intermediate exports to Country r at sector the level
can be expressed as
                                                                                         G
         A sr X r  (V s B ss )T # ( A sr X r )  (V r B rs )T # ( A sr X r )  (  V t B ts )T # ( A sr X r )
                                                                                       t  s ,r
               s   ss T      sr         r      s
          (V L ) # ( A X )  (V B  V L ) # ( A X )   ss   s   ss T        sr     r                             (17)
                                              G
          (V r B rs )T # ( A sr X r )  (  V t B ts )T # ( A sr X r )
                                            t  s ,r


where V s Lss is the domestic value added multiplier similar to a single country IO model.
     Inserting equation (11) into the first term of equation (17) and equation (14) into the last
two terms of equation (17) respectively, then combining equations (16) and (17), we obtain the
decomposition equation of Country s’s gross exports to Country r as follows8:



7
    For example, when a matrix is multiplied by an n  1 column vector, each row of the matrix is multiplied by the
corresponding row element of the vector.
8
  Using equations (10)–(12), one can further decompose Asr X r in DDC (category 5) and E r * in FDC (category 8)
according to final demand, i.e., where they are finally absorbed. We chose to express these two double counting
terms in the current format and use equation (14) to decompose the foreign originated value in order to simplify our
final decomposition formula. The further decomposition of DDC and FDC according to their final absorption is
reported in Appendix C (equation C8 and C9).

whereV s Lss  A st B ts  V s B ss  V s Lss . Equation (18) indicates that the gross exports from
               t s

Country s to Country r at sector levels can be completely decomposed into the sum of 16 detailed
terms in 8 major categories. To better understand each category in this accounting equation, we
provide the following economic interpretations:
     The 1st category, (V s B ss )T # Y sr , is domestic value added (DVA for short) embodied in final
goods exports. We label it as DVA_FIN for short.
     The 2nd category, (V s Lss )T # ( Asr B rrY rr ) , is DVA in intermediate exports used by direct
importer (r) to produce local final goods consumed in r. We label it as DVA_INT for short.9

    Note that the first and second terms in equation (18) include both domestic value-added directly and indirectly
absorbed by the importing country. Domestic value added of the exporting country that is directly absorbed by the
partner country can be measured as (𝑉 𝑠 𝐿𝑠𝑠 )𝑇 #𝑌 𝑠𝑟 (𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑠) , which is a portion of the 1st term, and
(𝑉 𝑠 𝐿𝑠𝑠 )𝑇 #(𝐴𝑠𝑟 𝐿𝑟𝑟 𝑌 𝑟𝑟 ) (𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑠), which is a portion of the 2nd term. These two portions are called
“Ricardian Trade” by Borin and Mancini (2015), which do not involve any additional production activity in third
countries. The domestic value-added in exports indirectly absorbed by the partner country is measured by
[𝑉 𝑠 (𝐵 𝑠𝑠 − 𝐿𝑠𝑠 )]𝑇 #𝑌 𝑠𝑟 and (𝑉 𝑠 𝐿𝑠𝑠 )𝑇 #(𝐴𝑠𝑟 (𝐵𝑟𝑟 − 𝐿𝑟𝑟 )𝑌 𝑟𝑟 ) respectively, which involve production activities in
third countries before the value-added in exports is finally absorbed in the partner country. In Appendix D, we
provide an alternative decomposition formula that accounts for traditional or direct and GVC trade separately.
Equation (18) shows clearly which part in gross bilateral trade flow can be decomposed by applying the standard
Leontief decomposition directly (final goods trade), which part cannot (intermediate goods trade), while the
alternative equation we provide in Appendix D shows clearly which part of domestic value-added of the exporting

                                                                               13

exports ultimately consumed by other countries except s. We name them as DVA_INTrex for

intermediates that it re-exports to third Country t for production of final goods exports that are
shipped to other countries (including the direct importer, Country r) except Country s.
        The first three categories are all DVA embodied in Country s’s gross exports to Country r
and ultimately absorbed abroad, which are value-added exports (labeled as VAX by Johnson and
Noguera (2012)) associated with gross export flows based on backward industrial linkages. We
name them collectively as VAX_G for short.
        The 4th category is DVA in intermediate exports that are returned to Country s and consumed
at home. We name them as RDV_G for short. It also includes three detailed terms:
(V s Lss )T # ( Asr B rrY rs ) is DVA that returns home via its final imports from the direct importer (r);
                                        G
(V s Lss )T # ( Asr  B rtY ts ) is DVA that returns home via final imports from third countries; and
                                    t  s ,r


(V s Lss )T # ( Asr B rsY ss ) is DVA that returns home via its intermediate imports and used to produce
domestic final products. Summing across all sectors and trading partners, the first two terms
equal the 4th term, and the last term equals the 5th term in equation (36) of KWW.10
        The first four categories are DVA embodied in Country s’s sector level gross exports to

country is absorbed by its partner country directly and indirectly, and which part of domestic value-added of the
exporting country is absorbed in third countries. Both decompositions are useful depending on one’s particular
analytical needs.

as DVA_G for short. At the country aggregate, it reduces to equation (37) of KWW.11 As we will
show by selected decomposition examples based on WIOD in the next section, these DVA terms
represent different types of cross country production sharing arrangements and can be used to
gauge the role and position of a country in various global value chains.

its intermediate exports to Country r but return home as its intermediate imports, and used for
production of its final exports, which are parts of DVA in Country s’s final exports and are
already counted once in the first category of equation (18). For this reason, they are a portion of
domestic double counted terms caused by the back and forth intermediate goods trade in order to

DVA in intermediate exports to Country r that returns home as intermediate imports and used for
production of its intermediate exports. It is also a domestic double counted portion caused by the
back and forth intermediate trade to produce intermediate exports in Country s (repeat counting
of Country s’s intermediate goods exports).12 We name them as DDC for short. Summing these
two terms across all sectors and country pairs equals the 6th term in equation (36) of KWW.
       The 6th category includes two terms: the first term (V r B rs )T # Y sr , is foreign value added
                                                                                                                                     G

Summing them across all sectors and country pairs equals the 7th term in equation (36) of KWW.
       Adding up the 1st (DVA from source Country s), and the 6th (FVA from Country r and
Country t) categories accounts for 100% of the value of the sector level final exports from
Country s to Country r.

embodied in intermediate exports, which are then used by Country r to produce its local final
goods. We name them as FVA_INT for short. Summing them across all sectors and country pairs
equals the 8th term in equation (36) of KWW.13
     Summing the 6th and 7th categories yield the total foreign value added embodied in Country
s’s sector level gross exports to Country r. We name them as FVA for short.
     The last category is double counted terms in Country s’s gross exports originating from
foreign countries. Similar to categories 6 and 7, it also includes two terms: the first term,
(V r B rs )T # ( Asr Lrr E r* ) , is FVA from the importer (r) embodied in intermediate exports to produce
its exports, which is a pure double counted term of r’s value added in s’s exports. The second
         G
term, ( V t B ts )T # ( Asr Lrr E r* ) , is FVA from third Country t embodied in intermediate exports to
       t  s ,r


produce its exports to the world. We label them as FDC for short.
     The 5th and last categories are both pure double counted terms in Country s’s gross exports
but originating from home country and foreign countries respectively. We name their sum as
PDC for short.
     The sum of the last four categories can be seen as an extension of the vertical specialization
(VS) measure proposed by Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001) in a multi-country setting with more
than one country engaging in intermediate goods trade.14 As we will show by examples in the
next section, these different components within the total VS also represent different types of
cross-country production sharing arrangements and are useful to study the upstream value-added
structures of a country’s gross exports in various global value chains.
13
    The 6th and 7th categories can be grouped differently in decomposing bilateral gross trade flows. Summing up the
first terms of these two categories yields total value added from the direct importer (Country r) used in the
production of gross exports of Country s. We can label them as MVA for short. Summing up the second terms of
these two categories yields total value added from other countries (t) used in the production of gross exports of
Country s. We can label them as OVA for short.
14
    KWW (2014) split the PDC terms into domestic and foreign content based on the origins of the double counted
terms, and allocate a portion of the PDC to the VS measure. In this paper, we allocate the entire PDC term (DDC
and FDC) to the VS measure so as to keep the notion of “domestic value added embedded in gross exports” as a “net”
concept, and is then consistent with the one country model that the original Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001) measure
is based on. It avoids additional layer in the decomposition and intuitively appealing. Note that the VS measure is
not a “net” concept and always contains double counted terms no matter how the PDC term is allocated. Both ways
to allocate the DDC term seems reasonable, which one to use is subject to what the issue to be investigated.

      The 16 detailed terms in the 8 categories discussed above completely decompose bilateral
 gross exports from Country s to Country r into different value added and double counted
 components, and their sum equals 100% of bilateral trade flows at the sector level. The
 disaggregated accounting framework made by equation (18) is also diagrammed in Figure 1.

 Note: E* can be at country-sector, country aggregate, bilateral-sector, or bilateral aggregate levels; both
 VAX_G and RDV_G are based on backward industrial linkages.

      Summing up equation (18) across the G–1 trading partners and N sectors, we obtain a
 decomposition equation for total gross exports of Country s, which can be verified to be identical
 to equation (36) in KWW (2014). Detailed proof is given in Appendix E. This formally shows
 that our formula generalizes the one in KWW from country aggregate to country-sector and
 bilateral-sector level.
      Summing up equation (18) to all s and r, the direct importer’s value added in exports (sum of
 the first term in categories (6) and (7), we label it as MVA for short) equals to RDV_G, and the

                                                                17
third countries’ value added in exports (sum of the second term in categories (6) and (7), we label
it as OVA for short) equals to DVA_INTrex in world total exports. This indicates that FVA
exactly double counts RDV_G and DVA_INTrex in measuring value-added in global exports.
The intuition of such equivalence is simple: when RDV_G and DVA_INTrex cross borders from
the source country to the direct importer for the first time, they are both counted as part of the
source country’s domestic value added in its gross exports. When they cross national borders for
the second time either from the direct importer back to the source country or are re-exported to a
third country, they are counted another time as MVA or OVA in gross exports of the direct
importing country. Therefore, FVA is value-added that crosses national borders at least twice.
    DDC and FDC only occur when there are back and forth intermediate trade flows among
countries. Their values are measured by the back and forth movement of intermediate trade flows
that cross national borders at least 3 times but through different routes: (1) as intermediate
exports from the home country, (2) returned from the direct importer or re-exported by these
direct importing countries to third countries as intermediate exports, and (3) exported by a third
country again to other countries including the home country as intermediate or final products.
Those intermediate trade transactions are not part of any country’s GDP or final demand (beyond
what has already been counted in categories 1–4, 6, and 7 in equation (18)), similar to domestic
inter-industry transactions that use one type of intermediate input to produce another type of
intermediate inputs. Because all cross-country trade transactions are recorded by each country’s
customs authority, they show up in official trade statistics. In comparison, domestic intermediate
input transactions are deducted from total gross output when official GDP by industry statistics is
accounted for. Therefore, PDC is not a value added concept, and has different economic and
mathematical properties compared to RDV_G and FVA, although the three of them all represent
double counted terms in a country’s gross exports. This intuition also helps readers to understand
why both DDC and FDC should be considered as part of the vertical specialization (VS) measure.
In Appendix C, we present a detailed concordance, in a three-country setting, between each of
the domestic value added measures and these double counted terms.

2.3 Relationships among various trade in value-added measures

    With the bilateral-sector gross exports decomposition equation (18) in hand, we are ready to
formally define two related “trade in value added” measures and the two notions of “domestic


                                                18
value added embedded in gross exports” at the bilateral-sector level. We also reflect on how the
value added trade to gross trade ratio and a summary statistic of double counting can be defined
properly at the country-sector and bilateral-sector level.15
     a) We have defined domestic value added in bilateral exports from Country s to Country r
that is ultimately absorbed by other countries as the sum of the first three categories in equation
(18) in our earlier discussion:

      VAX _ G sr  (V s B ss )T # Y sr  (V s Lss )T #( Asr B rrY rr )
                            G                                     G
       (V s Lss )T #( Asr  B rtY tt )  (V s Lss )T #( Asr B rr  Y rt )                              (19)
                          t  s ,r                              t  s ,r
                            G          G
       (V s Lss )T #( Asr  B rt  Y tu )
                          t  s ,r   u  s ,t



     It measures the amount of all domestic value added exported via a particular sector (e.g., US
electronics), including value added originating from any domestic sector (e.g., including US
plastics, chemicals, and automobiles) via backward industrial linkages, and is ultimately
absorbed abroad (in direct importing country or third countries). There are three key features to
take into account. The first is that the measure focuses on the identity of the last sector through
which domestic value added from all domestic sectors is exported. The second is the phrase
“ultimately absorbed abroad”, that is, the measure excludes the part of domestic value added that
eventually returns home. The third is it is always a part of gross export flows in a particular
trading route thus its value is always bounded by the value of the corresponding gross trade
flows.

     b) We have also defined domestic value added embodied in gross exports from Country s to
Country r based on backward industrial linkages as the sum of the first four categories in
equation (18) as follows and label the last term in equation (20) as RDV _ G sr , which measures
returned domestic value added based on backward industrial linkages from Country s to Country
r that is first exported but ultimately returned and absorbed at home:
      DVA _ G sr  VAX _ G sr  RDV _ G sr                                                              (20)

     c) From equation (30) of KWW, we can define domestic value added exports of a particular

15
   In KWW, only the forward linkage based value added trade measure is defined in equation (30), which is similar
to Equation (21) of this paper. Equations (19), (20), and (23) are all new and necessary to trace value added exports
and domestic value added embedded in gross exports beyond the country aggregate level.

                                                                19
sector from Country s to Country r based on forward industrial linkages as:
                                                       G
     VAX _ F sr  Vˆ s B ssY sr  Vˆ s B srY rr  Vˆ s  B stY tr                             (21)

Where Vˆ is a N by N diagonal matrix with direct value added coefficients of Country s, V s ,
        s


along the diagonal. It measures the amount of domestic value added originating from a specific
sector (e.g., from the US electronics sector), via all sectors’ gross exports from the source
country (i.e., including gross exports from the US automobile and machinery sectors in addition
to the US electronics sector), and ultimately absorbed in a particular destination country. It has
been the most widely used trade in value-added measure in the literature since it has been
proposed by Johnson and Noguera (2012). There are also three key features here. Using the
example of value added exports from the US electronics sector, the first key is that some of the
value added from that sector can be exported indirectly via other US sectors such as automobiles,
because some of the US electronics products are used as intermediate inputs in the production of
automobile exports. So this measure includes indirectly exported value added from the
electronics sector via forward industrial linkages. The second key is the phrase “ultimately
absorbed in a particular destination country.” The part of value added that eventually returns and
is consumed at home is also not part of the value added exports. Finally, it always deviates from
gross trade flows because it includes indirect value-added contributed to other sectors’ gross
exports and indirect trade via third countries.
    It is interesting to note that equations (19) and (21) clearly show that VAX _ F sr requires
that DVA from Country s has to be absorbed by a particular destination country r, while
VAX _ G sr includes domestic value added absorbed not only by direct importing Country r, but

also by third countries t or u. It demonstrates analytically why we claim that VAX _ G sr is the
trade in value added measure which is fully consistent and bounded by gross bilateral trade flows
and VAX _ F sr is not due to indirect trade through third countries. At the country aggregate,
these two measures are the same, but at the sector, bilateral or bilateral-sector level, they are
different except by coincidence.
    d) Similar to VAX_F, we define RDV_F as the amount of DVA from a specific sector
embodied in the source country’s intermediate gross exports to Country r, but eventually return
to, via all possible routines through third countries and other sectoral linkages, and is absorbed in

                                                                20

      e) Similar to DVA _ G sr , we define DVA _ F sr as the measure of DVA from a particular
sector of the source Country s that is embodied in Country s’s gross exports via forward
industrial linkages.
      DVA _ F sr  VAX _ F sr  RDV _ F sr                                                                     (23)16
     Summing up equation (23) across all trading partners, we obtain:
      G                     G                                                   G

      DVA _ F sr   (VAX _ F sr  RDV _ F sr )  Vˆ s Lss  E sr  Vˆ s Lss E s*
      rs                   rs                                                 rs
                                                                                                               (24)

     It measures how much a sector’s domestic value added can be generated from the production
of gross exports in Country s, regardless of whether this value added is finally absorbed by the
home country or other countries. We can show that, at the bilateral-sector level,
Vˆ s Lss E sr  VAX _ F sr  RDV _ F sr due to Vˆ s Lss E sr only trace where the domestic value-added

is produced, while DVA _ F sr also requires these value-added have to be absorbed by a particular
partner country r. This implies that the first part of equation (37) in KWW (2014) can only be
extended to the country-sector level but not to the bilateral-sector level due to country s’s
domestic value added embodied in Vˆ s Lss E sr could be absorbed by a third country t. Detailed
proof of equations (24) is given in Appendix G.
     Our main analytical results can be summarized by the following statements:17
•    In a world of three or more countries, VAX_G and VAX_F, are, in general, not equal to each
     other at the disaggregate level, though they are the same at the country aggregate level.
     DVA_G and DVA_F are also only the same at country aggregate level. These relationships
     can be summarized by Table 1 below: At any disaggregate level, VAX_G is always less than
     or equal to gross exports, thus the ratio of VAX_G to gross exports has an upper bound of
     one. Therefore, 1–VAX_G ratio is conceptually meaningful when gross exports are positive

16
    To help readers understand the derivation of the two types of value added trade and two types of GDP in gross
exports measures defined in equations (19) to (23), we use the three-country, two sector ICIO model as an example
in Appendix F to show the relationship among these forward/backward linkage based measures.
17
    Due to space limitation, we leave the derivation of equations (19) to (23), mathematical proofs of Propositions
A–C that correspond to the four statements, and a more detailed discussion on the relationship among these
measures to Appendix F.

                                                                 21
    and can be used as summary statistic for the extent of double counting in trade statistics at
    any level of disaggregation. Such a measure is always bounded by zero and 1. (The
    conventional VAX_F ratio is identical to this measure at the country aggregate level, but only
    at this level.)
•   At the country-sector level, VAX_F ≤ DVA_F (=VAX_F+RDV_F) ≤ sector-level value added
    production. Therefore, the ratios of VAX_F and DVA_F to GDP by industry both have an
    upper bound of one. These ratios can be used as summary statistics for cross-country
    production sharing.
•   Because both RDV_F and RDV_G are non-negative, therefore, both DVA_F and DVA_G are
    always greater than or equal to the two trade in value-added measures (VAX_F and VAX_G)
    by definition.

    The intuition behind these statements is simple: since direct value added exports at the sector
level are the same for the two “trade in value added” measures, only indirect value added trade
may differ. The indirect value added exports in the forward-linkage-based measure are the
sector’s value added embodied in other (downstream) sectors’ gross exports, which has no
relation to the gross exports from that sector. Therefore, the ratio of value added exports to gross
exports at the sector level cannot be properly defined based on forward industrial linkage. It is in
fact common in the data for some sectors to have very little or no gross exports (e.g., service
sectors), but their output is used by other domestic industries as intermediate inputs, and thus
they can have a large amount of indirect value added exports through other sectors. In such
cases, the forward linkage based VAX ratio can become large and even infinite. Similarly, at the


                                                       22
bilateral level, due to indirect value added trade via third countries, two countries can have a
large volume of value added trade with little or no gross trade. Therefore, the ratio of value
added exports to gross exports as defined in the literature is not upper bounded by one. However,
because such indirect value added exports are part of the total value added created by the same
sector, the forward-linkage-based value added exports and domestic value added embedded in
the gross exports to GDP ratio can be properly defined at the sector level.


3. Applications: Decomposition Results for 40 Economies during 1995–2011
    We apply our disaggregated accounting framework to the World Input-Output Database
(WIOD). The WIOD, developed by a consortium of eleven European research institutions
funded by the European Commission, provides a time series of inter-country input-output (ICIO)
tables from 1995 to 2011, covering 40 economies including all major industrialized countries and
major emerging trading nations. Timmer et al. (2012) provide a detailed description of this
database.
    Our disaggregated accounting framework produces a series of panel data sets, consisting of
many GN (1435) by G (41) and GN by GN matrices each year, collectively taking up more than
20 gigabytes of storage space when the decomposition is computed at the most detailed level. To
illustrate how the estimation outcomes can help us to better understand cross country production
sharing patterns in a manageable manner, we provide a series of examples, which are selected
and processed from subsets of the detailed results.


3.1 Decomposing bilateral-sector level gross trade
    As stated, Equation (18) is a key result of the paper. To illustrate what it can achieve, we use
the US-China bilateral trade in electrical and optical equipment as an example. Among all
bilateral-sector level trade flows in recent years, this is the single biggest product group
measured by the volume of gross trade, with the sum of two-way flows reaching $212 billion in
2011. By gross statistics, presented in column 1 of Table 2, the trade is highly imbalanced, with
Chinese exports to the US ($176.9 billion in 2011) being five times that of US exports to China
($35.1 billion in 2011). If we separate exports of final goods versus that of intermediate goods
(reported in columns 2a and 2b of Table 2), we see that most of the Chinese exports consist of
final goods, whereas most of the US exports consist of intermediate goods.


                                                23
     We provide a decomposition of the bilateral trade flows for selected years (1995, 2005, and
2011) in columns (3)–(7) of Table 2. More precisely, Column (1) = (3)+(4)+(5)+(6)+(7), where
column (3), VAX_G, represents the exporter’s domestic value added that is ultimately absorbed
by other countries, including by both the direct importing country and other foreign countries;
column (4), RDV_G, is the part of domestic value added initially exported but ultimately
returned home and is absorbed at home; column (5), MVA, is the part of the FVA that comes
from the direct importing country; column (6), OVA, is the part of the FVA that comes from third
countries; and finally, column (7) is the pure double counted items.
     Column (3) = (3a) + (3b) + (3c), that is, the VAX_G part is further decomposed into DVA in
final goods, DVA in intermediate goods directly and indirectly absorbed by trading partners, and
DVA in intermediate goods re-exported from the direct importing country and ultimately
absorbed in third countries.
     The decomposition results show that US and Chinese exports have very different value
added structures. First, the VAX_G as a share of gross exports is much higher for US exports (81%
in 2011) than for Chinese exports (about 70% in 2011).18 Second, correspondingly, the FVA
share (MVA+OVA) is higher for Chinese exports than for US exports. This is especially true for
the OVA share in China. In other words, US exports rely overwhelmingly on their own value
added (only 2.1% from China and 5.8% from other countries in 2011), whereas Chinese exports
use more foreign value added, especially value added from third countries (with 3.2% from the
United States and 23.1% from Japan, Korea, and all other countries). Third, whereas the RDV_G
share is trivial for China, it is non-negligible for the United States (7.0% in 2011). This again
reflects the different positions the two countries occupy in the global production chain. As the
United States produces and exports parts and components, it is on the upstream of the chain; part
of its value added in its exports returns home as embedded in imports from other countries. In
comparison, China is on the downstream of the chain; very little of its value added comes back
home as intermediate goods in other countries’ exports. This is also evidenced by China having a
much higher proportion of FVA used in producing its final goods exports to the US, while the US
has a higher share of FVA in producing its intermediate goods exports to China.
     The decomposition of VAX_G into (3a), (3b), and (3c) also reveals differences between the

    Because WIOD does not distinguish processing and normal trade, the domestic value added share for China is
likely to be overestimated. For a method to correct this, see Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2012).

                                                     24
two exporters. In particular, the VAX_G in Chinese exports to the United States is dominated by
DVA in final goods, whereas the VAX_G in US exports is dominated by DVA in intermediate
goods that is absorbed by China and other countries.
    As a consequence of these differences in the structure of value added composition,
China-US trade balance in this sector looks much smaller when computed in terms of domestic
value added than in terms of gross trade. In column (8), we report forward-linkage based value
added exports, or VAX_F. Because this measure captures value added originating in that sector in
all downstream sectors of exports from the exporting country but excludes contributions of value
added from other (upstream) domestic sectors to the electrical and optical equipment sector, it is
generally not the same as VAX_G at the bilateral-sector level, and in our application, VAX_F is
smaller than VAX_G (this is generally true for downstream sectors).
    We report the US-China bilateral balance of trade in electrical and optical equipment sector
by gross and various value-added components in the bottom section of table 2.
    It is important to bear in mind that at the bilateral-sector level, VAX_G is always a part of
gross trade flows, while VAX_F always deviates from gross trade flows due to indirect exports
via other sectors and third counties. While VAX_G is a measure of “trade in value added” that is
bounded by the bilateral gross trade flows, it is not a proper measure of bilateral value added
trade flows, because it also includes a portion of value added that is absorbed by third countries,
unlike VAX_F, which is absorbed by a particular partner country only.
   The results reported in the bottom section of table 2 not only reveal the misleading nature of
balance of trade computed from gross trade statistics but also the sources of the error. For
instance, based on the value added method, in 2011, US-China bilateral balance of electric and
optical equipment is only about two thirds of what is indicated by the gross trade data. Domestic
value-added absorbed by other countries only took 66.9% (column 3) of the total gross
imbalance; the rest of it came from third country transfer and double counting: 27.4% due to
Chinese exports to the US using more value-added from third countries than that in US exports
to China (column 6); 3.4% due to Chinese exports to the US including more US value added than
Chinese value-added embodied in US exports to China (column 5); and another 3.1% due to
more pure double counting in China’s exports to the US than that in US exports to China
(column 7), indicating Chinese value-added has more border crossing than US value-added
before they reach their final consumers.

3.2 Identifying a country’s role in global value chains by the structure of domestic value
added embodied in its exports
       As shown by equation (18) and Figure 1, different components within a country’s
domestic value added in its sector’s gross exports represent different types of cross-country
production sharing arrangements. In other words, different structures of these components
       contain useful information about the nature of cross country production sharing. For
example, two countries may have very similar shares of domestic value added in their gross
exports but very different value added structures due to their different roles in global value
chains. We had given a hypothetical example to make such a point in the introduction; we now
report a real world example based on data from the WIOD.
       When comparing textile exports by the United States and India, if we only pay attention
to the shares of domestic value added in the sector’s gross exports (DVA) for the two countries,
reported in Columns (3) and (9) of Table 3, respectively, they look very similar during 1995–
2011. In fact, the shares were almost identical in 2005. Do US and Indian textile sectors truly
participate in the global textile production chains in the same way? To gain insight, it is useful
to make use of our more detailed decomposition formula, with the results reported in Columns
(4)–(7) for the United States and Columns (10)–(13) for India, respectively. Once we lift this
veil, we see remarkable differences. For textile exports, the DVA_FIN share is about 80% for
India (Column 10), but only 50% for the United States (Column 4). On the other hand, the
DVA_INT share is about 10% for India’s textile exports (Column 11) but close to 30% for that
of the United States (Column 5). Furthermore, US textile gross exports embed about 10% or
more domestic value added that will eventually return home after being used as intermediate
inputs in other countries’ exports (Column 7). In contrast, Indian textile gross exports contain
virtually no domestic value added that eventually returns home (Column 13). These differences
suggest that the textile sector in these two countries occupy different positions in global textile
production chains. In particular, India is likely at the bottom of the chain, while the US is at a
more upstream position.

3.3 Tracing structures of Vertical Specialization across countries and over time
        Vertical specialization or VS, is a summary statistic to measure international production
sharing widely used in the literature (e.g., Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001), and Antras (2013)).
However, as shown by our equation (18) and Figure 1, there are different components within
VS, and each has a different economic meaning and represents different types of cross-country
production sharing arrangement. For example, a large share of foreign value added in a
country’s final goods exports (FVA_FIN) may indicate that the country mainly engages in final
assembling activities based on imported components and just participates in cross-country
production sharing on the low end of a global value chain, while an increasing foreign value
added share in a country’s intermediate exports (FVA_INT) may imply the country is upgrading
its industry to start producing intermediate goods for other countries, especially when more and
more of these goods are exported to third countries for final goods production. The latter is a
sign that the country is no longer at the bottom of the GVCs.
        Pure double counting terms in a country’s exports (PDC) can only occur when there is
back and forth trade of intermediate products. An increasing weight of PDC share in VS

                                                           28
indicates the deepening of cross-country production sharing. Intermediate goods have to cross
national borders multiple times before they are used in final goods production. Therefore,
knowing the relative importance of these components and their changing trend over time in a
country’s total VS can help us to gauge the depth and pattern of cross-country production
sharing and discover the major drivers of the general increase of VS in a country’s gross
exports during the last two decades.
        As shown in Table 4, across all countries and all sectors, the total VS sourced from
manufacturing and services sectors used in world manufacturing goods production has increased
by 8.6 percentage points (from 22.9% in 1995 to 31.5% in 2011, column 3). Interestingly, the VS
structure information reported in the last three columns indicates that this net increase is mainly
driven by an increase of PDC. This suggests that the international production chain is getting
longer; over time, a rising portion of trade reflects intermediate goods made and exported by one
country, used in the production of the next-stage intermediate goods and exported by another
country to be used by the next country to produce yet another intermediate good. This
progressively increasing trade of intermediate goods that cross national borders multiple times is
what gives the rising share of PDC.

Note: VS is sourced from manufacturing and services sectors only.

        Because the share of foreign value added in final goods exports in total VS has declined
by about 5 percentage points during the same period (from 44.6% in 1995 to 39.7 in 2011), and
because the share of foreign value added in intermediate goods exports in total VS stayed almost

                                                         29
constant, the increase of VS share in world manufacturing exports is driven mainly by an increase
in PDC share (from 21.1% in 1995 to 26.7% in 2011). If this trend continues, the PDC share may
reach the level of the FVA share and become an important feature of cross-country production
sharing. If we add the shares of FVA_INT and PDC, these two components involving
intermediate goods trade have already accounted for more than 60% of the total manufacturing
VS in 2011.
       Of course, there is heterogeneity in the VS structure both across countries and across
sectors, especially between industrialized and developing economies. Table 5 reports total VS
and its structure in electrical and optical equipment exports for six Asian economies: Japan;
Korea; Taiwan; China; India; and Indonesia. The three industrialized Asian economies are
reported in the right panel. Despite their difference in the level of total VS shares, their VS
structure is very similar: lower and declining in FVA_FIN, relatively stable in FVA_INT, and
rapidly expanding in PDC. Taiwan’s VS structure is an informative example (presented in the
right bottom 5 rows in Table 5). Taiwan is an important supplier of parts and components, and
crucially, as Taiwan often occupies several different positions in the global production chain
(since it produces both inputs into chip making, memory chips themselves, and components that
embed the chips), the collective shares of PDC and FVA_INT has reached about 80% of its total
VS (or 40% of its gross exports) since 2005.

Note: VS reported here is sourced from manufacturing and services sector only.
        In comparison, for other developing Asian countries such as China, India, and Indonesia
(presented in the left panel of Table 5), the share of FVA_FIN still accounts for about 50% of their
total VS until 2011. However, there are also interesting differences among the three emerging
Asian giants: the VS structure change during the 17 years for China was mainly driven by the
decline of FVA_FIN and increase of PDC, while FVA_INT stayed relatively stable. For Indonesia,
it was driven by the rapid expansion of both FVA_INT and PDC, which increased by at least 10
percentage points during this period, indicating that there was rapid upgrading of Indonesia’s
electrical and optical equipment industries during this period. For India, the late-comer in the
Asian global production network of electrical and optical equipment, the share of FVA_FIN rose
(from 38.1% in 1995 to 52.4% in 2011) and the FVA_INT share continued to decline (from 40.2%
in 1995 to 25.2% in 2011), while the PDC share stayed relatively stable in the last 17 years. This
may be the result of a strategic shift from import substitution to export oriented development; it is
also consistent with a move from the upper stream portion of the production chain to a more
downstream position as China and Indonesia did decades ago. This empirical evidence indicates
that the structure of VS in addition to its total sums offer additional information about each
country’s respective position in the global value chain.

4. Concluding Remarks
       This paper developed a disaggregated accounting framework of gross trade flows at
either the sector, bilateral, or bilateral-sector level. It provides a transparent framework to
completely decompose gross exports into its various components, including exports of
value-added, domestic value-added that returns home, foreign value-added, and double-counted
intermediate trade. These conceptually different components sum up to 100% of the gross trade
flows at any level of disaggregation. By identifying which parts of the official data are double
counted and the sources of the double counting, it bridges gross trade statistics and national
accounts in consistence with the System of National Accounts standard. More importantly, it
goes beyond simply extracting value-added trade from gross trade, and recovers additional
useful information about the structure of international production sharing at a disaggregated
level that is masked by gross trade data.
       In principle, when new countries or years are added to the WIOD database, or an
alternative inter-country input-output table becomes available, our accounting framework can
be applied as well. So the accounting framework developed in this paper is not inherently tied
to the WIOD database and can be a stand-alone tool to help us extract useful information from
official trade statistics. It is our hope that this gross trade accounting method and the datasets
generated by applying the method could provide a useful tool and additional data source for
other researchers in the international trade community to study a variety of issues that relate to
cross-country production sharing and global value chains.

Appendix A: Decompose intermediate and gross trade: 2-country 2-sector and 3-country
2-sector Cases
    In the 2-country 2-sector ICIO model mentioned in section 2.1, the gross exports of
Country s can be decomposed into two parts: final goods exports and intermediate goods
exports based on following accounting identity:

            e1sr   y1sr  a11sr                      a12sr   x1r 

the following four components according to where they are finally absorbed:

goods exports used by Country r to produce domestic final goods and consumed in Country r;
the second term is the part of country s’ intermediate goods exports used by Country r to
produce final goods exports that are shipped back to Country s; the third term is the part of
Country s’ intermediate goods exports that are used by Country r to produce intermediate
exports, shipped back to Country s and used by Country s to produce its domestic consumed

Equations (A3) and (A7), both of them completely decompose Country s’ intermediate exports,
are the key technical step to fully decompose gross trade flows, since they transfer gross output
(and gross exports), usually endogenous variables in standard ICIO models, to exogenous
variables in the gross trade accounting framework we proposed. Together with the global

value-added multipliers defined below, they are the major step stones in deriving our gross
exports decomposition formula.
     From equation (5) in main text, we can obtain Country s’ domestic and foreign
value-added multipliers as follows:

     Finally, based on the standard Leontief decomposition, Country s’ final goods exports can
be decomposed into domestic and foreign value-added as follows:




19For example, when a matrix is multiplied by n n  1 column vector, each row of the matrix is multiplied by the
corresponding row of the vector.

      Equation (A13) indicates that the gross exports of a country can be completely
decomposed into the sum of nine terms. It is an extension of equation (13) in KWW; with the
domestic pure double counting term being further split by production related to final and
intermediate goods exports respectively. To better understand each term in this accounting
equation, we provide the following economic interpretations:
      The first term is domestic value added embodied in the final exports of the 1st and 2nd
sectors of Country s. Each of them has two parts: domestic value added created by the sector
itself and domestic value added created by the other sector embodied in the sector’s final
exports.
      The second term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s
                                                                          rr     rr
intermediate exports which are used by Country r to produce final goods, y1 and y2 , and are

                                                                                     39
consumed in r.
     These two terms are domestic value added embodied in Country s’ gross exports which are
ultimately absorbed by Country r. They are value added exports of Country s.
     The third term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s
intermediate exports used to produce Country r’s final exports, i.e. country s’ imports of final
goods from r.
     The fourth term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s
intermediate exports that are used by Country r to produce intermediate exports and return to
Country s via its intermediate imports to produce its domestic final goods.
     These two terms are domestic value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sector’s gross
exports which returned home and are finally consumed in Country s.
     The first four terms are the domestic value added (GDP) embodied in the 1st and 2nd
sectors’ gross exports of Country s, which include value added created from all sectors in
Country s.
     The fifth term is domestic value added of Country s' 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate
exports which return home as its 1st and/or 2nd sector's intermediate imports and are used for
production of Country s’ both sector's final exports and are finally consumed in Country r. They
are part of the value-added in Country s' final exports and already counted once by the first term
of equation (A13), therefore it is a domestic double counted portion caused by the back and
forth intermediate goods trade in order to produce final goods exports in Country s.
     The sixth term is domestic value added of Country s' 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate
exports that return home as intermediate imports and are used for production of Country s’
intermediate exports to Country r. It is also a domestic double counted portion caused by the
back and forth intermediate goods trade in order to produce intermediate goods exports in
Country s.
     Sum of the first to the sixth terms equals domestic content of the 1st and 2nd sector’s gross

     The seventh term is foreign value added used in Country s' 1st and 2nd sector’s final goods
exports. Each of them also has two parts: foreign value-added from the sector itself and the
other sector used to produce final exports from Country s. Adding up the first and the seventh
terms accounts 100% of the value of the final exports in Country s by sector.
     The eighth term is foreign value added used to produce the 1st and 2nd sector intermediate
exports of Country s, which are then used by Country r to produce its domestic final goods.
Summing the seventh and eighth terms, the two elements in the resulted vector are total foreign
value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sectors’ gross exports of Country s, respectively.
     The ninth term is foreign value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate
exports used by Country r to produce its final and intermediate exports, which is the foreign
double counted term of Country s’ exports. Adding up the eighth and ninth term yields the
foreign content of the 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate exports.
     Therefore, sum the seventh to the ninth terms equals the foreign content of the 1st and 2nd

     Insert equation (A21) into last term in equation (A1), the intermediate goods exports by

Country s can also be decomposed into following two components according to where it is used

similar to a single country IO model:

      Equation (A29) indicates that the exports at bilateral and sector level of a country can be
completely decomposed into the sum of sixteen terms. To better understand each term in this
accounting equation, we provide the following economic interpretations:
      The first term is domestic value added embodied in the final exports of the 1st and 2nd
sectors of Country s to Country r. Each of them has two parts: domestic value added created by
the sector itself and domestic value added created by the other sector embodied in the sector’s
final exports of Country s to Country r.
      The second term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s
intermediate exports of Country s to Country r which are used by Country r to produce its

domestic final goods, y1rr and y2rr , and are consumed in r.
                                                                                  46
         The third term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s bilateral
intermediate exports used to produce Country r’s intermediate exports to Country t and

ultimately absorbed by Country t’ domestic final goods, y1tt and y2tt .

         The fourth term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s

bilateral intermediate exports used to produce Country r’s final exports to Country t, y1rt and

y2rt .

         The fifth term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s bilateral
intermediate exports used to produce Country r’s intermediate exports to Country t and

ultimately absorbed by Country t’ final exports to Country r, y1tr and y2tr .

         These five terms are domestic value added embodied in Country s’ exports to Country r
which are ultimately absorbed by Country r. They are value added exports of Country s via
bilateral exports to Country r.
         The sixth term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s bilateral
intermediate exports used to produce Country r’s final exports back to Country s, i.e. country s’

imports of final goods from r, y1rs and y2rs .

         The seventh term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s
bilateral intermediate exports used to produce intermediate exports to Country t and ultimately

absorbed by Country t’ final exports to Country s, y1ts and y2ts .

         The eighth term is domestic value added embodied in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s
bilateral intermediate exports that are used by Country r to produce intermediate exports and
return to Country s via its intermediate imports to produce its domestic final goods.
         These three terms are domestic value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sector’s bilateral
exports which returned home and are finally consumed in Country s.
         The first eight terms are the domestic value added (GDP) embodied in the 1st and 2nd
sectors’ bilateral exports of Country s, which include value added created from all sectors in

                                                    47
Country s’ bilateral exports to Country r.
     The ninth term is domestic value added of Country s' 1st and 2nd sector’s bilateral
intermediate exports which return home as its 1st and/or 2nd sector's intermediate imports and
are used for production of Country s’ both sector's final exports and are finally consumed in
Country r. They are part of the value-added in Country s' final exports and already counted once
by the first terms of equation (A29) and the decomposition equation of Country s’ exports to
Country r, therefore it is a domestic double counted portion caused by the back and forth
intermediate goods trade in order to produce final goods exports in Country s.
     The tenth term is domestic value added of Country s' 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate
exports that return home as intermediate imports and are used for production of Country s’
intermediate exports to Country r. It is also a domestic double counted portion caused by the
back and forth intermediate goods trade in order to produce intermediate goods exports in
Country s.
     Sum of the first to the sixth tenth equals domestic content of the 1st and 2nd sector’s gross
             2                    2

     The 11th term is Country r’s value added used in Country s' 1st and 2nd sector’s final
exports to Country r. Each of them also has two parts: Country r’s value-added from the sector
itself and the other sector used to produce final exports from Country s.
     The 12th term is Country r’s value added used to produce the 1st and 2nd sector intermediate
exports of Country s to Country r, which are then used by Country r to produce its domestic
final goods.
     The 13th term is Country r’s value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate
exports to Country r and used by Country r to produce its final and intermediate exports, which
is the portion of foreign double counted term of Country s’ exports to Country r.
     Summing the 11th to the 13th terms equals the Country r’s content of the 1st and 2nd sector’s

                                                                                 e .
                                                                            r rs sr
                                                                            i i2 2



     The 14th term is Country t’s value added used in Country s’ 1st and 2nd sector’s final
exports to Country r. Each of them also has two parts: Country t’s value-added from the sector
itself and the other sector used to produce final exports from Country s. Adding up the 1st, the
11th and the 14th terms accounts 100% of the value of the final exports in Country s to Country r
by sector.
     The 15th term is Country t’s value added used to produce the 1st and 2nd sector intermediate
exports of Country s to Country r, which are then used by Country r to produce its domestic
final goods. Summing the 11th, the 12th, the 14th and 15th terms, the four elements in the resulted
vector are total foreign value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sectors’ gross exports of
Country s to Country r, respectively.
     The 16th term is Country t’s value added embodied in the 1st and 2nd sector’s intermediate
exports to Country r and used by Country r to produce its final and intermediate exports, which
is the foreign double counted term of Country s’ exports to Country r. Adding up the 13th and
the 16th terms are the foreign double counted term of Country s’ exports. Adding up the 10th, the
13th and the 16th terms are the double counting terms of gross exports of Country s to Country r.


Appendix B: The Interpretation of Eight Terms in Equation (11)
     Equation (11) in main text decomposes Country s’ gross intermediate goods exports to
Country r according to where they are absorbed as:
                                       G                          G                   G        G

                            G                                         G

     The 1st term in equation (B1) is the part of Country s’ intermediate goods exports used by
Country r to produce domestic final goods that are eventually consumed in Country r; the 2nd
term is the part of Country s’ intermediate exports used by the direct importer, Country r, to

                                                                            49
produce intermediate goods that are exported to the third Country t for production of final
goods consumed in t; the 3rd term is the part of Country s’ intermediate exports used by Country
r to produce final exports which are ultimately absorbed by third Country t; the 4th term is the
part of Country s’ intermediate exports to Country r used by r to produce intermediate exports
to the third Country t for production of final exports absorbed by other countries (including the
direct importer r) except source Country s; the 5th term is the part of Country s’ intermediate
goods exports to Country r that are embedded in Country r’s final goods exports returned to
Country s; the 6th term is the part of Country s’ intermediate exports used by the direct importer
(r) to produce intermediate exports to the third Country t for its production of final exports that
are shipped back to Country s; the 7th term is the part of Country s’ intermediate goods exports
that are used by Country r to produce intermediate exports that are shipped back to Country s to
produce its domestic consumed final goods; and the last term is the part of country s’
intermediate goods exports used by Country r to produce intermediate goods that are shipped
back to Country s to produce final goods exports to all other countries. These eight terms
collectively decompose Country s’ intermediate exports to Country r completely according to
where they are finally absorbed. It will be used later to decompose domestic originated value of
a country’s bilateral gross exports into different value added and double counted components.


    Appendix C: Different types of double counted terms in gross trade statistics
    KWW (2014) has identified three conceptually different types of double counted terms in a
country's gross exports: (1) RDV represents the source country’s domestic value-added that is
initially exported but imported back and consumed at home. Because it is not domestic value
that stays abroad, it is double counted in trade statistics. However, because it constitutes a part
of the source country’s GDP, it is not double counted in either the global or the source country’s
GDP. (2) FVA represents the foreign value added in the source country’s gross exports that are
ultimately absorbed in foreign countries. Since it is already counted in other countries’ GDP, it
is double counted in both trade statistics and global GDP. (3) PDC represents the value of
intermediate products that is already captured by other terms in the gross exports decomposition
                                                 50
equation. Because it represents repeat counting of the same value added terms at least three
times and only occur when there is two way intermediates trade, KWW label it as “pure
double-counted terms.”
    Although mathematical expressions of these double counted terms are included in their
gross exports decomposition equation (36), KWW only illustrate the difference among them in
a two country setting, and did not explicitly derive the relations among them and show how
they repeat count other domestic value-added terms. This is what we will do in this appendix.
    Summing up equation (18) over all sectors and trading partners, we obtain an equation
exactly the same as equation (36) in KWW (2014), and rearranging it as

    As indicated by equation (C1), MVA is the direct importing country’s value added
embodied in the source country’s exports and ultimately absorbed by the direct importer. OVA
is value added from third countries that are embodied in the source country’s gross exports.
    We summarize the relationship among the major terms in equation (C1) by the following
three propositions. Proposition C.1 reveals how the two components of FVA, MVA, and OVA,
are related to other terms. Propositions C.2. and C.3 reveal how the two pure double counted
terms, DDC and FDC, respectively, are related to other terms.
    Proposition C.1: The FVA in a country’s gross exports double counts the RDV_B in gross
exports of direct importing countries and DVA_INTrex in gross exports of third countries.
    Proof: Based on equation (C1), we can obtain

        Since FVA = MVA + OVA, therefore,

    This indicates that FVA exactly double counts RDV_B and DVA_INTrex in measuring
value-added in global exports.
     The intuition of this proposition is simple: when RDV_B and DVA_INTrex cross borders
from the source country to the direct importer for the first time, they are both counted as part of
the source country’s domestic value added in its gross exports. When they cross national
borders for the second time either from the direct importer back to the source country or are
re-exported to a third country, they are counted another time as MVA or OVA in gross exports
of the direct importing country. Therefore, FVA is value-added that crosses national borders at
least twice.
     Proposition C.2: The DDC in a country’s gross exports repeatedly counts the value of the
gross intermediate trade flows originating from the home country. The limit of the double

where the double counting coefficient is a 1 by N vector. The terms inside the parentheses are N
by 1 vectors, representing different parts of gross output induced by the production of other

countries’ total gross exports (this part of the output in each country sums to X r  Lrr Y rr ). Their
values are measured by the back and forth movement of intermediate trade flows originating
from other (foreign) countries, which also cross national borders at least 3 times but through
different routes: (1) as intermediate exports from the home country, (2) re-exported by direct
importing countries to third countries as intermediate exports, and (3) exported by a third
country again to other countries except the home country as intermediate or final products. The
process can continue and repeat further until the value is absorbed by a destination country.
        The intuition behind propositions C.2 and C.3 is also simple: positive values of DDC
and FDC only occur when there are back and forth intermediate trade flows among countries.
They repeatedly count intermediate trade flows that cross national borders. Those intermediate

                                                                                           54
trade transactions are not part of any country’s GDP or final demand (beyond what has already
been counted), similar to domestic inter-industry transactions that use one type of intermediate
input to produce another type of intermediate inputs. Because all cross-country trade
transactions are recorded by two countries’ customs authorities, they show up in trade statistics.
In comparison, domestic intermediate input transactions are deducted from total gross output
when official GDP by industry statistics is accounted for. Therefore, PDC is not a value added
concept, and has different economic and mathematical properties compared to RDV_B and
FVA, although all three represent double counted terms in a country’s gross exports.
     Based on equation (C3), the gross exports of Country s in 3 country case can be expressed
as

Appendix D: Decomposition of a country’s bilateral exports into traditional and GVC trade
     In traditional trade, the domestic factor content embodied exports are directly absorbed by
importers without involving re-exports or production activities in any third countries. The

intermediate exports and final exports in traditional bilateral trade can be measured as (V s Lss ) T # Y sr

and (V s Lss ) T # ( A sr Lrr Y rr ) , which are not involved re-exports and third countries. Therefore,

equation (18) in main text can be further decomposed as:

    The 1st category, (V s Lss )T # Y sr  (V s Lss )T # ( Asr LrrY rr ) , is the domestic value added embodied in

traditional exports, which directly absorbed by trade partner r. The 2nd category is country s’s value
added embodied in GVC exports and ultimately absorbed by trade partner r. The 3rd category is
country s’s domestic value-added in GVC exports and ultimately absorbed by the third country
(other countries). The 4th category is Country s’s domestic value-added in its intermediate exports
and ultimately absorbed by source Country s. the 2nd to 4th categories are the domestic value added
embodied in GVC exports. Other categories are same to equation (18) in the main text.

     As a sum of domestic value-added in gross exports to all other G-1 countries, and combine the
2nd and the 3rd , the 4th and the 5th , as well as the 6th and the 7th terms respectively, the first 10
terms that decompose Country s’ domestic value-added in equation (18) of the main text reduce to 7

terms without separation of direct importer and third countries. Similarly, the last 6 terms in equation
(18) of the main text that decompose foreign value-added in bilateral gross exports are summed to
three terms with no distinction between direct importing country and third countries.

value-added created from the 1st sector of the source Country s is absorbed by the destination
Country r: The first term is sector 1’s value-added embodied in Country s’ final goods exports (of
both sectors) consumed by Country r, the second term is sector 1’s value-added embodied in Country
s’ intermediate goods exports (of both sectors) used by Country r to produce its domestic final goods
and consumed there. The last term is sector 1’s value-added embodied in Country s’ intermediate
goods exports (of both sectors) to third Country t and used by t to produce final goods exports to
Country r.

export measures divert from bilateral gross trade flows due to either indirect exports through other
domestic sectors or indirect exports through third countries). The difference between 3-country
model and 2-country model is obvious, since (F1) not only includes value-added exports from
Country s embodied in its own gross exports to Country r (second term), but also include
value-added exports by Country s embodied in its gross exports to third Country t, but finally

exports to country r that will stay abroad, regardless these value-added is finally absorbed by
Country r or by other third countries.

        We have:

     Where the first two positive terms in equation (F7) represent value added created by the 2nd
sector of Country s embodied in the 1st sector exports from Country s to Country r and consumed in r.
The first two negative terms represent value added created by the 1st sector of Country s embodied in
the 2nd sector exports from Country s to Country r and consumed in Country r. The final positive
term represent value added created by Country s (both sectors) embodied in the 1st sector exports
from Country s to Country r and consumed in third Country t. The final negative term represent
value added created by the 1st sector of Country s embodied in exports (Doth sectors) from Country s
to third Country t and consumed in t. These positive and negative terms are should not equal each

other except very special cases, so vax _ g1sr and vax _ f1sr do not equal each other in general.

     In the right side of equation (F13), all positive terms represent value added created by the 1st
sector of Country s embodied in the 2nd sector exports of Country s and consumed abroad, all
negative terms represent value added created by the 2nd sector of Country s embodied in the 1st sector
exports of Country s and consumed abroad. Therefore, adding up equation (F12) and (F13), the
difference will be fully canceled out.

           At country aggregate level, RDV_Gs* and RDV_Fs* are equal to the sum of the 4th and 5th terms
of Equation 36 in KWW.
           DVA_Gsr equals the sum of VAX_Gsr and RDV_Gsr, and DVA_Fsr equals the sum of VAX_Fsr and
RDV_Fsr by definition, while we already show VAX_G and VAX_F are equal only at country
aggregate level and RDV_Gsr and RDV_Fsrare equal at bilateral and country aggregate level,
therefore,                      DVA_Gsr and                                  DVA_Fsr are                                 equal              only   at   country   aggregate    level.   i.e

           By proof of proposition A above, the relationship among the two measures of trade in
value-added and the two measures of domestic value-added embodied in gross exports are made
clear analytically. Then, the proof of proposition B and C is straightforward.

           Because vax _ g isr is the sum of the first five terms and dva _ g isr is the sum of the eight terms

in equation (18) of the main text by definition, i. e. vax _ g isr and dva _ g isr are always part of eisr

                                                                                                                vax _ g isr dva _ g isr
and vax _ g isr  dva _ g isr  eisr , therefore,                                                                                       1 always holds. i.e. Proposition

In the same way, other bilateral trade flows can be fully decomposed as reported in Table F2
     This example shows that one has to be careful about defining the VAX ratios at a disaggregated
level. If one were to use the definition based on forward industrial linkages proposed by Johnson and
Noguera (2012), 6 out of the 12 VAX ratios at the bilateral sector level would be undefined (positive
value added exports, but zero gross exports, the ratio goes to infinity, shown in Column 24 of table
F2). At the aggregate bilateral level, the same VAX ratio would be undefined in 2 out of the 6 cases
(rows ST and TR in Table F2).          While the VAX ratio based on backward industrial linkage
(computed in column 19 of Table F2) we defined in this paper is always bounded between zero and
100% for all cases. Indicating it can be used as an inverse measure of double counting at any level of
disaggregation. Note that at the country aggregate level, our proposed measure coincides with the
other VAX ratio.

    Therefore, DVA_F or VLE based on forward linkage are equal VAX_F + RDV_F at
country-aggregate level.
     We can also decompose VssLssEsr based on backward industrial linkage in G-country world
as follows.

     It shows that VLE can be decomposed into four parts: domestic value added embodied in
final goods exports, and domestic value-added embodied in intermediate goods that are finally
absorbed in the direct importing country r, returned to the exporting country s, and re-exported
to third countries t, respectively. Domestic value-added in these terms not only include
value-added from the exporting sectors, but also other domestic sectors that contributes to the
