Can Payroll Tax Cuts Help Firms During Recessions?

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the effect of payroll tax cuts on firm activity during economic downturns. We
use two regional payroll tax cuts in Finland as well as the onset of the Great Recession to estimate
the effect of the recession on firms treated by the payroll tax cuts compared to a similar control group.
When implemented, prior to the Great Recession, we estimate that the payroll tax cuts had limited
effects on firms located in the treated regions. However, when the recession starts, some of its negative
effects were substantially hampered by the previously enacted payroll tax cuts in treated firms. These
effects are exacerbated for men and low-skilled employees. We also find that sales and profits in treated
firms respond differently in treated firms during the recession. This shows that payroll tax cuts can
make firms more resilient during downturns.

1         Introduction

How do payroll taxes affect firms during economic downturns? The common wisdom in
public finance is that the incidence of payroll taxes is mostly borne by workers, in which
case, payroll tax changes should not affect firm-level outcomes. However, recent evidence
has questioned this received wisdom, by showing that some, if not all, of the incidence of
payroll taxes is borne by firms and can substantially affect firm level activity.1 This paper
empirically addresses this question by estimating the effect of payroll taxes on firm activity
during the Great Recession.
        Our empirical strategy relies on using two regional tax cuts in Finland that were enacted
several years prior to the Great Recession and were still in place throughout the entire
recessionary period. These two waves of payroll tax cuts were enacted in 2003 and 2005
and were repealed in 2012, which allows us to observe the behavior of firms in the treated
regions before and after the onset of the Great Recession in 2008 in Finland. The treated
regions are all located in the Northern part of Finland, which is relatively poor compared
to the rest of the country. However, not all Northern regions are selected into treatment,
which allows us to use the remaining similar Northern regions as a control group. Using a
difference-in-difference strategy, we compare firms located in regions treated with the payroll
tax cuts to firms in similar control regions where payroll taxes were not changed.
        First, we find that the payroll tax cuts, when enacted several years prior to the Great
Recession, have very limited effects on earnings and on firm-level outcomes, implying that the
savings from the lower payroll tax cuts are likely channeled into firms and likely saved since
they do not appear to affect employment, earnings, sales or investment. The clearest effect
of the cut in payroll taxes appears at the time of the Great Recession: here we estimate that
firms located in the treatment regions exhibit a substantially different behavior than the ones
in the control region. In particular, while the Great Recession caused a decrease in earnings
in firms located in both control and treatment regions, these decreases are substantially
    1

                                                         1
smaller in the treated regions. And these effects seem to be particularly acute for low-skilled
workers. Overall, the net of payroll tax wage bill is relatively higher for firms in the treated
regions, consistent with them paying their employees relatively more. While the employment
effects are somewhat noisier, we also find that treated firms employ relatively more workers,
which could be due to either more hiring or fewer separations. In addition, treated firms also
invest relatively more and realize more sales than control firms during the Great Recession.
Importantly, some of these effects are long lived and tend to persist even after the payroll
tax cuts are repealed in 2012. This is particularly true for the employment effects.
   Our main identification assumption is that firms in the treatment regions would have
behaved similarly to firms in the control region had there been no change in payroll taxes.
A common test of this assumption is to ensure that trends in the control and treatment
groups are parallel prior to the change in payroll taxes. Our graphical evidence is consistent
with this identification assumption. We also show evidence that the control and treatment
regions are very similar along many observable characteristics. This is likely due to the fact
that regions were selected into treatment not because of their economic conditions but rather
because of political considerations: the payroll tax cuts were targeted at Northern regions
only, which are typically poorer than the rest of Finland, but among these regions, it did
not affect the poorest ones. While all the treatment regions are relatively poor compared to
the rest of Finland, they are not the poorest regions in the area.
   Our main contribution is to shed light on the effects of payroll taxes during recessions,
which is a question that had not been addressed by previous literatures. In doing so, we
contribute to three main strands of literatures. First, we contribute to the tax incidence
literature and in particular to the few papers that address the question of who bears the
incidence of payroll taxes. Our main contribution to this literature is to assess whether the
incidence of payroll taxes depends on the business cycle. This literature has mostly focused
on estimating the incidence of payroll taxes without paying much attention to business cycles.
While older papers have mostly estimated that workers bear the incidence of payroll taxes


                                               2
(Gruber (1997)), recent results (Saez et al. (2012), Saez et al. (2019) and Benzarti & Harju
(2020)) show that firms are likely to bear a substantial burden of the incidence of payroll
taxes. Relatedly, Bozio et al. (2019) show that this burden crucially depends on whether
payroll taxes are linked to the benefits they fund. Notably, Korkeamki & Uusitalo (2009)
use the same variation from the first wave of the experiment as we do to study short-term
responses and find no clear wage or employment responses.2 Finally, Huttunen et al. (2013)
finds no employment or wage responses to a very targeted payroll tax cut for the employers
of older and low-wage workers in Finland.
       Second, we contribute to a public finance literature that assesses whether government
intervention should vary during the business cycle. While we do not address this question
directly ­ we do not derive optimal payroll tax rates over the business cycle ­ we provide
evidence that the effect of payroll taxes varies over the business cycle, which can help inform
future research on this question. In public finance, this literature has mostly focused on the
optimal provision of unemployment insurance (see Landais et al. (2018b) and Landais et al.
(2018a)) and on public expenditure (Michaillat & Saez (2019)).
       Relatedly, our results have implications for the effectiveness of stimulus programs. Our
paper is closely related to Ku et al. (2020), who show that place-based payroll tax cuts
are partially shifted to employees and have large employment effects. We complement their
analysis by focusing on the effect of place-based payroll tax cuts during periods of severe
economic downturns. While there are several papers showing that Value-Added Tax cuts
are ineffective at stimulating firm activity as they are mostly passed through to profits (see,
e.g. Benzarti & Carloni (2019); Kosonen (2015); Benzarti et al. (Forthcoming); Harju et al.
(2018)), few papers have considered the stimulus effects of payroll taxes. Our findings suggest
that they can have long-run effects on firm activity by increasing production, output and
profits even after the cuts are repealed. They also lead to higher wages, which can also
   2
    Korkeamki (2012) also studies the longer term effects of the experiments, and uses the variation from
the second wave of the experiment (in his PhD dissertation) but does not consider the effects of the payroll
tax cut during the Great Recession.



                                                     3
stimulate demand.
    Finally, our results are also closely related to papers estimating the effect of place-based
policies (reviewed for example in Kline & Moretti (2014) and Neumark & Simpson (2015)).
In our empirical setting the payroll tax cuts were targeted to high unemployment areas and
aimed at increasing employment. Our empirical findings support the view that reducing
payroll tax rates in areas suffering from poor economic conditions can increase economic
activity, especially during bad economic cycles.



2     Institutions and empirical setting

2.1    The Finnish Payroll Tax System

The payroll tax system in Finland is similar to that of other countries in that it funds social
insurance programs including old age insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance
and other smaller programs. Both employers and employees are statutorily liable for paying
a given portion of payroll taxes with a higher share for employers. The tax rate schedule is
a function of several firm and employee characteristics including the age of the worker, the
size of the firm, the capital intensity of the firm and other observable characteristics. The
average employer-level payroll tax rate varies over time and by firm characteristics and has
been higher than 20% during for the past twenty years. Appendix Table 6 shows a detailed
description of the percentages by years by different firm categories.


The Finnish Payroll Tax Experiments. In this paper we use two regional and tem-
porary payroll tax rate cut experiments as a source of exogenous variation. Talks about
experimenting with payroll taxes on a set of Finnish regions started in December 2001. A
proposal of temporarily repealing employer contributions to the National Pension Insurance
and the National Health Insurance was brought to a vote in the Parliament in September
2002. The first wave of cuts was approved in December 2002. The payroll tax rate was


                                               4
cut in January 2003 by 3 to 6 percentage points depending on firm-level characteristics (see
Appendix Table 6). The tax cuts' stated goal was to experiment with lowering payroll taxes
in a group of Finnish municipalities in order to assess the effects of payroll taxes on em-
ployment. With this goal in mind, twenty municipalities were first chosen among a set of
relatively high unemployment municipalities. Importantly, while only poor municipalities
were considered, the twenty municipalities that made it into the treatment group were not
selected solely based on economic conditions. Instead, the final selection of these targeted
municipalities was the result of intense political negotiations.3 As such, some of the highest
unemployment areas were not part of the experiment and there were also areas with equally
high unemployment rates that were excluded from the treatment group. The experiment
resulted in the removal of the national health and pension insurances portion of contribu-
tions for firms located in the twenty treated municipalities.4 Importantly, current and future
benefits were not affected by the cut in payroll taxes which applied to all employees in a
given firm, as long as it was located in one of the treated regions. All private employers
registered for operation in the treated municipalities were eligible for the payroll tax cut.
       The law was passed with the European Union de minimis regulations which regulates firm
subsidies in EU Member States. This meant that the agriculture, fishing and transportation
sectors were excluded from the experiment.
       The second wave of the experiment took place in January 2005, which included additional
municipalities, mostly from the Kainuu region of Finland.5 Firms that were located in these
municipalities were subject to the same payroll tax cuts as the ones from the first wave of the
experiment. There was a third wave of experimentation in 2007, which started in January
   3
     Korkeamki (2012) and Korkeamki & Uusitalo (2009) provide a detailed narrative of the first wave of the
experiment, which we summarize here.
   4
     The target region consisted the following 20 municipalities mostly from the Lapland of Finland: Enonteki,
Hailuoto, Houtskari, Inari, Ini, Kemijrvi, Kittil, Kolari, Korppoo, Muonio, Nauvo, Pelkosenniemi, Pello,
Posio, Salla, Savukoski, Sodankyl, Utsjoki, Velkua and Ylitornio. However, in this paper we do not include
firms located in six municipalities on the islands of the west coast of Finland due to their small size and
remote location. These are: Hailuoto, Houtskari, Ini, Korppoo, Nauvo and Velkua.
   5
     These municipalities were: Kajaani, Kuhmo, Hyrynsalmi, Paltamo, Puolanka, Ristijrvi, Sotkamo, Suo-
mussalmi, Vaala and Vuolijoki.



                                                      5
2007. This wave added six of the most eastern municipalities. However, we do not analyze
this last wave of expansion, as these areas have very few firms and its onset was too close to
that of the Great Recession.
       All waves of the experiment ended in December 2011. Therefore, the first wave lasted
nine years and the second one six with substantial overlap with the Great Recession, which
started mid-2008 in Finland. Starting from January 2012, the firm-level payroll tax rates
were increased in the treatment municipalities so as to match those of the rest of the country.
Appendix Table 6 shows the employers' contribution rates over time.6


Minimum Wages And Wage Setting. Finland does not have a government mandated
minimum wage. Instead, wage bargaining occurs at the national level between employer
and employee representatives, setting a wage floor that depends on several characteristics
including employee tenure, industry of employment and other observable characteristics.
When the central agreement is reached, the negations continue at the sector-level, usually
by each industry. These negotiations set a representative wage level increase in these sectors
but also a minimum wages for each job task. These wage floors are likely to affect the pass-
through of payroll taxes in a similar way national minimum wages would in other countries.
       Importantly, these wages apply to all workers, not only to the employees that belong to
labor unions. Although collective bargaining applies to more than 90% of workers, wages
can vary across firms and across employees within firms. Firms can, of course, pay higher
wages but also lower wages as long as the minimum wage rules are not violated. Therefore,
wages can vary considerably across firms in the same job tasks.
   6
    Note that there was a 0.8 percentage point payroll tax cut that affected all firms in Finland in April
2009 and a larger cut starting in January 2010 as the firm size categories for national health and pension
insurances were removed and harmonized to the lowest payroll tax rate.

2.2    Data

We use a panel dataset of firm-level tax returns, covering the universe of firms in Finland.
The data are annual and contain information on every line of profits and losses at the firm
level, thus allowing us to observe, for example, sales, fixed and variable costs separately, as
well as number of employees, total wage sums and investments. Importantly, the dataset also
includes the exact address for each firm, which is essential for assigning firms to treatment
and control groups. The dataset covers the years 1999 to 2015, but some variables are
missing from 1999 to 2002. However, our main outcomes of interest (payroll tax bill, number
of employees, employee-level earnings, total labor costs, sales and profits) are all available
from 1999 onwards.
   The second dataset used in the analysis includes employer-reported wage information of
all employees. These data, which link employees to firms, cover sole proprietors starting
only from 2006 onwards. For this reason, we exclude them from the analysis. Note that,
although there are many sole proprietors in the data, they are all very small and employ
very few workers (0.5 on average in 2002) and therefore are mostly unaffected by the pay-
roll tax changes we analyze. These individual-level data contain detailed information on
earnings, socio-economic status and other important employee-level characteristics such as
demographic information on the employee: age, gender, education, tenure of job contracts,
etc. Overall, using unique identifiers, we are able to link the firm-level data to the employee-
level data for 97% of corporations and partnerships.


2.3    Estimation Strategy

We estimate the effects of the two payroll tax reforms using a difference-in-differences estima-
tion strategy. The main identification assumption is that, absent payroll tax changes, there
would have been no change in outcomes of the treated group relative to the control group.
To validate this assumption, we extensively inspect the pre-treatment trends of the outcomes
of interest in Section 3.1 across treatment and control groups and show that pre-trends are

                                               7
parallel. Formally, we estimate the following equation:




                   Yi,t = 0 + 1 Ai + 2 (Ai  Recessiont ) + 3 (Ai  Exp1t )                        (1)

                            +4 (Ai  Exp2t ) + i + µt +      i,t




where Y i,t represents the variable of interest in logs, i.e., payroll taxes paid, labor costs net of
the employer portion of payroll taxes, employee-level earnings, number of employees, sales,
profits, etc. Ai is equal to one if firm i is located in one of the treated municipalities and
zero if it is in one of the control municipalities, which we define below. Ai  Recessiont is
the interaction term for firms in treatment areas in the post recession period, years 2009 to
2015. Exp1t is equal to one for the first wave of the payroll tax experiments (2003 to 2011)
and the second wave (2005 to 2011), and is zero otherwise. Exp2t is equal to one for the
post-experiment period (2012 to 2015), and zero otherwise. Firms are weighted by firm-level
pre-reform labor cost levels in all specifications, using the average firm-level labor costs from
1999 to 2002. Standard errors are clustered at the municipality level, which is the source of
the variation we are exploiting in this paper.
   The main coefficients of interest are 2 , 3 and 4 ; 2 identifies the effect of the payroll
tax rate cuts on the post-recession years (2009 to 2015), 3 corresponds to the effect of the
tax cuts on firms at the time of the cuts (for both waves) and 4 identifies the effect of payroll
tax cuts post-Great Recession. In equation 1, µt represents year fixed effects, i corresponds
to firm fixed effects and   i,t   is the error term.
   The control group is constructed so as to include all neighboring municipalities that share
a border with the targeted municipalities, but exclude the four largest cities (Rovaniemi,
Oulu, Kuopio and Joensuu) close to the treatment municipalities, as these were explicitly
excluded from the treatment group when designing the experiment by the Finnish Govern-

ment.7
        Figure 1 shows the different treatment regions and the control municipalities. The control
and treatment groups appear to be reasonably similar, as shown in Figure 2. This Figure
plots average municipality-level outcomes of four main economic measures over time sepa-
rately for the whole country, as well as for the control and treatment regions. Figure 2 shows
that both treatment regions and control regions have, on average, lower employment rates
and tax revenue per capita relative to all municipalities in Finland as well as higher unem-
ployment rates and higher government subsidies. However, the treatment municipalities are
very comparable to the control municipalities, consistent with the fact that assignment to
treatment was not solely based on economic conditions. Municipalities in the control group
have slightly higher employment rates and lower unemployment rates compared to the treat-
ment group, but these level differences are not large. More importantly, the pre-experiment
trends across groups are very similar. There are no noticeable differences in levels or trends
for tax revenue (exclusive of payroll taxes) and government subsidies across the treatment
and control municipalities. It is also worth emphasizing that in many control municipali-
ties, employment rates are lower and unemployment rates higher relative to the treatment
municipalities, which further suggests that economic conditions were not the main and only
criteria of assignment to treatment.

3.1        Graphical Evidence

In this section, we plot our main outcomes of interest separately for the treatment and control
groups. We do this for two reasons: (1) to validate the parallel trend assumption needed

for our difference-in-differences estimation strategy and (2) to visually assess the response of
our main outcomes to the payroll tax reforms and to the Great Recession. Each figure plots
the coefficients from a fixed effect regression of the outcome of interest, namely, the amount
of payroll taxes, payroll costs net of taxes, number of employees and labor input in months
at the firm level on year dummies weighted by pre-reform firm-level annual labor costs. For
all figures we also remove the level differences between groups by indexing all groups to zero
in 2002, a year before the first experiment, and thus the figures show the changes in levels
relative to this year.8 Table 1 shows the firm-level descriptive statistics by treatment and
control regions in 2002.


Payroll Taxes Paid by Firms. The upper-left panel of Figure 3 plots average firm-level
payroll taxes from 1999 to 2015 relative to year 2002. Both treatment and control groups
exhibit parallel trends prior to the reform. We observe a decrease in average payroll taxes
paid in the first year after the treatment starts for both treatment groups, in 2003 for the
first treatment group and 2005 in the second one. As the payroll tax rates are reverted
back to the same level to that of the control municipalities (and the rest of the country), in
2012, the response of treatment group relative to the control group appears to be larger than
the response to the payroll tax cut. This asymmetry could be consistent with an increase
in number of employees or an asymmetric response of wages to payroll tax cuts, which we
investigate next.


Firm-level labor costs and employment. Payroll tax cuts increase incentives to hire
and retain employees. To assess the effect of this incentive, we first plot firm-level labor
costs net of the employer portion of payroll taxes over time in the upper-right panel of
Figure 3. Wage costs includes all costs of employees (net of the employer portion of payroll
taxes), a variable that is directly available in our data. Both treatment and control groups
follow parallel pre-trends from 1999 to 2002, validating our empirical approach. In the
  8
      Appendix Figures 8­11 show the DD estimates over time for pooled treatments for each outcome.


                                                   10
first treatment group there is a clear increase in labor costs right after the reform in 2003
compared to the control group. The pattern is a bit different for the second treatment group.
There is a small increase already in 2005 in the second treatment area but it seems to take
two years after the start of the treatment for there to be a clear increase in labor costs.
   In principle, payroll tax decrease in target regions could also affect the survival rate of
firms, increase entry and movement of existing firms towards the targeted municipalities. If
these effects are present and large, they could also create a challenge for our empirical setting.
Figures 12 and 13 in Appendix A show the number of firms entering into, exiting from and
moving into the target regions. Although there seems to be rather large annual variation in
these numbers, the figures suggest no systematic differences in any of these outcomes during
or after the experiment period. Therefore, these observations suggests that payroll tax cuts
do not affect firm births, deaths or location choices, and also that our empirical approach is
not threatened by these types of responses.
   In order to study the changes in employment over time, we plot the number of employees
and labor input in months. Number of employees represents the number of job contracts a
firm has during a given year and labor input in months represents the number of months
employees' have worked at a given firm within a year. Therefore, both of these measure
describe the amount of labor input used in firms. The lower-left panel of Figure 3 shows
that the pre-experiment trends in the number of employees are again relatively parallel,
although the pre-trend for the second treatment group is somewhat different. The number
of employees slightly increases gradually after the start of the treatment periods for both
treatment groups compared to the control group. The difference with the control group
clearly increases after the start of the Great Recession from 2008 onward. Therefore, the
level of employment is clearly increasing post-recession period among firms in the treatment
municipalities compared to firms in control municipalities. The lower-right panel of Figure
3 for labor input in months shows very similar effects.
   Figure 7 shows the effect of the payroll tax cuts on other firm-level outcomes, namely


                                               11
sales, investments and profits. Sales follow parallel trends prior to the reform and do not
appear to be responding to the payroll tax cut. There is a divergence between the control
and the two treatment groups at the onset of the Great Recession. This differential response
persists over time and suggests that lower payroll taxes may have helped treated firms cope
better with the effects of the financial crisis. The lower-left panel of Figure 7 shows a similar
pattern for investment: they follow parallel trends during the pre-treatment period and there
is no change in investments during the treatment period or after the Great Recession. The
lower-right panel of Figure 7 shows the response of profits: pre-reform trends are parallel and
profits increase as payroll taxes are cut and remain at higher levels for the entire experiment
period, and even once the payroll tax cuts are repealed. This suggests that temporary payroll
tax cuts can have long lasting effects even when the payroll tax rates are brought back to
their original levels.


Employee-level earning responses. Figure 4, plots average employee-level earnings at
the firm level in the treatment and control groups over time. There is no change in average
employee-level earnings following the payroll tax rate cuts in the treatment groups relative
to the control group. This suggests that firms do not reduce employee wages after the payroll
tax cuts, and thus the incidence of payroll taxes appears to be borne by firms. However,
starting from 2008 onward, average earnings are higher in both treatment groups compared
to the control group. Surprisingly, the gap between treatment and control groups remains
even after the payroll tax rates are reverted back to the same level after 2011.
   Figure 5 shows the employee-level earnings responses by gender, education and by types
of job tasks. The figure shows no changes in earnings among any of the groups in the two
treatment regions right after the payroll tax cut. However, starting in 2009, the earnings
diverge in both treatment groups relative to the control group. The This effect is most
prevalent among men, low educated (non-college) workers and employees working in lower-
level and manual tasks.



                                               12
Employee-level employment responses. Figure 6 shows employment responses using
the same division by employee-level characteristics as we did for employee-level earnings. As
is visible from these figures, the pre-payroll tax cut trends are far from perfect complicating
any inference. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution. However, it
appears that the positive employment responses are relatively larger for men, non-college
educated, upper- and lower-level workers.
   Next and In order to quantify all of the effects mentioned in this Section and their associ-
ated standard errors we show regression estimates using a difference-in-differences framework.


3.2    Regression results

Average responses of firm-level labor outcomes. Table 2 shows the results of esti-
mating equation (1) on firm-level outcomes. Column (1) shows that the amount of payroll
taxes decreases by 30% on average among both treatment groups right after the experiment
starts relative to the control group. This confirms that firms in the treated municipalities
indeed experienced a cut in their payroll tax burden. However, it seems that the level of
payroll taxes is higher post-recession period, on average by 7%. This could be consistent
with an asymmetric pass-through of payroll taxes to wages, possibly because of downwards
wage rigidity; or an asymmetric effect of payroll taxes on employment, which could be due
to high firing costs.
   Column (2) shows that the experiments increased firm-level labor costs net of payroll
taxes but only after the recession. This is consistent with the persistent effect on payroll taxes
paid shown in Column (1). The estimates for the effect of the payroll tax cut experiments
are all small and not statistically significant. Column (3) shows that the number of workers
in treated firms increased by 5% during the post-recession period. Similarly, estimates for
the effect of the payroll tax cut experiments are small and statistically insignificant. Column
(4) also shows that the results are very similar using the number of total working months of
all workers within a firm during a year as an alternative measure for labor input.


                                               13
Firm-level production responses. The estimated firm-level production responses at the
time of the Great Recession are larger than those triggered by the changes in payroll taxes
but are very noisily estimated, making any statements about firm-level production at best
suggestive, as can be seen in Table 3. The only effect we can detect with certainty is that
input usage is substantially higher in the treated regions even after the payroll tax cut is
repealed. This is also consistent with an increase in total labor costs as we discuss below
when addressing cumulative effects.


Employee-level earnings responses. Table 4 shows the average employee-level earnings
responses. Column (1) shows that the average earnings level is higher in the treated firms
after the recession compared to firms in the control region. These effects are mostly driven
by low-skilled workers holding non-managerial and manual jobs. This effect is not persistent
and disappears once the payroll tax cut is repealed as can be seen from the cumulative effect
estimates.


Effects on employment. Table 5 shows the employment responses using a classification
of workers similar to that used in Table 4. The estimates in Table 5 suggest that the increase
in employment is driven by higher responses among female and low-educated employees, and
employees in non-manual jobs. Note, however, that few of the employment estimates are
very precise.


Cumulative effects We systematically report the cumulative effects which add up the
effects of the two payroll tax changes and the Great Recession. Overall, the cumulative effects
appear large and significant for total labor costs net of payroll taxes and for inputs use. This
is consistent with firms producing more, although we do not detect a substantial change
in sales. All of the remaining cumulative effects are of small magnitude and statistically
indistinguishable from zero, suggesting that the long-term consequences of the temporary
payroll tax cuts for these other outcomes are negligible.

4      Conclusion

This paper estimates the effect of payroll taxes on firm activity during the Great Recession
by exploiting two regional payroll tax cuts that were enacted several years prior to the start
of the economic downturn. By comparing firms located in regions with lower payroll tax
rates to firms in similar regions unaffected by the payroll tax cuts, our results show that
temporary payroll tax cuts have very limited effects on individual-level earnings and firm-
level outcomes right after their implementation. However, while the Great Recession led to
a decrease in earnings in firms located in both control and treatment regions, these decreases
are substantially smaller in the regions with lower payroll tax rates.
     Therefore, our findings suggest that payroll tax cuts could be a way to stimulate firm
activity during downturns, and could be more effective than VAT rate cuts, for example,
which have been found to be relatively ineffective (see, e.g. Benzarti & Carloni (2019);
Kosonen (2015); Benzarti et al. (Forthcoming); Harju et al. (2018)).
