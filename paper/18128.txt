                                          ABSTRACT

We provide new estimates of the importance of growth rate and uncertainty shocks for developed
countries. The shocks we estimate are large and correspond to well-known macroeconomic
episodes such as the Great Moderation and the productivity slowdown. We compare our results to
earlier estimates of “long-run risks” and assess the implications for asset pricing. Our estimates
yield greater return predictability and a more volatile price-dividend ratio. In addition, we can
explain a substantial fraction of cross-country variation in the equity premium. An advantage of
our approach, based on macroeconomic data alone, is that the parameter estimates cannot be
viewed as backward engineered to fit asset pricing data. We provide intuition for our results using
the recently developed framework of shock-exposure and shock-price elasticities.

1        Introduction

The last 120 years have seen huge and very persistent variation in macroeconomic volatility. The
period prior to World War I (WWI) was a golden era of low volatility. The outbreak of WWI
ushered in a 35 year period of much higher volatility with one crisis following another—WWI,
German hyperinflation, Great Depression, World War II (WWII), to name a few. The late 1950s
and 1960s were a period of renewed tranquility. But the 1970’s and early 1980’s again saw a
large increase in volatility associated with the rise of OPEC, the breakdown of Bretton Woods,
the Iranian Revolution, and the crackdown on inflation initiated by Paul Volcker. Then came the
Great Moderation period which lasted until the onset of the Great Recession in 2008. As of this
writing, a lively debate rages on whether the next decade will be one of high volatility or a return
to the low levels of volatility of the Great Moderation period.
        These 120 years have also seen large and persistent swings in average growth rates. Growth
was persistently high in the 1920’s and persistently low in the early 1930’s. It shot up to very high
levels for roughly a quarter of a century after the end of WWII before falling substantially and in
a sustained way in the 1970’s and early 1980’s. Growth was high again in the 1990’s, but has been
persistently low over the past decade, particularly after the onset of the Great Recession.
        Many asset pricing models abstract from these phenomena. However, Bansal and Yaron (2004)
show that even a modest amount of persistent variation in growth and volatility—which they refer
to as “long-run risks”—can play a fundamentally important role in explaining key features of asset
prices such as the high equity premium, high volatility of equity returns, and predictability of
equity returns. Bansal and Yaron examine U.S. data. But a basic challenge in providing empirical
evidence for the long-run risks model is that key parameters of the model are hard to estimate
using 80 years of consumption data from a single country.
        This challenge has led authors in the asset pricing literature to focus on calibrations of the
long-run risks model designed to match asset pricing data (Bansal and Yaron, 2004 (BY); Bansal
et al., 2012 (BKY)) and to estimate the model using a combination of macroeconomic and asset
pricing data (Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron, 2007; Constantinides and Ghosh, 2011). A concern with
this approach is that the asset pricing data may be driven by other factors such as habits, rare
disasters, or heterogeneous agents.1 But estimation of long-run risks is typically done in models
without these potential alternative explanations. Hence, the estimation algorithm may be “forced”
    1
    See Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Barro (2006) and Constantinides and Duffie (1996) for influential asset
pricing models based on these features.

to generate large estimates of long-run risks to match the asset price data even if these param-
eters are not justified by the macroeconomic data. In a recent survey, Ludvigson (2013) argues
that the quantitative magnitude of long-run risks in macroeconomic data is smaller than standard
calibrations assume and unlikely to be large enough to explain the predictability of asset returns.2
    In this paper, we quantify the importance of growth-rate and volatility shocks using recently
assembled data on aggregate consumption for a panel of 16 developed countries over a period
of roughly 120 years. By using a dataset that is more than an order of magnitude larger than
is typical in the literature, we are able to estimate key parameters much more accurately. An
important advantage of our approach is that our estimates are based purely on macroeconomic
data. We therefore avoid the concern that our estimates of long-run risks are engineered to fit
the asset pricing data, as opposed to being a fundamental feature of the macroeconomic data.
We estimate a richer model than BY and BKY. Our model allows for world and idiosyncratic
components of growth rate and volatility shocks. It also allows for disasters and for correlation
between the growth rate and volatility shocks.
    We find strong evidence of long-run risks: we estimate substantial, persistent shocks to growth
rates and volatility. Our model captures well-known macroeconomic phenomena such as the Great
Depression, the “long and large” fall in volatility over the post-WWII period (Blanchard and
Simon, 2001), the Great Moderation, the post-WWII economic miracle in Europe (referred to
as the “Wirtschaftswunder” in Germany, the “Trente Glorieuses” in France, and the “Miracolo
Italiano” in Italy), the productivity slowdown in the 1970s, as well as the world recessions of 1979-
82, 1990, and 2007-09. Contrary to common belief, our data show clearly that the post-WWII
economic miracle in Europe cannot be explained simply as reconstruction after WWII since most
of the unusually high growth occurs after the countries in question have surpassed their pre-war,
trend-adjusted level of income (see Figure 1).
    The growth-rate and volatility shocks we estimate are substantially negatively correlated. The
1960’s were both a period of high growth and low volatility, while in the 1970’s growth fell and
volatility rose. More recently, during the recessions of 1979-1982, 1990 and 2007-2009 growth
fell and our estimates of volatility shot up. This negative correlation amplifies the asset pricing
implications of long-run risks since it concentrates bad news in certain periods.
    We find that it is crucial to distinguish between “world” and country-specific shocks to growth
   2
     Ludvigson (2013) calibrates a model based on the estimates of Bidder and Smith (2010) who estimate a simplified
version of the long-run risks model that abstracts from growth-rate shocks. She notes that estimates of a fully-fledged
long-run risks model are needed to fully assess the model.

                                                          2
rates. We estimate a highly persistent process for world growth rates, with a half-life of 13 years.
Allowing for a world growth rate component turns out to be crucial in identifying these persistent
growth rate shocks, since the country-specific growth rate shocks are far less persistent. One might
be concerned that these highly persistent components of growth rates would generate counterfac-
tually high autocorrelations of consumption growth. This is not the case. Our model yields a
near-zero autocorrelation of consumption growth at short-to-medium horizons due to the role of
transitory shocks to the level of consumption, including disasters.
    We analyze the asset pricing implications of our estimated consumption process in a representa-
tive agent model with Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. Our model generates an equity risk premium
in line with the data for a coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA) of 9. One way to interpret
this result is simply as a convenient metric for the amount of risk we estimate. Viewed this way,
our estimates yield somewhat more long-run risks than the standard calibrations of BY and BKY.
    We highlight three main asset pricing results. First, the countries that are subject to more long-
run risks according to our estimates and therefore have higher model-implied equity premia tend to
be those countries that have, in fact, seen higher equity premia in the data over our sample period.
The correlation of the equity premium in the data and the equity premium in our model across our
16 countries is 0.59. Hence, we explain a substantial fraction of the cross-country variation in the
equity premium using variation in exposure to long-run risk.
    Second, our model generates substantially more predictability of excess returns on equity than
standard calibrations of the long-run risks model. This lines up well with the data, in which excess
returns on equity appear to be substantially predictable at long horizons.3 This result addresses
Ludvigson’s (2013) concern, noted above, that a version of the long-run risks model estimated
using macroeconomic data alone would generate even less predictability than the conventional
calibrations. The difference arises both from the negative correlation of growth rate and volatility
shocks in our model, and the greater volatility of the growth rate shocks in our long-run risk process.
    On the other hand, our asset pricing model implies substantially more predictability of con-
sumption growth by price dividend ratios than exists in the data. In a sense, our findings thus
deepen the predictability dilemma for the long-run risks model suggested by Beeler and Campbell
(2012): The long-run risks model helps explain the return predictability we see in the data, but
with a mechanism that implies that consumption growth should be predictable, which we do not
   3
     The long-term predictability of stock returns has been documented by (Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Fama and
French, 1988; Hodrick, 1992; Cochrane, 2008; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010) among others.

see in the data.4
    Third, our model generates large and persistent swings in the price-dividend ratio, substantially
larger than in standard calibrations of the long-run risks model. This arises because of the high
volatility of long-run risk shocks in our model. While BY focused on vanishingly small growth-rate
shocks—too small to ever identify in the macroeconomic data—we estimate substantially larger
growth-rate shocks. These larger growth-rate shocks, in turn, generate substantially more return
volatility. As a consequence, our model is able to fit the volatility of returns endogenously through
the high volatility of long-run risks. In contrast, conventional calibrations require the addition of
volatile exogenous dividend process to fit the volatility of excess returns.
    We provide intuition for our results using the framework of shock-exposure and shock-price
elasticities developed by Borovicka, Hansen, and Scheinkman (2014). These elasticities help us
understand how sensitive dividends and returns at different horizons are to the different shocks
that drive consumption growth in our model. The shock-price elasticities constructed using this
methodology underscore the importance of the world long-run risk shocks in our model. The
persistent world growth rate shocks are associated with much larger shock-price elasticities than
their idiosyncratic counterparts.
    The asset pricing exercise we conduct uses a representative agent model that abstracts from
disasters, heterogeneity, and habits. However, our estimates in no way rule out the importance of
these other phenomena in explaining the behavior of asset prices. Our model matches the equity
premium when the CRRA is set to 9. While this is comparable to the parameters typically used in
the long-run risks model, it is high relative to the values typically estimated in the microeconomics
literature (Barsky et al., 1997; Chetty, 2006; Paravisini et al. 2010) Thus, our estimates leave
ample “room” for additional factors to play a important role in explaining stock prices.
    Our paper is related to a large body of work in macroeconomics that studies long-run properties
of output growth (Nelson and Plosser, 1982; Campbell and Mankiw, 1989; Cochrane, 1988; Cogley,
1990; Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007) and variation in the volatility of output growth (McConnell
and Perez-Quiros, 2000; Stock and Watson, 2002; Bloom, 2009; Ursua, 2010; Bloom et al., 2011;
Fernandez-Villaverde et al., 2011; Basu and Bundick, 2011). Our paper builds heavily on the large
and growing literature on long-run risks as a framework for asset pricing pioneered by Kandel and
Stambaugh (1990) and BY. Important papers in this literature include Bansal and Shaliastovich
   4
     The confidence intervals on the model’s predictions are large, so we cannot formally reject our model given
standard significance levels. But a Bayesian would certainly update in the direction of the model being inconsistent
with the data regarding consumption predictability.

consider a simple representative agent asset pricing framework with known parameter values, taking
the consumption process as given. Several theoretical papers extend on this framework, studying

Kung and Schmid, 2011), the asset pricing implications of parameter learning (e.g., Collin-Dufresne,
Johannes, and Lochstoer, 2012), deviations from the representative agent framework (e.g., Garleanu

for our results on the equity premium based on the shock price and exposure elasticities developed
by Borovicka et al. (2011). Section 8 concludes.


2     Data

We estimate our model using a long-term dataset on annual per-capita consumer expenditures
recently constructed by Robert Barro and Jose Ursua, and described in detail in Barro and Ursua
(2008).5 Our sample includes 16 countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom,
United States.6 Our consumption data is an unbalanced panel with data for each country starting
between 1890 and 1914 and ending in 2009. Figure 1 plots our data series for France. We have
drawn a trend line through the pre-WWII period and extended this line to the present. The figure
strongly suggests that France has experienced very persistent swings in growth over the last 120
   5
     One limitation of the Barro-Ursua data set is that it does not allow us to distinguish between expenditures on
non-durables and services versus durables. Unfortunately, separate data on durable and non-durable consumption
are not available for most of the countries and time periods we study. For the U.S., non-durables and services are
about 70% as volatile as total consumer expenditures over the time period when both series are available. One way of
adjusting our results would therefore be to scale down the volatility of the shocks we estimate by 0.7. Whether this
adjustment is appropriate depends on the extent to which non-durables and services are less volatile at the longer
horizons over which our long-run risks shocks are most important. For example, if durables and non-durables are
cointegrated, the adjustment is likely to be smaller. The adjustment is also likely to be smaller for earlier points in
our sample, when the role of durables in total consumer expenditures was much smaller.
   6
     We exclude countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America from our sample. Including these countries raises our
estimates of the importance of long-run risks. In this sense, our estimates are conservative.

year. In analyzing the asset pricing implications of our model, we also make use of long-term data
on the total nominal returns on stocks and the dividend-price ratio on stocks from Global Financial
Data (GFD) as well as data on the total real returns on stocks and bills and inflation rates from
Barro and Ursua (2008). Table A.1 gives the sample period we have for each variable for each
country.


3        An Empirical Model of Growth-Rate and Uncertainty Shocks

We model the “permanent component” of per capita consumption in country i at time t + 1—
denoted c̃i,t+1 —in the following way:

                             ∆c̃i,t+1 = µi + xi,t + ξi xW,t + ηi,t+1 + ξi ηW,t+1 ,
                               xi,t+1 = ρxi,t + i,t+1 ,                                                         (1)
                             xW,t+1 = ρW xW,t + W,t+1 .

The dynamics of permanent consumption growth are governed by two types of shocks: “random-
walk” shocks that have a one-time effect on permanent consumption growth and “growth-rate”
shocks that have a persistent effect on permanent consumption growth. For each type of shock,
we allow for a country-specific shock and a shock that is common across all countries (a “world”
shock). The four shocks that affect permanent consumption growth are therefore: a country-specific
random-walk shock (ηi,t+1 ), a world random-walk shock (ηW,t+1 ), a country-specific growth-rate
shock (i,t+1 ) and a world growth-rate shock (W,t+1 ). The persistence of the effects of the growth-
rate shocks on permanent consumption growth is governed by AR(1) processes (xi,t+1 and xW,t+1 ).
We allow the different countries in our sample to differ in the their sensitivity to the world processes.
The differing sensitivity is governed by the parameter ξi .
        The volatility of the shocks affecting permanent consumption growth is time-varying and gov-
erned by two AR(1) processes—one that is country-specific and another that is common across all
countries:
                                       2
                                      σi,t+1 = σi2 + γ(σi,t
                                                        2
                                                            − σi2 ) + ωi,t+1 ,                                   (2)

                                    2        2      2      2
                                   σW,t+1 = σW + γ(σW,t − σW ) + ωW,t+1 .                                        (3)

We refer to the innovations to these process—ωi,t+1 and ωW,t+1 —as uncertainty shocks.7
    7
    Here, we follow Bansal and Yaron (2004)’s original specification for the volatility shocks, which is truncated at
                                                           2               2
a small positive value. We could alternatively model log σi,t+1  and log σW,t+1  as following AR(1) processes. We
have experimented with this specification. However, with this specification, the volatility of σ 2 drops to very low

                                                         6
    We assume that when world uncertainty rises this affects the volatility of all shocks to per-
                                                                             2
manent consumption. The country specific component of stochastic volatility σi,t+1 , however,
only affects the country specific shocks. More specifically, for the growth-rate shocks we assume
                       2 , while var (
that vart (W,t+1 ) = σW,t                       2      2                   2
                                    t i,t+1 ) = σi,t + σW,t . Variation in σi,t+1 should, therefore,

be interpreted as deviations in the uncertainty faced by a particular country from that faced by
                                                                  2
countries on average. In line with this interpretation, we allow σi,t+1 to be negative as long as
 2 + σ2
σi,t                                                                                2  2
      W,t is positive. For the random-walk shocks, we assume that vart (ηW,t+1 ) = χW σW,t and

vart (ηi,t+1 ) = χ2i (σi,t
                       2 + σ 2 ), where χ governs the relative volatility of the two country specific
                            W,t          i

shocks, i,t+1 and ηi,t+1 , and χW governs the relative volatility of the two common shocks.
    We allow for correlation between the growth-rate shocks and the uncertainty shocks. This is
meant to capture the possibility that times of high uncertainty may also tend to be times of low
growth. Specifically, we allow the country-specific growth-rate shock i,t+1 and the country-specific
uncertainty shock ωi,t+1 to be correlated with a correlation coefficient of λ. We also allow the
world growth-rate shock W,t+1 and the world uncertainty shocks ωW,t+1 to be correlated with a
correlation coefficient of λW .
    To summarize, we assume the following distributions for the random-walk, growth-rate and
uncertainty shocks:
                                          ηi,t+1 ∼ N(0, χ2i (σi,t
                                                              2      2

levels when σ 2 is small implying that σ 2 can “get stuck” close to zero for a very long time. It is not clear to us
that the data support this feature. Also, our MCMC estimation algorithm runs into trouble in this case since the
likelihood function is very flat when log σ 2 becomes sufficiently negative (σ 2 sufficiently small). In this region very
large movements in log σ 2 correspond to tiny movements in σ 2 . This leads the MCMC algorithm to get stuck.
    8                                                                                                          2
      For world stochastic volatility, this means that when an ωW,t+1 is drawn that would yield a value of σW,t+1    < ζ,

we set σW,t+1 = ζ. This implies that the innovations to the σW,t+1 have a positive mean when σW,t+1 is close to ζ.

For the estimated values of the parameters of our model (baseline estimation), σW,t+1       = ζ about 9.2% of the time.
We incorporate this truncation in our asset pricing analysis in section 6.

       We allow parameters to vary across countries whenever our data contains enough information to
make this feasible. For example, we allow σi2 to differ across countries. This allows some countries
to have permanently higher or lower volatility of macroeconomic shocks than others. However,
some parameters are difficult to estimate precisely for each country individually. In these cases, we
rely on the panel structure of the data set and assume that these parameters are common across
countries. The parameters we make this pooling assumption for are: the persistence of the growth-
rate components ρ and ρW , the persistence of the stochastic volatility processes γ, the volatility of
the uncertainty shocks σω2 and σW,ω
                                2 , the average volatility of the world stochastic volatility process

 2 , the relative standard deviation of the world random-walk and growth-rate shocks χ , and the
σW                                                                                    W

correlations between the growth-rate and uncertainty shocks λ and λW .9
       We allow measured consumption—denoted ci,t —to differ from permanent consumption c̃i,t be-
cause of two transitory shocks:

                                                                   d      d
                                      ci,t+1 = c̃i,t+1 + νi,t+1 + Ii,t+1 ψi,t+1 .                                  (8)

The first of these shocks νi,t+1 is mainly meant to capture measurement error. We assume that
                                2 ), where the volatility of this shock is allowed to differ before and
this shock is distributed N(0, σi,t,ν
after 1945. By incorporating this break in the volatility of νi,t+1 we can capture potential changes
in national accounts measurement around this time (Romer, 1986; Balke and Gordon, 1989). This
is empirically important since it avoids the possibility that our estimates of the high persistence of
macroeconomic uncertainty arise spuriously from these changes in measurement procedures.10

       The second shock Ii,t+1  d
                               ψi,t+1 captures transitory variation in consumption due to disasters.11
                    d is set equal to one in periods identified as disaster periods by Nakamura
The dummy variable Ii,t
et al. (2010)—almost exclusively WWI, the Great Depression, and WWII—and during a two-year
recovery period after each such episode and zero otherwise.12 The disaster shock ψi,t
                                                                                  d is distributed

                                   d at 1 (a large value), to ensure that this shock “soaks up” all
N(µd , 1). We fix the variance of ψi,t
transitory variation in consumption during the disaster periods. Allowing for this separate disaster
shock avoids the concern that we are overestimating long-run risks in the persistent component of
   9
     Notice also, that we assume that the same parameter (γ) governs the persistence of both the common and country-
specific components of stochastic volatility. We do this because there is insufficient information in our dataset to
estimate a separate parameter for the persistence of world volatility.
  10
     We restrict νi,t+1 to be i.i.d. to avoid the identification problem discussed in Quah (1992).
  11
     The permanent effects of disasters are captured by ηi,t+1 , ηW,t+1 , i,t+1 , and W,t+1 .
  12
     Nakamura et al. (2010)’s results indicate that there is unusually high growth after disasters—i.e., recoveries—but
that this unusually high growth dies out rapidly—it has a half-life of 1 year. By allowing for a two year recovery
period after disasters, we allow the disaster shocks in our model to capture the bulk of the unusually high growth
after disasters and avoid having this growth variation inflate our estimates of long-run risks.

consumption due to the huge but transitory spike in volatility during WWI, the Great Depression,
and WWII.
         To summarize, our model extends the long-run risks model of Bansal and Yaron (2004) in four
ways. First, we allow for both a country-specific and world component of all the main shocks in the
model and we allow each country to differ in their sensitivity to the world shocks. Second, we allow
the growth-rate and uncertainty shocks to be correlated. This allows for the possibility that times
of low growth may also tend be times of high uncertainty. Third, we allow for time-variation in
measurement error in consumption. This is crucial since it avoids the outcome that our estimates of
the high persistence of macroeconomic uncertainty arise spuriously from changes in measurement
procedures. Fourth, we allow for disasters—again key for avoiding the overestimation of stochastic
volatility. Finally, we estimate the model using panel data on many countries and use the panel
structure of the data to identify certain key parameters.


4         Estimation

The model presented in section 3 contains a large number of unobserved state variables, since
it decomposes consumption into several unobserved components. We estimate the model using
Bayesian MCMC methods.13 To carry out our Bayesian estimation we need to specify a set of
priors on the parameters of the model. We choose highly dispersed priors to minimize their effect
on our inference:
                        ρ ∼ U(0.005, 0.995),                ρW    ∼ U(0.005, 0.995),
                       σω2 ∼ U(10−12 , 2.5 × 10−9 ), σW,ω
                                                      2   ∼ U(10−12 , 4 × 10−10 ),
                        λ ∼ U(−0.995, 0.995),               λW    ∼ U(−0.995, 0.995),
                      χ2W   ∼ U(10−4 , 25),                  χ2i ∼ U(10−4 , 25),
                        γ ∼ U(0.005, 0.98),                  2
                                                            σν,i ∼ U(10−8 , 10−2 ),
                       ξi ∼ U(10−4 , 1),                     σi2 ∼ U(10−8 , 0.0004),
                       µi ∼ N(0.015, 0.030),                 µd ∼ N(0, 1),
We normalize the unconditional volatility of the world stochastic volatility process to be σW =
0.005. Since we allow the loadings on the world volatility process to vary across countries, σW is
    13
    Our algorithm samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters and unobserved states using a Gibbs
sampler augmented with Metropolis steps when needed. This algorithm is described in greater detail in appendix A.
The estimates discussed in section 5 for the three versions of the model, are each based on four independent Markov
chains. Each of these chains has 5 million draws or more with the first 1 million draws from each chain dropped as
“burn-in”. To assess convergence, we employ Gelman and Rubin’s (1992) approach to monitoring convergence based
on parallel chains with “over-dispersed starting points” (see also Gelman, 2004, ch. 11).

                                                        9
unidentified unless volatility hits its lower bound.14 We assume that the initial values of xi,t , xW,t ,
σi,t and σW,t are drawn from their unconditional distributions. We assume that the initial value
of c̃it for each country is drawn from a highly dispersed normal distribution centered on the initial
observation for ci,t .


5         Empirical Results

Our baseline empirical results are for the full model described in section 3 for the full sample period
1890-2009. We also report results for a shorter post-WWII sample period and for a simplified version
of the model in which we shut down the world growth-rate and volatility components as well as the
correlation between the country-specific growth-rate and volatility shocks. We refer to this latter
model as the “simple model.” Tables 1-3 present parameter estimates for these three cases. For
each parameter, we present the prior and posterior mean and standard deviation. We refer to the
posterior mean of each parameter as our point estimate for that parameter.
         Overall, we find evidence for large amounts of long-run risk. A large fraction of consump-
tion volatility arises from persistent growth-rate shocks (roughly 40%) and these shocks are quite
persistent. These shocks lead to extended periods of high and low growth, despite the moderate
short-term autocorrelation of consumption growth. We also identify large and persistent variation
in volatility over time. Volatility is roughly 5 times higher at the 95th quantile of its distribution
than it is at the 5th quantile. Finally, our model implies that the component of the growth-rate
process that is common across countries is much more persistent than the component of these
shocks that is idiosyncratic to particular countries. This explains why consumption growth is more
correlated across countries at low than high frequencies. These facts have important implications
for asset pricing, as we describe in section 6.


5.1        Examining the Shocks

Perhaps the best way to illustrate the importance of long-run risks in our estimates is to simply
plot our estimates of the growth-rate and volatility processes. Figure 2 plots our estimate of the
world growth-rate process. The most striking feature of our estimates for this process is its high
    14
    In the absence of the lower bound on volatility, this parameter would not be identified. Given the presence of the
lower bound, the parameter is (weakly) identified by the effect of the truncation on the mean of the process. Given
that there is no economic logic for the identification of this parameter, we choose to fix it.




                                                         10
values in the 1950’s, 60’s and early 70’s. This reflects the post-WWII European growth miracle.15
Our estimated world growth-rate process also captures several major recessions such as the 1979-
82 recession following the spike in oil prices that accompanied the Iranian Revolution as well
as the tightening of U.S. monetary policy, the recession of 1990 following, among other events,
the Persian Gulf War, the unification of Germany, and the accompanying tightening of German
monetary policy, and the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Earlier in our sample, our world growth-
rate process captures the relatively high growth in the 1920s and the dismal growth of the Great
Depression and WWII.16
       Figure 3 presents our estimates of the evolution of the world stochastic volatility process (σW,t ).
We estimate a large increase in world volatility during the Great Depression and WWII. World
volatility remained high in the late 1940’s and 1950’s. It then fell to very low levels in the 1960’s,
but was high again in the 1970’s and early 1980’s. World volatility fell sharply in the mid-to-late
1980’s but was relatively high in the early 1990’s. From 1995 to 2007 the world experienced a long
period of relative tranquility. At the end of our sample period, world volatility rose sharply once
again. In studying this figure, it is important to keep in mind that our model attributes much of
the volatility in the first half of our sample to disasters and measurement error.
       Comparing Figures 2 and 3, it is evident that the world growth-rate process and the world
stochastic volatility process are negatively correlated. Our model allows explicitly for a correlation
between shocks to these processes (λW ). Table 1 reports that our estimate of this correlation
is -0.42. We also estimate a common correlation between the country-specific growth-rate and
uncertainty shocks in our data and find this correlation to also be -0.47. Our estimates, thus,
strongly suggest that periods of high volatility are also periods of low growth.
       We estimate a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the evolution of volatility across countries.
Figure 4 presents our estimates of the evolution of the volatility process for the U.S., the U.K. and
         2 + σ 2 )1/2 in our notation.17 For the United States our results reflect the “long
Canada—(σi,t  W,t

and large” decline in macroeconomic volatility documented by Blanchard and Simon (2001) and
  15
     It is intriguing that this growth spurt so closely followed World War II. It is tempting to infer that this high
growth is due to post-war reconstruction. However, for most countries, the vast majority of the unusually high growth
during this period occurred in years when consumption (and output) had surpassed its pre-WWII trend-adjusted
level (see, e.g., Figure 1).
  16
     Recall, though, that the temporary effects of WWII on the level of consumption are “soaked up” by the disaster
shock we allow for. Only the permanent effects of WWII are captured in our estimates of the world growth-rate
process.

     Recall that σi,t  can be negative (as long as σi,t + σW,t is positive) and should be interpreted as the difference
between country-specific volatility and world volatility.

well as the rather abrupt decline in volatility in the mid-1980’s documented by McConnell and
Perez-Quiros (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002). The experience of the U.K. is quite different.
Volatility in the U.K. was lower in the early part of the 20th century (excluding disasters), but then
rose substantially over the first three decades after WWII. Volatility in the U.K. began falling only
around the time Margaret Thatcher came to power and has remained elevated relative to volatility
in the U.S. ever since 1960. In contrast, volatility in Canada fell much more abruptly in the 1950’s
and early 1960’s than volatility in the U.S. and was substantially below U.S. volatility in the 1960’s,
1970’s and early 80’s at which point U.S. volatility converged down to similarly low levels.
       We estimate a substantial decline in the volatility of transitory shocks σν,i after 1945 in most
countries. Before 1945, the standard deviation of these transitory shocks is quite large—2.3% for
the median country. After 1945, it is only 0.4% for the median country. This change likely reflects
in part changes in national accounts measurement, as we discuss in section 3.18


5.2      Comparison with BY and BKY

In both the original calibration of the long-run risks model in BY and the more recent calibration
of BKY, long-run risks are relatively small; so small that they are hard to detect in macroeconomic
data. In contrast, the long-run risks we estimate are relatively large. Table 2 reports that roughly
40% of the volatility of consumption growth derives from the long-run risk shocks in our estimated
model, while in the calibrations of BY and BKY, this ratio is only 20-25%. The long-run risks we
estimate are therefore roughly twice the size of those considered by BY and BKY.
       The amount of stochastic volatility we estimate is also much larger than that considered by BY,
but comparable to the amount of stochastic volatility in BKY. To illustrate this, Table 2 reports
the counter-factual volatility of consumption growth in the United States if the stochastic volatility
processes were permanently “stuck” at the 5th, 50th, and 95th quantiles of their distributions.19
We find that the volatility of consumption growth is more than 5 times higher at the 95th quantile
than it is at the 5th quantile (0.038 versus 0.007). In the calibration of BY, this ratio is only 1.48
(0.034 versus 0.023), while it is 5 in the calibration of BKY (0.045 versus 0.009).
  18
     Ursua (2010) argues—based on methods developed by Romer (1986)—that this change also reflects changes in
macroeconomic fundamentals. Since transitory shocks turn out to be relatively unimportant for asset pricing, the
choice of whether to treat this change as a consequence of measurement or fundamental shocks plays a small role in
our asset pricing analysis.
  19
     The comparison with BY and BKY is complicated since their model is formulated at a monthly frequency, while
we estimate our model at an annual frequency. This complication is what leads us to use the statistics described here
rather than compare the parameter estimates directly.



                                                         12
       Table 2 also reports the persistence of the growth-rate and uncertainty processes we estimate
in terms of half-lives. The half-lives of the world and country-specific growth-rate processes that
we estimate are 8.5 years and 1.2 years, respectively. These estimates straddle the persistence
of the growth-rate processes considered in BY and BKY (half-lives of 2.7 years and 2.3 years,
respectively). Interestingly, the results we report for our “simple model” show that it is crucial
to allow for a world component in order to be able to capture the highly persistent movements
in growth rates in the data. In the simple model, the half-life of the growth-rate shocks is only
1.9 years and an analysis of the residuals from this model confirms that it is not able to capture
well the low frequency movements in growth-rates. The persistence of the uncertainty process we
estimate (half-life of 22 years) is much higher than the persistence of the uncertainty process in
BY’s original calibration. But it is not as high as the very high persistence considered in BKY
(half-life of 57.7 years).


5.3      Autocorrelations, Cross-Country Correlations, and Variance Ratios

A challenge in matching the empirical properties of aggregate consumption data is that, on the one
hand, variance ratios—which provide evidence on the long-run autocorrelation of consumption—
suggest substantial persistence in consumption growth rate. However, on the other hand, if one
simply looks at autocorrelations at short and medium horizons, the autocorrelations are close to
zero, suggesting low persistence.
       Table 4 illustrates these effects. The first panel reports estimates of autocorrelations in the
estimated model (excluding disasters).20 In the data, the autocorrelation of consumption growth
is positive but small at short to medium-term horizons for the median country. For the US, the
autocorrelation oscillates around zero at different horizons. At the same time, Table 4 shows that,
in the data, the variance ratio for consumption growth for the median country is 1.53, substantially
above one. For the U.S. the corresponding figure is 1.29. Variance ratios above one indicate reduced
form evidence for positive autocorrelation of consumption growth.21
  20
      In the data, we exclude disasters by subtracting from the raw data our estimate of the transitory disaster shock.
This yields series for consumption that smoothly “interpolate” through disasters. For the simulated data from our
model, we simulate the model without the transitory disaster shock.
   21
      The definition and intuition behind variance ratios is discussed in more detail in appendix B. The high value
of the variance ratio for the U.S. contrasts with the well known results of (Cochrane, 1988), who estimates a much
smaller variance ratio for U.S. output. Several factors contribute to the difference. First, the variance ratio for
consumption is somewhat higher than for output. Second, we are looking at a somewhat longer sample period than
Cochrane and the variance ratios are somewhat higher for this longer sample period. Third (and most important),
the variance ratio excluding disasters is substantially larger than that including disasters since disasters are typically
followed by recoveries and therefore lower the variance ratio (Kilian and Ohanian, 2002; Nakamura et al., 2012).

                                                           13
    Our model is able to fit both types of evidence on the persistence of consumption growth. On
the one hand, the model generates modest short and medium-term autocorrelations in the growth
rate of consumption. This is because the positive autocorrelation arising from the growth-rate
process is mostly off-set by the negative auto-correlation generated by the transitory shocks to the
level of consumption. On the other hand, the long-run risks shocks to growth generate variance
ratios substantially above one: 1.33 for the median country and 1.39 for the U.S.
    We also compute an analogous variance ratio measure for assessing the persistence of shocks
to volatility, introduced by Bansal and Yaron (2004). This statistic provides a rough measure
of the persistence of stochastic volatility. As with the variance ratio for consumption growth, if
this variance ratio is above one, it indicates that uncertainty shocks have persistent effects on
volatility—i.e., high volatility periods are “bunched together” (the exact definition is presented in
appendix B). In the data, the variance ratios for realized volatility are again substantially above
one (2.10 for the median country and 1.80 for the U.S.). This is hardly surprising given the long
swings in volatility associated with phenomena such as the Great Moderation that the model is
intended to fit. Again, the model fits this feature of the data quite well. It yields a value of 1.93
for the median country and 2.12 for the U.S.
    The last panel of Table 4 presents cross-correlations across consumption growth in different
countries, at different horizons. The correlation of consumption growth across countries is estimated
to be substantial and to grow with the horizon, a point emphasized by Cogley (1990). The median
one-year cross-country correlation in the data is 0.21, while it is 0.43 at the five-year horizon and
0.55 at the ten-year horizon. Our model provides an excellent fit to the data along this dimension.
In the model, the one-year cross-country correlation is 0.15, while it is 0.36 and 0.45 at five- and
ten-year horizons, respectively, for the median country. These long-run correlations help explain
observed cross-country comovement in asset returns (e.g., Colacito and Croce, 2011; Verdelhan,
2012).


6     Asset Pricing

We analyze the asset pricing implications of the model of aggregate consumption described in
section 3 within the context of a representative consumer endowment economy with Epstein-Zin-
Ursua (2010) presents a related analysis. Rather than filtering the data the way we do, he excludes “outlier” growth
observations. This simpler procedure also yields substantially larger variance ratios than raw consumption growth in
his broader sample.


                                                        14
Weil preferences (Epstein and Zin, 1989; Weil, 1990). For this preference specification, Epstein and
Zin (1989) show that the return on an arbitrary cash flow is given by the solution to the following
equation:                           "                                           #
                                                      (−θ/ψ)
                                              Ci,t+1              −(1−θ)
                                 Et β θ                          Rc,t,t+1 Ri,t,t+1 = 1,                             (9)
                                               Ci,t
where Ri,t,t+1 denotes the gross return on an arbitrary asset in country i from period t to period t+1,
Rc,t,t+1 denotes the gross return on the agent’s wealth, which in our model equals the endowment
stream. The parameter β represents the subjective discount factor of the representative consumer.
                           1−γ
The parameter θ =         1−1/ψ ,   where γ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA) and ψ
is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES), which governs the agent’s desire to smooth
consumption over time.
    We begin by calculating asset prices for two assets: a risk-free one-period bond and a risky asset
we will use to represent equity. The risk-free one-period bond has a certain pay-off of one unit of
consumption in the next period. We follow BKY in modeling equity as having a levered exposure
to the stochastic component of permanent consumption. Specifically, the growth rate of dividends
for our equity claim is
                                     ∆dt+1 = µ + φ(xi,t + ξi xW,t + ηi,t+1 ),                                      (10)

where φ is the leverage ratio on expected consumption growth (Abel, 1999). We base our analysis
on the posterior mean estimates for the baseline case from section 5. We therefore abstract from
learning, doubt, and fragile beliefs (Timmermann, 1993; Pastor and Veronesi, 2009; Hansen, 2007;
Hansen and Sargent, 2010; Croce, Lettau, and Ludvigson, 2010). We do not, however, mean to
downplay the importance of these factors. Indeed, the importance of long-run risks are likely
to raise the extent of parameter uncertainty, given how hard it is to estimate the long-run risk
parameters. Weitzman (2007) shows that parameter uncertainty can massively increase the equity
premium.
    The asset-pricing implications of our model with Epstein-Zin-Weil (EZW) preferences cannot
be derived analytically. We solve for asset prices in our model using standard grid-based numerical
methods of the type used, e.g., by Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and Wachter (2005).22 We choose
  22
     We solve the integral in equation (9) on a grid. Specifically, we start by solving for the price-dividend ratio for
a consumption claim. In this case we can rewrite equation (9) as P DRtC = Et [f (∆Ct+1 , P DRt+1    C
                                                                                                        )], where P DRtC
                                                                                            C
denotes the price dividend ratio of the consumption claim. We specify a grid for P DRt over the state space. We
then solve numerically for a fixed point for P DRtC as a function of the state of the economy on the grid. We can then
                                                                               C
rewrite equation (9) for other assets as P DRt = Et [f (∆Ct+1 , ∆Dt+1 , P DRt+1   , P DRt+1 )], where P DRt denotes the
price dividend ratio of the asset in question and ∆Dt+1 denotes the growth rate of its dividend. Given that we have
already solved for P DRtC , we can solve numerically for a fixed point for P DRt for any other asset as a function of

                                                            15
a subjective discount factor of β = 0.99 to fit the observed average risk-free rate in our baseline
specification. We follow BY in choosing an IES of ψ = 1.5, and a leverage parameter of φ = 3. We
choose a CRRA of γ = 9 to match the equity premium in U.S. data.
    Qualitatively, leverage and risk aversion play the same role in raising the risk premium but
they enter somewhat differently in the return formulas. In our setting with stochastic volatility,
leverage has a non-linear effect on the equity premium because it not only makes the shocks hitting
dividends proportionally larger, but also it makes shocks to stochastic volatility effectively larger.23
    To evaluate the asset pricing implications of long-run risks, we calculate asset prices as though
all risk was associated with risk in “permanent consumption.” This measure excludes the transitory
(measurement error) shock and the transitory variation in consumption during disasters—primarily
WWI, WWII and the Great Depression.
    The asset pricing implications of disaster risk have been the focus of a large recent literature (see,
e.g., Barro, 2006). Indeed, two of the authors of the present paper (Nakamura and Steinsson) have
quantified the asset pricing implications of disaster risk using similar methods to those employed in
this paper (Nakamura, et al., 2010). However, what we seek to show here is that one does not have
to believe in the importance of disaster risk to believe long-run risks have important asset pricing
implications. Even if one believes that events such as WWI, WWII and the Great Depression
will not occur in the future, one still has to contend with the existence of smaller but much more
persistent changes in growth rates and volatility—the focus of our paper. Hence, we believe that
the asset pricing implications of long-run risks are worthy of analysis in isolation.24 Note that if we
do not account separately for disaster risk and instead allow these events to influence our estimates
of long-run risks, then our estimates of the importance of long-run risks, and particularly stochastic
volatility become even larger—in this sense, our baseline estimates are conservative. Also, for the
post-WWII sample the handling of disaster risk is a unimportant since essentially no disasters have
occurred after WWII according to our definition in the sample of countries we analyze.25
the state of the economy on the grid.
  23
     BY model leverage by considering a scaled up dividend claim, in line with Abel (1999), who shows that this
formulation works well in replicating the asset pricing implications of true leverage in a number of settings but does
not analyze a model with stochastic volatility. This would be a useful topic for future research.
  24
     In addition, while it would certainly be interesting to explore the implications of interactions between disasters
and long-run risks, this would entail considerable costs in terms of computational complexity.
  25
     When we analyze the predictability of returns and consumption growth in section 6.2 we simulate consumption
growth adding back in our estimated process for “measurement error.”




                                                          16
6.1      The Equity Premium

Table 5 presents key asset pricing statistics in the data and for our baseline specification of the
model. The table presents results for the U.S. and for the median country in our sample. Our
model matches the observed equity premium for the United States with a CRRA of 9, a slightly
lower value than is used in BY and BKY. This value is roughly an order of magnitude lower
than the value needed in a model without long-run risks (Mehra and Prescott, 1985; Tallarini,
2000). Long-run risks make the world a riskier place, and households must be compensated to
hold equity which is exposed to these risks. Recall that our estimates of long-run risks are based
solely on macroeconomic data. The amount of long-run risk we estimate is therefore not backward
engineered to match the equity premium for a modest value of the CRRA. In light of this, our
finding that the quantity of long-run risks is somewhat larger than in BY and BKY is of particular
interest.26
       Table 6 presents results on the equity premium and the risk free rate from our baseline model
for all 16 countries in our sample. Interestingly, the model-generated equity premium varies sub-
stantially across countries—ranging from 4.7% to 12.5% with an average of 7.7%. This variation
arises because we allow for a rich array of heterogeneity across countries (e.g., different sensitivity
to the world growth-rate component, different average volatility of the country-level growth-rate
component, different average volatility of the random-walk shocks, etc.).
       Figure 5 plots the equity premium in the model versus the equity premium in the data across
the 16 countries in our sample. Despite the small number of countries, and many simplifying
assumption in our model, there is a clear positive correlation of 0.59 between the model-generated
equity premium and the equity premium observed in the data. Countries with higher loadings on
the world long-run risks factors as well as larger random-walk shocks have higher equity premia in
the data.
       Table 6 also presents results on the equity premium for a case where we “turn off” the uncer-
tainty shocks in the model. This “constant volatility” model yields equity premia that are roughly
half as large as the full model, implying that roughly half of the equity premium in our model
results from the growth-rate shocks and the other half from the uncertainty shocks. Finally, Table
6 present results on the equity premium for a third case where we eliminate all long-run risks and
  26
    Table A.3 in the appendix presents analogous results to Table 5 for our two alternative specifications: the simple
model and the post-WWII estimation of the baseline model. Results for both cases are quite similar to the baseline
case.



                                                         17
re-calibrate the volatility of the random-walk shocks to match the volatility of ∆c̃i,t . This case
corresponds closely to the model considered by Mehra and Prescott (1985). It generates equity
premia of only around 1%.
    As we discuss above, we allow for a correlation between the growth-rate and uncertainty shocks
in our model. This correlation is estimated to be substantially negative (Table 1). The negative
correlation contributes to raising the equity premium in our model. Since negative growth-rate
shocks and shocks that increase uncertainty both raise marginal utility, being hit by both at the
same time is particularly painful for the representative agent. We have re-calculated asset prices for
a case with λ = λW = 0 but keeping other parameters unchanged. This yields an equity premium
that is about 1.4 percentage points smaller for the U.S. than our baseline case.


6.2    Return Predictability

Our model generates substantial predictability in equity returns as a function of the price divi-
dend ratio. This lines up well with a large literature in finance documenting long-horizon return
predictability of equity returns in the data (Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Fama and French, 1988;
Hodrick, 1992; Cochrane, 2008; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010).27 The source of the return pre-
dictability in the long-run risks model is uncertainty shocks. A positive uncertainty shock leads to
a stock market decline with no corresponding effect on expected dividends—implying that expected
returns will be high going forward.
    To evaluate the fit of the model to the data along this dimension, we estimate equations of the
following form
                                          yi,t+5 = αi + βi pdi,t + i,t+5 ,                                       (11)

where pdi,t denotes the logarithm of the price-dividend ratio on equity and yi,t+5 is one of three
things: the five-year excess return on stocks, the five-year realized volatility of consumption growth,
or the five-year growth rate of consumption.28 We run these regressions in the data and on simulated
datasets of the same length (120 years) from our model. We report the median from 1000 such
simulations, as well as the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles.
  27
     The statistical significance of return predictability has been hotly debated (see, e.g., Stambaugh, 1999; Ang and
Bekaert, 2007). Recent work by Lewellen (2004) and Cochrane (2008) has exploited the stationarity of price-dividend
ratios and the lack of predictability of dividend growth to develop more powerful tests of return predictability. These
tests reject the null of no predictability of returns at the 1-2% level.
  28
     We use the absolute value of the residual from an AR(1) regression for consumption growth, summed over 5-year
intervals, as our measure of realized volatility, following Bansal et al. (2005).



                                                          18
   The first panel of Table 7 presents results on the predictability of excess returns. Our point
estimates imply a large degree of predictability of returns in the U.S. data. The regression coefficient
on the price-dividend ratio is -0.41 and the R-squared of the regression is 0.24. However, the U.S.
is a bit of an outlier in terms of the strength of this predictability. For the median country, the
regression coefficient is -0.30 and the R-squared is 0.11 in the data. Our baseline model generates
a median regression coefficient for the U.S. of -0.38 and R-squared of 0.10 and similar results for
the median country. The values for the data lie comfortably within the 95% probability intervals
generated by the model.
   In a recent survey, Ludvigson (2013) conjectures that a reasonably calibrated long-run risks
model cannot fit the evidence of return predictability in the data. She notes that conventional
calibrations of the long-run risks model explain a substantially lower fraction of variation in expected
returns (R-squared less than 0.05) and that an estimated version of the model generates even less.
Her analysis is based on estimates of a simplified version of the long-run risks model by Bidder
and Smith (2010) in which the R-squared of the return predictability regression for the estimated
version of the long-run risks model is essentially zero. Our model shows that, in fact, a fully
estimated version of the long-run risks model generates more rather than less return predictability
than in the calibrations of BY and BKY.
   On the other hand, our model implies too much predictability of consumption growth. Given
the degree of predictability we find in growth rates, our asset pricing model suggests the price
dividend ratio should predict future consumption growth: the median R-squared implied by the
model is 0.26, and the coefficient on the price-dividend ratio is 0.19. The confidence intervals on
the model’s predictions are large, so we cannot formally reject our model. But the R-squared and
coefficient on the price-dividend ratio from the data are clearly at the bottom of the confidence
interval from the model (0.03 and 0.04 respectively in the median country).
   The key feature of our model in generating return predictability is stochastic volatility. Two
features of our stochastic volatility process contribute to greater return predictability than in BY
and BKY. First, the correlation between growth rate and uncertainty shocks implies that even when
a high price-dividend ratio arises from a positive growth rate shock, it portends higher expected
returns, since uncertainty is also likely to be low. Second, the large amount of stochastic volatility
in our model arises through a somewhat different mechanism than BKY. While the persistence
of our uncertainty shocks process is lower, the uncertainty shocks themselves pertain to a much
more volatile long-run risk process. This generates more variation in uncertainty at a medium-term

                                                  19
horizon, and more predictability of returns.
      The price-dividend ratio on stocks also has substantial predictive power for realized volatility of
consumption growth in both the data and model. For U.S. data, the regression coefficient is -0.81
and the R-squared is 0.32.29 For the median country, the regression coefficient is -0.38 and the
R-squared is 0.19. Our model helps explain this pattern in the data. Our baseline model generates
a median regression coefficient of -0.52 and an R-squared of 0.09 for the U.S. and similar results
for the median country. Again, the values in the data are well within the 95% probability intervals
generated by the model.
      A related way to test this prediction is to study the comovement of the time series of realized
volatility and the price-dividend ratio. The relationship above suggests that the two should move
in opposite directions, or equivalently that realized volatility should comove with the dividend-
price ratio (inverse of the price-dividend ratio). Figure 6 plots our estimate of the evolution of
realized volatility in the U.S. along with the dividend-price ratio on stocks. There is a substantial
comovement between economic uncertainty and the value of the stock market, as emphasized by
Lettau et al. (2008). Figure A.1 in the web appendix presents analogous plots for all countries in
our sample, extending the results of Lettau et al. (2004), and illustrating that the comovement
appears to hold in many countries after 1970.
      A recent critique of the long-run risks model by Beeler and Campbell (2012) is that it generates
too much predictability of consumption growth. The third panel of Table 7 presents statistics
on the performance of the model along this dimension. The empirical results on consumption
predictability do lie within the confidence interval generated by our model. However, the empirical
value is clearly at the lower end of the interval, in line with Beeler and Campbell’s results.


6.3      Volatility of the Price-Dividend Ratio

An additional interesting feature of our empirical results is that the estimated model generates large
and persistent swings in the price-dividend ratio. The volatility of the price-dividend ratio is 0.26,
about a third higher than in BK and BKY. This difference arises because of the high volatility of
long-run risk shocks in our model. While BY focused on vanishingly small growth-rate shocks—too
small to ever identify in the macroeconomic data—we estimate substantially larger growth-rate
shocks.
      This same feature of the empirical estimates also endogenously generates a high volatility of
 29
      These results extend and reinforce earlier results by Bansal et al. (2005).

                                                           20
equity returns. Our model generates a standard deviation of equity returns for the US of 13%. A
key point to emphasize about this result is that the high volatility of returns arises even without
adding an extra shock to the dividend process, as in conventional calibrations of the long-run risks
model.


6.4    Bonds and Exchanges Rates

The model also yields interesting implications regarding the term structure of bonds and regarding
the volatility of exchange rates. To analyze the term structure, we approximate long-term bonds
by a perpetuity with coupon payments that decline over time by 10% per year. This yields a bond
with a duration similar to that of 10-year coupon bonds. In our model, the term-premium for this
real long-term bond is -2.4%. Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) document that the real yield curve in
the United Kingdom has been downward sloping, while it has been mostly upward sloping in the
United States. They caution, however, that this evidence is hard to assess because of the short
sample and poor liquidity in the U.S. TIPS market.30
     In a world with complete markets, the log change in the real exchange rate between two countries
is
                                                 ∆et = m∗t − mt ,                                                 (12)

where et denotes the log real exchange rate (home goods price of foreign goods), and mt and mft
are the logarithm of the home and foreign stochastic discount factors, respectively. Hansen and
Jagannathan (1991) show that σ(Mt )Rtf ≥ E(Rte )/σ(Rte ), where Mt is the level of the stochastic
discount factor and Re is the excess return on the stock market. From Table 5 we can see that
Rf ' 1.01, E(Rte ) ' 7%, and σ(Rte ) ' 18%, which implies σ(Mt ) ≥ 40%. However, the annual
standard deviation of changes in real exchange rates has been roughly 10% in the post-Bretton
Woods period (see Table 8). Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) point out that this logic
combined with equation (12) implies that mt and m∗t must be highly correlated—which is puzzling
in standard models in which mt is proportional to consumption growth (which is not very correlated
across countries).
     Colacito and Croce (2011) point out that this puzzle, which they refer to as the “international
equity premium puzzle,” can be resolved in a long-run risks model where the long-run risk factors are
  30
     Building on Alvarez and Jermann’s (2005) analysis of the implication of the term structure for the properties of
the stochastic discount factor, Koijen et al. (2010) emphasize that the positive autocorrelation of growth rates in the
long-run risk model implies that the model has a downward sloping term structure of real bond yields.


                                                          21
highly correlated across countries, even if transitory shocks are not. They consider the case where
the long-run risk factors are perfectly correlated across countries, and show that this calibration
generates realistic predictions for exchange rate volatility and the comovement of asset returns
across countries.31
    Our estimates of the world growth-rate and uncertainty processes speak directly to the strength
of the low frequency correlation Colacito and Croce emphasize. The larger these world long-run
risks are, the more correlated will be the stochastic discount factors in different countries (and
therefore the less volatile will their real exchange rate be). Table 8 presents the standard deviation
implied by our estimated model of annual changes in the bilateral real exchange rate versus the
United State for each country in our sample. The table also presents a counter-factual for this
statistic based on the same simulated data from our estimated model but ignoring the correlation
between the stochastic discount factors of each country and the United States that is implied by
our model—i.e., simply adding the variances of the two stochastic discount factors and taking a
square root. We see that the presence of common long-run risk shocks in our model lowers the
volatility of the real exchange rate by roughly a factor of two relative to what it would be if the
stochastic discount factors were uncorrelated. Our model can therefore account for a large part of
the discrepancy between the observed volatility of the real exchange rate and the volatility implied
by a model in which marginal utility across countries is uncorrelated. Nevertheless, our estimates
of the cross-country correlation in long-run risks suggest that long-run risks cannot fully resolve
the international equity premium puzzle.32


7     Intuition

In this section, we provide intuition for the asset pricing results in our paper using the elegant
decomposition developed by Borovicka, Hansen, and Scheinkman (2014, henceforth BHS). But let
us begin by reviewing some basic asset pricing implications of our model for both stocks and bonds.
    A positive growth-rate shock yields a large positive return on equity on impact (Figure 7).
  31
     See also Lustig, Stathopoulus, and Verdelhan (2016) who argue based on long-term bond data that the permanent
component of nominal stochastic discount facturs across countries are highly correlated.
  32
     These results are relevant for our analysis of country-specific asset prices at the start of this section, in which
we price assets using the stochastic discount factor of the domestic investor. If there were perfect risk-sharing, one
could price the assets using foreign investors stochastic discount factors. However, as we discuss above, the complete
markets view is at odds with the data, even accounting for an important common component of long-run risks. In
view of this discrepancy, it makes sense to price the stock market using the local investor given the large amount of
home bias in the data for both assets and goods.


                                                          22
This positive return reflects the balance of two opposing forces. On the one hand, the shock raises
expected future dividends on equity, which pushes up stock prices. On the other hand, since
consumption growth is expected to be high for some time, agents’ desire to save falls, which pushes
down all asset prices. If agents are sufficiently willing to substitute consumption over time (i.e.,
the IES is sufficiently high), the first of these effects is stronger than the second for equity and the
price of equity rises on impact. In the periods after the shock, returns on equity and the risk-free
rate are higher than average because of agents’ reduced desire to save.
   A positive uncertainty shock yields a large negative return on equity on impact (Figure 8). As
with the growth-rate shock, there are two opposing forces that together determine the response of
stock prices. The increase in economic uncertainty makes stocks riskier, which raises the equity
premium. This tends to depress the value of stock. However, the increase in uncertainty also
increases the desire of agents to save. This tends to raise the price of all assets. For sufficiently
high risk aversion and willingness to substitute consumption over time, the first force is stronger
than the second and the price of stocks falls on impact when uncertainty rises (Campbell, 1993).
In the periods after the shock, the equity premium remains elevated because uncertainty has risen.


7.1   Shock Elasticities

An equity claim can be thought of as a portfolio of claims to the dividends that the equity claim will
yield at each horizon (a portfolio of “equity strips”), it is also useful to understand how sensitive the
dividends, prices, and returns on each of these equity strips are to the different shocks that drive
consumption growth in our model. BHS introduce the concepts of shock-exposure, shock-cost, and
shock-price elasticities for this purpose. To illustrate these concepts, let’s consider shock elasticities
for the world growth-rate shock W,t+1 (elasticities for other shocks are defined analogously).
   The shock-exposure elasticity at horizon k then measures the elasticity of the level of expected
dividends at time t + k with respect to exposure to the world growth rate shock in period t + 1:
                                                        
                      d                      W,t+1 1 2               1 Et [Dt+k W,t+1 ]
        SEEt,t+k ≡      log Et exp dt+k + r         − r           =                       .
                     dr                       σW,t     2      r=0   σW,t    Et Dt+k

where Dt+k = exp(dt+k ) is the level of dividends at time t + k.
   The shock-cost elasticity at horizon k measures the elasticity of the level of the period t price of
the time t + k equity strip with respect to exposure to the world growth rate shock. The expression
for the shock-cost elasticity is analogous to that for the shock-exposure elasticity except that dt+k is
replaced by mt,t+k +dt+k , where mt,t+k denotes the logarithm of the stochastic discount factor from
                                                   23
period t to period t + k. Finally, the shock-price elasticity is difference between the two elasticities
defined above. Intuitively, this is the elasticity of the expected k period return (between period t
and t + k) on the time t + k equity strip with respect to exposure to the world growth rate shock.
In appendix C we present expressions for the shock-cost and shock-price elasticity, as well as an
alternative derivation that is useful for intuition.
    Figure 9 plots the shock-exposure and shock-price elasticities (i.e., the elasticity of dividends
and returns, respectively) with respect to the four long-run risk shocks in our model: the growth
rate shocks, i,t+1 and W,t+1 , and the volatility shocks, ωi,t+1 , and ωW,t+1 , evaluated at the model’s
steady state. The shock-exposure elasticities are plotted on the left and the shock-price elasticities
are plotted on the right.
    Let’s begin by discussing the shock-exposure elasticities. All four shock-exposure elasticities
start at zero. This is because the t + 1 shocks have no effect on time t + 1 dividends. The
shock-exposure elasticities for the two growth-rate shocks then grow over time as the effect of the
shock on the level of dividends grows. The shock-exposure elasticity plateaus much earlier for the
idiosyncratic than the world growth rate shock, because of the greater persistence of the world
growth-rate shock.
    These increasing shock-exposure elasticities are ultimately the source of the upward sloping
term structure of real yields implied by the long-run risks model. Koijen et al. (2010) emphasize
that this feature of the model appears inconsistent with empirical evidence on dividend strip prices,
which suggest a downward sloping real term structure. The inclusion of disaster risk in the asset
pricing exercise is likely to improve the fit of the model to the asset pricing data in this regard,
since rare disasters are partially mean reverting and therefore can generate a downward-sloping
real term premium, as emphasized by Nakamura, et al. (2010).
    In contrast to the standard long-run risks model, the shock-exposure elasticities for uncertainty
fall over time (in response to a positive shock). The difference versus the standard model (which
implies an increasing profile) arises from the correlation between growth rate and uncertainty shocks
in our model: positive uncertainty shocks tend to occur in conjunction with negative growth rate
shocks, leading to a negative shock-exposure elasticity.33
    Turning to the shock-price elasticities (the elasticity of returns) plotted on the right-hand side
of Figure 9, we see that both growth-rate shocks have a positive shock price elasticity starting in
  33
     The shock-exposure elasticity to an uncertainty shock is positive in the standard model because the uncertainty
shocks in the long-run risk model are shocks to uncertainty regarding log dividends, which has a level effect on
dividends themselves.

                                                        24
period 1; and uncertainty shocks have a negative shock-price elasticity starting in period 1. In both
cases, the shock-price elasticities are essentially constant as the horizon increases. This arises even
though the shock-exposure elasticities are steeply sloped and zero in period 1. The flat shock-price
elasticities arise from the nature of Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences, as discussed in BHS. Intuitively,
this is a consequence of the effect of future expectations on the current stochastic discount factor.
    We can use the relative magnitude of the shock-price elasticities for the different long-run risk
shocks to infer their relative importance for asset pricing. The most important shocks from the
perspective of the shock-price elasticities are the world growth-rate and world uncertainty shocks.
The world growth-rate shock has a shock-price elasticity roughly twice as large as the idiosyncratic
growth-rate shock. The world uncertainty shock has a shock-price elasticity roughly four times as
large as the idiosyncratic uncertainty shock. This difference arises because of the much greater
persistence of the world growth-rate shocks relative to the idiosyncratic growth rate shocks. The
world uncertainly shocks determine the volatility of these highly persistent world growth rate shocks;
and therefore also have a large effect on asset pricing.


8    Conclusion

Our paper represents the first estimation of the long-run risks model based on macroeconomic data
alone. We find evidence for both persistent growth rate and volatility shocks—the key features of
the model. We show that it is crucial to distinguish between world and country-specific shocks,
since world shocks are far more persistent than their idiosyncratic counterparts. In addition, we
estimate a robust negative correlation between volatility and growth rate shocks, and a much larger
volatility of long run risks shocks than conventional calibrations.
    We next investigate the asset pricing implications of the model. An advantage of our estimation
approach based on macroeconomic data alone is that the parameter estimates cannot be viewed as
“backward engineered” to fit the asset pricing data. We emphasize three main results. First, our
model explains a substantial fraction of cross-country variation in the equity premium. Second, our
model generates more predictability of excess returns than conventional calibrations (in line with
the data) but also more consumption growth predictability (not in line with the data).Third, our
model endogenously generates a large volatility of the price-dividend ratios.
    There are numerous ways in which our analysis could be extended. First, we do not consider the
implications of parameter uncertainty. Given the difficulty of accurately estimating the long-run

                                                  25
risks parameters, there is no doubt that parameter uncertainty is large, and likely to substantially
increase the risk perceived by agents in the economy (see, e.g., Weitzman, 2007). Second, our
analysis assesses the asset pricing importance of long-run risks, as opposed to the combination of
long-run risks and disasters. Adding disaster risk would increase the amount of risk, and would likely
help fit other features of the asset pricing data that the long-run risk misses, such as the downward-
sloping profile of real yields (Nakamura, et al., 2010). Though computationally challenging, we view
these as important topics for future research. Finally, for simplicity, our model assumes permanently
different average growth rates for different countries. An interesting extension would be to allow
for convergence towards the frontier country or conditional convergence dynamics.

A     Model Estimation

We employ a Bayesian MCMC algorithm to estimate our model. More specifically, we employ
a Metropolized Gibbs sampling algorithm to sample from the joint posterior distribution of the
unknown parameters and variables conditional on the data. The full probability model we employ
may be denoted by
                                        f (Y, X, Θ) = f (Y, X|Θ)f (Θ),

                   d
where Y = {ci,t , Ii,t+1 } is the set of observable variables for which we have data,

                                                                 2        2
                                     X = {c̃i,t , xi,t , xW,t , σi,t+1 , σW,t+1 }

is the set of unobservable variables, and

                                       2
                      Θ = {ρ, ρW , γ, σW , σω2 , σW,ω

                                                                                 2
                                                                                     , µi , µd , }

is the set of parameters. From a Bayesian perspective, there is no real importance to the distinction
between X and Θ. The only important distinction is between variables that are observed and those
that are not. The function f (Y, X|Θ) is often referred to as the likelihood function of the model,
while f (Θ) is often referred to as the prior distribution. Both f (Y, X|Θ) and f (Θ) are fully specified
in sections 3 and 4 of the paper. The likelihood function may be constructed by combining equations
(1)-(3) and (8), the distributional assumptions for the shocks in these equations detailed in section
3 and the assumptions about the distributions of c̃, xi,t , xW,t , σi,t , and σW,t for the initial period
for each country that are detailed in section 4. The prior distributions are described in detail in
section 4.
    The object of interest in our study is the distribution f (X, Θ|Y ), i.e., the joint distribution of
the unobservables conditional on the observed values of the observables. For expositional simplicity,
let Φ = (X, Θ). Using this notation, the object of interest is f (Φ|Y ). The Gibbs sampler algorithm
produces a sample from the joint distribution by breaking the vector of unknown variables into
subsets and sampling each subvector sequentially conditional on the value of all the other unknown
variables (see, e.g., Gelman et al., 2004, and Geweke, 2005). In our case we implement the Gibbs
sampler as follows.

  1. We derive the conditional distribution of each element of Φ conditional on all the other
      elements and conditional on the observables. For the ith element of Φ, we can denote this
      conditional distribution as f (Φi |Φ−i , Y ), where Φi denotes the ith element of Φ and Φ−i

                                                          27
         denotes all but the ith element of Φ. In most cases, f (Φi |Φ−i , Y ) are common distributions
         such as normal distributions or gamma distributions for which samples can be drawn in a
         computationally efficient manner. In cases where the Gibbs sampler cannot be applied, we
         use the Metropolis algorithm to sample values of f (Φi |Φ−i , Y ).34

  2. We propose initial values for all the unknown variables Φ. Let Φ0 denote these initial values.

  3. We cycle through Φ sampling Φti from the distribution f (Φi |Φt−1
                                                                   −i , Y ) where


                                            Φt−1    t         t      t−1         t−1
                                             −i = (Φ1 , ..., Φi−1 , Φi+1 , ..., Φd )


         and d denotes the number of elements in Φ. At the end of each cycle, we have a new draw
         Φt . We repeat this step N times to get a sample of N draws for Φ.

  4. It has been shown that samples drawn in this way converge to the distribution f (Φ|Y ) under
         very general conditions (see, e.g., Geweke, 2005). We assess convergence and throw away an
         appropriate burn-in sample.

       In practice, we run four such “chains” starting two from one set of initial values and two from
another set of initial values. We choose starting values that are far apart in the following way: For
one chain, we set the initial values of xi,t = 0 for all i and t. For the other chain, we set the initial
values of xi,t = ∆ci,t for all i and t.
       Given a sample from the joint distribution f (Φ|Y ) of the unobserved variables conditional on
the observed data, we can calculate any statistic of interest that involves Φ. For example, we can
calculate the mean of any element of Φ by calculating the sample analogue of the integral
                                                Z
                                                    Φi f (Φi |Φt−1
                                                               −i , Y )dΦi .




  34
    The Metropolis algorithm samples a proposal Φ∗i from a proposal distribution Jt (Φ∗i |Φt−1        i   ). This proposal dis-
tribution must be symmetric, i.e., Jt (xa |xb ) = Jt (xb |xa ). The proposal is accepted with probability min(r, 1) where
r = f (Φ∗i |Φ−i , Y )/f (Φt−1
                          i   |Φ−i , Y ). If the proposal is accepted, Φti = Φ∗i . Otherwise Φti = Φt−1
                                                                                                    i   . Using the Metropolis
algorithm to sample from f (Φi |Φ−i , Y ) is much less efficient than the standard algorithms used to sample from known
distributions such as the normal distribution in most software packages. Intuitively, this is because it is difficult to
come up with an efficient proposal distribution. The proposal distribution we use is a normal distribution centered
at Φt−1
     i  .




                                                              28
B     Variance Ratios

Variance ratios are a simple tool to quantify the persistence of shocks to aggregate consumption
(Cochrane, 1988). The k-period variance ratio for consumption growth is defined as the ratio of
the variance of k-period consumption growth and 1-period consumption growth divided by k:
                                               P               
                                                  k−1
                                         1 var    j=0 ∆c  i,t−j
                                VRi,k =                           .                       (13)
                                         k      var(∆ci,t )

The intuition for this statistic comes from the fact that for a simple random-walk process var(ci,t −
ci,t−k ) is equal to k times var(ci,t − ci,t−1 ), implying that the variance ratio for such a process is
equal to one for all k. For a trend-stationary process, the variance ratio is less than one and falls
toward zero as k increases. However, for a process that has persistent growth-rate shocks—i.e.,
positively autocorrelated growth rates—the variance ratio is larger than one.
    Bansal and Yaron (2004) introduce a variance ratio statistic for assessing the persistence of
shocks to volatility. They first compute the innovations to consumption growth ui,t as the residuals
from an AR(5) regression and use the absolute value of these innovations |ui,t | as a measure of
realized volatility of consumption growth. They then construct variance ratios for |ui,t |,
                                                  P                 
                                                     k−1
                                            1 var    j=0 |u   i,t−j |
                                   VRui,k =                            .                           (14)
                                            k      var(|ui,t |)

This statistic provides a rough measure of the persistence of stochastic volatility. As with the vari-
ance ratio for consumption growth, if this variance ratio is above one, it indicates that uncertainty
shocks have persistent effects on volatility—i.e., high volatility periods are “bunched together”
leading to a high value of the variance in the numerator.

The shock-price elasticity at horizon k for the world growth-rate shock is

                                               1 Et [Dt+k W,t+1 ]    1 Et [Mt,t+k Dt+k W,t+1 ]

    It is useful to develop an alternative way of deriving the shock elasticities. For concreteness, let’s
consider the shock-exposure elasticity for horizon k and for the world growth-rate shock. The dis-
tribution of the world growth rate shock divided by its standard deviation is W,t+1 /σW,t ∼ N(0, 1).
Let’s denote cumulative distribution of W,t+1 /σW,t by Q(W,t+1 /σW,t ). Now, let’s contemplate the
notion that the distribution of W,t+1 /σW,t is perturbed and becomes W,t+1 /σW,t ∼ N(r, 1). In
other words, its mean increases by r. Let’s denote the cumulative distribution of this alterna-
tive distribution by Qr (W,t+1 /σW,t ). Intuitively, if the distribution of W,t+1 /σW,t changes from
Q(W,t+1 /σW,t ) to Qr (W,t+1 /σW,t ), the economy will get hit by a larger value of W,t+1 /σW,t on
average.
    Let Xt denote the state of the economy at time t. Consider the expected dividend in period
t + k conditional on information at time t and also conditional on a particular value  for the world
growth-rate shock at time t + 1

                            Φt,t+k () ≡ E [Dt+k |Xt = x, W,t+1 /σW,t = ] .

Finally, consider the following generalized impulse response function
                                       Z                            Z
                            r                           r
                     GIRF (x) ≡ log        Φt,t+k ()dQ () − log       Φt,t+k ()dQ().

This is the difference between the log of Φt,t+k () averaged across  under the perturbed distribution
and under the unperturbed distribution. The shock-exposure elasticity is then defined as
                                                 R
                           d        r

                               GIRFt,t+k       = R                  .
                          dr               r=0     Φt,t+k ()dQ()

process, and the uncertainty processes in terms of the half-life in years. Panel B reports the standard deviation of consumption growth in a long
simulation of several variants of each model. The first row (labeled "total") reports volatility of each model without any modification. The
second row reports the volatility when the persistent growth-rate processes (xi,t and xW,t) are set to zero as a fraction of the total volatility in the
baseline model. The third through fifth rows report the volatility of consumption growth in a version of each model where volatility is constant
and set to the level of volatility that is the 5th, 50th and 95th quantiles of the distribution of stochastic volatility for the U.S. in that model.

   The table reports autocorrelations, cross-country correlations and variance ratios for the real-world data and simulated
   data from the model (excluding disasters in both cases). The first through sixth rows present the autocorrelation of one
   year through five year and ten year consumption growth. The next three rows present cross-country correlations of one,
   five and ten year consumption growth. The last two rows present the fifteen year variance ratio of consumption growth
   and the realized volatility of consumption growth. For the cross-country correlations, the median country results are the
   median of the 120 cross-country correlations across our 16 countries. For the results based on data from the model, we
   simulate 1000 datasets from the model of the same size as the actual data. For each such simulation we calculate the
   median across countries as well as the value for the U.S. for each statistic. We then report the median along with the
   2.5% and 97.5% quantiles across simulations for each of these statistic.

Columns labeled as "Median" report the result for the median country for each statistic. Columns labeled as "U.S." report
these statistics for the United States. The first two columns are estimates from real world data from non-disaster years. We
use total nominal returns and dividend-price ratios on stock from GFD and total real returns on government bills and
inflation rates from Barro and Ursua (2008). The second two columns are based on data from our baseline model. For
returns the statistics we report are the unconditional average of the level of the ex-post real net return in percentage points
(i.e., multiplied by 100). Rm denotes the return on equity (the market), while Rf denotes the return on a short term nominal
government bond (risk-free rate). The last three rows report statistics for the logarithm of the price-dividend ratio on equity.
For the model, these results are for a CRRA = 9, IES = 1.5, and subjective discount factor of β = 0.99, and are calculated
using a sample of length 1 million years.

The table presents asset pricing statistics based on simulated data from our model as well as from the historical
data. The historical data come from Barro and Ursua (2008). The "Constant Volatility" model is a version of the
full model where we "turn off" the stochastic volatility by setting the volatility of the uncertainty shocks ω and ωW
to zero but keep other parameters at their estimated values for the full model. For the "Mehra-Presott" model we
"turn off" both the stochastic volatility and the growth-rate shocks and then we recalibrate the random-walk shocks
based on the volatility of permanent consumption in the full model. These results are for a CRRA = 9, IES = 1.5
and subjective discount factor of β = 0.99.

The table reports results from regressions of excess returns, consumption growth and realized volatility at the 5 year
horizon on the price-dividend ratio. Our measure of realized volatility is the absolute value of the residual from an AR(1)
model for consumption growth. The first two columns report results using data from our 16 country sample and the U.S.,
respectively. The first column is the median across countries of the statistic in question. The next four columns report
results from our baseline model for the median country and the U.S. For the baseline model, we report the median value
of each statistic across 1000 simulations along with the 95% probability interval. The last two columns report results for
the models of Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Bansal, Kiku and Yaron (2012). The results for the Bansal-Yaron model are
taken from Beeler and Campbell (2009). We use the end of year convention for the timing of consumption, whereby
time t consumption is assumed to occur at the end of year t.

           The table presents the standard deviation of the log change in the real exchange rate of each country
           with the United States. First, it presents results based on historical data from 1975-2009. Second, it
           presents results based on simulated data from our baseline estimates. The last column calculates
           counterfactual exchange rates based on the simulated data from our estimated model but ignoring the
           correlation between the stochastic discount factors of the two countries in question.

Columns labeled as "Median" report the result for the median country for each statistic. Columns labeled as "U.S." report these
statistics for the United States. The first two columns are estimates from real world data from non-disaster years. We use total
nominal returns and dividend-price ratios on stock from GFD and total real returns on government bills and inflation rates from
Barro and Ursua (2008). The remaining columns are based on data from the three versions of our model. For returns the
statistics we report are the unconditional average of the level of the ex-post real net return in percentage points (i.e., multiplied
by 100). Rm denotes the return on equity (the market), while Rf denotes the return on a short term nominal government bond
(risk-free rate). The last three rows report statistics for the logarithm of the price-dividend ratio on equity. For the model, these
results are for a CRRA = 9, IES = 1.5, and subjective discount factor of β = 0.99, and are calculated using a sample of length 1
million years.
