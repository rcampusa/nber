                                               ABSTRACT
        The optimal allocation of assets among different asset classes (such as stocks and bonds) has
received considerable attention in financial theory and practice. On the other hand, investors have not been
given much guidance about which assets should be located in tax-deferred retirement accounts and which
in conventional savings accounts. This paper derives optimal asset allocations (which assets to hold) and
asset locations (where to hold them) for a risk-averse investor saving for retirement. Locating assets
optimally can significantly improve the risk-adjusted performance of retirement savings.

    Asset Location in Tax-Deferred and Conventional
                    Savings Accounts

1    Introduction
One of the biggest financial challenges facing households is saving for retire-
ment. Investors must decide how much to save, what to invest in, and which
investments to hold in tax-deferred retirement accounts and which to hold in
conventional taxable savings accounts. This paper addresses two of the main
parts of the overall problem: which assets to hold and where to hold them.
It does not deal with the choice of how much to save. The U.S. tax system
influences the size and the composition of retirement savings by allowing in-
dividuals to save in tax-qualified retirement vehicles (e.g., IRA, Roth-IRA,
401(k) accounts) and by exempting interest payments of certain assets (e.g.,
municipal bonds) from taxable income. This paper takes into account these
institutional features and derives optimal portfolio choices for a risk-averse
individual saving for retirement.
    The optimal allocation between different asset classes such as stocks and
bonds has received much attention in financial theory and practice since the
seminal paper of Markowitz (1952). More recently several papers analyzed
the effect of personal taxes on optimal asset allocation. Constantinides (1983)
and Dammon and Spatt (1996) discuss optimal trading strategies if investors
face personal taxes. Balcer and Judd (1987) examine the impact of capital
income taxation on savings and the demand for corporate financial instru-
ments under certainty. They show that the effective taxation depends on the
investment horizon. Dybvig and Ross (1986) demonstrate that the taxation
of asset returns can create clientele effects and derive the impact on asset
pricing.
    The aspect of this general topic which has been under-studied is the asset
location choice—i.e. the choice of holding assets in tax-deferred retirement
accounts or in conventional taxable savings accounts. Due to limitations on
how much individuals can contribute to tax qualified accounts, households
may want to or be forced to accumulate funds both inside a tax-deferred

                                      1
account and outside such an account. This subject was introduced in Shoven
and Sialm (1998) and Shoven (1999). This paper differs in two major respects
from the previous two papers. First, the previous papers do not explicitly
solve for the optimal portfolio choices (i.e., asset allocation and location);
instead, they compare the simulated distributions of wealth levels at retire-
ment for different heuristic portfolios. This paper solves for the choices which
maximize expected utility. Second, Monte-Carlo simulations such as those in
the previous papers do not give precise information about the extreme lower
tails of the resulting wealth distributions. These outcomes have a large im-
pact on expected utility if individuals are sufficiently risk-averse. This paper
takes better account of the effects of those unlikely occurrences. Wang and
Judd (1998) solve a dynamic savings allocation problem with tax-deferred
and taxable accounts. This paper analyzes the asset location choice in much
more depth and captures more completely important features of the U.S. tax
code.
    The actual behavior of individuals investing in tax-qualified accounts and
taxable accounts is discussed by Bodie and Crane (1997) and Poterba and
Samwick (1997). Poterba and Samwick analyze the relationship between age,
birth cohorts, and portfolio structure for households using the Federal Re-
serve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances. They find that the composition
of portfolios differ across birth cohorts. Bodie and Crane describe the as-
set allocation behavior of participants of TIAA-CREF, an organization that
manages self-directed retirement funds for the staff of some 6,000 universi-
ties, secondary schools, and other nonprofit organizations. They examine
the results of a survey that contains information on the composition of to-
tal asset holdings—both inside and outside their tax-deferred accounts—of
TIAA-CREF participants. They find that most households in the survey
have significant amounts of money in both tax-deferred and in conventional
accounts. The survey respondents locate a somewhat higher share of equity
inside the tax-deferred account than outside. They tend to invest in taxable
bonds and stocks in both environments. The respondents do not appear to
take advantage of the potential benefits of optimal asset location.
    There are three main results in this paper. First, the same asset located
in different tax environments has a different mean after-tax return as well as
a different variance. Returns of investments in tax-deferred accounts have
generally a higher expectation and a higher standard deviation than returns
on the same assets in conventional saving accounts. This implies that in-
vestments in tax-deferred accounts are in general not perfect substitutes for

                                       2
investments in conventional savings accounts even if the higher liquidity of
taxable accounts is ignored. Second, the preferred asset location is deter-
mined by the tax rates facing the returns, as well as the expectations and
the standard deviations of the returns. The conventional wisdom is that it
is wise to locate assets which face higher tax rates (such as taxable corpo-
rate bonds) in a tax-qualified account while locating assets which are taxed
less heavily (such as stocks or equity mutual funds) in conventional savings
accounts. We show that this conventional wisdom is wrong under certain
circumstances because stock returns have higher means and more risk than
bond returns. Third, optimal asset location significantly improves the risk-
adjusted performance of retirement saving. By simply adopting an optimal
location strategy one can enhance the resources enjoyed in retirement by
several percentage points.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the optimization
problem of the investor. Section 3 derives the after-tax rates of return of
different asset classes under the present U.S. tax system. Section 4 analyzes
how asset characteristics and taxation influence the optimal asset location
and allocation if investors can invest in stocks, taxable bonds, and tax-exempt
municipal bonds. We discuss the effects of the taxation of nominal returns
instead of real returns (i.e., inflation tax). The final section summarizes the
major results of the paper.


2    The Model
This section presents the theoretical model used to derive optimal asset al-
location and location choices. It is assumed that the investor maximizes
expected utility at the time of retirement by choosing an optimal portfolio
using tax-deferred and conventional savings accounts. The choice between
consumption and saving is taken as exogenous.
    To simplify the analysis, we examine the problem in a two-period model.
The investor chooses her portfolio during her working career in the first pe-
riod and withdraws the savings during retirement in the second period. The
investor has the choice to invest her saving of S in n risky assets which can
be located either in a tax-deferred account (TDA) or a conventional savings
account(CSA). The assets themselves are well-diversified portfolios of assets
(they probably should be thought of as mutual funds of stocks or bonds).
The investment horizon of the individual is h years, which corresponds to the


                                      3
length of the first period (i.e, the difference between retirement age and cur-
rent age). Due to the limitations on how much individuals can contribute to a
tax qualified account, they may want to accumulate funds in both locations.
The maximum contribution to the TDA is C.
    Asset i is assumed to have a nominal return of ri before taxes. The return
before taxes will compound to Ri = (1 + ri )h − 1 after h years. The return
after taxes depends on the location and is denoted by RiT DA or RiCSA . Let tW
and tR denote the marginal income tax rates during the work career and at
the time of retirement. If the investor saves $1 after taxes, she can contribute
$1/(1 − tW ) to her TDA after taking into account the tax-deductibility of
contributions to a tax-deferred account. This investment compounds at the
before-tax rate of return Ri . The withdrawn benefits at the time of retirement
are taxed at the future marginal income tax rate tR , which is assumed to be
known in advance. The TDA-returns are identical to the before-tax returns
if the tax rates do not change at the time of retirement (i.e, tW = tR ). The
after-tax return of asset i in a TDA after h years amounts to:
                                    1 − tR
                         RiT DA =           (1 + Ri ) − 1.                   (1)
                                    1 − tW
    Savings in a CSA are not deductible from taxable income and withdrawals
are not taxed. Distributed returns (dividends, interest, and capital gains
distributions) on assets held in a CSA are taxed annually. A fixed proportion
of the average return ri of asset i is paid annually either as a short-run
               i or as a long-run distribution di . The remainder 1 − di − di
distribution dsr                                   lr                   sr     lr

is the proportion of total returns that are accrued or unrealized capital gains.
Short-run distributions are taxed at the full current marginal income tax
rate tW and long-run distributions are taxed at the lower capital gains tax
rate tC . The after-tax distributions are reinvested in the CSA. The total
annual distributions simplify to di = dsr       lr
                                          i + di and the corresponding tax rate
simplifies to tdi = (tW dsr      lr
                         i + tC di )/di . The savings compound after taxes at
the following rate:

               riCSA = ri (1 − di) + (1 − tdi )diri = ri (1 − tdi di ).      (2)
    The investor liquidates the CSA during retirement. She is required to
pay capital gains taxes on the difference between the value of the portfolio
and its cost basis. The cost basis per dollar of initial investment, Bi , is the
sum of the initial dollar plus all the reinvested after-tax distributions. These
re-investments grow geometrically at the rate riCSA .

   We define the “effective tax rate” as the proportion of the total nominal
asset returns collected by the government. The government would need to
impose this effective tax on investment returns if it deferred the collection of
the tax until the end of the time horizon h. τij = 1 − Rij /Ri is the effective
tax rate of asset i in the location j, where j = (CSA, T DA).1

    The initial savings S can be allocated to n assets in 2 locations. The
corresponding weights are denoted by ωij . The investor is not allowed to
short-sell assets. We assume for simplicity that the investor does not have
any other sources of income during retirement. 2 The nominal wealth level at
retirement amounts to:
                                               XX
                                W =S                    ωij (1 + Rij ).                   (7)

wealth is given by a power-utility function with a constant coefficient of

    Other income sources might change the portfolio decisions of individuals. Introducing
relatively safe social security benefits would induce individuals to hold a smaller proportion
of their portfolios in safe assets. Other risk sources such as health risk will also influence
portfolio decisions. These extensions are not analyzed in this paper.

    Asset i is said to have a preferred location in the TDA if its optimal

proportion is higher in the TDA than in the CSA (i.e., ωiT DA / j ωjT DA >
        P
ωiCSA / j ωjCSA ) and a preferred location in the CSA if its optimal proportion
is higher in the CSA than in the TDA. The asset does not have a preferred
location if its optimal proportion is identical in both taxable accounts or if
the investor only contributes to one of the two accounts. Asset location is
irrelevant in these two cases.
    The optimization problem 9 cannot be solved analytically. Instead, we
determine the optimal portfolio weights numerically assuming a log-normal
distribution for the returns of the assets. The expected utility is computed
using a multi-dimensional Gauss-Hermite quadrature with 10 nodes.3 The
constrained optimization is performed using an active-set strategy.


3         Distribution of Returns
In this section we state the assumed distributions of asset returns and com-
pute the after-tax returns of stocks, taxable bonds, and tax-exempt bonds in
the two tax-environments.

3.1         Numerical Assumptions
Two major asset classes in financial markets are stocks and bonds. These two
asset classes differ considerably in their characteristics and their rate of effec-
tive taxation. Stocks have higher expected returns and a higher variability
    3
        Cf. Judd (1998), p. 261-263.

                                                 6
of returns relative to bonds. Bonds usually pay most of their total returns as
short-run distributions (interest payments) and only a small portion of their
returns in the form of capital gains and losses.4 Income from bonds issued by
state and local governments in the investor’s state of residence is completely
exempt from federal and state income taxation. Because of this tax-exempt
feature, the interest rate on these securities is below the rate on equally safe
taxable bonds.5 Stocks pay a smaller portion of their total returns as short-
run distributions (dividends and short-run capital gains). Capital gains and
losses result from active trading by the investor or the mutual fund. Mutual
funds differ considerably in their rate of asset turnover and in the proportion
of their total annual returns distributed in the form of realized capital gains.
Most mutual funds pay between 25 and 75 percent of their total annual re-
turns as short- and long-run distributions. Individuals can influence the net
distributions by trading their shares of mutual funds and thereby realizing
accumulated capital gains and losses. Tax-efficient trading strategies result
in lower and tax-inefficient strategies in higher annual distributions.6
    The base case of the computations in section 4 assumes that the investor
has a time horizon of 30 years. The coefficient of relative risk-aversion α is
taken as 3, which can be characterized as moderate risk-aversion. The in-
vestor can at most contribute half of her savings to the TDA.7 The marginal
income tax rate is assumed to be identical during the working career and
retirement in the base case. We analyze changes in marginal tax rates over
the life-cycle. The base-case tax rates on short-run and long-run distribu-
tions in the CSA are taken as 40 and 20 percent, roughly corresponding to
the marginal federal income tax rate and capital gains tax rate faced by
a high-income taxpayer. Some results are computed as well for medium-
   4
     Zero-and low-coupon bonds are the exception.
   5
     The implicit tax rate on municipal bonds is given by tM = 1 − rM /rB , where rM and
rB denote the nominal returns of municipal bonds and corporate bonds. The difference
between the yields on long-run municipal bonds and the yields on corresponding taxable
bonds is surprisingly small. The implicit tax rate on long-run municipal bonds has been
between 20 and 30 percent during the last 30 years; this is considerably lower than the
maximum statutory marginal personal income tax rate (Shoven 1999).
   6
     Constantinides (1983), Stiglitz (1983), and Dammon and Spatt (1996) argue that opti-
mal stock trading with personal taxes reduces the effective taxation considerably. Poterba
(1987) and Auerbach, Burman, and Siegel (1998) find that avoidance of tax on realized
capital gains is not prevalent and that the effective tax rate on realized capital gains is
close to the statutory rate for a large proportion of investors.
   7                                             S
     The contribution limit is therefore C = 2(1−t W)
                                                      .

income individuals (with tax rates of 30 and 20 percent) and for low-income
individuals (with tax rates of 15 and 10 percent).

                                  [Table 1 about here.]

    Our assumptions regarding the distributions of real asset returns are
shown in Table 1. The values correspond roughly to the historical record
between 1926-1998 as summarized in Ibbotson (1999). The simple real re-
turn of stock funds (S) has an expectation of 10 percent and a standard
deviation of 25 percent. The corresponding moments are 4 and 8 percent
for taxable bonds (B) and 2 and 6 percent for tax-exempt municipal bonds
(M). The returns of the bonds assume an implicit tax rate of 28.6 percent for
the municipal bonds, which is close to the average rate over the last thirty
years.8 The real return of taxable bonds is set slightly higher than the current
real yield on inflation-protected bonds to reflect a compensation for default
and inflation risk. We perform sensitivity analyses on these assumptions to
check the robustness of our results. The correlation coefficient is 0.25 be-
tween stocks and taxable bonds, 0.2 between stocks and tax-exempt bonds,
and 0.95 between taxable and tax-exempt bonds. The rate of inflation has
an average of 3 percent and a standard deviation of 4 percent. Inflation is
negatively correlated with the real returns of all the assets.
    We assume that the logarithms of the return relatives (i.e., one plus the
simple returns) and the logarithm of the price level are jointly normally
distributed. The moments of this distribution are derived using the moments
of the simple returns shown in Table 1. The returns of the assets are assumed
to be serially uncorrelated. The high serial correlation of inflation of 0.65 is
taken into account when we compute the moments of price changes over long
horizons.9
   8
      Note that the implicit tax rate is defined for nominal returns. The assumptions from
Table 1 imply expected nominal returns of 7 and 5 percent for taxable and tax-exempt
bonds, which corresponds to a 28.6 percent implicit tax rate on municipal bonds.
    9
      A higher serial correlation increases the variance of inflation more than proportionally
if the time horizon exceeds 1 year. Let pj denote the logarithm of the price level at time
j, where the initial price level is normalized to 1 (p0 = 0) and πj the logarithm of one
plus the (simple) inflation rate i at time j. The price change during the time horizon h,
       Ph
ph = i=1 πi , is normally distributed with a mean of E(ph ) = hE(π) and a variance of
                                                                 
                                        2ρ(h(1 − ρ) − (1 − ρh ))
                      V ar(ph ) = h +                               V ar(π).

    We assume in our base case that stock mutual funds distribute 50 percent
of their total returns annually. The remaining 50 percent of the total returns
are unrealized until the funds are withdrawn at the time of retirement. Short-
run and long-run annual distributions both equal 25 percent of the total
returns. In the paper we often discuss the effect of different stock fund
distributions. We define annual distributions as the fraction of the total
returns which are distributed annually to the shareholders of the stock mutual
funds and the fraction of those distributions which are taxed as short-run
distributions. For example, funds with annual distributions of 75 percent are
assumed to distribute 75 percent of their returns to the shareholders and 75
percent of those distributions are short-run capital gains. Actively managed
funds with high asset turnover tend to distribute more than index funds and
tax-efficient funds. Most funds distribute between 25 and 75 percent of their
returns. The returns of both taxable and tax-exempt bonds are distributed
completely as short-run income.

3.2     After-Tax Returns
The distribution of after-tax returns depends on the asset class and the tax-
environment. Table 2 summarizes the means and the standard deviations of
the after-tax annualized real returns of the three assets considered here for
individuals in two different tax brackets. Distributions of total asset returns
over long time periods are highly skewed to the right. To facilitate the
interpretation of the returns we annualize the returns by taking the geometric
mean of the long-run returns.10

                                [Table 2 about here.]

   The real returns in the TDA equal the before-tax returns due to our
base case assumption that marginal income tax rates do not change at the
time of retirement. The net rate of return on assets in a TDA does not de-
pend on the marginal income tax rate. Naturally, the average CSA returns
are lower for high-income individuals than for medium-income individuals.
  10
     The annualized moments of the geometric returns from Table 2 differ from the assumed
moments of the simple returns from Table 1. However, the underlying
                                                                  random distribution
is the same. The means in Table 2 are defined as E (1 + Ri )1/h − 1 and the variances
                    
as V ar (1 + Ri )1/h . The means in Table 1 are defined as E(ri ) and the variances as
V ar(ri ).


                                           9
Stocks have a higher average return and a higher standard deviation than
bonds irrespective of the location. Savings in a TDA have a higher average
return and a higher standard deviation than savings in a CSA for all assets
except for tax-exempt municipal bonds. Municipal bonds have a higher ex-
pected return than taxable bonds in the CSA for high- and medium-income
individuals. However, the real after-tax return of taxable bonds is higher for
low-income individuals. Returns in a CSA are less variable than the returns
in a TDA because the tax system implicitly insures against losses in a CSA.
Realized capital gains increase the tax liability and capital losses decrease the
tax liability. This symmetric tax system dampens both gains and losses. The
government does not insure against losses in a TDA at all. Assets in a TDA
are taxed on a consumption tax basis, meaning that investors face the full
(undampened) rates of return earned by the investments.11 The government
does not insure against losses in a TDA at all. Assets in a TDA are taxed on
a consumption tax basis, meaning that investors face the full (undampened)
rates of return earned by the investments.
    The effective taxation of taxable assets in a CSA is considerable. The
government would need to impose this effective tax on nominal investment
returns if it deferred the collection until at the end of the time horizon.
Although the tax rates on short- and long-run distributions are assumed
to be 40 and 20 percent for a high-income individual, the government will
have taxed on average 62.6 percent of the nominal returns of bonds and
44.1 percent of the nominal returns of stocks after 30 years in the base case.
Bonds face a higher effective tax because they pay all their returns as short-
run distributions which are taxed at the marginal income tax rate, whereas
stocks only distribute 50 percent of their returns annually and half of those
distributions are taxed as long-run capital gains in the base case. Medium-
  11
     Our model does not capture two institutional facts. First, mutual funds are forced to
distribute realized capital gains to their shareholders but are prohibited from distributing
losses. This fact might decrease the benefits of the implicit insurance in the CSA. Second,
the tax code limits the deduction of realized capital losses from taxable income. If the
capital losses are higher than the limit, then only the limit can be deducted from taxable
income. However, it is possible to carry the remaining losses forward and to deduct them
from future taxable income. Introducing those limitations does not change the major
results of our paper significantly. To determine how important this limitation is we make
the extreme assumption that capital losses can never be deducted from taxable income.
This decreases the mean real return of stocks in the CSA from 5.43 to 5.42 percent and
increases the standard deviation from 3.74 to 3.76 percent for a high-income individual
and does only change the returns of bonds marginally.


                                            10
income individuals (tW = 0.3 and tC = 0.2) pay effectively on average 51.1
percent taxes on bonds and 39.4 percent on stocks. Low-income individuals
(tW = 0.15 and tC = 0.1) are still taxed on average 29.2 and 21.7 percent on
the two assets. The effective tax rates increase both with the time horizon
and the level of annual distributions as shown in Table 3 for high-income
individuals. Investing in assets with annual distributions of 25 instead of 75
percent results in 66.4 percent more wealth with a 30 year horizon.

                            [Table 3 about here.]


4     Optimal Portfolio Choice
In this section we analyze how asset characteristics and taxation influence
optimal asset allocation and location. First, we derive numerically the opti-
mal portfolio for an investor who chooses between a bond and a stock mutual
fund. Second, we add tax-exempt municipal bonds as a feasible investment
choice. Third, we show that asset location is also important for risk-tolerant
investors who only invest in stock mutual funds.

4.1    Choice of Stocks and Taxable Bonds
When choosing between a corporate bond fund and a particular equity mu-
tual fund, optimal asset location depends primarily on the proportion of
returns that the equity fund distributes annually as dividends and capital
gains (tax effect). Funds with high annual (potentially taxable) distributions
should be located in a TDA. We show that return effects (i.e., the effective
tax increases with the return of an asset) and risk effects (i.e., investments
in a TDA are more risky than investments in a CSA) are secondary effects
which under certain circumstances can outweigh the primary tax effect. As-
set location influences the performance of a portfolio substantially.
    A high-income individual should take full advantage of tax-deferred sav-
ings and contribute the limit to the TDA. She should invest 6.5 percent of
her assets in equities in the TDA, 43.5 percent in bonds in the TDA, and the
remaining 50 percent in stocks in the CSA in the base case. Bonds have a
preferred location in the TDA and stocks in the CSA if stocks distribute 50
percent of their returns annually. The location preference of stocks shifts to
the TDA if stocks distribute more than 92 percent of their returns as shown


                                     11
in Figure 1. This result contradicts conventional wisdom which advises to
put the asset with the higher tax rate in the TDA. Although bonds face
higher tax rates than stocks, stocks have higher expected returns and gain
more by compounding without deductions of taxes in the TDA. If the an-
nual distributions of the equity fund are below 17 percent then the investor
should not hold stocks in the TDA at all. The investor increases the share of
stocks in the TDA as the annual distribution of stock funds increases. This
portfolio shift towards stocks compensates for the higher effective taxation
facing stocks in the CSA at higher distribution levels.

                             [Figure 1 about here.]

    The asset allocations and locations do not differ much for medium- and
low-income individuals. Individuals facing lower tax rates hold fewer stocks
in the TDA in the base case (4.9 and 0.0 percent for the medium- and low-
income individuals). The location preference of stocks shifts to the TDA if
stocks distribute more than 89 percent for medium-income individuals and
87 percent for low-income individuals. The portfolio choice is not affected
significantly for individuals expecting a lower or higher marginal income tax
rate during retirement.
    To determine whether asset location is economically significant we com-
pare the gains from asset location to the gains from the existence of a tax-
deferred account. We compute the expected utility of an investor in three
different environments. In a first environment investments can only be made
in a taxable CSA (NTDA). A second environment allows investments in a
TDA but restricts investors to hold the same relative proportions in the CSA
and the TDA (NL). A third environment allows investments in a TDA and
does not restrict the asset location. This third environment corresponds to
the optimization problem described in section 2. For a better comparison of
the three environments we compute the certainty equivalents of the expected
utilities. It is defined as:
                                     (                  1
                        −1
          ce(E(u)) = u (E(u)) =          ((1 − α)E(u)) 1−α if α 6= 1       (13)
                                         exp(E(u))         if α = 1
   Let ce denote the certainty equivalent in the unrestricted environment.
The certainty equivalents in the environment without a TDA and without
asset location are denoted by ceN T DA and ceN L . The gain due to the existence


                                         12
of a TDA is ceN L /ceN T DA − 1 and the gain due to optimal asset location is
ce/ceN L − 1.
    Table 4 summarizes the certainty equivalents in the unrestricted model
and the gains from asset location between the three environments. Panel
4 shows the values for a high-income individual facing the same tax rates
during the working career and during retirement. The certainty equivalent
in the unrestricted environment equals 288.9 percent of the initial saving S for
this high-income individual in the base case with an equity fund distributing
50 percent of its total return. Choosing stock portfolios with lower annual
distributions increases the wealth at retirement considerably. The certainty
equivalent increases by 13.9 percent if the the high-income individuals shifts
from a mutual fund with 75 percent distribution (typical for an actively
managed fund) to a fund with 25 percent distribution (typical for a tax-
efficient fund). The availability of a TDA corresponds to an increase in the
certainty equivalent of retirement wealth of 39.0 percent in the base case.
The benefits of a TDA increase with the annual distributions of the stocks.
Asset location improves the performance of a portfolio significantly. Optimal
asset location adds 6.7 percent to the benefits of a TDA in the base case.
The gains of asset location are particularly high if the available assets differ
considerably in their characteristics, that is if stocks differ from bonds by
distributing considerably less than 100 percent. The benefits of asset location
are computed relative to a symmetric asset location. Other sub-optimal asset
locations can reduce retirement wealth considerably more.
                            [Table 4 about here.]
    Panel 1 of Table 4 shows that a medium-income individual has a slightly
higher certainty equivalent than the high-income individual. The gains of
a TDA and asset location are slightly lower because the tax-deferral is less
valuable if investors face lower taxes. Saving in tax-deferred accounts is
particularly beneficial if tax rates are expected to be lower during retire-
ment than during the working career as shown in Panel 3. Individuals can
deduct their contributions from their taxable income when they face higher
tax rates and they pay the taxes on the withdrawn benefits when their taxes
are lower. Panel 2 shows that contributions to the TDA are beneficial even
if the marginal income tax rates are expected to rise from 30 to 40 percent
at retirement.
    The following computations check the robustness of our results by chang-
ing the assumptions about risk-aversion, expected returns, and standard

                                      13
deviations. Figure 2 shows the portfolio composition at different levels of
risk-aversion. Contributions to the TDA equal the contribution limit for
plausible levels of risk-aversion. Investors invest exclusively in stock funds
if their risk-aversion is lower than α = 1.4. As their risk-aversion increases
they shift towards bonds. The preferred location of stocks remains the CSA.

                           [Figure 2 about here.]

   The preferred location of bonds does not depend on the level of expected
returns and the standard deviation of stocks for high-income individuals as
shown in Figures 3 and 4. Investors shift their portfolios towards stocks as
their expected return and their risk decreases.

                           [Figure 3 about here.]

                           [Figure 4 about here.]

4.2    Choice of Stocks, Taxable and Tax-Exempt Bonds
This section adds tax-exempt municipal bonds to the asset choices. The im-
plied tax rate on municipal bonds is assumed to equal 28.6 percent. This im-
plied tax is smaller than the marginal income tax rate of high- and medium-
income individuals, which determines the taxes paid on interest payments
of taxable bonds. The computations assume that tax-exempt and taxable
bonds are highly but not perfectly correlated. We show that municipal bonds
should be located in the CSA and corporate bonds in the TDA. Stocks have
a preferred location in the TDA if their distributions are sufficiently high.
    A high-income individual should invest 6.5 percent in stocks in the TDA,
43.5 percent in bonds in the TDA, and the remaining 50 percent in stocks
in the CSA if stocks distribute 50 percent of their total returns annually.
The investor chooses exactly the same portfolio as without municipal bonds.
Figure 5 shows that municipal bonds are only held if the stocks distribute
more than 52 percent annually. Municipal bonds have a preferred location
in the CSA and taxable bonds in the TDA. The preferred location of stocks
shifts from the CSA to the TDA if they are sufficiently tax-inefficient. A
medium-income individual holds the same portfolio as in an environment
without municipal bonds if stocks distribute 50 percent. The substitution
of municipal bonds in the CSA for taxable bonds in the TDA occurs at a
slightly higher level of annual distributions of the stocks for medium-income

                                     14
than for high-income individuals. Low-income individuals never invest in
tax-deferred municipal bonds and choose the same portfolios as in an en-
vironment without them. Investment practitioners suggest that individuals
hold municipal bonds if their marginal tax rate on ordinary income is higher
than the implicit tax rate of municipal bonds. This advice is not always
correct for individuals saving in both tax environments. The relevant com-
parison in our case is the implied tax on municipal bonds relative to the tax
on stocks in the CSA. Individuals should put bonds in the TDA and mostly
stocks in the CSA if the taxes on stocks are lower than the implied taxes on
municipal bonds. This reduces the demand of investors for municipal bonds
and might explain the low implicit tax rate on them which is often perceived
to be puzzling.12

                               [Figure 5 about here.]

    Adding tax-exempt bonds does only affect the certainty equivalent if stock
funds are sufficiently tax-inefficient. Otherwise investors do not hold tax-
exempt bonds and their portfolios are identical to an environment without
tax-exempt bonds. The introduction of tax-exempt bonds increases the cer-
tainty equivalent of high-income individuals from 269.2 to 285.1 if stocks
distribute 75 percent of their returns annually. The gains of a TDA are 29.1
percent and the gains of optimal location are 8.8 percent in this case.

4.3     Choice of Two Stocks
In this section we consider the case of allocating assets between two stock
mutual funds. In sections 4.1 and 4.2 we showed that investors with low
risk-aversion should invest exclusively in stocks. Asset location is important
in this case if investors have the choice between stock funds with different
characteristics. The two stock funds might differ in the market capitalization
of the stocks held (small vs. large caps), in their nationality (domestic vs.
foreign stocks), or they might be constructed to take full advantage of the
different tax environments (e.g., with one portfolio including mostly assets
with highly taxed short-run distributions and the other portfolio including
assets with lightly taxed long-run capital gains). We show that the opti-
mal asset location depends primarily on the proportion of returns that are
  12
    This explanation of the low implicit tax rate on municipal bonds is similar to Mankiw
and Poterba (1996).

                                           15
distributed annually as dividends and capital gains. Assets with high an-
nual (potentially taxable) distributions should be located in a TDA. Asset
location can influence the performance of a portfolio substantially.
    Consider a high-income investor with a risk aversion of α = 1. This
investor should not hold taxable nor tax-exempt bonds. The investor can
choose between two stock mutual funds. The mutual funds are assumed to
have the same expected return of 10 percent and the same standard deviation
of 25 percent. The correlation between their returns amounts to 0.5. The
other assumptions are given in section 3. In Figure 6 we change the annual
distributions of stock fund 1 and keep the total distributions of stock fund 2
constant at 50 percent. If both assets distribute 50 percent of total returns,
then it is optimal to invest the initial savings equally in the four possible
choices.13 That is, the TDA should be used to the maximum extent possible
and both environments would hold the same proportions of stock fund2 1 and
2. If stock fund 1 distributes more (less) than 50 percent then its preferred
location is in the TDA (CSA).
                               [Figure 6 about here.]
    The availability of a TDA increases the certainty equivalent by 17.1 per-
cent if both stocks distribute 50 percent of their returns annually. The gains
of asset location are zero in this case because the optimal asset location corre-
sponds exactly to the symmetric asset location (i.e., the proportions of stock
1 in the TDA and the CSA are identical). The gains from asset location
increase with more asymmetric asset characteristics. An optimal asset loca-
tion generates an increase in the certainty equivalent of 4.1 percent relative
to the symmetric asset allocation if stock fund 1 distributes 25 percent of
its returns and fund 2 distributes 75 percent of its returns. Asset location
is therefore as well relevant for risk-tolerant individuals investing in just one
asset class.


5      Conclusions
This paper derives optimal asset locations and allocations for risk-averse in-
vestors saving for retirement. It confirms the desirability of accumulating as-
sets in tax-deferred accounts and suggests that certain assets are best suited
  13
    This symmetric allocation is strictly better than any other allocation because it di-
versifies the risks of the two funds with identical characteristics optimally.

                                           16
to taxable and tax-deferred accounts. The most important determinant of
asset location is the proportion of returns distributed annually as income and
capital gains. We show that expected returns and standard deviations of as-
sets may as well influence the asset location choice. The paper shows that
coupon bonds and stocks with high annual distributions have a preferred lo-
cation in the tax-deferred environment and that tax-exempt municipal bonds
and stocks with low annual distributions have a preferred location in conven-
tional savings accounts. One of the key findings of this paper is that asset
location choice can affect welfare in retirement by significant amounts. Asset
location matters both for high-income and low-income individuals and for
risk-tolerant and risk-averse investors.

Table 4: Gains With Stocks and Taxable Bonds
The table lists the percentage changes in the certainty equivalents of different
investment environments if the individual can invest in stocks and taxable
bonds. ‘Gains of TDA’ denote the gains which result from the availability of
a TDA if the investor locates the asset classes symmetrically in the CSA and
the TDA. ‘Gains of Location’ are the additional gains from locating the assets
optimally between the CSA and the TDA. The products of those two gains
are the ‘Total Gains’. The ‘Certainty Equivalent’ is for an environment with
a TDA and optimal asset location. It is expressed in percent of the initial
savings.
