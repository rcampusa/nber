       In   this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating distributed

lags  in short panels. Estimates of the parameter of distributed lag
relationships based on single time—series of observations have been usually
rather imprecise. The promise of panel data is in the N repetitions of
the time—series that     it contains which should allow one to estimate the
identified     lag parameters with greater precision. On the other hand,
panels tend to track their observations only over a relatively short time
interval. Thus, some assumptions will have to be made on the contribution
of the unobserved presample x's to the current values of y before any
lag parameters can be identified from such data. In this paper we suggest
two such assumptions; both of which are, at least in part, testable, and
outline appropriate estimation techniques. The first places reasonable
restrictions on the relationship between the presample and insample x's
while the second imposes conventional functional form constraints on the
lag coefficients. The paper concludes with an example which investigates
empirically how to construct a "capital stock" for profit or rate of return

regressions.

I. INTRODUCTION


    The problem we deal with in this paper arises, as is often the

case in econometrics, because we do not have all the data that we

would like to have. We often expect that changes in our independent

variables have relatively long lasting effects, but have only fairly

short time series to uncover them. Consider, for example, the simple

model

                 y
                  t
                       wx
                        Ot
                           +x
                            it—i                 mt—rn       t


where we have suppressed the constant term for simplicity of exposi-

tion. Here in + 1 is the total length of the lag structure and the

problem we wish to consider arises when rn is large relative to T

or to T + 0 , where       T is the total number of observations on y

and 0 is the available number of lagged observations on x • A

typical example might be T = 20       ,   in = 6 ,   and   0 = 2   .   In   this case,

one would have to give up )4 observations on y to get the whole lag

"in", and estimate 8 parameters (including the constant term) on the

basis   of i6   observations.   The resulting estimates are unlikely to be
very precise. One way of gaining precision is to impose additional
structure on the w's , choosing the form of the lag a priori —— poiy—
nomial, geometric, etc. Alternatively, one may try to increase the

sample   in some other dimension, adding more individuals, states or
commodities. The sample becomes then a time—series panel with N x T
observations.
                                      —2—


    A significant number of panel data sets are now available. Though

N in these data sets is often quite large, it is not yet clear

whether they will yield "better" estiraates of distributed lag coef-

ficients. Part of the problem lies in the fact that panel data sets

usually track their observations only over a rather short time inter-

val. Thus, if in the example introduced above T + 0 were less than

seven while m > 7     ,   we could not estimate any of the coefficients

consistently (as N grows large) without bringing in additional

information. The problem is, of course, that in short panels the

contribution of the unobserved presample x's to the current values

of y (or the truncation remainders) are likely to be particularly

important. Since the value of the truncation remainder is determined

by the lag coefficients and the presaniple x's one has to constrain

either the lag structure, or the stochastic process generating these

x's ,   in   order to identify any of the coefficients of interest. The

first alternative has been discussed in the context of a single time

series by Klein (1958), Dhrymes (1971), Maddala and Rao (1971),

Pesaren (1973), and others. In Section III, we discuss how their

solutions can be adapted to the panel data situation. Because there

are usually many more degrees of freedom available in panel data, we

concentrate on solutions which do not restrict the lag coefficients a

priori. Section II considers, therefore, the problem of estimating a

sequence of unrestricted lag coefficients when one is willing to

impose some structure on the stochastic processes generating the x's

The models we deal with allow for the possibility of individual—

specific time—invariant unobservable factors which impact both on y

given past x's and on the distribution of the x's themselves (they
                                 —3—



allow for heterogeneity and correlated effects). We consider expli-

citly the identification of lag coefficients when the regression func-

tion of recent xs on all past values of x and an individual spe-

cific constant term depends only on this constant term and a small

number of the immediately preceeding x's .   Examples of stochastic

processes which statisfy such assumptions are mixture processes con-

sisting of individual—specific components plus an integrated auto-

regressive deviate. The parameters defining this process may differ

from year to year (they need not be homogeneous over time). It is

shown that given this assumption one can identify the leading lag

coefficients without nking any assumptions on the shape of the rest

of the lag distribution and test for alternative simplifications (for,

e.g., that there is no individual—specific component, or that the lag

coefficients, at least after a few free lags, have an autoregressive

structure). These assumptions do not allow, however, for the iden-

tification of the tail of the lag structure (at least not without

further restrictions). One cannot provide answers to questions

involving the entire sequence of the lag coefficients (such as their

sum) without imposing constraints on the lag structure itself (Sims,

l9T4). On the other hand, the early w's are often of significant

interest in themselves, especially since unconstrained estimates of

their values may provide an empirical basis for restricting the tail

of the lag structure in further work. This brings us then to

Section III where we discuss the estimation of distributed lag coef-

ficients from panel data when one is willing to restrict the shape of

the lag structure a priori.

      An advantage of using the approach discussed here is that, in

general, it can be checked against the observed behavior of the data.

The tests we consider consist of a set of constraints on the second

order population moments of the vector r '         = (y
                                                      _]_
                                                            ',   x')
                                                                 _i
                                                                        ; where y

is the T element vector of observations on y for individual i ,

and    x   is the T + 0 vector of observations on x •                  In most cases

these constraints are restrictions on the matrix of coefficients

obtained from the regression of each of the T y 's on all
                                                            it
(T + 0) of the x         's .   In   each of our models this matrix, labelled
                    it
II by Chamberlain (1918), consists of a combination of the lag coef—

ficients of interest, and of the regression functions of the unob-

served components (the truncation remainders, and the individual—

specific sources of heterogeneity), on x.

      We conclude with an empirical example. It consists of regressing

the operating profits of firms on a distributed lag of their past

investment expenditures. The example, therefore, investigates empiri-

cally how to construct a "capital stock" for profit or rate of return

regressions. We find that the lag coefficients rise monotonically

over the first three periods and then remains fairly constant over the

next four or five. This differs significantly from lag structures

based on straight line or declining balance depreciation schemes (in

both of these the lag coefficients decline monotonically in T ).

When we compare the fit of the equations estimated from our models to

the fit of a system of regressions functions based on the usual capi-

tal stock constructs (net or gross), our equations do quite a bit

better. On the other hand, when we compare the restricted                  II matrix
                                                             —5—




implied        by our model to an unrestricted                                  II matrix, we find that we

can, using traditional testing procedures, reject the null hypothesis

embodied in our assumptions. It is doubtful whetherthe relationship

between profits and past investments is truly stable over different

firms and time periods.




II. DISTRIBUTED LAGS FROM PANEL DATA WITH PRIOR STRUCTURE ON THE
     x—PROCESS


          The distributed lag model which we assume is given by Al.

set of unknown finite parameters.

          Here (and in the discussion below) E*(z1 z) is the operator

which provides the minimum mean square error linear predictor (or the

regression function) of z1 given z2 .                                           Some preliminary comments on

Al are in order. For ease of exposition we have omitted time—specific

constant terms from it and from all equations to be introduced below.

Since we will be concerned with the limiting distribution of the para-

meter estimates in dimension N (holding T fixed), time—specific
                                          —6—


constant terms, if required, can be added without creating any addi-

tional estimation problems. Al does assume that the distributed lag

coefficients do not differ either over time             or   between individuals

(though random differences in these coefficients as defined for

example by Swairty, 1910, are covered by Al). Note, however, that the

model does allow for individual—specific constant terms (the a ).
                                                             1
This permits one to deal explicitly with the problem of unobserved

individual—specific components which are constant over time and affect

both the conditional distribution of .                given the x sequence
corresponding to individual i and the marginal distribution of x.

Given the a       ,   we are also assuming that u is not correlated
             1                                          it
with either the x's observed prior to, or those observed after,

period t   [i.e., E*(uj x, D) = o]              .    Since the models presented

here will, in general, be overidentified, one may, in any particular

example, wish to relax the assumptions of constancy of the lag para-

meters and E*(u. x., D.) = 0          •    These assumptions do, however, allow

for a relatively straightforward exposition of our results concerning

the estimation of lag structures in short panels.

    It is convenient to rewrite Al as

                              t+ 0
                 yit =a i +          w x

period t .       Let the matrix of coefficients obtained from the
regression function of y                         on x be           II     ,   defined   by

E*(y. x) = lix                      We ll say that a lag coefficient is identified

if it can be calculated from the elements of                                   II   .    Given    Al,

equation (1) makes it clear that each row of                                   II will contain a coni—

bination of the lag coefficients of interest and of the coefficients

from the regression functions of the two unobserved components,                                            a,


and b.          on        x     •    Our problem is, therefore, to separate out the

            ,
                          1
lag coefficients from the coefficients defining these two regression

functions.

     The distinction between a                        and b               is that a is constant
                                                  1              it                     1

over time while b                     is not. The estimation of models containing the
                               it
a    has been discussed extensively in the past (see Mundlak, 19T8, and
 1

the literature cited there) and therefore the particular difficulties

we shall encounter in identifying (at least some of) the lag coeffi-

cients from          TI       in our models arise from the existence of the trunca-


tion remainders (the b.                     ).    Since      b        =             w   x        ,   in   order
                                       it                     it                    t+T 1 —t

to identify any one of the lag coefficients one has to restrict either

the sequence of lag coefficients (the w ),                                    or    the relationship
                                                                   T

between presample x's and the observed data. This section deals

with the second alternative.



1. This will be shown to be equivalent to stating that a lag coef-

     ficient is identified if it can be calculated from the second

     order population nDments of r =                             (x,
                                                                  -1 y')
                                                                      i

11.1 The Identification Problem When There Is No Heterogeneity

      The phrase 'no heterogeneity' will be used to denote a situation

in which it is appropriate to assume that


A2:                 c = 0,              for i = 1,      ..., N



Since the basic ideas underlying our results are easier to grasp when

we nintain A2, and since the addition of the a does not change the

identification status of the lag coefficients in the models discussed

here, we begin with this special case.

      Given both Al and A2 the                     11 nRtrix (which, in this special case,
                     nh
we denote by        II

assume that the stochastic process generating the x sequences

restricts the regression of presample on insample x •                                      The particular

for          q> 1 ; that is in the regression of the unseen past x's on

x        only the first (the closest) p coefficients are non—zero.

         A sufficient condition for P3 is that the regression of the

T +      U   — p   most recent observations of x on their entire past

history depends only on their preceding p                                   values.'    This would

hold, for example, if the recent x's were a realization from a
    th
P            order autoregressive process. It would also be true for more

general processes such as an integrated autoregression (where the

order of the integration plus the order of the autoregression sum to

p ),      with     possibly changing coefficients over time.'

         Since each element of                    is just a different linear combination

of the same presample x's ,                   given P3, the B matrix in (2) will

(14) clarifies how one identifies the leading lag coefficients from           II




under assumptions Al to A3. Fach year's value of y is regressed on

current and all previous insaniple values of x •          The last p values

of x in each regression equation have non—zero partial correlations

with the truncation remainders (the b ).             Hence their coefficients
                                             it
do not identify the parameters of the lag         distribution.   The

t + U —   p   leading coefficients in each equation are, in fact, esti-

mates of the leading lag coefficients. As t increases, one gradu.-

ally uncovers the lag structure. Of course, if T + 0 is small rela-

tive to p ,    we will not be able to build up much information on the

tail of the lag distribution. This simply reflects the fact that

short panels, by their very nature, do not contain unconstrained

information on that tail. However, even when T + 0 is small, the

initial consistent estimates of the first few lag coefficients pri—

vided b (14) may    contain   enough information on the lag structure to

allow one to restrict it to be a member of a family of distributions

which depend on a small number of parameters and concentrate on esti-

mating those parameters thereafter. This gets slightly more compli-

cated when there is also heterogeneity, a topic which we turn to now.




11.2 Identification With Heterogeneity


    Recall that the reason for dealing explicitly with the x was to

allow for the possibility of unobserved individual—specific factors

which cause differences in both             given all the individual's past

x's    ,   and in x.              It follows that if there is heterogeneity, A3

is not likely to provide a good approximation to the regression func-

tion of presample on insaniple x •                    That is, if        y conditional     on all

past       x's has an individual—specific component, and the diverse unob-
served factors which lead to that component have an independent effect
on insaniple x's ,              then   these same factors are likely to have an inde-
pendent effect on presample x's •                     The simplest way to incorporate

this possibility into our framework is to allow the regression func-

tion of presample on insample x to depend directly on the a
                                                                                       I
That is, we would drop A2 of the last subsection (thus allowing for

heterogeneity) and replace A3 with the assumption



Ab: E*[x               x., D] = c a +                     p                       for q        i

Note that A4 does constrain the individual—specific differences in the

x process to be proportional to the a •                       Since this assumption may

different linear combinations of the presample x's .                                         If   w =     0     for

unobserved factor with free 'factor loadings' (the c                                         ). Since the

loadings is required and one which is consistent with the possibility

that the length of the lag is less than or equal to T + 0 is

11.3 Some Further Considerations: Estimation and Testing


           Having discussed the identification of the lag parameters under

alternative assumptions, we turn now to the consideration of some

issues associated with the choice of estimators and test statistics

for such models.

           In the context of panel data one is interested in the limiting

properties of estimators as N (the number of individuals) grows

large, and these depend on how the sample moments behave as the sample

grows in this dimension. Chamberlain (1982) provides an explicit

discussion of the properties of alternative estimators of II and of

relevant test statistics under the assumption that the N obser—

      ation to be imposed on one of the elements in              or in         in.

some niultivariate distribution with finite fourth order moments. Note

that neither this assumption, nor any of the assumptions made prior to

it, imply that E{y.             —   lix')

our assumptions (for a discussion of related points and alternative

stochastic assumptions, see, in addition, White, 1980, 1980a, 1980b,

and 1982). With these assumptions maximum likelihood (based on a nor-

mal density for r           )       or an asymptotically equivalent estimator of II
is (strongly) consistent and asymptotically normal but need not be

efficient, nor need its covariance matrix be given by the traditional

information matrix (see also MaCurdy, 1981). The point to note here

is that unless further assumptions on the covariance matrix of distur-

bances from the regression of                          on       x     are relevant, one must
                                               I

mum likelihood estimation procedures (Chamberlain, 1982, provides both

the appropriate formulae and more efficient estimators, under these

assumptions). Of course, if E{(. —

statistics are formed in the usual manner.

      Looking at the structure of the                         II matrices, it is clear that for

  >1,              can be obtained from a set of restrictions on                                    fi    fiSh

                              11                and

                                                        TI     from restrictions on H
                                                                                                     sh
                                        ,



There is, therefore, a nested sequence of restrictions that can be

used to decide between alternative models. In particular, if there

is no heterogeneity, then the elements of                           II =   I   11    1   ought to be
                                                                                tr
close to zero for r >          t   >        p —   0     (that is all leading x's for years

where t >     p   — 0    should have insignificant coefficients); and its

elements should have a "stationary structure" (should depend only on

t —   r)   for t >   r   >   p —    0       .   The test for a model with no hetero-

geneity involves, therefore, only equality and zero restrictions.



7. Note that our discussion is based on estimating the                                        II matrix

      rather than on estimating the form of the model containing either
                                    N             N
      or both of the sequences {. }.     and m. }.     (the system in

      only T (a small number) of sample points, one cannot estimate

      them consistently as N +                         and an attempt to do so would lead,

      in general, to inconsistent estimates of the other parameters of

      interest. That is, in our                   problem        a.ii=l

      constructing the density of y conditionals on x                                         ,   and the

This assumes that p is known at the outset. If this is not the case

then one can build a nested testing sequence for            p by starting with

p sufficiently large and testing the constraints on                   II arising from

lower values of p •          In   all cases the test of the null hypothesis

8. The choice of rejection criteria for such a sequence of tests is

    discussed in Geweke and Meese (1979). Their discussion is likely

    to be particularly relevant when p can take on a wide range of

    values (so that a long sequence of tests may be relevant). In our

    case, one is likely to have fairly narrow a priori bounds on p

III. Distributed Lags from Panel Data with Prior Structure on the Lag
      Coefficients


        As noted earlier in order to identify any of the lag coefficients

from panel data one must impose some structure on the relationship

between the truncation remainders and the observed data. The last sec-

tion discussed the possibility of restricting the relationship between

presample and insample x ; in this section we consider restricting the

lag coefficients themselves. The particular example we focus on is a

sequence of lag coefficients which, after a few free lags, has an auto—

        perties of alternative estimates of the lag coefficients (see

        also Pesaren, 1973).

      One further point is worthy of note. In this section we have not

restricted the relationship between presample and insample x in any

way, and as a result the    II matrix resulting from assumptions Al and

A5 are not, in general, nested inside the    II matrices of Section II.

If, however, in addition to A5 we assume A2 or AI of the last section,

then the    II matrices from the models in this section can be

simplified further (the additional restrictions are straightforward

special cases of the restrictions developed in Section II) and the

models presented here will be nested to those presented in the last

section. Thus, if either A2 or A14 were relevant, and the initial con-

sistent estimates of a free lag distribution obtained from the tech-

niques developed in the last section indicated that one of the simple

lag structures satisfying A5 seemed plausible, one could test and then

estimate this lag structure in a second round.




IV.    AN EXAMPLE: ESTIMATING THE SHAPE OF THE DEPRECIATION FIJNCTION



      A common empirical construct is the "stock of capital" based on

some variant of the perpetual inventory method. It is, in fact, a

distributed lag function of past investment expenditure with the

depreciation formula implying a set of lag weights (w's). These

weights are, usually, assumed a priori based on mortality assumptions

(straight line, geometric, etc.) and some scattered evidence on the

length of life of selected assets. Alternatively, one accepts the
                                 —27—


depreciation assumptions used by firms and reported in their annual

statements, even though they n.y be heavily affected by tax and other

accounting considerations that have little to do with the economic

measure of depreciation one is after. In general, there is no obvious

unique right way to construct "capitalt'; it all depends on the purpose

for which such a variable is to be constructed (Cf Griliches 1963, and

the articles in Usher, ed. 1980).

     One of the more common uses for capital is to compute and compare

"rates of return" across projects, firms, or industries. Such

measures assume implicitly that there exists a stable relationship

between earnings (gross or net profits) and past investments, and that

firms or industries differ only by a factor of proportionality in the

yield on their past investments, with the time shape of these yields

being the same across firms and implicit in the assumed depreciation

formula. In this section we investigate this question empirically,

using panel data and the methods developed in Section II to estimate

an   unconstrained distrubuted lag relationship between firm profits and
their past investments.
     The data come from the Compustat tape (1980). Profits are for the

years 1961i_72 inclusive (thus T = 9    )   and are defined to equal the

operating income of firms deflated by the implicit G.N.P. deflator

and an index of the average gross rate of return (1972 =      1.0)   taken

from Feldstein and Summers (1977, table 1, column 3, page 216). The

observed investment data are for the years 1961—71 (thus, assuming

that this year's investment does not effect this years profits, we

have two presample observations on investment). Investment is defined

to equal the reported gross investment of firms deflated by the impli—
                                      —28--



cit G.N.P. investment deflator. Firms were chosen from the tape if

there was no evidence of a major       merger,   acquisition, or sale of a

part of the firm during the sample period; and if all the required

variables for the firm were available. This yielded a sample (w)             of
258 firms)-'
      All   results   reported here are based on two simplifications.

First, after making an adjustment for heteroskedasticity, we shall

assume that the conditional (on x )           covariance matrix of distur—

bances from the regression of y on x does not vary over obser—
                                              1
vations.     This implies that maximum likelihood estimation procedures

provide consistent estimates of all parameters and their standard

errors, and maximum likelihood is used throughout. The adjustment

made for heteroskedasticity was to divide all figures for each firm by

the square root of the average rate of investment over the 1961—11

period as a whole. The second simplification to be used here concerns

the relationship between presaxnple and insample x .          Our results

focus on the model which allows for heterogeneity and, therefore,

assumption A4 will be used to describe this relationship. It will be

assumed that p in A4 equals three. This is based on a preliminary

examination of the observed x sequences (see note 8) which indicated

that a p of 2 or 3 would do.



13.    It also, no doubt, resulted in some selection bias. The esti-

       mates presented here do, however, allow for firm effects or

       heterogeneity, and this should take care of nost of the sample

       selectivity pr oblem.

       The Compustat tape for the years of interest contains more infor-

mation on the history of the firms x's than just the reported

investment series. It reports also the firm's gross (ks) and net

 (k'') capital stocks at the beginning of each year. These numbers are

essentially linear combinations of the firm's past investment expen-

ditures (including investments in years that we do not have in our

data). Net capital makes adjustments for reported depreciation

                                                 The availability of k allows us to

make comparisons between the results from the models based on the

         Table 1 summarizes the parameter estimates. Estimates of the

unconstrained       II matrix indicated that there was heterogeneity (see

p.18). Column (1) lists the estimated lag coefficients based on

allowing for a single source of heterogeneity (the model of assump-

tions Al and A4, or the      11 matrix in (6)) while column 2 adds

equation (11) to this system. The algorithm used to compute the maxi-

mum likelihood estimates of column (1) did not actually meet its con-

vergence criteria. It seemed that the data could not distinguish

effectively between alternative combinations of the vectors c and C

and the last few lag coefficients when using system (6); but conver-

gence was rapid once we added equation (ii). The resulting estimates,

listed in column (2), yield w through w8 which are all positive,

the first seven being estimated with a fair amount of precision. As

one should expect from the structure of the                II matrix, the standard

errors of the lag coefficients rise nnotonically in                      T .     While it is
clear that the lag coefficients increase until r = 3 ; w3 ,

            The estimated lag coefficients, then, rise over the first

three periods and remain fairly constant over the next four or five.

Note that this pattern is distinctly different from the pattern

implied by either straight line or declining balance depreciation.

Both of these imply coefficients which decline monotonically in                    t


and   in the second case the decline is greatest in the earlier periods.

the estimates of column (2) in Table 1 (which use Al and A4 of Section

II). The latter figure is still, however, 18 percent larger than the

trace of a ndel which allows for a free      II matrix (the trace of the

comparison model is lO! percent larger than the trace from the model

with the free matrix). The model with a free          II accounts for about 19

percent of the total variance in profits, the model based on Al and A4

accounts for about 75 percent of this variance, while the comparison

model accounts for about 57 percent of it.

    Coming back to the lag structure, recall that the estimates of

column (2) suggested that it rose over the first three periods and was

fairly flat over the next four or five, with perhaps a slight decline

in the last few coefficients estimated. A simple way to approximate

such a lag structure might, therefore, be to allow for three free lag

coefficients and then substitute either k               or k'          for

estimates of these ndels (the system estimated is constructed in a

manner analogous to the construction of the system for the comparison

model, see the discussion of system 10).      The estimated coefficients

in both these columns also rise over the initial three year period.

Thrning to columns (3) and (4) of Table 2, it is clear that the trace

of the estimated coveriance matrices of disturbances for the systems

which allow for these three free initial coefficients are much smaller

than the trace of the covariance matrix for the comparison model

(which does not). Their values are only 66 percent of the values of

the trace for the comparison model, but they are still over 15 percent

larger than the trace of the covariance matrix which uses the esti-

mates of column (2).

    So far we have compared the estimates from the model based on a

single source of heterogeneity and a set of free lag coefficients to a

model which uses capital stock figures from the Compustat tape, and,

in addition, shown that the model's estimates seem to be consistent

with the information from auxiliary calculations. Though the model

does well in these respects, it does not really provide a completely

adequate summary of the data. This becomes evident when we formally

test the restrictions on the   II matrix embodied in the system con—

sistirig of equations (6) and (ii). The observed value of the x/55

test statistic for the restrictions was 5.64 which indicates rejection

of the null hypothesis at traditional levels of significance.--' Thus

though the model underlying the estimates of column (2) seems to pro-

vide a better summary of the relationship between past investment and

current profits than conventional capital measures, none of these

models provide a really adequate account of the interaction between

profits and past investment expenditures. This model failure

reflects the basic implausibilities in the original maintained hypo-

thesis: (a) that the relationship between investment and profits is

essentially the same for different firms and industries and, (b) that



16. Though in judging this test statistic one should keep in mind the

     rather large size of our sample.

the time shape of the relationship (the depreciation pattern) is inde-

pendent of calander time, that the contribution of a particular

vintage of investment is independent of the circumstances and factor

prices that prevailed at the time it was purchased and from subsequent

changes in them. Nevertheless, what is clear is that the usual depre-

ciation schemes which assume that the contribution of past investments

declines rapidly and immediately with age are wrong. If anything

there nay be an "appreciation" in the early years as investments are

completed, shaken down, and adjusted to.
