                                             ABSTRACT

This paper shows that the effect of capital account liberalization on growth depends upon the
environment in which that policy occurs. A theoretical model demonstrates the possibility of an
inverted-U shaped relationship between the responsiveness of growth to capital account
liberalization and institutional quality. Three empirical specifications based on the model are
estimated using a panel of 71 countries. Estimates of all three specifications support the hypothesis
of a non-monotonic interaction between the responsiveness of growth to capital account
liberalization and institutional quality, with about one-quarter of the countries, those with better (but
not the best) institutions exhibiting a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect of
capital account openness on economic growth.

1. Introduction
       The positive experience of industrial countries that opened up to international

capital flows since the early 1980s, and the boom in emerging market economies during

the first half of the 1990s, bolstered the argument that an open capital account promotes

growth and development. But, in the wake of the economic and financial crises in

emerging markets in the latter part of the 1990s, critics questioned the wisdom of this

type of economic integration. These critics include well-respected mainstream

economists who strongly favor free trade in goods and services, but maintain that trade in

assets fundamentally differs from trade in “widgets.” For example, in an influential

article published in Foreign Affairs in 1998, Jagdish Bhagwati wrote “substantial gains

[from capital account liberalization] have been asserted, not demonstrated …” (p. 7). In a

similar vein, Dani Rodrik (1999) warned “Openness to international capital flows can be

especially dangerous if the appropriate controls, regulatory apparatus and macroeconomic

frameworks are not in place.” (p. 30). By the end of the decade, a report by the

International Monetary Fund (2000) stated that the Executive Board of that institution

“…has emphasized the substantial benefits of capital account liberalization, but stressed

the need to carefully manage and sequence liberalization in order to minimize risks.”

Reviewing this topic, Kenneth Rogoff, then the Chief Economist and Director of

Research for the IMF, wrote in the December 2002 issue of the IMF’s publication

Finance and Development “These days, everyone agrees that a more eclectic approach to

capital account liberalization is required.” (p. 55).

       A careful reading of the warnings advanced by Rodrik, the Executive Board of the

IMF, and Rogoff, however, does not suggest that open capital accounts cannot have a




                                               1
salutary effect; rather, they argue that the environment in which capital account

liberalization occurs is a potentially important determinant of its consequences. But the

conditions under which capital account liberalization contributes to economic growth are

not evident from previous published empirical research.

         Earlier empirical literature offers conflicting results concerning the effect of

capital account openness on growth.1 Quinn (1977), who includes an indicator of capital

account openness in a standard growth regression, provides the first evidence that an

open capital account promotes growth. Klein and Olivei (1999) show that an open

capital account is associated with greater financial depth and, through this channel, it can

promote growth. The results presented in Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti (1995), however,

show no effect of an open capital account on growth. Rodrik (1998) demonstrates that

capital account openness may only serve as a proxy for institutional quality and have no

independent significant effect in a growth regression. Edwards (2001) and Arteta,

Eichengreen, and Wyplosz (2003) investigate the effect of a linear interaction between

the capital account liberalization indicator and income per capita in cross-country growth

analysis, with the former finding a significant effect for higher income countries while

the latter, using somewhat different estimation techniques, finding no significant effects.

         The results presented in this paper help resolve the ambiguity of this earlier

empirical work since the empirical specification used here nests specifications in

previous research. This specification is based on a neoclassical growth model developed

in Section 2 that focuses on the manner in which institutional quality affects the impact of

                                               2
capital account liberalization on growth.2 Institutional quality, in this model, affects the

extent to which savings are protected from expropriation and it also affects the premium

borrowers pay for funds from abroad. The effect of institutional quality on the steady

state level of output differs when there is an open capital account as compared to when

there is autarky. The responsiveness of growth to capital account liberalization reflects

the relative values of these two steady states. Therefore, institutional quality affects this

responsiveness and, in particular, a key result is that it may vary in a non-monotonic

manner with institutional quality.

       This model provides a theoretical foundation for the analysis of the effect of

capital account liberalization on growth presented in Section 3. Consistent with this

model, the results presented in this section provide evidence of an inverted – U shaped

relationship between the effect of capital account liberalization on growth and

institutional quality. About one-quarter of the 71 countries in the sample, those with

better (but not the best) institutions exhibit a statistically significant and economically

meaningful effect of capital account openness on economic growth. This result is robust

to different specifications of the interaction between institutional quality and an indicator

of capital account openness. Thus, the results presented in this paper offer conditional

  In its focus on the interaction between the capital account and institutional quality, this
paper is related to other recent research. Castro, Clementi and MacDonald (2004)
develop a model in which the positive effects of investor protection on growth are
strongest for countries with more open capital accounts because access to international
capital holds interest rates steady even as better institutions increase the demand for
investment. They also present cross-country evidence consistent with this model. Along
another dimension, Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan and Volosovych (2003, 2005) present cross-
country evidence that capital inflows are significantly and positively affected by
institutional quality.

support for a policy of capital account liberalization, with the quality of domestic

institutions serving as an important determinant of whether integrating into the world

capital market delivers on the promise of more rapid economic growth.



2. Capital Account Liberalization, Institutional Quality, and Growth

       The model presented in this section illustrates how the effect of capital account

liberalization on the growth rate of a small open economy depends upon the quality of its

domestic institutions. Institutional quality in this model affects the extent to which

domestic savings translate into investment as well as the premium demanded by

foreigners when investing in the domestic economy. Section 2.1 presents a neoclassical

growth model of a small open economy with two types of capital under the conditions of

financial autarky whereby all capital is funded from domestic savings. An alternative

version of this model for a small open economy, one that includes partial capital mobility

(following Barro, Mankiw and Sala-i-Martin 1995) is presented in Section 2.2. Section

2.3 models capital account liberalization by drawing on the solutions for the autarkic and

partial capital mobility cases. The model shows that, for reasonable functions relating

institutional quality to expropriation and the risk premium, the responsiveness of growth

to capital account liberalization, while positive, may first increase, and then decrease,

with higher levels of institutional quality. As discussed in Section 3, the empirical results

support this inverted U-shaped relationship between the responsiveness of growth to

capital account liberalization and institutional quality.

2.1 Steady State Output and Growth under Financial Autarky

       The model used in this paper has two types of capital, K and H. The distinction

between these types of capital relates to whether they can serve as collateral when

borrowing from abroad.3 Thus, under financial autarky, the situation studied in this

subsection, there is little difference in the characteristics of K and H but, as discussed

below, an important difference exists between these two types of capital when

international borrowing and lending occurs.

       The production function for this economy includes K and H, as well as L, the

number of workers, and E, the efficiency of labor, and is given by

       [1]      Y = K α H β (EL)1−α − β

where Y is output, and both α and β are between 0 and 1. We study the model with the

variables expressed in terms of effective units of labor, and define y = Y / EL, k = K / EL

and h = H / EL. Using these variables, the production function is

       [2]      y = kα hβ

       The model attempts to capture the link between institutional quality and the

responsiveness of growth to capital account liberalization through the effect of

institutional quality on the return to savings. The parameter representing institutional

quality in this model is q (0 < q ≤ 1) with larger values of q indicating better institutions.

In this model, the quality of institutions affects the rate of expropriation of capital by


3
  Barro, Mankiw and Sala-i-Martin (1995) identify H as human capital, a natural
interpretation since expected future wages typically cannot serve as collateral. It is
reasonable, however, to broaden the definition of H to other types of capital as well. For
example, differential collateral requirements exist for foreign direct investment and
international portfolio investment, a point stressed by Froot and Stein (1991) in their
model of the link between the real exchange rate and foreign direct investment.

governmental or private actors who are not appropriately constrained by law, as captured

by the function x(q). This function represents the proportion of savings that contributes

to physical investment, with x'(q) > 0 and x(1) = 1. This function appears in the capital

accumulation equations for both K and H under autarky, when both types of capital can

only be accumulated through domestic savings, as shown in the two equations in [3], that

express capital accumulation in terms of k and h.

rate of depreciation of both types of capital.4

        The steady state value of output per effective unit of labor of this economy under

financial autarky, y *A , is

  In addition to q affecting the use of savings, the quality of institutions could also affect
the savings rate. In this case, we could posit the relationships s K (q ) and s H (q ) , where
 s K ' (q ) > 0 and s H ' (q ) > 0 . This would not change the qualitative effects of institutional
                                  d [s K (q ) x(q)]      d [s H (q ) x(q)]
quality in this model since                         > 0,                   > 0 . Also, it would be
                                         dq                     dq
straightforward to allow for different x(q) functions for the two types of capital.

Naturally enough, steady state output per effective unit of labor in autarky is higher with

a higher level of institutional quality (a higher value of q) because better institutions lead

to a higher proportion of savings being used for productive investment.

       Below we will compare the dynamic path of output per effective worker under

autarky and under partial capital mobility. A Taylor-series expansion around the steady

state yields the differential equation for output per effective unit of labor under autarky

2.2 Steady State Output and Growth with Partial Capital Mobility

       With no restrictions on its movement, and no cost of adjustment, capital would

move instantaneously to capital-scarce countries and equalize rates of return across

nations. A model with this feature would have no meaningful transition dynamics. The

results of such a model are obviously at odds with experience. A more reasonable result

is obtained if one assumes partial capital mobility, whereby there is perfect international

capital mobility for some types of capital but not for others. Barro, Mankiw and Sala-i-

Martin (1995) formalize this concept by assuming that physical capital, K, can serve as

collateral and, as such, can be fully funded by foreign borrowing while H cannot serve as

its own collateral. In an economy that is credit-constrained, H can only be accumulated

through domestic savings.5



5
 A country is credit-constrained if the overall value of its assets that can serve as
collateral, K, is less than or equal to the value of its debt, D, where D = (K + H) – A, and
A is the overall value of assets of an economy. In the model below, we assume that the
credit constraint is binding (else there would be no transition dynamics).



                                                  7
        When K can serve as collateral in international asset trade, the amount of physical

capital per effective worker, k, is determined by an equilibrium condition that sets the

marginal return of capital equal to its marginal cost. The marginal return of capital is the

marginal product of capital net of its rate of depreciation and net of expropriation.

Institutional quality affects the rate of expropriation and, therefore, the premium that

must be paid to foreign lenders. This premium is assumed to be a negative function of

institutional quality, v(q), where v'(q) < 0 and v(1) = ε where ε is a small premium

associated with international lending, even in the presence of no expropriation. The

arbitrage condition for k is, therefore,

                 ∂y
        [6]         − δ − v(q ) = rW
                 ∂k

where rW is the (exogenous) world interest rate. This equilibrium condition holds

regardless of whether or not a country is capital constrained. An analogous equilibrium

                                                                                           •
                                                                                         h
condition does not hold for h in a credit-constrained economy; rather, in this case, the
                                                                                         h

equation given in [3] determines its path of accumulation.

        The steady state levels of h and y in a credit-constrained economy are obtained by

using the equilibrium condition for k (Equation [6]) in the steady state, and the steady

state value of h consistent with the equation of motion for that variable in Equation [3].

The steady state level of output per effective unit of labor under this assumption of partial

capital mobility, yG* , is

                                                                1 / (1−α − β )

                      ⎝ (n + g + δ ) ⋅ (rW + δ + v(q ) )
                  G                 β                   α
                                                            ⎠




                                                  8
As in the case under autarky, steady state output per effective unit of labor is higher with

a higher level of institutional quality when there is partial capital mobility since x'(q) > 0

and v'(q) < 0. A distinction between the effect of institutional quality on the steady state

levels of output under partial capital mobility and under autarky arises because k is

financed through foreign lending in the former case while it is financed through domestic

savings in the latter, and institutional quality has different effects on these two sources of

financing investment.

       The differential equation that describes the dynamic path of an open economy is

                                    •

             1−α − β
where λ =            (n + g + δ ) . Comparing this result to the differential equation for an
              1−α

autarkic economy in equation [5], we see that the rate of convergence is more rapid for a

country with partial capital mobility than for a country that operates under financial

autarky (a point noted in Barro, Mankiw and Sala-i-Martin 1995).



2.3 Solutions and Empirical Specification

       The empirical specification of the effects of capital account liberalization on

growth, and the demonstration of how this effect depends upon institutional quality,

draws on the solutions to the differential equations for an economy under financial

autarky, [5], and for an economy with open capital markets, [8].6 These solutions,

 This use of the model to generate an empirical specification is similar to Mankiw,
Romer and Weil (1992) who develop an estimating equation from a standard Solow
growth model.

account at time F (where 0 ≤ F ≤ T). The indicator of capital account openness in this

model, κ, represents the proportion of years between year 0 and year T that a country has

an open capital account, and is defined as

                                                       T −F

Thus, 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1, with κ = 0 for a country that that is closed throughout the period and κ =

1 for a country that is open throughout the period.7 Assuming continuity in the path of

output between the time before and the time after the liberalization of the capital account,

the solution for the average rate of growth of output per effective unit of labor for an

economy that spends the first (1 – κ)T years with a closed capital account and the

remaining κT years with an open capital account is

  It is worth noting that κ, the proportion of years that a country has an open capital
account, directly corresponds to the standard indicator of capital account openness used
in empirical analyses, including the empirical analysis presented in Section 3 of this
paper. See Edison, Klein Ricci and Sløk (2004) for a discussion of the different
indicators of capital account openness used in empirical studies.

square brackets in the first line.8

           Variables included in the term S in [9] include those that represent the

determinants of the steady state of an economy that has an open capital account for the

proportion κ of the period T. In particular, κ, the proportion of time spent with an open

capital account, is one of these variables.9 A Taylor-series expansion of S around its

constituent variables gives us the linear specification

where Z is a row vector of variables other than κ that affect S, the coefficients on these

variables are the elements of the column vector B, and both γ and the elements of B are

obtained from the first-order Taylor series expansion of S. In the case of γ, the expansion

around κ = 0 gives us

  The parameter – (C/T) represents the coefficient on the initial income term in a growth
regression, and 0 < C < 1 (for example, C=0.32 when α=0.3, β=0.3, n=0.01, g=0.02,
δ=0.05, κ=0.5 and T=20). As noted above, this model suggests that the rate of conditional
convergence is more rapid for countries with more time spent with an open capital

account since, with reference to [9],     > 0 . However, the results presented in Section 3
                                      dκ
do not support a significant difference in conditional convergence associated with κ.

    Note that S = (1 − e − (1−α )λT )ln ( y *A ) when κ = 0, and S = (1 − e − λT )ln ( y G* ) when κ = 1.

The result in [10] shows that γ, representing the effect of a given value of κ on growth, is

bigger when steady state output with open capital markets, yG* , is large relative to steady

state output with closed capital markets, y *A , since κ reflects the proportion of time

during the period 0 to T with open capital markets.11

           Institutional quality affects γ through its effect on the steady state values of y *A

and yG* . More precisely, using the result in [10], we have

institutional quality has a relatively big effect on y *A as compared to its effect on yG* .

        Specification of particular functions of x(q) and v(q) enable us to explore further

the relationship between γ and q, and, in particular, to demonstrate that the model can

generate an inverted-U shaped relationship consistent with the empirical results presented

in the next section. Consider the functions

                                          x(q ) = X q −1
                [12]
                                          v(q ) = e −Vq

where the logarithm of the parameter X represents the semi-elasticity of the protection of

savings against expropriation with respect to the quality of institutions (X > 1) and the

parameter V represents the semi-elasticity of the real premium paid on foreign funds with

respect to institutional quality (V > 0). There is an inverted – U shaped relationship

between γ and q if there is some value of institutional quality q* between 0 and 1 such

             ∂γ         ∂ 2γ
that, at q*,    = 0 and      < 0 .13 For these functions, q* is
             ∂q         ∂q 2




                [13] q* =
                                                      {
                            1 ⎡ V − ln ( X ) × 1 − (α + β )e λ (1−α )(1−κ )T  }     ⎤
                             ln ⎢                                                   ⎥.
                                    {
                            V ⎣ 1 − (α + β )e               }
                                              λ (1−α )(1−κ )T
                                                              × ln( X ) × (rW + δ ) ⎦



13
    These functional forms meet the requirements outlined above that x'(q) > 0, v'(q) < 0,
x(1) = 1, and v(1) is small for appropriate values of V. Of course, the functions presented
here are not the only ones that can generate this inverted–U shaped relationship between
γ and q. A sufficient condition for q* to represent a maximum value is x"(q*) ≤ 0 and
v ′′(q*) × (rW + δ + v(q *)) > (v ′(q *)) 2 .



                                                 13
        The central point here is that, for a range of values of X and V, q* is positive and

less than 1. This is demonstrated in Table 1 in which q* is shown to have values between

0.469 and 0.702 when X equals 6, 10, or 14, and V equals 8, 10 or 12, and the value of the

other parameters are those used in earlier discussion. Thus, the largest effect of capital

account liberalization on growth occurs among countries with good, but not the best,

levels of institutional quality.14

        The non-monotonic relationship between γ and q is further illustrated by Figures

1a and 1b which trace out γ for values of q between 0.3 and 1.0. Figure 1a

presents this relationship for three different values of X (6, 10, and 14), given V = 10,

while Figure 1b shows how γ varies with q for three different values of V (8, 10, and 12)

when X = 10 (thus the middle line in each figure, representing V = 10 and X = 10, is the

same across the two figures).15 These figures show that γ, while consistently positive,

first increases, and then decreases, with q, reflecting the differential effects of q in the


14
   The result in [13] also shows that q* is decreasing in both X and V and that the savings
rates, sH and sK do not affect q*, although they do affect the maximum value of γ.
15
   The parameter values used to generate these figures are the same as those used up to
this point.



                                               14
two functions x(q) and v(q). The value of γ associated with q* is about 10 percent bigger

than its value when evaluated at q = 1 for the cases of V = 10 and X = 10, as well as for

the cases where V = 14 and X = 10 and V = 10 and X = 14. The value of γ evaluated at q*

is between 20 and 25 percent larger than its value at q = 0.3 for each of the three cases

depicted in Figure 1a, while, for the cases depicted in Figure 1b, the maximum value of γ,

relative to its value at q = 0.3, ranges from 10 percent larger (for V = 12) to 46 percent

larger (for V = 8).

        The results presented in Table 1 and Figures 1a and 1b suggest that there may be a

non-monotonic relationship between the responsiveness of growth to capital account

liberalization and institutional quality. These results are obtained through the use of

particular functional forms, but other reasonable specifications of x(q) and v(q) could also

generate an inverted-U shaped relationship between γ and q (see footnote 13). Different

functional forms for x(q) and v(q), however, can produce a monotonic relationship.

Ultimately, out interest is in the empirical relationship between γ and q. We next turn to

this question and show that, in fact, the data supports an inverted-U shaped relationship

between γ and q. Furthermore, the estimated values of γ presented in Section 3 are

similar to those generated in the model developed in this section.

       This section presents an empirical analysis of the manner in which the

responsiveness of economic growth to capital account openness depends upon an

indicator of institutional quality. This analysis considers the performance of 71 countries

over the twenty year period 1976 to 1995. The indicator of capital account openness for

country i, κi, is based on the data in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements

and Exchange Restrictions, and its value represents the proportion of the years between

1976 and 1995 that this publication reports that country i had an open capital account (0 ≤

κi ≤1). The indicator of institutional quality, Qi , represents, for country i, the average of

five series from the International Country Risk Guide, published by the PRS group, with

higher values for each of the five series representing better institutional quality.16

       We use these data, along with macroeconomic data, to estimate three

specifications that, in different ways, allow for a possible non-monotonic interaction

between institutional quality and capital account openness. These specifications are

presented in Section 3.1. The preferred specification includes interactions between κ, the

capital account openness indicator, and Q, Q2 and Q3.17 The estimates from this

16
  This empirical indicator of κi corresponds directly to the definition of κ in the model in
Section 2. The empirical indicator of institutional quality ranges from 2.45 to 7.22, with a
median value of 4.36. The data appendix provides details on these two indicators.
17
   The inclusion of the cubic term allows for greater flexibility then if the specification
only included the interaction terms κ ×Q and κ ×Q2 and, of course, the specification with
three interaction terms nests the specification with two interaction terms. These
interactions also effectively nest the Edwards (2001) and Arteta, Eichengreen, and
Wyplosz (2003) specifications that include a linear interaction between the capital
account openness indicator and initial income, since institutional quality is strongly
correlated with initial income per capita (see Klein (2003) and the discussion in Edison,
Klein, Ricci and Sløk (2004)). Also, by separately including Q, the specification
presented here nests the one used in Rodrik (1998).


                                              17
specification are of an inverted–U shaped relationship between the responsiveness of

economic growth to capital account openness and institutional quality. The two other

specifications presented in Section 3.1 also yield a similar non-monotonic relationship.

Furthermore, the estimated economic importance of open capital markets can be quite

pronounced for countries with an appropriate level of institutional quality.



3.1 Specifications

         An empirical specification that allows one to test for a non-monotonic

relationship between the responsiveness of growth to capital account openness and

institutional quality is

[14]

                                                                     (         )      (         )
∆ ln Y76−95,i = β1 ln Y76,i + β 2 Qi + β 3κ i + β 4 (κ i × Qi ) + β 5 κ i × Qi2 + β 6 κ i × Qi3 + β 7 Z i′ + ε i

where ∆lnY76-95,i is the change in the natural logarithm of real per capital income between

1976 and 1995 of country i, lnY76,i is the natural logarithm of real per capita income in

1976 for country i, κi is an indicator of capital account openness of country i, and Qi is

an indicator of institutional quality for country i.18 In this specification, γ, the

responsiveness of the steady state level of output to the indicator of capital account

openness, is

18
   The matrix Zi includes variables that are typical included in cross-country growth
regressions (and are included in the model in Section 2), such as the logarithm of the
secondary school enrollment rate (a proxy for E), the average rate of investment to GDP
over the years 1974 to 1978 (which, in the steady state, is related to the variables sH and
sK), and the growth rate of the population between 1976 and 1995 (the parameter n). As
is often the case in empirical investigations of growth, one of the columns of the matrix
Zi represents a dummy variable for African countries. The model suggests the
importance of including the world interest rate as a regressor, but, in a cross-section panel
regression, this variable, which is the same for all countries, is subsumed in the constant.


                                                        18
                                     γ = β 3 + (β 4 × Qi ) + (β 5 × Qi2 ) + (β 6 × Qi3 ) .

This specification nests a model in which the effect of capital account openness on

growth does not depend upon institutional quality (that is, a model in which β4 = 0, β5 =

0, and β6 = 0), a model in which γ varies in a linear fashion with institutional quality (in

which case β5 = 0 and β6 = 0), and a model in which γ varies in a quadratic fashion (a

model in which β6 = 0). A positive value for β5 and a negative value for β6 is consistent

with an inverted-U shaped relationship between γ and Qi.

          Another hypothesis from the model presented in Section 2 is that the rate of

convergence depends upon the proportion of years a country had an open capital account.

We test this hypothesis by augmenting specification [14] with a variable that represents

the interaction of initial income and capital account openness, as shown in

[15]

                                                                                            (          )      (         )
∆ ln Y76−95,i = β1 ln Y76,i + β C (ln Y76,i × κ i ) + β 2 Qi + β 3κ i + β 4 (κ i × Qi ) + β 5 κ i × Qi2 + β 6 κ i × Qi3 + β 7 Z i′ + ε i



The rate of conditional convergence for country i is β1 + (β C × κ i ) . The model presented

in Section 2 predicts that a longer period with an open capital account contributes to a

faster rate of conditional convergence. A test of this hypothesis is whether βC is

significant and negative.19

19
  The partial derivative of growth with respect to capital account openness in [15] is
                    γ = (β C × ln Y76,i ) + β 3 + (β 4 × Qi ) + (β 5 × Qi2 ) + (β 6 × Qi3 ).
Initial income is significantly correlated with institutional quality, so we use the
estimated values from the regression
                                       ln Y76,i = π 0 + π 1Qi + u i ,
the results of which are reported in Table 3, to calculate the estimated value of γ from
specification [15] as
                 γ = (β C × (πˆ 0 + πˆ1Qi ) ) + β 3 + (β 4 × Qi ) + (β 5 × Qi2 ) + (β 6 × Qi3 ).



                                                               19
         While the empirical specification [14] is flexible, since it nests a range of possible

interactions between γ and Q, in the interest of robustness the empirical results also

include two other specifications that allow for an interaction between capital account

openness and institutional quality. One specification replaces the interaction terms in

[14] with a quadratic spline,

[16]

∆ ln Y76−95,i = β1 ln Y76,i + β 2 Qi + β 3κ i + ω1κ i (Qi − QMIN ) 2 + ω 2 M iκ i (Qi − Qˆ KNOT ) 2 + β 7 Z i′ + ε i

where Q̂KNOT is the estimated knot of the spline, Mi is a dummy variable that equals 0 for

values of Qi ≤ Qˆ KNOT and otherwise equals 1, and QMIN is the minimum value of

institutional quality in the sample. In this specification, the responsiveness of growth to

capital account liberalization is

                          γ SPLINE = β 3 + ω1 (Qi − QMIN ) 2 + ω 2 M i (Qi − Qˆ KNOT ) 2

Equation [16] is estimated through non-linear techniques that allow for the joint

estimation of the β and ω coefficients as well as Q̂KNOT (which determines Mi).

         A third specification, one that is even less restrictive in its parameterization,

estimates different coefficients for the effect of capital account liberalization on growth

for each quintile of institutional quality, as shown by

                                                                    5
                    [17] ∆ ln Y76−95,i = β1 ln Y76,i + β 2 Qi + ∑ α j D j κ i + β 7 Z i′ + ε i
                                                                   j =1



where Di represents a dummy variable that equals 1 if country i is in the jth quintile for

institutional quality, and is otherwise equal to zero. The value and pattern of significance

of the estimates of the five α j coefficients can be used to confirm the results derived




                                                        20
from specifications [14] and [16] as to whether, in fact, the effect of capital account

openness on economic growth varies systematically with institutional quality.



3.2 Capital Account Openness, Institutional Quality and Growth

        This section presents estimation results in several ways. The estimated

coefficients from regressions along with their standard errors are presented in Table 2.

The OLS estimate of [14], the OLS estimate of [15], the IV estimate of [14], the non-

linear least squares estimate of [16], and the estimate of [17] that includes the indicator of

capital account openness, κi, interacted with the institutional quality quintile dummy

variables are reported in Columns 1 – 5, respectively.

        The results in Columns 1 – 4, however, do not provide a transparent answer to the

central question of this paper, how the responsiveness of growth to capital account

openness varies with institutional quality. Therefore, the lower panel of Table 2 also

includes, for Columns 1 – 4, estimates of γ calculated for the 10th, 30th, median, 70th and

90th percentile values of Qi.20 This table also reports the number of countries that have

values of Qi such that the estimated value of γ is significant, and the percentiles spanned

by this set of countries.

        An even more clear representation of the results in Columns 1 – 5 is provided in

Figures 2 – 6, respectively. Each of these figures plots, for one of the specifications

reported in Table 2, the estimated value of γ (in a line in which filled circles represent


20
  The lower part of Column 5 presents the coefficients on the interaction of κi with the
quintile dummy variables, where the percentile listed in the left column represents the
midpoint of that quintile (i.e., the row labeled “10th Percentile” presents the coefficient
for κi for the first quintile, the row labeled “30th Percentile” presents the coefficient for κi
for the second quintile, and so on).



                                               21
estimates of γi for actual values of Qi), along with the associated 95 percent confidence

intervals (dashed lines). Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 also include plots of γ as estimated in

Column 1 (as diamonds unconnected by a line) for purposes of comparing results across

specifications and estimation methods. Figures 2 – 5 also include a vertical line drawn at

the smallest value of Qi at which γ is significant at the 95 percent level of confidence, and

another vertical line drawn at the largest value of Qi at which γ is significant at the 95

percent level of confidence.

        The OLS estimate of Specification [14], reported in Column 1 of Table 2, and

represented in Figure 2, shows that capital account openness is a significant determinant

of growth over the period 1976 to 1995 for a set of countries with above-median levels of

institutional quality. The coefficient on κi itself, as well as the coefficient on each of the

three interaction terms, κi × Qi, κi × Qi2, and κi × Qi3, are significant at better than the 95

percent level of confidence. This suggests that a cubic interaction between κi and Qi, as

opposed to no interaction, a linear interaction, or a quadratic interaction, is warranted.

The lower panel of Table 2 shows that, with this specification and estimation method, 17

of the 71 countries in the sample (23.9 percent of the countries) have a value of γ that is

significant. The set of countries represents those with institutional quality ranging from

the 55th percentile (Mexico) to the 79th percentile (Ireland).

        The quantitative effect of having an open capital account is economically

meaningful, as well as statistically significant, for countries with institutional quality

between that of Mexico and Ireland. For example, consider two hypothetical countries

that are similar along all relevant dimensions, including initial income and their

institutional quality. The strongest support for the opening sentence of this paragraph can

be made by assuming that Q equals 5.75 for both of these economies (the level of

institutional quality for Korea) since γ reaches a maximum value of 0.67 at this level of

Q. If one of these countries maintained capital controls throughout the sample period

while the other kept an open capital account, the estimated annual average growth rate of

the open economy would be 3.35 percentage points greater than that of the closed

economy, and the open economy would be 95 percent bigger than the closed economy

after two decades. Of course, this is the maximum difference that is obtained with these

estimates. But differences are notable with other assumed values of κi and Qi as well.

For example, at Q = 4.64, a level of institutional quality just below that of Mexico, the

point of the lower 95 percent confidence bound in the estimate with constant

convergence, the estimated value of γ is 0.357. This suggests a difference of 1.79

percentage points in annual growth between a fully closed and a fully open economy, and

a difference of 43 percent in per capita income after two decades. Even comparing two

economies for which Q = 4.64, with one that is closed and one that is open only during

the second half of the sample, there is a difference of 0.893 percentage points in the

annual growth rate, a difference that would result in a difference of 20 percent between

the continually closed and periodically open economy after two decades.21

       While these results strongly support one prediction of the model presented in

Section 2, another prediction, that an open economy experiences more rapid conditional

convergence than a closed economy, is not consistent with the empirical results. Column


21
   These values of γ are broadly consistent with those presented in the theoretical model
since the estimates of γ in the theoretical model represent effects on average annual
growth and, consequently, the values of γ from the theoretical model must be multiplied
by 20 to be compared them to the estimates of γ presented here. For example, the value of

2 presents the estimates from Specification [15] that allows for the possibility of varying

conditional convergence through the inclusion of the interaction between initial income

and the indicator of capital account openness. As predicted by the theory, the estimated

value of this interaction term is negative, but it is not significant (the p-value is 0.57).22

        The estimated γ obtained with varying conditional convergence is almost identical

to the γ obtained under the assumption of constant conditional convergence.23 In Figure

3, the estimates of γ for varying conditional convergence (represented by the line with the

filled circles on it) and under the assumption of constant conditional convergence

(represented by the unconnected diamonds) track each other very closely. In fact, as

shown in the lower panels of Columns 1 and 2 in Table 2, the set of countries with a

significant value of γ for the varying conditional convergence estimate is the same as that

for the constant conditional convergence estimate. Therefore, because of the lack of

support for varying conditional convergence, and the similarity of results concerning how

γ varies with Q across these two specifications, all further results presented here consider

only the case of constant conditional convergence.

        Column 3 of Table 2 presents instrumental variable estimates of Specification

[14], and Figures 4 plots the associated estimate of γ, along with its 95 percent

confidence interval. The instruments used in these estimates include κi for the period

1970 to 1974, similarly constructed indicators of current account openness, a multiple

exchange rate regime, and surrender of export proceeds, the average of trade divided by


22
  Sachs and Warner (1995) argue that unconditional convergence is more rapid in open
economies, although their definition of openness differs from the one used here.
23
  The estimates from a specification with a varying rate of convergence employ the
results of the regression of Qi on lnY76,i reported in Panel B of Table A.2 (cf. fn. 19).

well as the for interactions of κi with institutional quality.24

          The lower panel of Columns 3 shows that fewer countries have a significant

estimated value of γ with IV estimates than with OLS estimates, a result partially due to

the smaller sample available for the IV estimates, but also one typically found when

comparing IV to OLS estimates. Figure 4 also shows, however, that over the range of

values of Qi for which γ is significant in the IV estimates, or even over the larger range of

values of Qi for which γ is significant in the OLS estimates, the IV and OLS estimates of

γ track each other closely.

          The fourth column of Table 2 presents the estimates of Specification [16] which

includes a quadratic spline, with the knot of the spline estimated simultaneously with the

coefficients of the regression using nonlinear least squares. The lower panel of this

column shows that 9 countries, those with institutional quality between the 62nd and 73rd

percentiles, have significant estimated effects of capital account openness on growth.

The size of the estimated effect for the 70th percentile is only about 16 percent different

than the effect for the country at that same percentile using Specification [14].

          The similarity between the estimated effects of institutional quality on the

responsiveness of economic growth to capital account openness in the spline and cubic

interaction specifications is shown more fully in Figure 5. The plot of γ estimated with a

also includes the upper and lower 95 percent confidence intervals for γ, as well as the

lower 95 percent confidence interval for γ if the estimated value of the knot, 5.218, is

treated as a known parameter rather than an estimate. This latter confidence interval

gives a much wider range of significant values of γ (even though the p-value for the

estimate of the knot is less than 0.001), as shown by the dashed vertical lines, with 23 of

the 71 countries having estimates of γ that are significant at better than the 95 percent

level of confidence when the value of the knot is treated as a parameter of the model.

       The final column in Table 2 presents the estimates of Specification [17] in which

κi is interacted with a set of dummy variables representing the quintiles of institutional

quality. The results in this column show that the coefficient on κi is only significant for

the 4th quintile, that is, from the 60th percentile to the 80th percentile. This corresponds

closely to the more parameterized results presented in Columns 1 and 2, where significant

values of γ are obtained for countries between the 55th and 79th percentiles. Also, the

estimated value of γ of 0.572 for the 4th quintile is within the range of significant values

of γ from the estimates in Columns 1 and 2 of 0.357 to 0.670.

       The close correspondence between the estimates of γ from Specification [14] and

Specification [17] is also demonstrated by Figure 6. This figure shows that the 4th

quintile, for which institutional quality ranges form 4.81 to 6.67, is the only one in which

the confidence interval for γ does not overlap zero. In this range, the estimated values of

γ from Specification [14], represented by the unconnected diamonds, closely correspond

to the estimate from Specification [17]. Thus, the overall result for the effect of




                                              29
institutional quality on the responsiveness of growth to capital account openness is robust

to results from this different estimation technique.

4. Conclusion

        The debate over the consequences of capital account liberalization tends to be

painted in broad strokes of black and white. This paper suggests a more nuanced

approach, one that allows for shades of gray.

        The model in this paper presents a logical framework demonstrating that the

effect of capital account liberalization on economic growth varies with institutional

quality. Estimates from several empirical specifications consistent with this model

suggest that an open capital account can make a statistically significant and economically

meaningful contribution to economic growth. But, as predicted by the theory presented

earlier in the paper, this estimated effect varies with institutional quality. In particular,

the effect of capital account openness on growth is found to be statistically significant for

about one–quarter of the countries in the sample, and these countries tend to be ones with

better (though not the best) institutions. There is a strong correlation between

institutional quality and income per capita, and the countries that tend to benefit

significantly from capital account liberalization are mostly upper-middle-income

countries.

        At a policy level, the results presented in this paper answer, to some extent, the

critics of capital account liberalization who assert that its benefits have not been

demonstrated. But the model and empirical results presented here do not offer an

unqualified endorsement of capital account liberalization either. Instead, the main

message of this paper is that the environment in which this policy takes place can have an

important effect on its consequences.

     Indicators of Capital Account Openness and Institutional Quality

       In this data appendix we discuss the indicators of capital account openness and

institutional quality used in the regressions.

A.1 Indicator of Capital Account Openness

       The theoretical model presented in Section 2 includes the parameter κ that

represents the proportion of years that a country had a continuously open capital account.

For the empirical analysis in this paper, we construct the indicator of capital account

openness κi that represents the proportion of years between 1976 and 1995 that country i

is recorded a country as having an open capital account by the Annual Report on

Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), a publication of the

International Monetary Fund.25 This indicator has been used in other empirical studies

of the effects of capital account openness on growth, including Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti

(1995), Rodrik (1998) and Klein and Olivei (1999).26




25
  Every issue of the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions published between 1967 (which refers to conditions in 1966) and 1996
(which refers to conditions in 1995) includes a summary table in which row E.2, labeled
“Restrictions on payments for capital transactions,” addresses the presence or absence of
capital controls. The 1997 issue of Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and
Exchange Restrictions expanded the summary information on capital controls including,
for the first time, a distinction between restrictions on inflows and restrictions on
outflows. Unfortunately, this new classification system cannot be mapped into the early
system, making the use of a panel bridging the pre-1996 and post-1996 data problematic.
26
  An alternative empirical indicator of capital account openness developed by Dennis
Quinn (1997) attempts to record the intensity of controls. Quinn’s indicators are only
available for a limited set of years for non-industrial countries. Edison, Klein, Sløk and
Ricci (2004) compare κi to Quinn’s indicators



                                                 32
          Table A.1 presents some statistics and information on κi. The IMF publication

records that about half of the countries in the data set (36 of the 71 countries for which

we have full data) had closed capital accounts throughout this period. Among the 35

countries that had some experience with open capital accounts (a set that includes all 17

industrial countries in the sample), 6 were recorded as having had open capital accounts

each year from 1976 to 1995; the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada,

Malaysia and Hong Kong.

          As defined here, κi does not distinguish between a one-time liberalization and an

on-again, off-again pattern of capital account restrictions. Fortunately, in the large

majority of observations in the data set, κi corresponds directly to κ in the theoretical

model, that is, it reflects an early period with capital account restrictions and, if nonzero,

a later period with an open capital account. For the 29 countries where κi did not equal 0

or 1, the governments of 20 of them (all 14 industrial countries and 6 of the 15 non-

industrial countries that had a value of κi greater than 0 but less than 1) did not close the

capital accounts once it was opened.27

A.2 Indicator of Institutional Quality

          A variety of indicators of institutional quality have been used in empirical

research. The composite indicator used in this paper, Qi, represents, for country i, the

1984 to 1995 average of five series from the data set constructed by Steve Knack and

Philip Keefer of the IRIS Center at the University of Maryland; Bureaucratic Quality,

Control of Corruption in Government, Risk of Expropriation, Repudiation of Government

Contracts, and Rule of Law (Law and Order Tradition). These series are based on data

from the International Country Risk Guide, published by the PRS Group. 28 A higher

value for any of the indicators represents a higher quality of an institution so, for

example, a higher score for Repudiation of Government Contracts means less of a risk of

repudiation and a higher score for Risk of Expropriation means a smaller risk.

          Table A.2 presents some statistics for Qi. Panel A shows the minimum and

maximum values, as well as the values for the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th and 90th percentiles, for

the 71 observations in the sample. The regression of the logarithm of income per capita

in 1976 on Qi , presented in Panel B, shows a highly significant link between the

logarithm of initial income per capita and institutional quality.29 The results in Panel C

show that there is a very high correlation between all five components of the overall

indicator of institutional quality. This high correlation explains why the results of the

estimates presented below are largely unchanged if any single component is used rather

than the average of all five, as well as if a different weighting scheme is used to calculate

the overall indicator of institutional quality.

     As mentioned in footnote 15, this estimate is used to evaluate γ in specification [15].
