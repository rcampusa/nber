                                          ABSTRACT




    This paper utilizes a survey of the US manufacturing firms from 1832 to
investigate the structure of manufacturing investment during early industria1
ization. Although        several manufacturing industries, such     as    cotton textiles,

depart   from the pattern, most appear to have       devoted   the hulk   their
                                                                           of

investments    to working capitaL This variation across         industries in the
composition    of capital investments     is indicative of a more general         variation

in factor intensities, and bears on the issues of        why industries became
concentrated    in the   regions they   did, and the degrees to which they         were
adversely   affected by the limited availability of longtenn loans                 Evidence
that most manufacturing industries had quite modest investments in machinery

and tools per unit of labor is also presented, servIng to undercut the notion

that the early period of industrialization was based on a proliferation of

new, machinery-intensive technologies

     Economic historians have long been concerned with the absolute and

relative amounts of investment by manufacturers in fixed and working capital

during the early stages of industrialization. The question that has, perhaps,

most directly attracted them to the subject has been how closely industrial

development was related to the introduction of sophisticated machinery   and
production processes that were highly intensive in fixed capital. It has also

been argued, however, that the division of investment between fixed and

working (or circulating) capital has an important bearing on the issue of the

extent to which industrial expansion might have been impeded by the

organization of financial markets.' Pollard, in particular, suggested that

the bulk of investment in early manufacturing took the form of circulating

capital, and that the growth of this sector was accordingly not substantially

hindered by limited access to sources of long—term credit.2 In his view,

merchants and other traditional suppliers of short—term credit could finance

the working capital, which was relatively liquid and turned over rapidly,

leaving only a modest share of manufacturing investment to be raised through

equity and long—term loans,

    Most scholars who have studied the division of investment in

manufacturing between fixed and working capital have had to rely predominantly

on the individual records of firms. Although such bodies of evidence are rich

and detailed, the cost of retrieving them is high, and has restricted investi-

gators to the experiences of a relatively small number of establishments. A

recently collected sample from the 1832 McLane Report, however, contains

information for a large cross—section of northeastern firms on the composition

of their capital investments,3 The U.S. Treasury Department survey of manu-

factures, from which these data were drawn, was marred by several defects,

such as variation across geographic areas in the quality of coverage and the
                                      2




format of the questionnaire administered. Nevertheless, the 1194 firms

included in the sample encompass a broad spectrum of manufacturing industries,

establishment sizes, and locations. Careful analysis of this body of evidence

can yield much insight into the operations of manufacturing firms and

financial markets during the initial phase of industrialization in the U.S.

     One of the problems associated with employing the McLane Report data is

that the categories used by enumerators to decompose investment do not always

conform to modern concepts of what constitutes fixed and working capital, and

their various subeomponents. An already alluded to diffIculty of this sort is

that firms in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and the Middle Atlantic states were

surveyed with a different questionnaire than were those in Massachusetts,

Maine, Vermont, and Connecticut. Establishments from the former set of states

(henceforth referred to as Group I) decomposed their capital investments into

two components, "capital invested in ground and buildings, and water power,

and in machinery" and the "average amount in materials, and in cash for the

purchase of materials, and payment of wages." Those from the latter areas

(Group II) distinguished between the "value of real estate, buildings, and

fixtures, occupied and used for the business," the "value of tools, machinery,

and apparatus other than the fixtures," and the "value of average stock on

hand, and in the process of manufacture." Thus, all enumerators for the 1832

survey appear to have been operating with similar instructions as to what

sorts of fixed assets should be classified together, although those working

with Group II firms provided more detail by dividing such assets into two

classes. Their understanding of fixed capital resembles the modern one, and

evidence seems to support the view that their measure of the former was a good

approximation of the latter.4
                                         3



     As for the treatment of working capital, enumerators appear to have only

surveyed firms on the value of their inventories, and omitted the other major

component of this type of capital, accounts receivable or the credit extended

to customers.5 Fortunately, additional information reported by most of the

Group II establishments surveyed allows this important component of working

capital to be estimated at the firm level. About 300 establishments revealed

the proportions of their output sold for cash, for credit, or for barter, and

if for credit, at what average term. By fitting regressions with the propor—

tion of output sold on credit arid the average term of credit as the dependent

variables over the data for the reporting firms, predicted values of the

variables were generated for the other observations. Under the assumption

that the manufacturing establishments had been maintaining constant levels of

output and credit extension, firm—level estimates of the average accounts

receivable were computed from the following expression:

                   AR =   (PC-Q)(T/12)
where AR is accounts receivable, PC is the proportion of output sold on

credit, Q is the value of annual output, and T is the average term (in

months) of the credit extended. Given that the levels of production and sales

are likely to have varied seasonally, the average accounts receivable

estimated by this procedure, as well as the average level of inventories

reported by firms, may be significantly different from the actual monthly

investments made in these components of working capital. Whether, and how,

this variation around the mean should influence the interpretation of the

quantitative results is unclear, and remains to be determined. Seasonality

might also affect the estimated patterns by encouraging investment in working

capital, relative to that in fixed capital.

     The percentages of the total investment accounted for by the various

categories of capital have been calculated for selected industries from the

1832 sample, and are presented, by group, in Table 1. Also reported for the

Group II establishments are estimates of the total capital investment per

equivalent worker and of the investment in tools and machinery per equivalent

worker. The results suggest that working capital attracted a substantial

share of the investments made by manufacturing firms. When credit extended to

customers (accounts receivable) is included in the estimate of the total

capital investment, the working capital share ranges between 40.6 and 65.6

percent across the six Group I industries, and between 37.6 and 88.7 percent

across the eight in Group 11.6 The significance of these figures is

buttressed by the recognition that the relative importance of working capital

would be understated if some finns reported the gross value of their capital

stock, rather than the net value.

     One of the most interesting features of these estimates is the

covariation across industries of the working capital share with the level of

total capital per unit of labor. The three most capital—intensive industries,

such as cotton textiles, wool textiles, and paper, have relatively low working

capital shares, between 37.6 and 53.3 percent among the Group II firms. Work-

ing capital accounts for higher proportions of the total investment in the

other industries, between 53.6 and 88.7 percent among the same group of

establishments. The sizes of individual establishments also vary between the

two classes of industries, with the average plants in the more capital—

intensive industries (especially textiles) being much larger than those from

the latter group.7 Thus, the evidence seems to favor distinguishing between

manufacturing industries with respect to their demand for long—term capital.

Firms in highly capital—intensive industries such as textiles are likely to

Notes and Sources:

     These estimates are weighted averages computed over all of the firms in

the 1832 sample that supplied the relevant information, with the exceptions of

firms that reported no investment in structures and land, no investment in

machinery and tools (a requirement which excludes a number of putting—out

enterprises in shoes), or operating fewer than seven months a year. The

principal criteria for including industries in this table were a sufficient

number of observations and a relatively homogeneous set of outputs. The

industries are ordered by the value of machinery and tools per equivalent

worker. The number of equivalent workers is equal to the sum of the number of

adult male employees, four—tenths times the number of female and child

employees, and 1 (representing the entrepreneur's labor input). The figures

within parentheses represent the numbers of observations of Group I and Group

II firms over which the estimates on the respective lines were computed. The

numbers of observations differ between those estimates computed with and those

without credit, because some firms did not report the value of their output.

The estimated values of the proportion of output sold on credit and the

average term of credit were computed from regressions fitted over those

observations that reported on these variables. Included as independent

variables in these regressions were the log of the number of employees and

industry dummy variables.

have had greater relative, and much greater absolute, demands for long—term

funds than their counterparts in other industries, because on average a

greater share of their investment went to fixed capital, more investment

capital was utilized for each unit of their labor, and more units of labor

were employed by them. Pollard's claim that manufacturers during early

industrialization were less dependent on supplies of long—term capital than

has generally been recognized might apply in the U.S. case to textiles. It

seems, however, to more accurately characterize other industries.

     Another implication of the data on Group 11 firms is that, with the

exception of cotton textiles, the capital invested in machinery and tools

amounted to only a small fraction of the total investment.8 In all other

industries, the value of the buildings, land, and fixtures far outweighed that

of machinery and tools. Although machinery and tools attracted nearly 30

percent of the capital invested by the cotton textile establishments, one

cannot fail to be impressed by the relative insignificance of this category of

investment when the second—most mechanized industry, wool textiles, barely

manages a 14 percent share. The industry—specific estimates of the value of

machinery and tools per equivalent worker lend further support to this

judgment. The figure for cotton textiles is $656.4, more than twice as large

as that for wool textiles, and more than ten times the figures for coaches!

harnesses, tanning, hats, furniture/woodwork, and shoes. All of the latter

average less than $50 of machinery and tools per equivalent worker.

     Although the industry averages reported in Table 1 are quite informative,

they don't provide insight into how the composition of investment capital

varied with firm characteristics such as size and location. Hence, the

implications drawn from them might not apply to all classes of establishments

within the industries in question. Regressions with the various components of
                                       7




the total investment (here treated as the sum of fixed capital and

inventories) per unit of labor, and the proportions of the investment

accounted for by those components, as the dependent variables were accordingly

estimated over the Group II firms, and are presented in Table 2. The first

four regressions suggest that the total capital investment, and each of its

major subcomponents, increased relative to the labor input with the firm scale

of production in all manufacturing industries examined except shoes. Perhaps

more surprising is that, in industries other than textiles, the share of the

capital investment allocated to fixed capital decreased with establishment

size, as did the amount of investment in machinery and tools relative to that

in inventories. The fixed capital share of a firm's investment also decreased

with the degree of urbanization in the county in which the firm was located.

Thus, in most industries, the larger firms employed greater amounts of fixed

capital per unit of labor than their smaller competitors, but they were even

more extensive users, both relatively and absolutely, of inventories and

working capital in general.'°

     These regressions appear to support and extend the interpretations drawn

from the industry—specific averages. Not only were the proportions of the

firm investments in inventories quite large in industries other than textiles,

but they were especially so in the larger firms whose development has often

been linked to industrialization. What explains this observed relationship

between the composition of the capital investment and the size of firms?

There are a number of hypotheses but the evidence does not allow us to clearly

distinguish between them. One possibility is that larger firms enjoyed, on

average, lower—cost access to short—term credit than did small establishments,

and were therefore led to invest relatively more in working capital. They

might have attracted more favorable terms by trading with merchants who

Notes and Sources

     These regressions were estimated over all of the Group II firms in the

1832 sample that supplied the relevant information, with the exceptions of

firms that reported no investment in structures and land, no investment in

machinery and tools, or operating fewer than seven months a year. The

t—statistics appear within parentheses below the corresponding regression

coefficients. The "urbanization rate" variable is defined for the county in

which the firm was located as the proportion of the population in 1830 that

resided in cities of 2500 or more people. The "part—tii dummy" is set equal

to 0 for those firms that reported operating at least 11 months a year. The

dummy is set to 1 for all other firms. Since many establishments failed to

indicate what portion of the year they operated, this variable seems likely to

suffer from a significant measurement error.
                                           9



supplied funds to their regular contacts, being easier to monitor, or being

less risky borrowers. Another theory is that larger firms had a relatively

greater demand for working capital, perhaps because they were more risk averse

about running out of inventories and being compelled to shut down, or found it

advantageous to hold larger stocks of inventories and offer more credit when

dealing in greater quantities and with more distant customers.

     A third response to the statistical finding might be to label it an

artifact. Since manufacturing establishments don't always operate at full

capacity, and working capital is more directly related to current output

levels than fixed capital, one would generally expect to observe some positive

correlation between the current output of firms and their ratio of working to

fixed capital. This effect does not seem to provide an adequate explanation

of the regression results, however, because the labor input is also closely

linked to current output, and thus the same logic would predict an increase in

the ratio of labor to fixed capital with firm size, rather than the estimated

decrease.

     A final piece of evidence that bears on the issues of whether and why the

working capital increased with firm size is provided by firm data on the

extension of credit. Regressions were estimated with the proportion of output

sold on credit as the dependent variable. One of these is presented below

without the industry dummies, which were jointly insignificant.

                   Proportion of Output Sold on Credit =

                        Intercept                  0,778 (5.49)

                        Log (#   of   employees)   0.012 (O.3l)

                        Urbanization Rate          0.569 (—1.92)

                        Proportion of

                             Output Sold Locally — 0.252 (—344)

                        Interaction between

                             Urbanization and

                             Log (#   of    employees) 0.199 (2.38)

                   N = 224                                  =   0.325

     This regression conforms well with the view that the utilization of

working capital grew disproportionately with the size of firm, and lends some

support to each of the hypotheses concerned with that pattern. The negative

coefficient on the proportion of output sold locally may indicate that as

firms expanded to serve broader markets, they were driven to extend more

credit (demand more working capital) in order, perhaps, to compete more

successfully for buyers who preferred to delay payment until after delivery.

Alternatively, the sign on the coefficient could arise from those firms that

sold outside the local areas having cheaper access to short—term credit,

through the merchants and other substantial traders that they presumably dealt

with more frequently. The positive relationship between size of firm and the

proportion sold on credit, particularly strong in urban counties, also seems

consistent with each of the theories. Larger firms might be expected to have

both been involved in disproportionately more of the large—bloc transactions

that tend to be carried out on credit rather than in cash, and faced lower

credit costs. Urbanization appears to have been associated with a decrease in

the proportion of output sold on credit among small firms, but an increase

among large establishments. This pattern might be attributable to firms in

rural areas knowing more about their individual customers (consumers of

product) that bought directly from them than did their counterparts in the

city. For the larger firms, the greater the degree of urbanization in the

county, the greater the probability that they would be dealing with merchants

or other established middlemen that were more likely to provide short—term

loans and delay payment for goods.1°



Conclusions

     This paper has sought to document the general quantitative importance of

manufacturing investment in working capital during the early stages of U.S.

industrialization. Another objective has been to emphasize the sharp varia-

tion across industries in the composition of their capital investments, and

more generally, in the factor intensities of their operations. In particular,

some major industries of the era, such as cotton textiles, wool textiles, and

paper, seem to have been relatively intensive in fixed capital, while most of

the others appear to have been intensive in working capital or labor. The

difference in capital requirements between the two classes of industries is of

special interest here, because of its implications for understanding why

certain industries became concentrated in the areas and regions they did, and

the degrees to which they were adversely affected by the limited availability

of long—term loans. Cotton textile firms, for example, may have tended to

cluster in New England, because that region's developed financial markets and

institutions provided long—term capital at lower cost. Manufacturers of hats

and shoes, however, would have tended toward areas where short—term credit and

the desired classes of workers were relatively abundant.'1

     The other major argument of this paper has been that most of the

manufacturing industries examined had quite modest investments in machinery

and tools per unit of labor. Although the value of this ratio tended to

increase with firm size, the evidence serves to undercut the notion that the

early period of industrialization was based on a proliferation of new,

machinery—intensive technologies. On the contrary, the general dominance of

the working capital share of investment, as well as its positive association
                                      12




with firm size, seems to suggest that the expansion of markets may have played

the principal role in spurring industrial development.

     4The chief problem with the valuations of fixed capital in the HcLane

Report is that some firms may have reported the gross or original value rather

than the net. Although of some concern, the resulting overstatement of the

capital values does not appear to have been severe. When dummy variables for

firms established in 1830 or 1831 were included in regressions similar to

those presented in Table 2 below, the coefficients always proved insignifi-

cantly different from zero. Other evidence that points to the use of net

value measures of the capital stock includes the comments of manufacturing

establishment proprietors on their reports to the enumerators for the 1820

     5The quoted description of the inventories to be reported by Group II

firms suggests that "cash on hand" was not to be included. No adjustment for

this omission has been made, but this may not be very significant as holdings

of cash seem to have been modest.

        comparison of the Group II estimates to the U.S. figures from the 1890

Census of Manufactures (which contains information on both inventories and

accounts receivable) indicates that all of these industries except wool

textiles experienced declines in their working—capital shares. For example,

the share decreased from 39.5 percent to 34.8 percent in cotton textiles, and

from 77.3 percent to 65.0 percent in hats. U.S. Census Office, Eleventh

Census of the United States: 1890. Report on the Manufacturing Industries in

the United States (Washington, D.C., 1895).

     71n 1850, for example, the average number of employees per New England

firm was 112.3 in cotton textiles, 37.8 in wool textiles, 7.7 in coaches!

harnesses, and 4.3 in tanning. U.S. Census Office, Abstract of Statistics of

Manufactures (Washington, D.C., 1858).

     8These figures may understate the value of the machinery and tools in use

in some industries, such as shoes, because employees may have worked with

their own tools. No reasonable adjustment for this phenomenon seems like to

alter the qualitative result.

     9me qualitative results of these regressions are not sensitive to

whether one includes the estimates of accounts receivable in the total

investment and working capital figures. Regressions with estimated accounts

receivable per unit of labor as the dependent variable suggest that this

component of working capital also grew more rapidly than did fixed capital

with firm scale of production. The principal findings also hold If the
                                      15




regressions are estimated over the Group 1 firms, or if the labor input is

measured without allowing for entrepreneurial labor.

     101t was evidently common practice for merchants to extend short—term

loans to manufacturers and to pay for goods at some time after delivery. They

frequently sold manufacturing output on commission or consignment. See Porter

and Livesay, Merchants and Manufacturers, for details.
