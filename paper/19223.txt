                                             ABSTRACT

How do innovators respond to the shock of a natural disaster? Do natural disasters spur technical
innovations that can reduce the risk of future hazards? This paper examines the impact of three types
of natural disasters including earthquakes, droughts and flooding on the innovation of their respective
mitigation technologies. Using patent and disaster data, our study is the first to relate natural disasters
to technology innovation, and also presents the first attempt to empirically examine adaptation responses
to climate change across multiple sectors at the country level. Overall, we show that natural disasters
lead to more risk-mitigating innovations, while the degree of influence varies across different types
of disasters and technologies.

1. Introduction

          How people cope with natural disasters is a question that has for long concerned both

policy makers and researchers. This issue is gaining renewed attention nowadays, given the

increasingly evident threats of climate change. Many climate scientists warn that global warming

will likely increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, thereby substantially

raising the risk of disasters such as droughts, heat waves, floods and tropical cyclones (e.g., Van

Aals, 2006). A recent report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC,

2012) confirms the link between climate change and natural disasters.1 Moreover, it calls for

policy makers to integrate disaster risks reduction into their efforts of climate change adaptation.

          In this paper, we ask whether natural disasters lead to innovations of risk-mitigation

technologies. Such technologies are analogous to those that may aid adaptation to climate change.

A term initially used to explain biological evolution, adaptation is now more often applied to

human society and regarded as an important strategy to address climate change (for a review on

the concept, see Smit and Wandel, 2006). The IPCC defines adaptation as “adjustment in natural

or human system in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which

moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities” (IPCC TAR, 2001: 72). In a broad sense,

adaption takes form of various actions and measures, which often depend on the characteristics

of local environment, particularly the natural hazards associated with climate change. Adaptation

can be either proactive or reactive (Fankhauser et al, 1999). The former occurs when people

anticipate the risks and take measures to forestall disasters or mitigate their risks, while the latter

refers to the actions taken only after the disaster events happened.


1
  The report explicitly concludes “(A) changing climate leads to change in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and
timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events” (IPCC 2012:
7). The report also highlights the impacts of those climatic or weather-related disasters: they have resulted in increased economic
losses worldwide since 1980, and particularly tremendous deaths in developing countries.
       Within the context of climate change adaptation, we coin the term “risk-mitigating

innovation”, referring to the development of new and more effective technologies that assist

people in better coping with natural disasters and building resilience to future shocks.

Innovation is an important form of adaptation because it provides the technical methods for

people to use in the process of adaption. While adaptation in some cases can be just behavioral

changes, such as relocation, people more often have to employ certain technologies, which take

either hard form (e.g., equipment and infrastructure such as building levees) or soft form (e.g.,

science, technical know-how, and skills such as emergency management) (UNFCC, 2006). As

an example of how technology can affect adaptation, consider how the advent of air conditioning

changed the development of regions in warmer climates. Moving forward, other innovations,

such as developing new breeds of crops more resistant to drought, have the potential to change

the world’s ability to adapt to climate change. Innovation also includes improvement and

commercialization of existing technologies, such as using new materials or new designs to make

them more cost-effective in combating one or multiple types of hazards. As Ausubel notes in his

1991 article, technical innovation and diffusion related to climate change “occur in all societies

and sectors and in many forms”. The importance of science and technology for climate

adaptation has received increased attention in the international policy world (e.g., UNISDR,

2009; UNFCC, 2006), though this issue is often ignored in the research community. Our study

contributes to a better understanding of the role of technologies in climate change adaptation.

       Research on innovation has important implications for policymaking related to climate

adaptation and disaster risk management. While adaptation is generally a local activity,

innovation produces new knowledge and technologies that can often serve as a public good or

even a global good. New technologies can be transferred and adopted by non-inventors and




                                                                                                  2
eventually benefit people and communities who face similar disaster risks. Therefore,

introducing the concept of risk-mitigating innovation expands the conventional view on the

highly localized nature of adaptation. From the policy perspective, encouraging risk-mitigating

innovation and the transfer of these technologies can not only save the cost of repeated R&D

elsewhere and improve the global equity in disaster risk reduction, but also can facilitate the

knowledge spillovers and provide building blocks for persistent future innovations.2

          This paper presents the first study to relate natural disaster impacts to technology

innovation. In particular, we focus on three types of natural disasters, earthquakes, droughts and

floods, and match each of them with one or two kinds of mitigation technologies including

earthquake-proof building and earthquake detection technology, drought-resistant crop, and flood

control technology.3 Our analysis, using a panel of up to 30 countries over a period of 25 years,

shows that all three types of natural disasters have a significant and positive impact on the patent

counts of their corresponding technologies. Moreover, given the relative newness of adaptation

as a climate change strategy, there has been very limited data and analyses done so far

concerning the implementation of adaptation at a country or regional level. By using risk-

mitigating innovation as an outcome of adaptation, our study also presents the first attempt to

examine systematically the adaptation responses across multiple sectors at the country level.

          Another contribution of this paper is to explore the motivation and ability for adaptation

responses, which is an under-researched issue in the adaptation literature. Notably, a majority of

the current adaptation studies focus on estimating costs or cost-effectiveness of adaptation

2
  Given the fact that most innovation activities are conducted in industrialized countries, their advanced technologies, if
transferred properly, can benefit the developing countries, which not only lack the innovative capacity but also are more
vulnerable to natural disasters relative to their developed counterparts.
3
  It should be noted that earthquake is normally classified as a geological hazard and regarded with a weak link to climate change.
However, given that catastrophic climate impacts have not yet been observed, we consider not only disasters directly relevant for
climate change such as drought and floods, but also include responses to other natural disasters like earthquake. Moreover, as
researchers expect the probabilities of earthquakes to rise in certain regions (such as California) due to the crust movement, we
believe earthquake fits neatly into the context of adaptation.



                                                                                                                                 3
measures, at either the global level or at the country level, and many climate models simply treat

adaptation as autonomous. For instance, recent examples of climate policy models incorporating

adaptation are the AD-DICE model (deBruin et al. 2009), the WITCH model (Bosello, Carraro,

and De Cian, 2009), which assesses the optimal mix of mitigation and adaptation measures, and

the FUND model, which has been used to analyze the tradeoff between mitigation and adaptation

for protecting coastlines (Tol, 2007). None of these models consider the possibility that the

tendency and ability to adapt are endogenous. Our empirical evidence of reactive risk-mitigating

innovations can inform the current endeavors in integrated assessment modeling of climate

change, and more specifically, suggests the possibility of treating adaptation as a function of

previous disaster losses. Finally, this paper also contributes to the literature of endogenous

technological change by testing the impact of natural disasters as a stimulus for innovation.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the

relevant literature. Section 3 discusses a conceptual framework and lays out our key hypotheses.

Section 4 describe the data sources and present some descriptive statistics. Section 5 discusses

the empirical model and our results. Section 6 concludes.


2. Literature review

       This paper is part of a growing literature on the economics of natural disasters (for a

survey of the literature, see Cavallo and Noy, 2010 and Kellenberg and Mobarak, 2011). This

literature primarily consists of two bodies of research, one concerning the economic effects of

natural disasters, and the other assessing the determinants of natural disaster impacts (i.e.,

treating disaster damages as a function of natural and social factors). While our research falls

into the first category, since we consider natural disasters as an explanatory variable, we also

base our conceptual and empirical models partly on the second line of research which suggests


                                                                                                4
that disaster impacts are endogenous.

         Most empirical studies concerning the economic impacts of natural disasters (the first

category) focus on assessing the costs of disasters or the impact of disaster shocks on output

growth using macroeconomic indicators and sector-specific measures (e.g., Benson and Clay,

2004). This literature involves a subset of research that looks into the behavioral changes induced

by natural disasters (e.g., how countries cope with the aftermath of disasters). Two recent studies

of relevance in this aspect are Cuaresma et al. (2008) and Yang (2008). The first study tests the

Shumpeterian theory of creative destruction (i.e., natural disasters that destroy capital stocks

provide an incentive to update capital and employ newer technologies, thereby leading to higher

productivities) by examining the relationship between disaster frequency and the R&D stocks

embodied in the imports of developing countries. Using both cross-country and panel data

regressions, they don’t find any systematic evidence supporting such a positive link, except for

high-GDP countries.4 Yang (2008) examines the impact of hurricanes on a variety of types of

international financial flows to developing countries. He finds that hurricanes lead to a

significant increase in foreign aid as well as in migrants’ remittances to the affected countries.

         In this paper, we examine the incentivizing effect of natural disasters on the innovation of

risk-mitigation technologies. Our research question implies at least two hypotheses: first,

technological innovation can be driven by external factors and is thus endogenous; and second,

disaster shocks can induce precautionary behaviors. To illustrate the two statements, we draw on

and connect two separate strands of literature. First, the theory of induced innovation posits that

changes in the relative price of an input of production leads to innovations that enable reducing


4
  Although Cuaresma et al (2008) also focuses on the link between natural disasters and technology, it should be noted that our
research question is fundamentally different from theirs. While their study asks whether natural disasters make developing
countries more likely to import and absorb new technologies to improve their productivity, our focus is a on a specific group of
technologies that can mitigate the risks of natural disasters.



                                                                                                                              5
use of the relatively more expensive factor (Hicks, 1932). Over the past decade, this theory has

been increasingly applied to the field of environmental economics, as researchers try to

understand the relationship between energy prices, environmental regulations and energy related

innovations (for an overview of this topic see Popp, Newell, and Jaffe 2010). Using U.S. patent

data from 1970 to 1994, Popp (2002) finds that both demand-side influences (e.g. energy prices)

and supply-side influences (e.g. the existing knowledge base) determine energy-efficient

innovation. Similar empirical evidence on the responsiveness of innovations to energy prices and

environmental regulations has been found by other researchers using other modeling techniques

(e.g., Newell et al, 1999) and conducting cross-national analyses (e.g., Johnstone et al. 2010,

Verdolini and Galeotti, 2011). Our study adds to this literature on induced innovation by making

the first attempt to link innovative activities to natural disaster events.

        We also draw on the literature on risk perceptions and protection motivation to consider

how disaster shocks encourage people to develop and adopt precautionary measures. One key

theoretical contribution in this field is the Roger’s Protection Motivation Theory (Roger, 1983),

which posits that people adjust their protective behavior based on their appraisal of external risks

and appraisal of their own competence in coping with the threat. More specifically, the risk

appraisal, or risk perception, involves the perceived probability of the occurrence of a

threatening event occurrence and perceived severity of the threat. More recently, this theory has

been used by environmental researchers to study individuals or households’ adaptation

motivation and behaviors. For example, Grothmann and Patt (2005) survey residents who face

flooding risk in the city of Cologne, Germany and find that risk perception and perceived

adaptive capacity play a more important role than socio-economic factors in explaining

individuals’ adaption decisions. With regard to the factors that affect risk perception, many




                                                                                                  6
researchers identify the prior disaster experiences/impacts as an important one. In a review of

the natural hazards literature, Weinstein (1989) concludes that past experiences with natural

disasters generally increase people’s perception of risk and their preparedness, though such

effects might be short-lived sometimes. Earlier studies (e.g., Perry & Lindell, 1986) find that

prior disaster experiences involving only minor damages have little effect on risk perception and

preparedness. This suggests that it is the severity of disaster impacts more than the disaster itself

that determines people’s risk perception.

       Finally, we come back to the adaptation literature, which is a fast growing subfield of the

contemporary natural disaster studies. The actual impact of a disaster falling on a community

depends on the nature of the hazard as well as on local people’s adaptation measures or their

adaptive capacity (Yohe and Tol, 2002; Brooks et al, 2005; IPCC, 2012). In fact, increased

attention has been focused on the term of adaptive capacity, an umbrella concept referring to a

country/community’s capability to undertake or develop adaptation (OECD, 2006; IPCC TAR,

2001). While there seems no clear consensus on the definition of the term, most researchers use

“adaptive capacity” to summaries a set of social, economic and political characteristics that

enable a society to mobilize its available resources to carry out adaptation.

       In line with the notion of adaptive capacity is a series of empirical studies examining the

determinants and heterogeneity of natural disaster impacts. By using a global cross-national data

set on human mortalities from multiple types of natural disasters, Kahn (2005) shows that

nations with higher income and more democratic institutions suffer fewer deaths from these

disasters. His argument is that economic development and good institutions lead to better

infrastructure and preventive technologies, more effective regulations and emergency

management, which provide “implicit insurance” against natural disasters. Following Kahn’s




                                                                                                   7
work, subsequent researchers use similar theoretical models and various measures of institution

(e.g., inequality, corruption, political regime) to account for the cross-country heterogeneity in

the impact of natural disasters. (Anbarci et al, 2005; Escaleras et al, 2006; Keefer et al, 2010). All

of them offer strong evidence that good institutions can buffer natural disaster losses. The

relationship between disaster losses and economic development was further examined by Toya

and Skidmore (2007), Rashky (2008), Kellenberg and Mobarak (2008), Schumacher and Strobl

(2011) and Hallegatte (2012). Rather than disaster losses decreasing monotonically with income,

these studies show that the damage-income relationship also depends on the squared income

level (Kellenberg and Mobarak, 2008), hazard exposure (Schumacher and Strobl , 2011) or the

density of capital as risk (Hallegatte, 2012). In addition to income and institution, hazard

exposure is another driving force for countries to adapt. For example, Hsiang and Narita (2012)

find that countries with more intense tropical cyclones (TC) climates have lower marginal losses

from an actual TC event, which provides direct evidence of adaptation. To sum up, this line of

research reflects a consensus view that disaster impact is determined by both the exogenous

natural hazards and local socioeconomic conditions. The implication for our study is that a

disaster’s impact (as an independent variable in our research) is influenced by any existing

adaptation efforts, including a country’s current adaptive capacity.


3. Conceptual framework

       Drawing on the three lines of literature discussed above, we develop a conceptual

framework for examining the effects of natural disaster on risk-mitigating innovations. Under

this framework, the impact of a disaster shock potentially raises the perceived risks, and thereby

leads to a higher demand for adaptive technologies. The anticipation of higher demand motivates

the private sector to develop newer and more cost-effective technologies for mitigating disaster


                                                                                                    8
risks. To be consistent with the risk literature, we expect risk perceptions to depend on the

severity of disaster impacts (e.g., human and economic losses from natural disasters) rather than

simple counts or physical properties of disasters. The rationale is simple: if a natural disaster of

extremely high magnitude occurs in an uninhabited area and results in little damage, it may not

substantially affect people’s risk perception. Our research question is essentially whether

individuals react to these new events or whether the risks of natural disasters are properly

perceived, so that new events do not change expectations.

            We begin by modeling perceived risk R*it, which is unobserved, as a function of country

i’s baseline hazard H (e.g. does the country have a fault line?), the country’s capacity Cit to cope

with a disaster in year t, and the impact of current events Dit (measured by death tolls or

damages). The disaster impact in turn depends simultaneously on the magnitude of the

exogenous disaster shock Mit and the country’s adaptive capacity Cit.

            (1)      R*it = f {Hi, Cit, Dit (Mit, Cit)}

            The baseline hazard is important for perceived risk, because people living in a region

known to be at risk for certain hazards are more likely to possess some level of risk perception.

For example, 81% of all earthquakes occur in countries located along the “Ring of Fire” in the

Pacific Ocean.5 People living in these quake-prone countries presumably perceive stronger risks

of earthquakes. Adaptive capacity may affect the perceived risk in different channels: first,

previous investments to reduce vulnerability, such as sea walls or earthquake-resistant buildings,

reduce the risk that significant damages will follow a disaster event. In such cases, the perceived

need for additional innovation will be lower. Also, perceiving a strong adaptive capacity may

cause over-confidence and then lower the perceived risks.6

    An analogy is the theory of “levee effect”(Stefanovic, 2003), which posits that people may excessively rely on the existing



                                                                                                                             9
         Because capacity is not directly observed, we model capacity as a function of the

following observed variables:

         (2)      C*it = f(Hi, Ki,t-1, Yit, Iit ).

As suggested by our literature review, both income, Yit, and the quality of institutions, Iit,

influence the coping capacity of a country. Ki,t-1, represents the current knowledge and

technologies available to cope with the disaster in question. To the extent that previous events led

to new innovations, there will be less need for additional innovation after a subsequent shock.

         Finally, innovation itself depends on the perceived risk R*it (and thus the demand for

better technologies to cope with disasters), the existing knowledge base on which inventors can

build Ki,t-1, income Yit, and science policy Sit.

         (3)      PATit = f(R*it, Ki,t-1, Yit, Sit)

         We use the count of patent applications pertaining to a given technology, PATit, to

measure the outcome of innovative activities. Science policy includes the availability of qualified

engineers to work on disaster-related research and patent policy, which determines the likelihood

that inventors will seek patent protection for new innovations. We control for these by using the

total number of patents by country and year.

         Combining equations (1), (2), and (3) summarizes this reduced form relationship:

         (4)      PATit = f(Dit, Hi,, Ki,t-1, Yit, Iit, Sit).

         Note that the effect of both economic development Yit and knowledge, Ki,t-1, are

ambiguous. Equations (1) and (2) suggest that a greater existing knowledge stock and higher

income increase adaptive capacity, thus reducing the need for additional innovation (because




protective measures knowing their existence. For example, people may think the construction of levees can fully protect
themselves against all future floods.



                                                                                                                   10
perceived risk is lower).7 At the same time, equation (3) suggests that existing knowledge serves

as a building block for future innovation. While we expect a positive relationship between

existing knowledge and innovation, it may also be the case that a strong existing stock may

constrain technological opportunities and make future breakthroughs more difficult. Similarly, as

innovation is primarily carried out in industrialized countries, and people from higher-income

countries may have a higher demand for mitigation technologies, a positive correlation between

GDP and patenting activity is also possible.

         Equation (4) raises two issues for estimation. First, we consider potential lags between

disaster events and patents. Innovation is a gradual process. Research projects take multiple

years, and staff may not be easily shifted to a new project just because a new profitable

opportunity arises. Similarly, adjustments to perceived risk may also be gradual. For example, a

drought in one year may be perceived as a random event. Persistent drought over multiple years

may be perceived as changing climate. As such, we consider multiple lags when estimating our

model.

         Second, we must also consider how globalization renders countries increasingly

interdependent with each other, so that a salient foreign disaster shock may generate a global

effect in that it may raise the risk perception of the hazard in other countries.8 One anecdotal

example is that the Netherlands launched a full re-assessment of its risk management policy soon

after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, US in 2005. The global impact also includes technology

spillovers, as advanced technologies developed in one country can be employed by the rest of the

world to cope with their own disaster risks. In our baseline specification, year effects capture


7
  This suggests a learning-by-doing phenomenon, which we test in another paper which examines the effect of knowledge stocks
in mitigating disaster risks.
8
  This “contagious effect” hypothesis has actually received some support in micro-level studies, as researchers find that indirect
disaster experiences, which people obtain from observing disasters that happen to others, can also influence risk perception of
those unaffected.



                                                                                                                              11
both the effect of these disasters on perceived risk and on the accumulation of global knowledge

that may serve as a building block for domestic innovation. Later, we also directly assess the

effect of foreign shocks and foreign knowledge stocks on domestic innovation by replacing the

year fixed effects by such variables in our empirical analysis.


4. Data and Descriptive Statistics

       In this study our dependent variable is the flow of risk-mitigating innovations, which is

measured by the number of successful patent applications filed in a country in a given year. All

our patent data is taken from an online global patent database Delphion.com and is identified

through either International Patent Code (IPC) or key word searches (For a more detailed

description of our patent search strategy, please see appendix 1). Given the issue of cross-country

patenting (i.e., inventors can patent the same technology in multiple countries where they desire

protection), we take a set of procedures in cleaning the data to ensure that 1) one patent

represents one unique innovation and is counted only once in our sample; and 2) each patent is

assigned to only one country where the first inventor indicated in the patent document is located.

       It is important to acknowledge that a patent, as a common measure of invention used in

the innovation literature, is not a perfect measurement. Issues regarding using patent statistics to

measure innovations were discussed by Griliches (1990) and Motohashi and Goto (2010). There

are two major disadvantages of using patent data: first, the number of patent applications in a

country is highly subject to its patent system. Thus, we control for country heterogeneity by

including the overall number of patents in each country in our regression. Second, not all

inventions get patented. Inventors have the right to hide or reveal their inventions. Since the

propensity to patent varies by technology, we do separate regressions for each technology, so that

our identification strategy focuses on patenting changes within a single technology.


                                                                                                 12

counts based on the perpetual inventory model, which assumes that the knowledge stock depends

on a distributed lag of the current and past flows of innovations.

         (5) Kit = PATit + (1- ) Kit-1

where ρ is the rate of stock depreciation, which we assume to be 15 percent following the

conventional innovation literature. Using a depreciation rate implies that the patent/knowledge

produced earlier become less valueable and relevant for today’s innovations. For the first year’s

knowledge stock, we simply equate the patent counts in the first year to knowledge stock, since

most countries have zero patents in their first year of our estimation period.9 For the ease of

interpreting the effect of knowledge stock, we normalize this variable by taking log of the value

of knowledge stock plus 1.

         We measure disaster impacts, our key independent variable, using both human mortalities

and economic losses from the natural disasters. Our disaster data on the three types of natural

disasters (earthquake, drought and flood) is taken from two sources. We use the drought and

flooding data from the Emergency Event Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for

Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster. Most current studies involving cross-country and

multi-hazard analyses use the EM-DAT database. While this database is publically assessable,

the accuracy of its data has been questioned given its humanitarian focus and specific thresholds

for events to be included. 10 While we can identify no better alternative for information on

flooding and droughts, we collect data on earthquakes from the National Geophysical Data


9
  In most applications of perpetual inventory model, the starting stock is calculated by dividing the first year’s flow by average
annual logarithmic growth plus the depreciation rate (e.g., Coe and Helpman 1995). This method cannot be applied in our case,
since a lot of countries in our sample have zero patents during the years. We feel safe to do so also because many countries have
zero patents in their first year in our data set. Moreover, as our regressions begin in 1984 but our patent data begin in 1974, we
have 10 years of historical data for most countries to construct the initial knowledge stock.
10
   EM-DAT includes events with either more than 10 fatalities, over 100 people affected, a declaration of a state of emergency, or
a call for international assistance. It contains information on disaster events from 1900.



                                                                                                                              13
Center (NGDC) Significant Earthquake Database. This database is preferred to EM-DAT since it

contains richer information on earthquake physics (e.g., magnitude and Modified Mercalli

Intensity), much longer timespan and more small-impact events that do not meet the EM-DAT

threshold. The economic losses are adjusted by the World Bank GDP deflator index.

          In addition to the disaster impacts data, we also collect data to measure the magnitude of

the exogenous disaster shocks, in order to instrument for potentially endogenous disaster impacts

and knowledge stocks. For earthquakes, the NGDC database provides information such as the

Richter scale of individual earthquake events. For drought, we use the Standardized Precipitation

Evapotranspiration Index (Vicente-Serrano et al, 2010), which is a multi-scalar drought index

that is calculated using precipitation and temperature data11 and presented in a global gridded

dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree (approximately 56 km x 56 km at the equator)

covering the period of 1901 to 2009. This index is claimed to be “particularly suited to detecting,

monitoring, and exploring the consequences of global warming on drought conditions” (Vicente-

Serrano et al, 2010: p1698). Considering that drought is most likely to affect agriculture, we

focus on the drought events occurring on cropland, and match the SPEI data with a global

cropland coverage data set which is also at 0.5 spatial degree resolution.12 Since out data is a

panel structure of country by year, we use geospatial software to create a new country-year

aggregate drought measure: we take the mean of the SPEI values which are under 0 (indicating

dryness) with their feature points (defined by longitude and latitude) located on cropland.13 For

flood, we use the area-weighted-precipitation data from Dell et al (2012) and assume that


11
   Their original weather data is taken from the Global Historical Climatology Network database.
12
   The global cropland dataset, which spans from 1700 to 2007, is produced by Navin Ramankutty at the Land Use and the
Global Environment lab of Mcgill University.
 The data is retrieved from http://www.geog.mcgill.ca/~nramankutty/Datasets/Datasets.html
13
   In the original global cropland data, for each feature point cropland is identified by a crop coverage percentage. To simplify our
definition of cropland, we calculate the mean cropland coverage ratio by country-year and treat all feature points which exceed
the country mean in the same year as cropland.



                                                                                                                                 14
excessive rainfall is often an exogenous shock causing flooding.14

          For data on country characteristics, we use the data on real GDP per capita and

population from Penn World Table (7.0 version). To measure institutional quality, we use the

polity variable from POLITY IV project, which takes on the value from -10 to 10 and indicates a

country’s openness of political institution (higher values suggest a more democratic and open

political institution). As discussed above, countries are different in terms of their science bases,

patent systems and general propensity to patent innovations. Thus we use the total number of

patent applications filed by a country’s residents to control for this country characteristic. This

data comes from the World Bank World Development Indicators and the database of the World

Intellectual Property Organization.

          In this study, we look at three types of natural disasters and four different types of

technologies. For each technology, we construct a sample of countries with the selection criteria

that the country should have at least five patents in a given technology field between 1974 and

2009. We begin in 1974 because patent data for many countries first appears in the Delphion

database in the mid-1970s. Therefore, our sample size varies according to different technology

types. Appendix 2 lists the countries included for each technology.

          Table 1 provides national summary statistics reporting the average deaths and damages

from natural disasters per year by disaster type, and total patent counts by technology type for a

period 1970-2009. A large majority of our sample countries are industrialized countries. This is

consistent with the notion that most of the global R&D activities are carried out by developed

countries (National Science Board, 2010), since they have higher demand and more resources for

science, technology and innovation. In particular, United States, Germany and Japan appear to

14
   The precipitation data in Dell et al (2012) have also been aggregated to the country-year level. The original data is taken from
the Terrestrial Air Temperature and Precipitation: 1900-2006 Gridded Monthly Time Series, Version 1.01(Matsurra and Willmott
2007).



                                                                                                                               15
play leading roles in patenting on these mitigating technologies. Notably, China seems to be most

severely impacted by all three types of disasters among all sample countries, while it also has a

large number of patents on these technologies. To compare across disaster types, earthquakes and

floods cause much larger losses on our sample countries than droughts. This suggests that two

possibilities. First, while droughts will typically affect a larger geographic area than earthquakes

or floods, their impact is primarily on a single sector (agriculture), rather than the entire economy

of the affected area. Second, given that most of our sample countries are developed countries,

they already have good technologies and infrastructure such as irrigation systems which make

them less vulnerable to drought. In fact, the statistics of global drought impacts by country

(based on the EM-DAT data) shows that most of the severe drought events in the past forty years

have occurred in developing nations, in particular the least developed countries in Africa.15 This

fact further confirms that the impact of drought highly depends on an area’s vulnerability or

adaptive capacity.

         Figures 1-3 illustrate trends in patenting behavior for selected countries, with major

disaster events also highlighted. Figure 1 shows earthquake mitigation patenting trends for the

United States and Japan. In both cases, patenting activity increases after major earthquakes, such

as the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the U.S. and the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan. Figure

2 shows similar trends for flood control technology in the Unites States and United Kingdom. In

contrast, a visual inspection of drought-resistant crop technologies suggests a more gradual

increase in patenting activity over time. Possible explanations include increased awareness of

drought risks from climate change or increased patenting due to advances in agricultural


15
  We rank countries that are most often hit by drought from 1970 to 2010 using the drought data from EM-DAT. Only five
countries in the top 15 (China, Brazil, Australia, India, United States) are included in our sample. The other countries are
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Kenya, Bolivia, Somalia, Honduras, Indonesia, Mauritania, Philippines, and Sudan, which have no
patents in either of the drought-mitigating technologies.

biotechnology. Year effects in the regression analysis allow us to control for both possibilities.

          Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics of main variables in the analysis. It should be

noted that though our patent data generally becomes available in 1974, we deliberately choose to

start our estimation period at least 10 years later because we have the knowledge stock, which is

also a function of patent counts, on the right hand side. In this way, we allow the stock to

accumulate for ten years before it enters into the estimation equation.



5. Empirical model and main results

5.1 Domestic disaster impacts

          To examine the relationship between disaster shocks and risk-mitigating innovations, we

estimate a reduced-form empirical model based on our proposed conceptual framework:
                               5
        (6) PATjit = f ( Dit  n , Yit, Iit, Kjit-1, Sit, ηi, t )
                              n 0



where the innovation flow (PATjit) is the total number of successful patents in the technology

field j applied by the residents in country i in year t. It is the function of contemporary and

lagged impact of natural disasters that occurred in country i and a set of country characteristics

including real GDP per capita Yit, political institutions Iit, existing domestic knowledge stock

relevant to the specific technology type in question, Kjit-1, and general patent application quantity

Sit. The reason for using a distributed lag of disaster impacts is that we are reluctant to impose a

structure on the effects of recent year’s disasters on innovation. 16 Country fixed effects ηi,

control for time-invariant heterogeneity across country (e.g., the baseline hazard risks,


16
   As we discussed earlier, innovation takes time. Whether the most recent disasters have bigger impacts on innovative activities
is an empirical question. To determine the number of year lags to be included in the regression, we first conduct a sensitivity test
by gradually increasing the lags. We find the coefficients on lagged values of disaster effects generally become insignificant
beyond five years ago. Further sensitivity analysis of the lags is available in Appendices 3 and 4.



                                                                                                                                17
innovation capacity, and other unobserved country specific characteristics), and also helps to

address the potential endogeneity of the disaster impact variables. Year fixed effects t control

for time-varying factors common to all countries (e.g., the global technology advancement,

salient disaster shocks which occurred in one country but affect the global risk perception).

         Given the count-data nature of our dependent variable (i.e., patent counts) and panel

nature of our data structure, we use Poisson fixed-effects model with robust standard errors to

address possible over-dispersion in the data (Cameron and Trivedi, 2005). Standard errors are

clustered by country.17 We use the fixed-effects model because the unobserved heterogeneity

across countries as discussed above is very likely to exist and correlate with the explanatory

variables.18

         We estimate our empirical model by using the Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM)

technique (Hansen, 1982).              While this estimation equation allows the individual effects to

correlate with the other regressors, the consistency of the estimators rely on the assumption of

strict exogeneity of explanatory variables (E(xituit) = 0). In other words, the regressors must not

correlate with any of the past, current and future error terms. However, this assumption seems

difficult to justify in our model for two reasons. First, our lagged knowledge stock variable is

constructed using a distributed lag of previous patent counts, and therefore has the similar

character of a lagged dependent variable, which is predetermined. Second, the disaster impacts

may also be predetermined in the sense that the earlier efforts of innovating as a response to past

disaster shocks may help alleviate the human mortalities and economic losses of the subsequent

similar events. It should also be noted that the inclusion of country fixed effects is to capture the

17
   Because of the panel nature of the data, we do not use a negative binomial model, as the negative binomial fixed effect model
does not truly control for unobserved fixed effects (Alison and Waterman, 2002; Cameron and Trividi 2005; Paulo 2008).
18
   Unless we can find proper measures for the country specific heterogeneity and include them in the regression, the potential
correlation between the observed fixed components ηi with the other regressors would make a standard random effects estimator
inconsistent.



                                                                                                                            18
time-invariant individual effects that may affect innovation motivation and patenting. If the

time-varying elements of a country’s adaptive capacity that may affect disaster outcomes are not

fully accounted for, this might also induce the endogeneity issue of our disaster variables.

          To address these issues, we estimate two specifications. First, we replace the Kjit-1 in the

estimation equation (6) with Kjit-6, so that the knowledge stock is no longer a function of the

lagged disaster impact variables in our regression and can be treated as exogenous to today’s

innovation flows. Using this specification we essentially assess the effect of disaster events that

occurred in the present year as well as in the last five years on risk-mitigating innovation,

considering that they may both induce innovation today to do lagged reactions and may reduce

the need for innovation due to earlier improvements to adaptive capacity in the past five years in

reaction to lagged disasters. One caveat is that the reduced form specification does not address

the issue of strict exogeneity. Given the long time frame of our sample, such concerns are

unlikely to cause significant bias, and this specification does not suffer if potential instruments,

described below, are weak (Wooldridge 2010).19

          Second, we use the instrumental variable approach, using the magnitude measures of

shock events that have induced natural disasters as instruments. Our argument is that the

“natural destructiveness” of a disaster correlates directly with the disaster outcomes such as

human and economic losses and should be exogenous. Moreover, since our theory posits that

disasters induce innovation and subsequent accumulation of the specific technical knowledge to

cope with disasters, the magnitude measures should also exert a positive effect on the knowledge

stock. Therefore, in addition to using the disaster magnitude that corresponds to each year’s

disaster impact, we instrument for knowledge stock using the magnitude information over a


19
  When strict exogeneity is violated, the bias is a function of 1/T. Our regressions include 24-26 years of data, so that any
potential bias is scaled by a factor of approximately 0.04.



                                                                                                                                19
longer period of 25 years, given the availability of rich pre-sample data. By instrumenting for the

lagged knowledge stock, the second specification allows us to directly interpret the effect of the

existing knowledge base on upcoming innovations. For some types of technology (e.g.,

earthquake mitigating innovations), we also use a country’s population as an instrument for

disaster impacts because a high density of population is presumably more subject to human and

economic losses when being hit by a disaster shock.20 One complication for earthquake is that

our unit of analysis is country-year instead of events. We use two variables to measure the

severity of earthquakes, the maximum earthquake magnitude if any occurs in a country-year and

the total number of earthquakes with a magnitude six or large in a country-year. As for drought,

we use the aggregated Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at country-

year level as well as population to instrument for drought damages and lagged knowledge stocks.

The instrument we use in the case of flooding is area-weighted precipitation (Dell et al, 2012) for

country-year. In all cases, the instrumental variable approach provides consistent estimates of

our parameters as long as the quality of our instruments is good. However, the results suffer if

the instruments are not strong predictors of disaster impacts and lagged knowledge.

         Table 3 presents the estimation results for both specifications using death tolls as the

measure of disaster impact. Note that for droughts we focus on only economic damage because a

majority of our sample countries have zero deaths over the estimation period. Income and total

patent applications are in logs, so that the coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. The

results show that human mortalities from recent disasters generally have a significant and

positive effect on the domestic patent flows for all technologies concerned. Such evidence

20
  To address the predetermined and endogenous regressor issue, we have also tried other approaches following the literature on
panel count-data models. For example Chamberlain (1992), Wooldridge (1997), and Windmeijer (2000) have suggested a quasi-
differencing GMM estimator using the lagged xit as instruments. This approach can not only allow the unobserved heterogeneity
to correlate with regressors but no longer rests on the strict exogeneity assumption. But the precision of the estimator may be
hampered if the regressors are highly persistent over time, which thus have less relevance for the differenced terms (weak
instrument problem). We have found the same problem when we applied this approach to our data.



                                                                                                                           20
supports our principal hypothesis that natural disasters lead to risk-mitigating innovations, and

the amount of successful patent applications following disaster events increase with the severity

of disaster impacts. Specifically, in the case of earthquakes, the coefficients on the current-year’s

death (measured in thousand) suggest that an additional 1,000 deaths increases the expected

counts of patents of earthquake-proof building and detection technology applied for in same year

by 1.3% - 1.5%, respectively.21 Comparing the two types of earthquake-mitigating technologies,

we find that earthquake impacts seem to have a long-term effect on quake-resistant building

patents while its effect on detection patents seems more immediate (i.e., only the coefficients on

the present year and last year’s death are statistically significant). The row “sum of death”

presents the joint significance of all current and lagged impacts. For quake-proof buildings, one

thousand deaths from earthquakes can increase the expected counts of patents filed in the next

five years by about 18.6 – 23.8%, while such impact on the detection patents are insignificant

over the five-year period. It is somehow surprising to see the lagged effect does not become

smaller with the increase of year lags, as reflected in the magnitude of the coefficients. One

possible explanation is that the innovation of earthquake-proof buildings is not only stimulated

by the disaster events but also subject to the changes in regulations (e.g., building codes may be

revised following severe events, thereby providing a long-term motive for innovation). By

comparing the two different specifications, we notice that the significance of most coefficients

does not change much, and the coefficient magnitudes of those highly significant variables are

largely similar.22


21
  As we use Poisson model for estimation, we are able to interpret the coefficients in a semi-elasticity form.
22
  However, recall that we should be cautious about the difference in how to interpret these coefficients, since we are controlling
for two different levels of lagged knowledge stock in the two models. In specification (1), we estimate the effect of recent
disasters conditioning on the six-year lagged knowledge stock (that had been established before these events actually happened);
and in specification (2), we estimate the effect of a distributed lag of disasters controlling for last year’s knowledge stock, so the
effect of earlier disaster events (e.g., year t-5) on existing knowledge will already be captured in the knowledge stock variable. In
Appendix 5, we demonstrate that this has little impact on the magnitude of the individual coefficients.



                                                                                                                                  21
            As for flood-control technology, we only show the results for specification 1 because the

instrument (i.e., area-weighted precipitation) is weakly correlated with the death variables.23 The

results shows that the cumulative effects of recent flooding events on the innovation of flood-

control technologies in particularly prominent: an additional 1,000 deaths from floods that have

occurred in the past five years plus the present year would lead to an increase of patent

application in this field by 88%. Also, the six-year lagged knowledge stock is statistically

significant and positive for patent counts: a ten percent increase in the knowledge stock of six

years ago is associated with 2.5% increase in today’s patent applications. This suggests that the

earlier knowledge stock serves as a building block for future innovations even after considering

its possible competing effects on risk-mitigating innovations as part of a country’s existing

adaptive capacity.

            Table 4 reports the estimation results using economic losses as a measure of disaster

impact for both specifications. The results are largely consistent with what we have found using

human losses, that is, economic damages from recent disasters generally have a statistically

significant and positive effect on the innovation of risk-mitigation technologies. As for

earthquakes, the pattern of the disasters-innovation relationship is somewhat similar with that in

Table 3: patenting in earthquake-proof building technology seem to be more affected by the

earlier events (though it should be noted that in specification 2, the coefficient on current year’s

damage turns significant with a much large magnitude compared to that in specification 1), while

patenting of earthquake detection technology is more responsive to the most recent events. We

also notice that when instrumenting for disaster impacts (specification 2), the coefficients on

one-year lagged knowledge stock for both two technologies are positive and significant at 5%

level, which suggests that the supply-side effect of the existing knowledge base on upcoming

     Appendix 6 provides information on the fit of the instruments for each of our technologies and endogenous variables.



                                                                                                                            22
innovations may play a dominant role. As for flooding, the stimulating effect of disasters on

patenting seems to come more from recent years, and both specifications show that the

magnitude of such impact is biggest for the current year’s flooding: an additional $1 billion

economic loss would increases the expected number of flood-control patent applications filed in

the same year by 4.8% - 11%. The effect of the lagged knowledge stock seems ambiguous in this

case: although both two have positive coefficients, neither is significant at 5% level. As for the

drought-resistant crop technology, the effect of drought on patenting activities is also positive

and statistically significant in most lagged years (except year t-1 and t-3) in the specification 1. It

is estimated that an additional $1 billion economic losses from drought that occurred no earlier

than five years ago would increase the expected number of patent applications filed at the present

year by approximately 20%. When we instrument for drought damage using aggregated drought

index, the coefficient of the present year’s damage has been substantially inflated to 0.244 (this

suggests the immediate innovation response is even larger than the long-term responses in the

specification 1), while coefficients on other lagged years turn insignificant. It is also surprising to

see that the coefficients on other country controls, such as GDP, institution quality and general

patent applications, are very different from those in specification 1. In particular, the control for

total patent applications has an unexpected negative sign in this specification. We suspect these

problems are the results of the relatively weak link between our instruments and the damage

variables, as discussed in Appendix 6. Given that there are few differences between

specifications 1 and 2 for other technologies, we place more faith in specification 1 for drought-

resistant crops.




                                                                                                    23
5.2 Do foreign shocks matter?

         So far we have examined the effect of domestic disaster shocks on domestic innovation

of risk-mitigating technologies. Here we consider whether innovators also respond to salient

foreign disaster shocks and whether they could benefit from the adaptive knowledge that has

been created abroad (i.e., knowledge spillover effects). To answer this question, we create

variables measuring the impact of foreign shocks as well as foreign knowledge stocks and use

them to replace the year fixed effects to avoid multicollinearity.24 Specifically, we estimate the

following model:25
                                 5              5
         (7)     PATjit = f (  DDit  n ,      FD     it  n ,
                                                                   DKjit-6 , FKjit-6 , Yit , Iit , Sit , ηi )
                                n0            n0



in which DDit denotes the human mortality or economic losses resulting from natural disasters

that occurred in country i in year t, while FDit is the human or economic losses from disasters

that occurred outside country i in year t. DKjit-6 denotes the domestic knowledge stock in

technology field j in country i by year t-6. FKit-6 denotes the foreign knowledge stock constructed

by the patents filed outside country i up until year t-6.

         Table 5 reports the estimation results. First, removing the year fixed effects and adding

controls for foreign disasters and knowledge increases the significance of some coefficients on

the distributed lag of domestic disasters. But this does not affect the cumulative effect of

domestic shocks much, which suggests the robustness of our estimation. In terms of foreign

impact, we find foreign disasters that have occurred between year t and year t-5 together exert a


24
   To create the foreign impact variables, we first calculate the total global impacts by aggregating the human or economic losses
from all countries in the database (not limited to our sample countries) and subtract each country’s own losses from the total
global losses. We construct the foreign knowledge stock in the same way as we create the domestic knowledge stock (using the
perpetual inventory model). We aggregate the total number of patents filed in the world in a year and then subtract each country’s
own patents from the global pool to obtain the foreign patent counts by country-year.
25
   Note that model (7) is largely based on specification (1), which uses country fixed effects and no instrument variables. We
choose this to derive our foreign model due to the small difference between this approach and the instrument approach.



                                                                                                                              24
statistically significant and positive effect on the domestic innovation of flood control and

drought-resistant crop technology, though the magnitude of such effect is much smaller

compared to the domestic disasters. Surprising, the patent counts of quake-proof technology

decrease with the severity of foreign earthquakes, and this effect is statistically significant at 1%

level for most lagged-year coefficients when severity is measured by deaths. While it may simply

be that innovation of building technology might be primarily driven by domestic demand and

institutions (e.g., building codes) and less subject to the foreign disaster shocks, we cannot rule

out that the lack of year fixed effects may imply an omitted variable correlated with foreign

disasters. For detection technology, the innovative response to foreign earthquakes seems more

immediate and only significant in the current year. This pattern is consistent with the response to

domestic earthquakes, while the magnitude of foreign effects is also very small. In terms of the

knowledge spillover effects, we find that for earthquake detection and drought-resistant crop,

foreign knowledge stocks lagged by six years have a significant and positive effect on domestic

innovation, which suggests the potential spillovers across countries.

       In addition to not controlling for year effects, the previous model also assumes that all

global disasters have a similar impact on innovation. We next relax this assumption, asking

whether disaster shocks that occur in nearby foreign countries would more likely induce

domestic innovation of risk-mitigating technologies. The rationale is that geographic proximity

leads countries to share some similar geophysical characteristics, thereby causing risk perception

to be influenced by the incidence of one another. Moreover, geographic proximity might imply a

potential same market and make it easy for foreign technologies to diffuse and profit. To test this

hypothesis, we group countries by continent and create variables of foreign disaster impact based

on the same continent external to country i. By adding more cross-country variation to foreign




                                                                                                  25
disasters, we are also able to once again include year fixed effects, so that year dummies can

capture global technological progress, salient global shocks, and any potential omitted variables

correlated with such shocks. Other variables remain the same.

       Table 6 reports the estimation results using this approach. Again, the coefficients on the

distributed lag of domestic disaster impact largely stay the same as compared to the original

domestic model. Foreign disasters that occurred between year t and t-5 on the same continent

external to a country have a positive cumulative effect on its domestic innovation of detection

and flood control technology, and such effect is statistically significant when foreign impact is

measured by death for detection and damage for flood control. For quake-proof building

technology, using this new measure makes some originally negative coefficients on foreign

shocks in model (7) no longer significant. But we still see no evidence on the link between

foreign disasters and domestic innovation for this technology. Finally, unlike when controlling

for all foreign damages, foreign disaster impacts generally are now insignificant for drought-

resistant crop technology. One possible explanation is the presence of the global crop market and

the concentration of innovative activities by a few biotech multinational corporations. To

summarize, we do find some evidence suggesting the impact of foreign shocks and foreign

knowledge spillovers on domestic innovation, though such evidence is not pervasive across all

technology types.



6. Conclusion

       Natural disasters cause tremendous human causalities, as well as significant economic

losses worldwide. But apart from this, what do people learn from suffering natural disasters? Do

they improve their coping capacity every time after being hit by a disaster shock? These are




                                                                                              26
meaningful questions for both researchers and policy makers to consider. Until now, there has

been no systematic study of the role of technology and innovation in climate change adaptation.

This paper fills this gap, linking three types of natural disasters (earthquakes, droughts, and

flooding) to a set of mitigation technologies.

       By introducing the idea of “risk-mitigating innovation”, we conceptualize innovation as

an important form of adaptation. We bring together two lines of research on induced innovation

and adaptation to develop a conceptual framework for assessing the effects of natural disasters

on risk-mitigating innovation. Our empirical analysis, using a panel of up to 30 countries

covering a period of about 25 years, reveals a consistent stimulating effect of natural disasters on

patent flows of the technologies that can mitigate similar disaster risks. For all types of

technologies concerned here, we find evidence that the amount of risk-mitigating innovation in a

country increases with the severity of its recent natural disasters. This finding suggests that

people are constantly learning from their disaster experiences, though they adapt to natural

disasters in a reactive manner. This has important implications for both policymakers and

modelers of climate policy, as it suggests that innovations that facilitate adaptation to climate

change are unlikely to come from the private sector until after climate damages have been

experienced. The potential role of public R&D support to facilitate earlier improvements in risk-

mitigating technologies thus deserves investigation in future research.

       Moreover, our study also shows that innovators not only respond to domestic shocks but

also respond to natural disasters occurring in other countries, although the magnitude of the latter

is much smaller and the link is not pervasive across all technology types. We also find that the

growing pool of global knowledge on disaster mitigation exerts a stimulating effect on domestic

risk-mitigating innovation (e.g., for earthquake detection and drought-resistant crop technology).




                                                                                                 27
This finding has important implication for global adaptation policy making. Since most of the

innovative activities are currently taking place in industrialized countries, their risk-mitigating

innovation can generate positive externalities to the developing world and could be translated

into useful local knowledge to cope with natural disasters and reduce vulnerability. Policies are

needed to facilitate the transfer of more risk-mitigating technologies to countries with limited

technological resource and capacity and deployment of these technologies.

       As the first study integrating technology innovation and adaptation, we believe that this

line of research can be further extended in at least two directions. First, in this study we construct

the measure of foreign disaster shocks and foreign knowledge stocks in a relatively coarse way.

In fact, not all natural disasters that have occurred elsewhere in the world or foreign knowledge

available are relevant for a country. More detailed analyses could be done in this regard, for

example, weighing the foreign impacts by geographic distance between countries and measuring

the existing foreign knowledge stock using the patent family and patent citation information.

Second, more research could be done to assess the role of technological change in facilitating

adaptation to climate change. In this study we mainly focus on how natural disasters induce risk-

mitigating innovation, but we have little to say about the effectiveness of these new innovations

in reducing disaster risks (e.g., saving lives and preventing economic losses). Particularly, given

the public good nature of knowledge, it is an important policy and research question to gauge the

potential benefits of diffusion of risk-mitigating technologies in the global context.

 All the economic losses are in million US dollars (2005 level). According to our sample selection criteria, countries with less than five patents in the given technology are not
included in the sample and are thus indicated as “.” in the table. For these excluded countries, we don’t indicate their disaster impact information. But this by no means implies
that these countries have never been hit by any disasters.

Robust standard errors in parentheses *** p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1. Economic damages are measured by billion US dollars at 2005 level. The instruments we use in the
specification (2) for quake-proof building and earthquake detection technologies include the maximum earthquake magnitude and counts of earthquakes with magnitude 6 or larger
in year t to year t-25, and population in year t to year t-5. For flood control we use area-weighted precipitation in year t to year t-25 to instrument for all damage variables and
l1.kstock in specification (2). For drought-resistant crop, we use the country aggregated mean SPEI value tin year t to year t-25 and population in year t to year t-5 to instrument
for all damage variables and l1.kstock.

Appendix 3. Sensitivity to Lag Length

In the main paper, we include deaths and damages lagged through year 5. In this appendix we

demonstrate that our results are robust to different lag lengths. The tables in this section present

reduced form estimates (corresponding to column (1) in Tables 3 and 4) including lags from 3 to

8 years. The results are not sensitive to the length of the lag. In particular, there is little change

in the magnitude of coefficients for recent years as more distant lags are added to the model.

Moreover, with the exception of flood control in reaction to deaths, the sum of all damage or

death coefficients experience little change when adding more than five years of lags.

We choose to present lags of five years in the paper as nearly all lagged values are insignificant

after 5 years. Moreover, the AIC statistics verify that either a four or five year lag is optimal for

all technologies except drought-resistant crops. Thus, for ease of presentation in the main text,

we choose a lag of five years for all technologies.

Appendix 4. Lag sensitivity without knowledge stocks

In this section we provide additional sensitivity analysis showing the robustness of our results to

both different finite lag structures and to potential endogeneity concerns when including

knowledge stocks. To avoid these endogeneity concerns about the knowledge stock, the models

presented here consider a reduced form in which the knowledge stock is replaced by the sum of

previous deaths or damages. Essentially, the entire history of deaths or damages for each

country is included, with the coefficient constrained to be the same after L years to allow

estimation of the equation. The model can be written as:

(A1)                     ∑         ,        ∑          ,


For example, if L = 3, the model includes a separate damage coefficient for years 0 to t-3, and a

single coefficient, H, on the sum of all damages occurring from year t-4 onward until 1960, the

first year for which we have disaster data. We denote this as year H above. Xit represents a

matrix of the various control variables used.

Panels A-C in Table A3 present the results for deaths and panels A-D in Table A4 present the

results for damages. The tables show that our results are robust to various lag lengths. With the

exception of flood control technology, lagged deaths or damages are rarely significant after four

or five years. Moreover, in most cases (the effect of damages on earthquake detection being the

most notable exception), the coefficient on the sum of past events is insignificant, suggesting that

additional lags are unimportant. Moreover, the sums of the various l coefficients, shown at the

bottom of each table, are comparable to the sums found in the regressions in Tables 3 and 4 of

our paper and do not vary much across various lag specifications. For example, the sum of

deaths for a 5 year lag for earthquake-proof buildings, shown in panel A of Table A4, is 0.185,




                                                                                               A11
compared to 0.187 in the reduced form regression in Table 3 of the paper. The largest range of

the sums occurs for flood control in response to deaths, with a range from 0.621-0.857.

Appendix 5. Further Sensitivity Analysis

The reduced form models presented in the paper use damage lagged 6 years to avoid endogeneity

concerns. The instrumental variables model include instruments for damage, and thus include

only a one year lag so as to ease interpretation of the stock variable. However, this may lead to

changes in the lagged damage coefficients, since the lagged values in the reduced form equation

include both the direct effect of the event on innovation and the indirect effect of the lagged

event changing the existing knowledge stock.

To assess whether moving from a six-year lag to a one-year lag affects the results, Tables A5-A6

present three results. For each technology, column (1) is the reduced form results presented in

Tables 3 or 4 (corresponding to column 1 in those tables). Columns (2) & (3) use instrumental

variables for knowledge and deaths (or damages).                            Column (2) uses the six-year lagged

knowledge stock, and column (3) uses the one-year lagged knowledge stock, as in column (2) for

each technology in Tables 3 and 4.26 In all cases, the results are similar. Moreover, the sum of

deaths or damages is larger in both columns (2) and (3) for all cases except flood control (where

the results are insignificant), suggesting that it is the use of instrumental variables, and not

changing the lagged knowledge stock, that leads to slightly larger estimates.




26
  No results are presented for drought-resistant crops, as the model using instruments with the six-year knowledge stock did not
converge to a solution.

Appendix 6. Instrument Quality

To assess the quality of our instruments, Table A7 includes the partial R2 and Shea partial R2

statistics for each of our endogenous variables for each technology. With multiple endogenous

variables, simply assessing the F-statistic of the excluded instruments is not a sufficient test of

the strength of the instrument (Baum 2006).         Shea’s partial R2 statistic accounts for the

intercorrelations among instruments. If the Shea partial R2 is significantly smaller than the

standard partial R2, it suggests that there are not enough unique instruments to identify each

endogenous variable. As we see in Table A1, that is not the case, as both partial R2 values are

similar for each variable.

However, as discussed in the text, the instruments for flood control and drought-resistant crops

are weak, as the partial R2 values are below 0.05 for nearly all variables. Thus, for these

technologies we have more faith in our reduced form regressions. Given that there are few

differences between the reduced form and instrumental variable results when the instruments are

stronger in the case of earthquake, we do believe that these reduced form estimates are valid.
