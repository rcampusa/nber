                                              ABSTRACT

Debtors bear the brunt of a decline in asset prices associated with financial crises and policies aimed
at partial debt relief may be warranted to boost growth in the midst of crises. Drawing on the US experience
during the Great Recession of 2008-09 and historical evidence in a large panel of countries, we explore
why the political system may fail to deliver such policies. We find that during the Great Recession
creditors were able to use the political system more effectively to protect their interests through bailouts.
More generally we show that politically countries become more polarized and fractionalized following
financial crises. This results in legislative stalemate, making it less likely that crises lead to meaningful
macroeconomic reforms.

I. Introduction

        Financial crises lead to severe economic downturns because of their asymmetric impact

on debtors.1 The reason behind this empirical observation is that most external finance in the

world is raised through non-contingent debt. Hence the amount that debtors owe to creditors is

not made contingent on the aggregate state of the economy. Consequently, in the event of a

financial crisis such as an economy-wide decline in asset prices, the brunt of the losses are borne

by debtors. A reduction in the net worth of borrowers can lead to a reduction in real activity via

either the investment or consumption channel.2

        There is substantial evidence that policies aimed at better ex-post risk sharing between

debtors and creditors after a financial crisis lead to superior economic outcomes. For example,

Kroszner (1998) shows that large-scale debt relief related to repudiation of gold-indexation in

debt contracts benefitted both equity and debt holders of firms. Countries that left the Gold

Standard earlier in the Great Depression--which resulted in inflation and reduced debt burdens

for nominal debt contracts--escaped the downturn more quickly (Eichengreen and Temin, 2000).

        We begin with the observation that there are a number of scenarios in which an ex-post

transfer of resources--in the form of debt forgiveness, debt moratoria, or inflation-- from

creditors to debtors in response to a financial crisis is welfare improving.3 However, such

  The evidence goes back to at least Fisher (1933), and supporting evidence has been found in Mishkin (1978), King
(1994), Olney (1999), Koo (2009), Mian and Sufi (2010, 2011a, 2011b), Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011), and Glick and
Lansing (2010). Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2011) study 200 recessions in 14 advanced countries from 1870 to
2008 and show a very strong relation between the ex ante increase in private debt and the ex post severity of the
recession.

Krugman (2011) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2011) on consumption.
3
  This of course is a strong assumption, but we feel it is justified given the substantial empirical and theoretical
evidence discussed above. A very large number of commentators have argued that debt forgiveness would give a
boost to growth. See: Kenneth Rogoff
(http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Understanding_the_Second_Great_Contraction_An_interview_with_Kenneth_
Rogoff_2871 ), the editorial board of Bloomberg (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-06/for-the-u-s-
economy-the-real-slam-dunk-answer-is-debt-forgiveness-view.html ), and Nouriel Roubini (http://www.project-
syndicate.org/commentary/roubini42/English )

                                                                                                                   1
transfers can only be approved and mediated by the political process. For example, Bolton and

Rosenthal (2002) build a model in which ex-post debt forgiveness is optimal and must be

approved via a voting mechanism. In this paper we investigate if such political mechanisms are

feasible.

         Even if partial debt forgiveness is option in the aftermath of a financial crisis, creditors

are going to fight any such policy. There is thus a likely political tug-of-war between creditors

and debtors in the aftermath of a financial crisis.4 We investigate the political economy of the

creditor-debtor conflict using data from both the United States and other countries.

         Relative to European countries, the US has more lenient bankruptcy regulations allowing

for a greater sharing of risk when a negative aggregate shock occurs. There is some evidence that

for a given decline in house prices and a given initial leverage ratio, indebted households in the

US are more likely to declare default and partially relieve their debt burdens compared to

households in Europe. Nonetheless, in all of these countries, debtors are much more severely

impacted than creditors in a financial crisis.

         We investigate the political conflict between debtors and creditors using historical cross-

country data on financial crises, as well as data from the recent US financial crisis. Mian, Sufi

and Trebbi (2010a) show that both debtors (homeowners with mortgage debt outstanding) and

creditors (shareholders and creditors in US financial institutions) actively lobbied their respective

legislators to push for bailout legislation that would transfer resources from tax-payers to

themselves. While both debtors and creditors were successful in getting their respective


4
  While the analysis of this paper mostly focuses on the clash between creditors and debtors in the aftermath of a
financial crisis, another interesting topic is the alignment of creditors, debtors, and political facilitators (e.g.
Congress) in the expansion of debt that leads to financial crises. These are recurring observations. Romer and
Weingast (1991) in their analysis of the buildup to the Savings and Loans crisis discuss the role of constituent
interests and Congress in facilitating S&L gambling for resurrection through sparse and ineffective legislative and
regulatory effort. Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi (2010b) present similar evidence for the 2000-2006 housing boom. Nunez
and Rosenthal (2004) discuss bankruptcy reform in the early 2000’s.

                                                                                                                       2
legislation passed in 2008, the mortgage relief legislation desired by debtors was smaller in

magnitude and was a failure in terms of implementation. In contrast, the bailout of US financial

institutions was implemented quickly with a massive injection of government funds into banks.

        The success in implementation of the financial bailout contrasts sharply with the ultimate

impotence of the mortgage relief legislation. This is despite the fact that low net worth

homeowners with mortgages bore the brunt of the financial shock. Using data from the Federal

Reserve's Flow of Funds, we show that the collapse in house prices was much more dramatic

than the decline in financial wealth. Thus while there was an active political tug of war between

creditors and debtors, creditors were more effective in protecting their interests. A possible

politico-economic explanation comes from collective action theory (Olson, 1965). Collective

action is predicated on the fact that few, highly politically organized banks should be more

effective than millions of unorganized mortgage holders.

        Looking at historical cross-country data on financial crises, there is some evidence that

reforms aimed at reducing creditor rights are more likely to take place in the aftermath of

banking and currency crises. In fact most of the changes in creditor rights, excluding ex-Soviet

bloc transition economies, in the last three decades have been in the direction of reducing

creditor rights. Yet such changes are not very common and mostly involve changes in the

bankruptcy code, which fail to significantly alter the debtor-creditor distribution of net wealth in

the event of a financial crisis.

        Political polarization may help to explain why legislation addressing ex-post risk sharing

after a financial crisis is difficult to pass. We find robust evidence that politics after a crisis is

plagued by polarized interests. Using the Reinhart and Rogoff (2009, 2011) comprehensive data

set on financial crises, we show that banking, currency, inflation, or debt crises lead to greater



                                                                                                         3
ideological polarization in society, greater fractionalization of the legislative body, and a

decrease in the size of the working majority of the ruling coalition. The size of the governing

coalition shrinks after almost any type of crisis (banking, currency, or inflation crises); at the

same time, political fragmentation increases. These novel stylized facts have crucial implications

for the study of macroeconomic response to crises.

       Weaker governments mean political stalemate. Stronger opposition and more fragmented

legislatures constrain the implementation of reforms of any kind. This endogenous response of

political preferences and alliances in the face of financial crises may lead to political gridlock

and makes it harder to achieve compromise on macroeconomic intervention and bailouts. The

post-housing crisis US congressional gridlock of 2010-2011 appears the norm, not the exception.

       In general, it is not theoretically obvious why individuals polarize systematically in the

aftermath of a financial crisis. Perhaps large negative shocks change radically voters’ beliefs

about what good policy is. However, even abstracting from policy uncertainty, one can

conjecture that creditors and debtors naturally polarize in the aftermath of a financial crisis.

Debtors become insolvent precisely at the time creditors are more in need of seeing their

outstanding credit is serviced. In fact, the same write-off that can be inconsequential to a creditor

during an expansion may prove lethal in bad times.

       The increase in polarization and political gridlock in the aftermath of financial crises is

crucial in evaluating specific ‘mechanism design’ solutions after a financial crisis. For example,

Bolton and Rosenthal (2002) argue that in the event an economy suffers collectively from a debt

overhang problem, as was the case in the Great Depression and the Cotton Panic of 1819,

legislatures may be relied upon to intervene and pass legislation calling for collective debt relief.




                                                                                                     4
Evidence of this type of response is available. Alston (1984) studies the case of the role of farm

foreclosure rates during the Depression and its importance as driver of state-wide debt moratoria.

         However, our empirical findings suggest that relying on a voting mechanism to

renegotiate financial contracts at a national level may not be feasible. More generally, voting

outcomes are not necessarily driven by what is in the national economic interest. Instead, voting

and political debate are driven by a complex interaction of shifting voter preferences, strategic

lobbying, and special interest politics. For instance, the strategic delay of efficient reform with

the goal of shifting costs of implementation on political counterparties has been documented

both theoretically (Alesina and Drazen, 1991; Drazen and Grilli, 1993) and empirically (Alesina

et al., 2006). It may thus be better to think of alternative mechanism design arrangements to

resolve collective debt overhang problems. We discuss some of these possibilities in conclusion.

Secondly, higher political polarization means higher thresholds to achieve policy support. This

implies that of two different constituencies struggling for government support, possibly on equal

merits but with different degrees of political organization (e.g. organized big banks versus

diffused mortgage holders), only the politically organized group will get the bailout. From this

selective intervention, additional economic inequality and political polarization may ensue,

compounding and amplifying the initial political effects of the crisis.

         This paper is related to recent political events in the aftermath of the global financial

crisis. Many observers have commented on the heightened gridlock in politics in both

Washington and Europe.5 Our results suggest that political gridlock and polarization is more

common in the aftermath of financial crises. This is in contrast to research advocating crisis as

potential mechanism for unlocking efficient macroeconomic reform (Drazen and Grilli, 1993;

Drazen and Easterly, 2001). Indeed, our evidence on post-crisis political stalemate appears a

reasonable candidate in explaining the more protracted and deeper nature of downturns after

financial crises, an empirical regularity discussed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart

and Reinhart (2010).

       The large distributional shifts as a consequence of a debt-induced financial crisis raise the

stakes for everyone in the political process. We should not be surprised with increased

polarization and conflict between the “haves” and “have-nots”. Such polarization may manifest

itself within countries, e.g., the recent wave of Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States.

Polarization, and even conflict, can also manifest itself across countries, e.g., the polarization of

positions on fiscal stance between Germany and Southern Europe in the fall of 2011 or the

ideological polarization ensuing crises in 1920s’ Europe and the Great Depression that ultimately

led to World War II.

       Finally, this is a consequential finding also in explaining persistent instability after

financial crises, for instance in terms of triggering sovereign debt ‘secondary’ crises.

International financial markets are often sensitive to the lack of sound ex-post political response

at the country level, which may factor into risk premia. This lack of response, however, follows

naturally from the political polarization we document.



II. Debtors and Creditors after a Financial Crisis

       In this section, we explain why the conflict of interest between debtors and creditors is

central to our understanding of why financial crises lead to severe economic downturns. We



                                                                                                        6
show how shocks to economic conditions and asset prices are amplified by debt, and we explore

the mechanisms in place meant to deal with the asymmetric losses imposed on debtors when

asset prices and economic conditions collapse. We argue that the existing mechanisms are often

ill-suited for resolving the financial crisis, and conclude that there is a meaningful role for

political intervention to impose a more even distribution of the losses among creditors and

debtors.

A. The Economic Cost of Financial Crises

       There is a very large literature devoted to the question of how financial crises lead to

economic disruptions. The common theme in this literature is that the distribution of shocks

between debtors and creditors matters. Since a negative shock is primarily absorbed by debtors,

the net worth of debtors is most severely impacted in the face of a negative aggregate shock. As

a result, the distribution of net worth becomes more skewed against debtors. As we explain

below, such distributional shifts can lead to a negative impact on total output and employment by

disrupting investment or aggregate demand.

The Investment Channel of Financial Crises

       The influential work of Bernanke and Gertler (1989) explains how a shock to the net

worth of borrowers reduces their ability to borrow. Agency problems such as the borrowers'

ability to renege on debt payments mean that lenders require borrowers to have equity in a

project. Given this equity requirement, a decline in the net worth of borrowers driven by a

decline in the value of assets they hold will reduce their overall capacity to borrow. This

borrowing constraint channel means that overall investment will fall even if there remain as

many positive NPV projects as before the shock (see also Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997).




                                                                                                   7
       A reduction in the borrowing capacity of the entrepreneurial class with access to

investment projects leads to a slowdown in investment when otherwise profitable investment

projects exist. There is a large literature that discusses such borrowing constraints in the context

of financial crises. A common prescription in such discussions is to transfer resources back to the

debtors to boost investment. We return to the political feasibility of implementing such reforms

in the next section.

The Consumption Channel of Financial Crises

       A related transmission channel of financial crises is the effect of reduced net worth on the

consumption of debtors. The idea goes back to the debt-deflation hypothesis of Fisher (1933) and

was discussed by King (1994); this idea has gained traction in the context of the Great Recession

(e.g., Eggertsson and Krugman, 2011; Guerrieri and Lorenzoni, 2011).

       The consumption channel focuses on the accumulation of debt by households followed

by an event that wipes out the net worth of debtors, leading to tightened borrowing constraints

and reduced liquidity. The severe shock forces debtors to cut back on consumption. Should one

worry about a sharp decline in debtors’ consumption from an aggregate perspective? The answer

to this question depends on general equilibrium feedbacks and whether the creditors are able or

willing to increase their consumption in the face of reduced consumption by debtors.

       Recent theoretical work such as Eggertsson and Krugman (2011) points out scenarios

where nominal price rigidity and a zero lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates make it

difficult for aggregate demand to remain stable. Consider for example the recent episode in the

United States. A strong decline in the housing market forced indebted households to cut back on

consumption. The decline in debtors’ consumption means that savers or creditors must increase

their consumption in order to keep aggregate demand constant.



                                                                                                       8
       But why would creditors increase their consumption relative to earlier levels? Such an

increase is possible only if creditors can be enticed to consume more either through lower prices

or lower interest rates. However, both of these channels have limited success in practice.

Nominal prices may be rigid downwards. Moreover, even if significant deflation were possible,

it may exacerbate the problem by increasing the real burden of household debt, which will

further depress consumption by debtors. The alternative channel--lower nominal interest rates--

may also have limitations. In particular, what if even at zero nominal interest rate creditors are

unwilling to increase consumption significantly?

       Philippon and Midrigan (2011) focus on a specific case related to the liquidity role of

housing. In their framework, debtors are households that used their house as collateral in a cash-

in-advance constraint model. The sharp reduction in house prices leads to a sharp pull-back in

consumption for these households. With nominal rigidities and structural adjustment frictions in

labor markets, they also show that this pull-back in consumption can lead to a severe recession.

       In both of these environments, there may be a need for collective action to increase

consumption. As in the case of investment channel, policy prescriptions in the consumption

channel require a net transfer in favor of debtors to resolve the debt overhang problem. This may

be done through explicit policies of debt relief or via taxation and spending on behalf of

creditors.

       Two recent papers provide empirical evidence to show that the consumption channel is

indeed very powerful and responsible for a large fraction of the decline in US output and

unemployment. Mian, Rao and Sufi (2011) show that during the recent US recession

consumption decline was significantly stronger in counties with more indebted households.

Moreover, there was no equivalent increase in consumption by non-indebted households despite



                                                                                                     9
interest rates reaching historical lows. As a result, aggregate demand fell sharply in 2009 and

2010.

        Mian and Sufi (2011b) look at the employment consequences of the fall in aggregate

demand. They show that the larger decline in demand in counties hit hardest by the financial

crisis is also associated with a larger decline in non-tradable employment in these counties. Since

non-tradable employment has to depend on local demand for output, it suffers the consequences

of the local demand collapse. Employment in tradable sectors falls everywhere uniformly, since

it only depends on the country-wide fall in aggregate demand. Their empirical results show that

over 65% of the drop in employment during the Great Recession can be attributed to the fall in

aggregate demand driven by indebted households.

        The discussion above has focused on private debt accumulated by firms or households.

However, the problem is similar if the debt instead belongs to a sovereign entity. The same

investment and consumption mechanisms highlighted earlier become operative at the public

sector level when the debt in question is sovereign. In particular, the debtor country (e.g.,

Greece) demand will fall as the country is forced to cut pensions and other public spending in the

face of a sovereign debt crisis. And in the absence of an equivalent positive change in demand

for debtor country goods from creditor nations, the debtor’s economy will plunge into a

recession.

B. Default Mechanisms for Dealing with Financial Crises

        The preceding section argues that a sharp reduction in the net worth of debtors in

response to a financial crisis can lead to a sharp decline in investment and consumption. The

combination of high leverage and a negative asset price shock leads to a large imbalance in the

net worth positions of creditors and debtors, which we have argued is at the heart of the



                                                                                                  10
economic malaise that follows. As a result, our argument is that there is a need for explicit policy

intervention to address the imbalance in net wealth created between debtors and creditors.

       However, before going into the political process in more detail, it is important to

understand the legal and regulatory mechanisms put in place to deal with the potential imbalance

between debtors and creditors. Doing so is also important for understanding the default

bargaining position that debtors and creditors have in a post-financial crisis political process. For

example, if the legal system gives creditors complete recourse to go after debtors’ existing assets

and future cash flows, then creditors will have a stronger incentive to resist changes to the status

quo. On the other hand, debtors will also be more inclined to fight the political battle if they have

more to lose in the status quo. Overall, stronger creditor rights in the face of a financial crisis

might lead to more polarization between debtors and creditors.

       The most common arrangement for dealing with the inability of debtors to pay creditors

is bankruptcy law. However, there are two main limitations of bankruptcy regimes in alleviating

the debt overhang problem. First, bankruptcy becomes operative only when the debtor declares

default and stops making payments on his debt. This is not necessarily the relevant margin. For

example, in the Eggertsen and Krugman (2011) model, there is no default on debt and yet

aggregate demand goes down as debtors desperately try to pay down their existing debts in the

face of a negative shock to collateral and debt capacity. This is especially relevant for the US,

where 25% of mortgages are underwater yet most homeowners do not default on their

mortgages.

       The second reason bankruptcy regimes do not work very well is that in a financial crisis

the economy cannot absorb a large-scale fire sale of assets disposed of in bankruptcy. For

example, consider firm assets that can only be bought and run by other entrepreneurs that have



                                                                                                      11
the know-how of the relevant industry. As discussed above, the core problem that the

entrepreneurial class does not have sufficient net worth and borrowing capacity. In such an

environment, a large scale attempt to sell firm assets will lead to a sharp decline in the value of

such assets, putting further pressure on entrepreneurs struggling to raise capital (e.g., Shleifer

and Vishny, 1992).

       In the context of the housing collapse and US financial crisis, Mian, Sufi and Trebbi

(2011) study the impact of foreclosures on the real economy. Using exogenous variation in the

likelihood of foreclosures due to state laws, they show that forced sales of houses had a large

effect in terms of further reducing house prices, residential investment, and consumption. On

both theoretical and empirical grounds, bankruptcy regimes are unlikely to help in alleviating the

macroeconomic costs associated with financial crises.

C. The impact of bankruptcy regimes on debtor-creditor conflict

       We have argued that the typical bankruptcy regime is not adequate in addressing the

gross imbalance between debtors and creditors created during a financial crisis. Nonetheless, on

the margin, bankruptcy design does influence the extent to which financial losses are shared

between debtors and creditors.

       There are important differences in the design of bankruptcy regimes across countries. For

example, it is typically harder and more expensive to declare bankruptcy in Europe relative to the

United States. Moreover, in the event of a bankruptcy, most European countries allow full

recourse to an individual’s assets and future wages. European creditors can – and often do – go

after a borrower’s other assets and wages in case there is a deficiency in the value of collateral

and outstanding principal. Recourse is significantly more limited in the United States and

qualifying borrowers can discharge most debts by declaring bankruptcy.



                                                                                                      12
        A European Mortgage Federation study in 2007 found that recourse was allowed in

Belgium, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Ireland, Portugal, and the United

Kingdom. Borrowers in these countries cannot simply default on their mortgage and be cleared

of all their mortgage debts. The higher level of recourse and tougher rules for declaring

bankruptcy are likely to prevent borrowers from declaring default. As a result, debtors in

European countries are more likely to absorb financial shocks internally than declare default.

        Does tougher bankruptcy regulation force borrowers to absorb more of the losses and

make them less likely to declare default? We investigate this question by comparing the change

in default rates across Europe and the United States during the 2007 to 2009 global housing

crisis. Since the bankruptcy regime is relatively more lax in the United States, one would expect

a larger increase in default rates. However, such a comparison can only be made if the macro

environment is otherwise similar between the United States and the European countries in

question.

        There are two key variables that one needs to control for when comparing changes in

default rates on mortgages across countries. First, the comparison countries should experience a

similar decline in house prices. If the decline in house prices is smaller, then the change in

default rates is also likely to be smaller, even if the bankruptcy regime has no impact on default

rates. Second, for any given level of house price drops, the increase in the default rate depends

on the level of indebtedness of the borrowing households. For example, if a country has 60

percent loan to value ratio in general, then it is less likely to declare default relative to a country

that experiences the same decline in house prices but has 80 percent of loan to value ratio on

average.




                                                                                                      13
       For a meaningful comparison of default rates across countries, we need to combine data

on default rates with data on house price changes as well as data on the amount of leverage in a

country. We were able to collect all this information for five countries (US, U.K., Spain, France

and Ireland) from 2007 to 2009 using data from the European Mortgage Federation. Figure 1

shows the three main variables of interest for the five countries: the 2007 mortgage debt to GDP

ratio, the change in default rates from 2007 to 2009, and the change in log house prices from

2007 to 2009. In order to display the three variables together in a single graph we renormalize

change in default rate by multiplying it by ten.

       The change in default rate (red bar) for USA between 2007 and 2009 is 5.9 percentage

points. While the default rate level in 2007 is not shown in Figure 1, it is quite low and similar

across the five countries (0.4%, 1.2%, 0.7%, 1.9%, and 2.1% for France, Ireland, Spain, the

United Kingdom and the United States, respectively). However, the change in default rate stands

out for the United States and is at least twice as large as the change in default rate for any of the

other four European countries.

       All European countries in Figure 1 have high recourse and tough bankruptcy laws

relative to the United States. The very large increase in default rates for the US is consistent with

the notion that lower level of recourse and easier bankruptcy legislation helps indebted

borrowers declare default. As a related interpretation, it is also possible that differences in laws

reflect different cultural attitudes toward default in the United States and Europe.

       While the United States has the highest increase in default rates along with having the

most debtor-friendly bankruptcy regime, we want to caution against a strong causal

interpretation. The data are limited and we do not control for other factors (such as underlying

quality of marginal borrowers in each country).



                                                                                                       14
        Nonetheless, Figure 1 shows two of the key variables that are relevant for understanding

the magnitude of the negative housing shock in each country. The green bar depicts the change

in house prices between 2007 and 2009. The stronger the decline in house prices, the higher the

likely increase in default rates. The change in house prices for the United States is 23.3 percent,

but it is not the strongest decline. House prices dropped even further in Ireland, with a 30.0

percent decline.

        The blue bar depicts mortgage debt to GDP ratio for each country in 2007. The mortgage

to GDP ratio is highest for United Kingdom at 85.4% followed by United States and Ireland at

76.9% and 73.7% respectively. The mortgage to GDP ratio is a good indicator of the extent of

leverage in the housing sector. For the three countries for which we also have the average loan to

value ratio, this ratio lines up closely with the mortgage to GDP ratio.6 For a given change in

house prices, one would expect the change in default rates to be higher in countries with more

mortgage debt to GDP.

        A collective look at the three housing market variables in Figure 1 shows that the United

States experienced the highest increase in default rates by far, despite some of the European

countries experiencing very similar (if not stronger) decline in house price (e.g. Ireland) and

having similar housing leverage (Ireland and the United Kingdom). Furthermore, the decline in

housing prices could very well have been stronger in countries such as the United Kingdom if

they also had more lax bankruptcy laws as more houses would have been put on the market as

foreclosure sales.7

  Mortgage to GDP ratio is 85.4%, 76.9% and 61.4% for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain,

         A key problem in the aftermath of financial crises is debt overhang which

disproportionately affects debtor investment and consumption, necessitating debtor relief.

Existing regulations, such as bankruptcy laws, determine to some extent the ease with which

debtors can discharge their debt obligations in case of default. However, such mechanisms are

typically inadequate given the nature and magnitude of the aggregate debt overhang problem.

         Given the inadequacy of mechanisms already in place, the extent to which policies are

implemented to address debt overhang after a financial crisis becomes a matter of political and

legislative debate. For example, Bolton and Rosenthal (2002) present a political economy model

where it is possible to “certify” debt overhang states of the world through the political voting

mechanism and renegotiate financial contracts. However, in practice, creditors are likely to push

back as it is not in their individual self-interest to provide debtor relief at their expense. As a

result, political battle lines are likely to be drawn between debtors and creditors. In this section,

we ask, how does the political process resolve this conflict between debtors and creditors?

A. The US Experience

         The 2007-2009 US financial crisis provides an interesting case study to examine the

political tug of war between debtors and creditors. Table 1 provides information on the net worth

distribution for US homeowners at the beginning of the recession.8 As has been well

documented, column 1 shows a very striking increase in net wealth as one moves up the

distribution. The lowest quintile had a median net worth of $32 thousand whereas the highest

quintile had a median net worth of $1.2 million.




8
 According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, homeowners in the United States made up 69% of the population.
We isolate the sample to homeowners because levered homeowners are the most relevant group of debtors in our
analysis. An analysis of renters during the Great Recession is also of interest but we exclude them from our analysis
here.

                                                                                                                   16
       Columns 2 and 3 show another very important result: as a fraction of total assets, homes

represented the lion's share for low net worth homeowners, whereas high net worth owners had a

large amount of financial assets. The cell means in columns 2 and 3 are not adjusted for leverage.

Columns 4 and 5 show that low net worth households were much more levered, especially with

regard to their housing positions. We think of the lower net worth quintiles in Table 1 as debtors,

given their low net worth and levered position in housing. We think of the upper net worth

quintiles in Table 1 as creditors, given their high net worth and large holdings of financial assets.

       The information in Table 1 allows us to clearly see how the sharp ex-post decline in

house prices from 2007 to 2009 affected the net wealth distribution. Housing assets were the

main asset for low net worth individuals, and their housing positions were quite levered. As a

result, the collapse in house prices disproportionately affected low net worth individuals. Mian,

Rao, and Sufi (2011) show that at the 10th percentile of the county-level house price distribution,

house prices dropped by 40 to 60% depending on the house price index used. This decline would

completely wipe out the entire net worth of the median household in lowest quintile of the net

worth distribution. CoreLogic reports that 25% of mortgages are underwater; for the low net

worth individuals in the US, this effectively means that their total net worth is negative.

       It is in this context that Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2010a), henceforth MST, document the

political economy of two major bailout bills that were passed in the US Congress in 2008. The

first of these bills, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act (AHRFPA),

provided up to $300 billion in Federal Housing Administration insurance for renegotiated

mortgages, which translated into using public funds to provide debtor relief. MST show that

legislators with more constituents in financial distress were more likely to vote in favor of the




                                                                                                    17
bill. Similarly, legislators in competitive districts were more likely to respond to constituent

pressure.

        At the same time, creditors--i.e., the shareholders and debt-holders of large financial

institutions--pushed a second bill which was closely tied to protecting their own interests. The

$700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) enabled the Treasury Department

to bailout AIG which had provided insurance against losses to creditors. The bill also allowed the

Treasury to put public money as preferred shares in banks, therefore protecting creditors from

realizing losses. MST show that legislators that had received larger campaign contributions from

the financial industry were more likely to vote in favor of the EESA bill.

        It is worth clarifying why we classify EESA, which eventually led to the Troubled Asset

Relief Program, as a bailout bill that primarily benefited creditors. While the banks were highly

levered, the primary beneficiaries of the legislation were the creditors to and shareholders of

highly levered financial institutions. As seen in Table 1, high net worth individuals hold the

lion's share of financial assets in the US economy, which includes these claims on financial

institutions.

        While both debtors and creditors were effective in passing legislation in their favor, there

were two important differences in the magnitude of their effectiveness. First, the debtor friendly

bill provided fewer resources ($300 billion versus $700 billion) than the creditor friendly

legislation. The difference in resources devoted to the two bills becomes even more stark when

one takes into account the fact that debtors faced substantially larger losses - in both absolute and

proportional terms - than creditors in the face of the US housing crisis.

        Second, while the creditor friendly EESA bill was fully implemented and executed, the

housing legislation was a miserable failure. As of December 2008, there were only 312



                                                                                                   18
applications for relief under the program and the secretary of Housing and Urban Development

was highly critical of the program.9 When the Obama Administration arrived and implemented

the Home Affordability Modification Program under AHRFPA, their initial goal was to help 3 to

4 million homeowners with loan modifications. In July, 2011 President Obama admitted that

HAMP program has “probably been the area that's been most stubborn to us trying to solve the

problem.”

          It is worth noting that one of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness of the HAMP

program has been the lack of cooperation from creditors. The initial legislation made creditor

cooperation completely voluntary, thereby enabling many creditors to opt out of the program

despite qualifying borrowers. In fact, as Representative Barney Frank noted, banks actually

helped formulate the program in the summer of 2008.10

          What was the net result of these programs? Figure 2 plots total household asset value at a

quarterly frequency and also breaks it down into household financial assets (green line) and real

estate assets (red line). Financial assets include various debt instruments as well as stocks. Both

financial and real estate assets declined in the initial phase of the financial crisis. However, by

2011, while financial assets have largely recovered, real estate assets remain at depressed values.

In terms of numbers, between 2007Q2 to 20011Q2, total (nominal) wealth dropped by $7.25

trillion dollars and out of this housing wealth loss is $5.92 trillion.

          Financial wealth dropped by only $1.33 trillion while housing wealth dropped by $5.92

trillion. Although not reported separately in the flow of funds data, it is likely that once the

decline in financial wealth due to stocks is taken out, the decline in value of debt held by

creditors will be even smaller. In other words, while debtors lost a major chunk of their overall

wealth represented by home equity, their liabilities largely remained fixed in nominal terms.

Even some of the losses passed onto creditors due to defaulting mortgages were insured either

via GSEs or the EESA bailout package.

        Why were creditors better able to protect their interests in the recent US financial crisis?

It is difficult to conclusively know the answer, but one possibility is that creditors were relatively

smaller in number (due to the concentration of wealth) and better organized through financial

institutions. Indeed, Johnson and Kwak (2010) notably identify thirteen banks (and their

bankers). Textbook collective action theory á la Olson (1965) would predict that politically

organized and cohesive special interests, such as banks, would be ideally suited to influence

government policy. Concentrated benefits (to banks) often trump diffused costs borne by

taxpayers. The effective bailout of General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford, which followed TARP,

seem to conform to this explanation as well. Debtors, on the other hand, were numerous and

diffused, therefore suffering from typical collective action problems. In light of the 2008

presidential elections few months ahead, millions of struggling mortgage holders represented a

large enough electoral constituency to obtain policy recognition through the AHRFPA, but

apparently were not a sufficiently cohesive force to effectively profit from the bailout down the

road.

B. Cross-country evidence on financial crises and change in creditor rights

        The seminal work of La Porta et al (1998), followed by Djankov et al. (2007), introduced

cross-country index of “creditor rights” from 1978 to 2002. The index captures the rights of

secured lenders under a country’s legal system. A country has stronger creditor rights if: (i) there

are restrictions for a debtor to file for reorganization; (ii) creditors are able to seize collateral in




                                                                                                           20
bankruptcy automatically without any “asset freeze”; (iii) secured creditors are paid first; and

(iv) control shifts away from management as soon as bankruptcy is declared.

         Stronger creditor rights favor creditors in bargaining situation vis-à-vis debtors. Djankov

et al. (2007) show that creditor rights, which are partly determined by a country’s history such as

legal origins, lead to stronger growth in credit. This result is to be expected, since stronger

creditor rights will make creditors more likely to extend credit and offer it at cheaper prices.

However, as the discussion in section II.A. highlighted, such rights may not be helpful ex-post in

the event of a financial crisis. There is likely to be a tension between creditor rights and the push

to introduce reforms in the aftermath of a financial crisis.

         There is evidence in the Djankov et al. (2007) data on creditor rights that suggests this

tension is real. While the creditor rights index is remarkably stable, it does occasionally change

for a given country. Table 2 shows that there are twelve instances between 1978 and 2002 when

creditor rights deteriorate in a country, and eight instances when creditor rights are strengthened.

Six of the eight instances when creditor rights are strengthened involve transition economies

such as Romania, Lithuania and Bulgaria. These countries had very low creditor rights to begin

with and were in the process of broadly changing their legal code in conjunction with western

norms.

         What is more interesting is that most of the instances of a relaxation in creditor rights

involve established democracies. Moreover, the timing of these changes in creditor rights often

comes after a severe financial crisis. For example, Indonesia and Thailand actively reduced

creditor rights in the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Similarly, the

Nordic banking crisis of the early 1990s led to a relaxation in creditor rights in both Sweden and

Finland.



                                                                                                     21
         A more formal analysis of the likelihood of reduction in creditor rights in the face of

financial crises confirms the anecdotal evidence above. Employing Reinhart and Rogoff (2009,

2011), henceforth RR, information on banking, debt (external or otherwise), currency, and

inflation crises, it is possible to focus on within-country variation in creditor rights. Table 3

performs simple country fixed effect regressions of creditor rights in the sample of countries

which undergo a crisis, restricting to observations at most five years before and five years after

the crisis for comparison. The inclusion of country and year fixed effects allows to formally test

whether the reduction of creditor rights is systematic around financial crises.

         Notwithstanding the limited numbers of changers in the sample and the different

coverage of RR relative to Djankov et al. (2007), the evidence appears to go in this direction.

Across all four types of crises, the evidence points toward a relaxation of creditor rights after a

financial crisis (negative sign on the post-crisis indicator variable). In the case of banking and

currency crises the reduction is also highly statistically significant. Notice, however, that

magnitudes are not large, around 7 percent of a one-point decrease in creditor rights index

(which is the modal size of a change in the creditor right score), suggesting that creditor rights

get relaxed around crises, but that this type of policy change is not the norm after a financial

crisis.11 The following section will investigate the fundamental reasons for the sparseness of this

type of reform.

         Overall, while creditor rights promote the origination of more credit, a financial crisis

that results from excessive debt tends to reduce creditor rights. These results highlight a

fundamental tension between the benefits of stronger creditor rights ex-ante and the debt


11
   To be more explicit, given that the coefficient on post-crisis averages creditor rights decreases across all post-
crisis instances, one would expect a coefficient around -1 (the modal change) on the post-crisis dummy in the case
all crises were systematically followed by changes in creditor rights. The estimated coefficient in Table 3 is much
lower, -0.07, instead, indicating that less than 1 in 10 crises are followed by creditor rights decreases.

                                                                                                                    22
overhang costs associated with giving creditor too much power in the financial crisis state of the

world.

C. Cross-country evidence on financial crises and political polarization

           Ex-post relaxation of creditor rights is not the norm after a financial crisis. This section

highlights an underappreciated reason for this phenomenon: political polarization in the

aftermath of a financial crisis.

           More specifically, we show that financial crises are systematically followed by political

polarization and that this may result in gridlock and anemic reform. The logic is simple.

Financial crises polarize debtors and creditors in society. On the one hand, debtors are weakened

by a fall in the value of assets they hold. On the other hand, creditors become more sensitive to

write-offs during bad times (losing an extra dollar on a loan when a lender is close to be

insolvent is worse than when the lender is on solid grounds) and possibly more reluctant to

converge onto a renegotiated platform because of their increased reliance on the satisfaction of

the original terms of agreement.

           Although the debtor-creditor tug of war is hardly the only explanation of the current shift

of US voters’ ideological positions to extremes (e.g., the Tea Party versus Occupy Wall Street,

but also evidence from Gallup polls in Figure 3), it fits the profile. Furthermore, although the US

does not appear to suffer from systematic chipping-away from the moderate middle after

banking, currency, and market crashes according to self-reported Liberal-Conservative scores in

the American National Election Study Cumulative Data File 1948-2008 (see Figures 4a-4c), this

seems to be more the result of the lack of depth of the ‘typical’ US crisis. 12 The congressional

stalemate observed in the fall of 2011 debate on the national debt ceiling raise, with its

exceptional political salience and persistence, appears telling in this respect.
12
     The definition of crises is again derived from RR.

                                                                                                          23
         More systematically, Figure 5 considers de-trended (HP-filtered) congressional party

polarization levels as standard in the political science literature (see McCarthy et al., 2006) built

from ideological position scores and based on the spatial voting models of Poole and Rosenthal

(1985, 1997). Political polarization in the United States appears higher after banking crises and

market crashes, while lower after currency crises.13

         The US is no exception though. Increases in polarization of voters are a common feature

across all 70 countries sampled by RR. For example, South Korea's Gini coefficient increased by

6 percent in the four years after 1996 and the Asian financial crisis. Thailand experienced drastic

increases in economic disparity in the post-financial crisis period as well, particularly in the

North and Northeast areas. Both events led to political attrition within these countries. Indeed,

one would expect systematic shifts in political polarization on a systematic scale, which we show

below.

         The frequency of crises of the various types reported by RR and their distribution by year

are reported in Tables 5a and 5b. In Figure 6 we employ the official aggregate World Value

Survey from 1981-2008, which includes a question on self-positioning on the political scale (1 is

most liberal, 10 most conservative). The sample covers about 250,000 individual interviews from

60 countries, which we matched to the pre-crisis and post-crisis RR crisis indicators and then

collapsed based on their selected ideological bin. After a crisis, the share of centrists/moderates

in a country goes down in 3 out of 4 types of crisis and the share of extremists (left or right

radicals) goes up in 7 out of 8 possible cases. Interestingly, while banking and currency crises are

neutral (i.e. they increase extremists on both the left and the right of the political spectrum),



13
   There are almost no debt crises in the US that we can use for the analysis. A caveat in the interpretation of Figure
5 is that crises in the US are sparse and the number of congresses used to generate the graphs is very limited,
typically around 10-15. Once again we only include congresses within five years before and after the crisis.

                                                                                                                     24
inflation crises appear to produce more conservative extremists and debt crises produce many

more left-wing radicals.

       Further, financial crises move political systems toward systematically more polarized

legislatures and fragmented political scenarios. After a crisis, governments have to rely on

weaker coalitions, oppositions grow larger and more fragmented, and overall political

disintegration becomes the norm. Figures 7, 8, and 9 report the shift in the vote share of the

governing coalition, the vote share of the opposition (excluding unaligned parties, which are

political forces that may align alternatively with the government or the opposition), and the

overall degree of fragmentation within the legislative assembly, respectively, as reported by the

World Bank’s Database of Political Institutions. We observe in Figure 7 that ruling governments

become weaker after almost any type of financial crisis. We also observe that their opposition

grows in size (Figure 8) and that the overall fragmentation of the political environment

unambiguously increases (Figure 9).

       Differently, form the survey evidence discussed above, DPI’s cross-country and time

coverage is excellent and the DPI sample’s overlap with RR is almost perfect, which allows for a

more systematic analysis of the data. In Table 4 we report summary statistics useful for the

interpretation of Tables 5 and 6, where the issue of ‘politics after the crisis’ is explored in a

regression framework. Once again, the evidence points in a direction of increased political

polarization after a financial crisis. Table 5 performs pooled and country fixed effect regressions

of government vote shares, opposition vote shares, and polarization indexes in the sample of

countries which undergo a banking, currency, debt, or inflation crisis, again restricting to

observations to (at most) five years before and five years after the crisis for comparison

(similarly to what presented in Table 2).



                                                                                                    25
       We first examine unconditional mean differences pre and post crisis across countries. We

then include country and year fixed effects in order to capture country-specific unobserved

heterogeneity and time effects. Notice that the inclusion of time effects is particularly

demanding, as financial crises tend display cross-border contagion. Yet, all our results point

clearly in the direction of countries becoming more polarized post-crisis.

       The magnitudes of the estimated post-crisis differences are quantitatively meaningful.

For instance after a banking crisis the within-country analysis indicates a drop in government

electoral support of more than 6 percent, a sizeable drop relative to a sample mean of 56%. At

the same time, the opposition's gain is 7%, a sizeable increment relative to a sample mean vote

share of 37%. Qualitatively similar effects are observed also when considering the share of seats

in the legislative body held by government or opposition, as opposed to vote shares. We do not

report them for brevity.

       In Table 7, we explore measures of fractionalization, which consider the probability that

two representatives drawn at random within the government coalition, the opposition coalition,

or the assembly at large belong to different parties (hence, 1 indicates maximal fractionalization

and 0 no fractionalization). Fractionalization increases across the board for both the government

and the opposition after a financial crisis. However, it is sufficient to look at the sample means in

Table 4 to see that the increase is similar in relative terms for the governing coalition than for the

opposition. The probability of two legislators drawn at random from the government coalition

belonging to different parties increases by 2.5 percentage points, relative to a mean of 20%. For

opposition the post-crisis effect is 4.3 percentage points against an average fractionalization of

48%. Governments that may be initially monolithic before a financial crisis, tend to fragment in

its aftermath. Oppositions, in turn, both grow and fragment, with somewhat ambiguous effects



                                                                                                     26
on their relative strength vis-à-vis the ruling coalition (it may be harder to negotiate with

multiple opponents, but also fragmented opponents may be easier to divide).

        While we do not have direct evidence on reform implementation, it is easy to see how

these three facts would lead to political stalemate.14 Weak and disperse ruling coalitions are

known to breed stalemate and present leadership lacking room for maneuver (see Alesina et al.

2004 for an analysis of institutional features which produce endogenous insulation of leaders).



IV. Concluding Remarks and Discussion

        This paper begins by highlighting how financial crises put pressure on debtors and how

the ensuing debt-overhang problem deepens economic downturn. A potential solution discussed

in the macroeconomic and finance literature involves relaxing creditor rights and bailing out

(partially or totally) debtors.

        However, such policy interventions are rare. Why? Based on within US and cross-

country evidence we conjecture that bailouts and pro-debtor reforms may be stifled by

ideological polarization and political gridlock that systematically follow financial crises. Politics

after the crisis is substantially skewed in favor of stalemate, with systematically more polarized

voters, weaker governments, and more fragmented oppositions. Our results offer a political

economy explanation for why financial crises often lead to prolonged economic slumps and why

it becomes hard to reach a policy consensus in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Crises bring

gridlock through polarization. Gridlock delays reform and it possibly makes recovery slower,

explaining long post-crisis slumps (see Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; Reinhart and Reinhart, 2010).




14
 For strong evidence on the role of polarization on stalemate and policy gridlock in the US see Binder (2003),
Coleman (1999), and McCarthy, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006).

                                                                                                                 27
        The inability to reach a political consensus can lead to further losses. Gridlock brings

political uncertainty and markets for sovereign debt often respond heavily to such conditions.

Debt crises may be a natural consequence of gridlock. Recent U.S. and European events

highlight the cost that political indecisiveness imposes on the economy.

        Gridlock also brings selective policy intervention. If a reform overcomes political

gridlock, it is likely because of strong political organization by its constituency. Concentrated

special interests (banks) did get a sizeable bailout. Diffused special interests (mortgage debtors)

did not. Importantly, this mechanism feeds back into higher inequality in society and

polarization.

        Overall our aim in this paper is to highlight the shifting political landscape in the

aftermath of a financial crisis. It is a question that has not been extensively addressed in the

literature15 but has important economic consequences. Any model of post-crisis macro

intervention leaving this political feature aside forgoes what we believe is an important

dimension. Indeed, any type of post-crisis reform becomes harder, including bailouts. Crises are

occasionally thought of as critical junctures where macroeconomic reform unlocks by shattering

entrenched conditions. The opposite seems true.

        Since post-crisis politics makes it difficult to politically resolve the debt-overhang

problem ex-post, what other alternatives are there? One possibility is to explicitly put in place a

contingency in traditional non-contingent debt contracts. The contingency only needs to be

written on the aggregate state of the economy. For example, in mortgage contracts the

contingency could be the level of aggregate (or regional) price index. If the state of the economy,



15
  With some exceptions, such as Alesina et al. (2011) who study electoral consequences of large fiscal adjustments.
Brender and Drazen (2008) look at electoral consequences of fiscal and inflation performance, but with no emphasis
given to post-crisis recovery.

                                                                                                                28
or the housing index in this example, performs too poorly then the contingency could

automatically kick in and restructure the debt.

       The typical benefit of non-contingent debt is that it protects the lender from moral hazard

issues related to the borrower deliberately mis-utilizing the loan. However, if the contingency for

debt reduction is written on the aggregate state of the economy, such moral hazards continue to

be avoided. More generally, we believe that the mechanism design problem of contracting

around the debt-overhang problem for the overall economy is an important and practical issue to

investigate.
