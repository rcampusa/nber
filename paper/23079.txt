Comparing Apples to Oranges: Differences in Women’s and Men’s Incarceration and Sentencing
Outcomes

                                          ABSTRACT

Using detailed administrative records, we find that, on average, women receive lighter sentences
in comparison with men along both extensive and intensive margins. Using parametric and semi-
parametric decomposition methods, roughly 30% of the gender differences in incarceration cannot
be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender. We also find
evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male
offenders. There is little evidence, however, that tastes for gender discrimination are driving the
mean gender disparity or the variance in treatment between judges.

1     Introduction

    The incarceration of women has received attention from scholars and policy
makers in recent years, in large part because the incarceration rate of women
is rising more quickly than those of men (Carson and Golinelli (2012)). Al-
though the incarceration rate of women continues to be less than a tenth of the
rate for men, there is concern that incarceration of women, who are likely to
be custodial parents (Mumola (1999)), may have broad adverse consequences
for both their own future outcomes and those of their children. Further, in-
carceration is expensive and there is interest in whether it is being effectively
deployed to incapacitate or deter the worst potential offenders (Travis et al.
(2014)).
    Whereas incarcerated men tend to come from socioeconomically disadvan-
taged backgrounds, the women tend to be even worse off (Harrison and Beck
(2006)). The literature on incarcerated women documents poor outcomes for
the women and for their children (see Poehlmann, Dallaire, Loper, and Shear
(2010) for a review of the child development literature). A body of work
by Robert LaLonde and his co-authors has examined long-term changes for
women and their children after the women’s incarceration by assembling linked
administrative records. This research, using techniques that exploit within-
person variation, finds remarkably little adverse causal impact of incarcera-
tion on women’s employment (Cho and Lalonde (2008)), welfare dependency
(Butcher and LaLonde (2013)), and children’s test scores (Cho (2009)).
    In this paper, we step back to examine how women and men are treated at
the sentencing stage, investigating punishment differences between women and

                                       2
men who have been convicted of felonies. We use detailed data on the universe
of convicted felons in Kansas from 1998-2011 to investigate the differences
between women’s and men’s penalties, adjusting for detailed observables about
the elements of the offense, criminal history, and case facts. Trends in overall
and female incarceration in Kansas are similar to national patterns. Other
advantages include: Kansas has as representative a sentencing system as exists
among the varied jurisdictions in the U.S., high quality data, and random
assignment of cases to judges. These features are all discussed in detail later
in the paper.
   The raw punishment gap between women and men in incarceration and
in sentence length conditional upon incarceration both indicate that women
receive more lenient treatment. On average, women are 14 (drug crime) to 20
(non-drug crime) percentage points less likely to be incarcerated and receive
44 (non-drug crime) to 12 (drug crime) percent shorter sentences conditional
on incarceration. Using linear regressions and conditioning on available ob-
servables about the case, women are 5 to 6 percentage points less likely to be
incarcerated than men and receive 2 to 9 percent shorter sentences for non-
drug and drug crimes, respectively. We also investigate the punishment gaps
for non-drug crimes using semi-parametric techniques (DiNardo et al. (1996))
to examine the treatment of women who have the same observable character-
istics as men, finding evidence that the same activity by men and women is
treated quite differently in the criminal justice system even though Kansas is
a state where judges follow guidelines to structure sentencing discretion.
   Given a sizable unexplained portion of the gaps in punishment, we turn to


                                       3
examining the role of judicial behavior in determining these gaps with a focus
on the extensive margin of incarceration versus probation. We do this in two
ways. First, we use an event-study analysis (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan
(1993), Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (2003)) to trace out the impact of
entry into or exit out of the Kansas court system by “harsh” or “lenient”
judges on female incarceration.1 The entry of a “lenient” judge reduces the
probability of female incarceration by 5 percentage points, whereas the entry of
a “harsh” judge increases the incarceration probability by 5 roughly percentage
points for women.2 These represent large percentage effects on incarceration
probabilities for women given that the average women’s incarceration rate for
non-drug related crimes is 0.121.
    Second, we compute standard measures of between-judge variation in fe-
male incarceration rates. This analysis uncovers substantial judicial hetero-
geneity in sentencing; for example, being assigned the 75th percentile judge
rather than the 25th percentile judge increases the likelihood of incarceration
for women by roughly 8 percentage points, which constitutes a 67% increase.
Interestingly, there is slightly more variation across judges in women’s incar-
ceration rates in comparison with men’s. The heterogeneity is not driven by
gender-based case assignment nor is it the result of sampling error. Thus,
while women receive more lenient sentences on average, there is still consider-
able ex-ante uncertainty in the probability of incarceration tied to the identity
of the presiding judge.
    1
      “Harsh” and “lenient” judges are defined by whether a judge’s incarceration rate of non-
person crimes committed by male offenders falls in the upper or lower quartile, respectively.
    2
      We find that judicial exit has much less effect on incarceration probabilities for reasons
we will discuss.


                                               4
   Multiple reasons for differential treatment of women are proposed in various
literatures; women are less effective bargainers on their own behalf (Redlich
and Shteynberg (2015)), have weak social ties conditional on being in the crim-
inal justice system, and are often used as leverage in criminal cases against
intimates (Starr (2012)). While we cannot test these alternatives without
additional information, we can test the popular conception that judges are
chivalrous (Spohn (1999)) towards women by applying a rank-order test of
taste-based discrimination (Anwar and Fang (2006), Park (2015)). This ap-
proach examines whether the rank-order of judicial incarceration rates depends
on the offender’s gender. Our statistical test does not reject the null that judges
do not have tastes for discrimination in favor of female defendants. This sug-
gests that gender differences in unobservable characteristics, such as social ties
and effective bargaining, may better explain differences in sentencing outcomes
between men and women.
   The findings in this paper help shed light on the previous literature on
female incarceration and its impacts. The fact that there is a substantial
punishment gap between women and men, conditioning on all the observables
of the case, suggests that women who are incarcerated are more negatively
selected than the men who are incarcerated. This interpretation supports the
findings in LaLonde’s (and his co-authors’) work on incarcerated women which
looks at outcomes for the same women (and their children) before and after
incarceration and finds little adverse impact of incarceration.
   The findings here also comport with recent literature that exploits variation
in the probability of incarceration that arises due to random case-assignment


                                        5
across heterogeneous judges (Aizer and Doyle (2015)). This source of variation
might have different implications for the impact of incarceration on various life-
outcomes because it would compare women who are relatively more and less
negatively selected. Our finding that judges exhibit considerable heterogeneity
in their sentencing towards women supports use of this variation to study the
impact of female incarceration.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of sen-
tencing in Kansas, including descriptive statistics. We then turn to under-
standing the female-male punishment gap in Section III. Section IV investi-
gates judicial heterogeneity. Section V concludes.



2       Background

    Institutional Details
    Kansas employs sentencing guidelines to structure the punishments of crim-
inal offenses.3 Each felony is associated with a guideline sentence that recom-
mends either prison or probation as well as the sentence length. Figure 1
shows that the guideline sentence is a function of the severity of the crime and
the felon’s criminal history.4 In each cell of Figure 1, the three numbers are
the minimum, expected, and maximum sentence length (in months). The grey
    3
      More than 20 states use guidelines to structure criminal sentencing. See Stemen (2004)
for an evaluation of how well the Kansas guidelines meet their objectives.
    4
      In Kansas, the criminal severity level is the analogue to the base offense level in the
Federal Sentencing Guidelines. As in the Federal Guidelines, the criminal severity level is
determined by the crime of conviction. The Kansas Guidelines also allow for the possibility
that some cases will involve special circumstances that could warrant a sentencing enhance-
ment. However, unlike the Federal system, Kansan judges do not decide whether to adjust
the base offense level. Thus, in Kansas, there is no technical distinction between the base
and final offense level.

Notes: In the grey and clear boxes, the presumptive sentence is probation and prison,
respectively. Dashed boxes are “Border Box” cells in which the judge can issue a non-
prison sentence subject to the availability of an appropriate rehabilitation program. The
numbers in each cell represent different sentence lengths in months. The low and high values
represent the minimum and maximum sentence, respectively. The intermediate value is the
recommended or presumptive sentence length.


boxes indicate that the guideline sentence is probation, whereas in the clear
boxes, the presumptive sentence is prison.5 For example, a defendant who is
charged with theft of $100,000 (a severity level 5 crime) and who has 1 prior
non-person felony should expect between 38 to 43 months in prison, regardless
of gender.6

    5
      The dashed boxes are “Border Box” cells. The presumptive sentence for these crimes is
prison, but the judge can choose probation without the departure being subject to review.
    6
      “Person” and “non-person” crime are formal legal terms used in Kansas. In the Kansas
Sentencing Guidelines Desk Reference Manual (2014), it states that: “The ‘person’ designa-
tion generally refers to crimes that inflict, or could inflict, harm to another person. Examples
of person crimes are robbery, rape, aggravated arson, and battery. The ‘nonperson’ designa-
tion generally refers to crimes committed that inflict, or could inflict, damage to property.
Nonperson crimes also include offenses such as drug crimes, failure to appear, suspended
driver’s license, perjury, etc.”


                                                                           7
    There are three primary ways in which gender disparities can arise under
the sentencing guidelines. First, the guidelines provide judges with the dis-
cretion to issue longer or shorter sentences within cell. Second, judges can
formally depart from the guideline sentence, on either extensive or intensive
margins, based on mitigating or aggravating factors.7 However, formal de-
partures are subject to appeal and can be reversed.8 Roughly 14% of cases
are sentenced with a formal departure. Third, judges have more freedom to
depart from the guideline sentence when the crime violates a special rule.9
Approximately 28% of all cases involve special rule violations, which include
committing a person felony with a firearm, aggravated battery against a law
enforcement officer, committing crimes for the benefit of a street gang, persis-
tent sex offenses, and more. The modal violation is committing a crime while
on probation, parole, conditional release, post-release supervision, or felony
bond (72%). In this case, the judge can order a prison sentence for even low
severity crimes without being subject to formal review.10
    Descriptive Statistics
    Our data are the universe of convictions for felonies in Kansas from 1998 to


   7
      Some examples of departing factors are whether the offender played a passive role in
the crime, the crime is excessively brutal, the crime is a reaction to prolonged abuse, the
crime is in self-defense, etc.
    8
      There are limits to upward durational departures. The departure cannot exceed twice
the base sentence length. In cases involving multiple convictions, the upward departure
cannot exceed four times the base sentence length.
    9
      As noted in footnote 4, this practice differs from that under Federal Guidelines. In
Kansas, when special rule violations apply, judges are free to deviate from the sentence
prescribed by the Guidelines without being subject to review.
   10
      Note that the majority of criminal cases in Kansas, as elsewhere, are resolved by ne-
gotiated pleas. Judges are responsible for recording final outcomes, and for submitting
justifications for departure.

   Table 2 shows differences in the types of crimes for which women and men
are convicted. We have grouped crimes into drug and non-drug crimes, and
indicated person crimes among the non-drug crimes. Kansas has separate sen-
tencing grids for drug and non-drug crimes. While the main analyses examine
non-drug crimes, we show the full set of offenses here and report some speci-
fications for drug offenses where we can do so without disrupting the flow of
the analysis. Panel A shows the fraction of women and men whose offenses
fall into these categories. Sixty-three percent of the women are sentenced for
non-drug crimes, and 68 percent of the men are; 33% of men are sentenced for
a person crime, but only 15% of women are sentenced for person crimes.

drug and drug related offenses, ordered by their prevalence among women.
The first two columns show the probability of the offense type conditional
on female and male, respectively, and the third column shows the relative
likelihood of the offense. Among non-drug related offenses, there are stark


                                                    11
differences in the types of criminal convictions between women and men. In
particular, women’s offenses are disproportionately concentrated among the
types of criminal offenses that are associated with economic deprivation. While
the top two categories, “forgery” and “theft between $1-$25K”, account for
43% of convictions for women, they comprise only 17.4% of convictions for
men. Moreover, the relative probabilities show that women are roughly three
to four times more likely to face a criminal conviction of forgery, theft less
than $1K, making a false writing, giving a worthless check, and identity theft
in comparison with men. These statistics highlight the gender difference in
the propensity to commit certain types of non-drug related crimes.
    The top 10 drug crimes among women and men show more overlap in the
categories and their rankings. For example, none of the ratios among the
top 10 drug related offenses exceeds two. Nonetheless, there are still notable
differences in the distribution of offenses between gender groups. The top
two categories - “Possession (1st offense)” and “Sale within 1,000 ft of school
(Narcotics)” - account for 70 percent of the women’s convictions and 57 percent
of the men’s. In addition, a formal chi-square goodness of fit test for whether
the distribution of drug crimes (and non-drug crimes) is the same across men
and women is rejected at all conventional levels of statistical significance.
    Table 3 shows the sentencing outcomes and case characteristics overall and
by gender. Overall, 26% of individuals receive a term of incarceration, and the
average sentence length conditional on incarceration is 43 months12 ; among
  12
     In Kansas, the prison sentence is a strong predictor of actual time served. For example,
for crimes committed on or after April 20, 1995, the maximum reduction of a prison term
is 15%. For crimes committed on or after January 1, 2008, offenders who are sentenced to
prison for low severity offenses can receive a maximum reduction of 20%.


                                             12
those who receive probation, the average length is 19 months. There are large
differences in men’s and women’s sentencing outcomes, with women being on
average 18 percentage points less likely to receive a term of incarceration.
Among those who are sentenced to prison, women’s sentences are about 15
months shorter; among those on probation, women’s sentences are about a
month shorter.
    The bottom panel of Table 3 shows the “Case Facts” as reported in the
administrative records. These include factors about the crime that might enter
into the sentencing guidelines or into the judicial decision. One can see that
women frequently have more counts for a given charge than men, but the
average severity of the charges is significantly lower. Women also have less
serious criminal histories and are less likely to have committed a special rules
violation. Women are less likely than men to have retained private counsel,
a marker of having fewer resources with which to defend themselves, and are
more likely to have entered a plea agreement and less likely to have objected
to the official presentation of their criminal history.13 They are more likely to
have been released on felony bond prior to trial. Finally, women are about
3.7 percentage points (over 10 percent) more likely than men to have had a
mental health or substance abuse evaluation. These differences point to women

  13
     Even though over 95% of cases are resolved via plea, attorneys should endogenously
incorporate judicial preferences and bargain in the “shadow of the judge” (LaCasse and
Payne (1999)). In Kansas, attorneys know the identity of the presiding judge during plea
negotiations and judges have power to veto plea agreements. One way to empirically assess
the judge’s influence is to see whether the residual variation in incarceration is more pro-
nounced within versus between judicial districts since within-district variation holds fixed
any district level characteristic including the sentencing preferences of the prosecutor. A
simple decomposition shows that nearly 70% of the residual variation in incarceration that
partials out the usual set of case facts is within district.

  Notes: N=119,081. Means and mean differences are computed by running regressions of
  a variable on a set of race indicators using observations without missing data. The scale
  for severity varies for non-drug vs. drug related crimes (1 to 10 for non-drug crimes and
  1 to 4 for drug crimes). The scale has been inverted so that higher values are associated
  with more severe crimes. Criminal history is on a 1 to 9 scale with higher values reflecting
  more extensive prior records. Person crimes inflict physical or emotional harm to another
  person (e.g. robbery, rape, aggravated arson, and battery.)

as having less severe criminal histories and less severe offenses, while having
fewer resources with which to defend themselves, at the same time having more
mental and physical health issues with which to contend.
    Figure 3 presents the joint distribution of severity and criminal history for
men and women separately. Recall from Figure 1 that the intersection between
criminal history and severity is what determines the recommended sentencing
in those states, like Kansas, that adhere to sentencing guidelines. Women’s
distribution of criminal acts is much more crowded into the low-severity and
low-criminal-history portion of the distribution. For men, while more crimes
are in the low-criminal-history/severity portion of the distribution, the high-
severity and high-criminal-history portion of the distribution is much more
populated.
    The descriptive statistics make clear that it is not surprising that women
are less likely to be remanded to prison than men, and that conditional on
prison, their sentences are lighter, since the measures of the severity of their
crimes and their criminal histories are both lower. In what follows, we use a
variety of techniques to compare incarceration and conditional sentence length
between women and men who are similar along observable characteristics.

                                            16
et al. (2014), Mustard (2001)). This is a potentially salient difference given
that federal crimes tend to involve far more serious offenses (along with a large
number of drug cases, the seriousness of which is under contention (Sevigny and
Caulkins (2004)) and are associated with more severe punishments. The types
of men and women involved in federal cases are systematically different from
those in state cases (Glaeser et al. (2000)). Thus, our findings provide evidence
from a legal environment in which the gender gap receives disproportionately
less attention, despite its arguably greater generalizablity.14
    Our regression analysis focuses on two outcome variables: (i) whether or
not the defendant receives a sentence of incarceration (=1, probation=0), and
(ii) conditional on incarceration, the (log of) the sentence length:


                                 Yi = α + βFi + Xi γ + i                                   (1)


where Yi denotes the outcome, Fi indicates that the offender is female, Xi
represents a vector of case facts15 and i is the error term. The parameter
of interest is β and represents the female-male sentencing disparity ceteris
paribus. Its interpretation, however, can be ambiguous to the extent that
some case facts themselves may be affected by gender discrimination.16
   14
      While there is a fairly large economics of crime literature that uses state jurisdiction
data, most studies focus on other determinants of sentencing besides gender. For example,
Berdejo and Yuchtman (2013) and Lim (2013) use data from the state courts of Washington
and Kansas, respectively, in order to study how judges respond to re-election concerns. More
recent literature has focused on the effects of sentencing on labor market (Mueller-Smith
(2014)) or marriage market outcomes (Charles and Luoh (2010)).
   15
      Control variables are: the severity level of the offense, the offender’s criminal history
level, total counts, the offender’s age and race, whether the defendant attains private counsel,
committed a special rule violation, and resolved the case via plea.
   16
      For example, in her study of federal jurisdiction, Starr (2015) finds larger gender in-
carceration gaps conditional on conviction. In her study, she is able to account for charge


                                              17
    The results are presented in Table 4. The top and bottom panels show esti-
mates for non-drug and drug offenses, respectively. The first column presents
the raw gaps in sentencing between women and men. The next column controls
for indicators for the severity level of the crime. In most cases adding controls
closes the size of the gap, although notably the prison length gap for drug
crimes increases from 12 percent to 19 percent. When indicators for criminal
history are included in column 3, the sentencing gaps fall dramatically. The
incarceration gap closes to about 5 percentage points for non-drug and drug
crimes; and the sentence length gap drops to about 2 percent for non-drug
crimes and 7.6 percent for drug crimes.
    In column 4, we replace indicators of the severity levels and criminal history
with indicators for each sentencing cell. This specification is more flexible
and accounts for any interactions among severity and criminal history. The
estimated coefficients of interest are similar to those in the previous column. In
the subsequent columns, we control for age and race/ethnicity, which although
they do not enter into the sentencing grid, are correlated with recidivism and
may influence judicial behavior; and as we saw in the descriptive statistics,
women are older and more likely to be white than men. While these controls
are statistically significant in the regressions, they do not materially affect the
female punishment gap.
    Finally, we add indicators for the case facts to the regression. These include
indicators for whether the defendant is represented by private counsel, the plea
status of the case, whether it was a person crime, the number of counts on

bargaining because her data includes information on the evolution of charges over the course
of the plea negotiations.

the charge, and whether the felon violates a special rule. Some of these are
things that should affect the sentencing outcome, like whether there is a special
rules violation (such as committing a crime while on felony bond), and others
are things that we strongly suspect influence outcomes even if they are not
included in statute (like private counsel). While many of these coefficients are
statistically significant in explaining variation in incarceration and sentence
length, they do not change the female punishment gap much.
   Controlling for all the facts on the record for non-drug crimes, we still find

                                                            19
that women who are observably similar to men are 5.4 percentage points less
likely to be incarcerated, and are sentenced to about 2% shorter sentences
conditional on incarceration. For drug crimes, although the raw gaps (column
1) between women and men are smaller, controlling for observables does less
to shrink them. Roughly 41% of incarceration and 71% of the sentencing gap
remains unexplained for drug crimes.17 Since drug and non-drug crimes require
separate analysis due to the different sentencing grids, for the sake of brevity,
we focus on non-drug crimes from this point forward. It is worth noting that
non-drug offenses constitute the majority of crimes for both men and women.


3.2     Semi-Parametric Decompositions

    While the regression analysis shows that case facts largely explain the mean
difference in sentence length among non-drug crimes leaving only 5% of the
original gap unexplained18 , it seems plausible that there could remain gender
differences at other points in the distribution conditional on observables. In
this section, we examine the actual and counterfactual distributions of prison
terms conditional on incarceration using a semi-parametric re-weighting tech-
nique (DiNardo et al. (1996)). The counterfactual distribution for men is
constructed by placing more weight on men who share case facts that are
commonly observed among women. An analogous procedure can be used to
construct the counterfactual distribution for women. This approach allows us

  17
      These results are not driven by prison diversion programs for drug related offenses.
Even when we restrict the sample to offenders who are not sentenced to this program, we
get similar results. These estimates can be found in Section 3.7 of the Appendix.
   18
      The raw gap for log of sentence length conditional on incarceration is -0.442 in column
1 and shrinks to -0.024 in column 7.

to examine the entire distribution in addition to evaluate the gender differ-
ence in means. It is worth noting that this approach abstracts from potential
general equilibrium effects that could arise in the event that women and men
actually commit the same types of crime.19
   Figure 4 presents the actual and counterfactual distributions of sentence
length conditional on incarceration for non-drug crimes. We focus on results
that re-weight men to have the same covariate distribution as women because
there are more men who have case characteristics similar to women in the data
than there are women with similar characteristics to men as shown in Figure
3.20 Thus, the exercise of re-weighting men has more support in the data than
the exercise of re-weighting women to look like men.
   Panel A shows how the distribution changes as we vary the weights using
different sets of facts from the court records. Panel B graphs the differences
between the two distributions and the vertical line indicates the modal value
of the male distribution. If the distributions have the same mass at a given
sentence length, then the graphs in Panel B will be at zero. If the line is below
zero, there is more mass in the women’s distribution at that point, and if the
line is above zero, there is more mass in the men’s distribution at that point.
   The first entry in Panel A shows the two actual distributions. The women’s
distribution is left-shifted compared to the men’s. The women’s distribution
has a clear mode at about 3 log points, and the men’s distribution has a number
of spikes at about 3 and 4 log points. Each successive graph uses a different

     The details of the procedure are in Section 3.1 of the Appendix.

     Results are qualitatively similar when we conduct the exercise by re-weighting women
to look like men (see Section 3.2 of the Appendix for these results).

counterfactual distributions for the men, shown as dotted lines. The first
of these is graph (a) which plots the counterfactual distribution for men if
they were to have the same age distribution as women and the solid line
is the actual distribution for women. Re-weighting men to have the same
age distribution as women does not change the men’s distribution of prison
length much. When we add controls for severity, on the other hand, the
men’s counterfactual density looks much closer to the women’s. Graph (c)
adds controls for criminal history and the distributions are even more similar.
Graph (d) adds interactions between age and criminal history and severity to
the probit equation, and Graph (e) adds the remaining case facts including
race/ethnicity, type of counsel, whether a special rule applies, and counts.
    Turning to the graphs in Panel B, which show the differences in the distri-
butions, we see that once the re-weighting function includes criminal history,
the distributions stabilize and the differences are relatively close to zero.21
    To summarize, our regression results show that even after conditioning
on all of the observable criminal elements and despite the fact that Kansas
uses sentencing guidelines that limit judicial discretion, about 30% of the gap
in incarceration between men and women remains unexplained. Conditional
on incarceration, gender gaps in sentencing length remain, but are small rel-
ative to the unexplained gaps in incarceration. Aside from the mean, the

     Note that we have also estimated gender difference in the mean sentencing outcomes
among non-drug offenses using the re-weighting technique. The estimates shows that even
after conditioning on all of the observable criminal elements and despite the fact that Kansas
uses sentencing guidelines that limit judicial discretion, about 30% of the gap in mean
incarceration between men and women remains unexplained. Conditional on incarceration,
gender gaps in mean sentencing length remain, but are small relative to the unexplained
gaps in incarceration. These results are qualitatively similar to our regression estimates and
can be found in Section 3.2 of the Appendix.

re-weighting exercise shows little support of gender difference in other parts
of the distribution of prison length conditional on incarceration. It is worth
noting that the results thus far are mainly descriptive. Given that numerous
actors could contribute to the unexplained gender disparity in incarceration,
including judges, prosecutors, and police, we now turn our focus towards de-
termining the role of judicial behavior in the incarceration probabilities of
women.



4     Judicial Heterogeneity

    In light of structured sentencing and random case assignment, we might ex-
pect little judicial heterogeneity in sentencing outcomes. Figure 5 plots judge-
specific female incarceration rates against total number of cases. The plot
includes the 173 judges with more than 100 non-drug related cases. The two
horizontal lines demarcate the 25th and 75th percentile judge. The plot shows
considerable dispersion in judicial female incarceration rates. Being assigned
the 75th as opposed to the 25th percentile judge increases the probability of
incarceration by roughly 8 percentage points for women, which constitutes a
67% increase.
    Figure 5 shows that judges who have seen fewer cases exhibit more disper-
sion but their estimates are also less informative due to sampling error. We
will account for this in two ways. First, we will compute measures of disper-
sion that weigh judges by the inverse of the estimated variance of their fixed
effect such that judicial incarceration rates that are estimated more precisely



                                      24
receive more weight. Second, we will adjust estimates of the standard devia-
tion associated with the distribution of judge fixed effects by subtracting off
the mean of their estimated variances, which serves as a proxy for the sam-
pling error variance (Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander (2007)). Even with these
adjustments, the variation between judges is substantial.

Note: Each dot is a judge’s incarceration rate of female felons relative to the baseline judge.
The baseline judge is normalized to 0. The weighted standard deviation is 0.064, where the
weights are the inverse of the variance of the estimated judge fixed effect. The F-statistic
associated with a joint significance test is 7.09. The judge fixed effects are estimated using
variation orthogonal to the usual set of covariates. The horizontal lines denoth the 25th and
75th percentile judge, respectively. There are 173 judges total. Judges with fewer than 100
non-drug related cases are excluded. The sample is restricted to non-drug related crimes.


    Before proceeding to quantify the extent of judicial heterogeneity, we con-
sider the possibility that randomization is not achieved in practice. To test


                                                      25
whether cases are balanced across judges, we regress the presumptive sentence
length on a set of judge fixed effects separately for each judicial district and
then test whether or not the judge fixed effects are jointly equal to zero.22 We
also test for the presence of gender-based case assignment by including inter-
actions between the offender’s gender and judge fixed effects in the regression
and then testing whether the interactions are jointly equal to zero. This will
test whether or not some judges are assigned worse female offenders than other
judges, on average.
    The F-statistics and p-values associated with these tests are presented in
Section 3.4 of the Appendix. On the whole, the evidence suggests that pre-
sumptive sentence length is balanced across judges in most judicial districts.
In roughly 70% of the judicial districts, the p-value associated with the joint
test of equality is above 0.05. There is also very little evidence of gender-based
case assignment. The gender-by-judge fixed effects are jointly statistically sig-
nificant at the 5% level in only one judicial district.
    The fact that a few districts show imbalance further motivates our event-
study analysis in which we exploit the entry into and exit out of districts by
“harsh” and “lenient” judges. This approach mitigates residual concerns of
non-random case assignment, since it is highly unlikely that case composition
is endogeneously related with the timing of judicial entry or exit. Moreover,
this approach utilizes within-district variation in sentencing, and thus accounts
for all permanent unobserved district-specific factors that might influence the
  22
      The presumptive sentence length is the middle value in the relevant cell of the sen-
tencing grid. Given the multiplicity of observables and the 31 judicial districts, we focus on
presumptive sentence length in order to provide a parsimonious and interpretable balancing
test.

sentencing of female offenders; for example, prosecutorial or police behavior.23


4.1     Event-Study Analysis

    In this section, we study the impact of entry or exit of “harsh” or “lenient”
judges on female incarceration rates. Since we are focusing on incarceration
for women, we define a “harsh” judge as one whose incarceration rate for
male offenders who commit non-person crimes is in the top quartile and a
“lenient” judge as one whose incarceration rate for male offenders who commit
non-person crimes is in the bottom quartile of all judges.24 To estimate the
effects of entry/exit, we parameterize the regression model following Jacobson,
LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) and Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (2005):

                                            3
                                            X
                        yidt = γt + τd +          Ditk + Xi β + idt                     (2)
                                           k=−2

where Ditk are a set of timing of entry/exit fixed effects, Xi represents a vector
of the usual set of case facts, γt denotes a set of year fixed effects, and τd
are district fixed effects. The subscripts i denote the case, d denotes the
district, and t reflects the year. The k superscript associated with the timing
indicators denotes the k-th year relative to the event and takes values of k =
−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3+. Districts that do not experience an event of entry or exit

  23
      It is possible that prosecutors or other actors could change their behavior in response
to changes in judicial composition. To assess this, we examine whether predicted incar-
ceration (i.e. the fitted values from a regression of incarceration on case facts and other
controls) changes with respect to judicial composition. We find no evidence supporting this
hypothesis. These results are in Section 3.5 of the Appendix.
   24
      We define “harsh” and “lenient” based on male incarceration rates in order to avoid
the overfitting problem. Results are similar if we use combined incarceration rates, which
suggests that judges treat female and male offenders similarly.


                                             27
will identify the year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the district-
level.
    Figure 6 presents four different plots which describe how female incarcer-
ation rates are affected by the timing of entry or exit. The left panel shows
effects associated with entry of a lenient and then harsh judge, and the right
panel shows effects associated with exit of a lenient and then harsh judge.
Beginning with Panel a, we see that with respect to entry of a lenient judge,
female incarceration rates decline not in the initial year of entry, but in sub-
sequent years and that the decrease is persistent. Three years and beyond,
female incarceration rates are roughly 5 percentage points lower in compari-
son with three years prior to the entry of the lenient judge. We also see no
evidence of pre-trends prior to entry. The declines in response to entry of a
lenient judge are statistically significant at the 5% level.
    The entry of a harsh judge, Panel c, has opposite effects. In the year of
entry of a harsh judge, female incarceration rates increase by nearly 10 percent-
age points. The magnitude is large given that the mean female incarceration
rate is 11 percent. As with entry of a lenient judge, there is little evidence of
a pre-trend in female incarceration rates. Three years and beyond, female in-
carceration rates are about 5 percentage points higher in comparison with the
3 years prior to entry, although this point estimate is not statistically signifi-
cant.25 On the whole, the time pattern is consistent with the narrative that the
entry of a harsh judge leads to substantial increases in female incarceration.

   25
     The standard error is large due to the fact that there are relatively few events and in
the 17th judicial district, there is only 1 judge in the district leading to little within-district
variation in the 3 years and beyond indicator.

          (c) Entry of Harsh Judge                        (d) Exit of Harsh Judge




Note: “0” is the year of entry or exit. Harsh judge is defined as a judge whose incarceration
rate of male non-person crimes is in the top quartile among all judges in the state. Lenient
judges are in the bottom quartile in male non-person incarceration rates. Estimates are from
a regression of incarceration on timing indicators, case facts, demographic characteristics,
year effects, and district-fixed effects.


    The right-hand panels show the effects associated with the exit of lenient
and then harsh judges. Unlike entry, exit appears to have little effect on female
incarceration rates. For example, in Panel b, most of the estimates associated
with the exit of a lenient judge are close to zero and none are statistically
significant at the 5% level. The exit of a harsh judge also has little impact
on female incarceration rates. It is interesting that the effects of exit are
not comparable to the effects associated with entry. Although it is beyond
the scope of this paper, this suggests an important role for judicial learning


                                             29
with respect to time in service. Recall that Figure 5 demonstrated that the
variability in female incarceration rates across judges declines with the number
of cases. Since the number of cases seen will increase with years in service,
their sentences are less variable when judges exit.26


4.2     Gender Gaps and Judicial Heterogeneity

    The previous section establishes that judicial entry has a substantial impact
on the incarceration rate of women. In this section, we provide measures of
dispersion associated with the distribution of judicial incarceration rates of
both women and men. The judge-specific incarceration rates are covariate-
adjusted for all of the observable characteristics of the case. Section 3.3 of
the Appendix provides additional results from a re-weighting exercise that
shows our measures of dispersion are robust to potential gender differences in
case composition across judges. These analyses provide more general evidence
on the importance of judicial heterogeneity in sentencing. In addition, these
results allow us to explicitly compare judicial heterogeneity in sentencing of
men versus women which speaks to the question of whether it is plausible
to study the impact of incarceration on women’s life-outcomes by exploiting
variation associated with random case-assignment to heterogeneous judges.
  26
      It is interesting that “harsh” judges affect sentences in their first year, but lenient
judges only impact sentences after they have been on the bench for a year. One explanation
may be related to the well-known fact that judges typically run election campaigns built
on the promise that they will be “tough on crime” once elected into office (Gordon and
Huber (2007), Berdejo and Yuchtman (2013)). Thus, it may not be surprising that harsh
judges immediately respond with increases in female incarceration whereas lenient judges
may exhibit more caution in issuing less punitive sentences until they learn how to navigate
the criminal justice system. While we emphasize that this discussion is purely speculative,
it is interesting that we observe other patterns in the data that are consistent with judges
learning over time.


                                             30
   Table 5 shows estimates of the standard deviation, 75th vs. 25th percentile,
and 90th vs. 10th percentile differentials associated with the distribution of
judicial incarceration rates separately for women and men and that are both
unweighted and weighted.27 The unweighted estimates suggest that a 1 stan-
dard deviation change in the distribution of judges is associated with a 7.1
and 6.1 percentage point increase in the likelihood of incarceration for women
and men, respectively. The weighted standard deviations for women and men
are slightly smaller but still show substantial variation between judges. The
weighted estimates imply that a 1 standard deviation change is associated
with a 6.4 and 5.8 percentage point increase in the likelihood of incarceration
for women and men, respectively. Given that the baseline female and male
incarceration rates are 0.121 and 0.319, respectively, this constitutes a much
larger effect size for women in comparison with men.
   The adjusted standard deviation shows qualitatively similar results.28 A 1
standard deviation change is associated with a 6.7 and 6.0 percentage point
increase in the likelihood of incarceration for women and men, respectively.
The 75/25 and 90/10 differentials also suggest that there is considerable het-
erogeneity across judges. To help put all of these statistics in perspective,
the estimated incremental effects of obtaining private counsel, agreeing to a
plea, and committing a person crime on the probability of incarceration are
-3.9, -11.7, and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. Thus, judicial assignment
impacts the probability of incarceration at a level comparable to that of key

           Notes: Bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. We estimate the judge fixed effects by regress-
           ing an indicator of incarceration on a vector of case facts and judge fixed effects. Rather than run the
           model separately by gender, we also include judge-by-gender interactions. The measures of dispersion
           correspond to the main judge fixed effects. The weighted statistics weight each judge fixed effect by
           the inverse of its estimated variance. The adjusted standard deviation subtracts off the mean of the
           estimated variances of the judge fixed effects from the unadjusted standard deviation. The sample is
           restricted to non-drug crimes.




   While these results show that judges exhibit considerable heterogeneity,
the mechanisms that drive these differences are less clear. Perhaps the most
straightforward explanation is that judges differ in punishment philosophies
which translate into heterogeneity in sentencing. For example, some judges
may have a higher willingness to afford an offender the opportunity to rehabili-
tate outside of prison. Other judges may have a stronger desire to incapacitate
the same defendant. In Section 3.6 of the Appendix, we provide some descrip-
tive evidence that is consistent with judicial differences in punishment philoso-
phies. Specifically, we show that judges who incarcerate women at high rates
also tend to incarcerate men who commit non-person offenses, low severity
level offenses, and those with less extensive criminal histories. These patterns
suggest that judges who are “tough on females” are “tough on property crime”
more generally.


                                                          32
    In addition, it seems plausible that statistical or taste-based discrimination
could contribute to the observed judicial heterogeneity in the data. To assess
this possibility, we develop a theoretical model of judicial sentencing (see Sec-
tion 1 of the Appendix) that is a fairly straightforward adaptation of Anwar
and Fang (2006) and Park (2015). Importantly, it allows for (i) judges to vary
in their punishment philosophies, (ii) the prospect of statistical discrimination,
and (iii) judges to have tastes for discrimination. An implication of the model
is that in the absence of both forms of discrimination, judges should incarcer-
ate both men and women at the same rate as long as the distribution of case
facts is the same for men and women conditional on the observed elements
of the case. While it is unlikely that we observe all the relevant variables in
the judge’s information set, it is worth reiterating that the data contains all
of the case elements that determine the prescribed punishments by the state
guidelines.
    Figure 7 plots the regression-adjusted judicial incarceration rates of women
and men along the x and y axes, respectively, as well as the 45o line and the line
of best fit. In the absence of discrimination, we should expect to see all of the
judicial incarceration rates located close to the 45o line with some deviation
due to sampling error. The extent to which the line of best fit deviates from
the 45o line signals the potential for statistical or taste-based discrimination
to affect judicial decisions. Interestingly, the plot shows that the line of best
fit is considerably flatter than the 45o line with a slope of 0.634.29 A two-sided
  29
     It is worth noting that the line of best fit deviates from the 45o line with a flatter
rather than steeper slope. As we illustrate in Section 1.2 of the Appendix, more punitive
judges should have a higher willingness to incarcerate offenders who commit less severe
offenses which are disproportionately associated with women. This implies that a more

Note: Each dot represents judge-specific incarceration rates relative to the baseline judge,
who is normalized to 0. The horizontal and vertical lines pass through the baseline judge.
The incarceration rates are regression-adjusted for the usual set of covariates. There are
173 judges total. Judges with less than 100 cases are excluded. The sample is restricted to

hypothesis test of the null that the slope equals 1 is comfortably rejected with
a t-statistic of -8.32.30 Alternatively, a goodness of fit test of the null that
judicial incarceration rates are the same for men and women is rejected with
a p-value less than 0.001.
    In summary, consistent with the event-study findings, we find that the
identity of the presiding judge has sizable influence on the incarceration prob-
ability for both men and women. It is unlikely that this pattern is driven
by systematic differences in case composition across judges. Not only are

punitive judge should exhibit a larger increase in the judicial incarceration rate of women
in comparison with men. Thus, the fact that the line of best fit is flatter than the 45o is
not unexpected.

      A weighted regression that places more weight on judges whose female incarceration
rates are estimated more precisely has negligible affect on this result.

cases randomly assigned, but in Section 3.3 of the Appendix, we also show
that the observed judicial heterogeneity is robust to a re-weighting technique
that equalizes the gender gap in case facts across judges. In addition, the
misalignment between the line of best fit through the gender-specific judicial
incarceration rates and the 45o line implies that there is considerable judicial
heterogeneity not only in the levels but also in the female-male difference in in-
carceration rates. This pattern hints at the possibility that perhaps statistical
or taste-based discrimination influences judicial sentencing.
   To identify which type of discrimination operates, we will apply the rank-
order test of discrimination as in Anwar and Fang (2006) and Park (2015)
which adapts the test to analyze judicial behavior. These studies forcefully
argue that judicial heterogeneity in group-specific incarceration rates (in ei-
ther levels or differences) cannot separately identify tastes for discrimination.
Rather, if judicial incarceration ranks depend on gender, then this points to
gender-based tastes for discrimination. Graphically, in the absence of tastes
for discrimination, a plot of judicial incarceration ranks of men and women
should lie atop the 45o line. The next section presents the rank-order test.


4.3    Rank-Order Test of Taste-Based Discrimination

   The key insight of the rank-order test is that in the absence of tastes
for discrimination, more punitive judges should have higher male and higher
female incarceration rates in comparison with other judges and thus judicial
incarceration ranks should be the same regardless of the offender’s gender.
Table 6 provides an illustrative example of a rank-order violation. The table


                                       35
shows gender-specific incarceration rates and ranks from the four judges in the
Ford County district court.31 We denote judge j’s incarceration rate of gender
g felons as γjg where g ∈ {M, W }. Judge j’s incarceration rank is provided
in the parentheses such that higher ranks imply higher rates. The first cell
indicates that judge A incarcerates men at the lowest rate (γjM = 0.227) and
women at the second lowest rate (γjM = 0.097) among the four judges. On the
whole, the table implies that judicial ranks depend on gender since the rank-
                                 M
order of men (γAM < γBM < γCM < γD ) differs from the rank-order of women
(γBW < γAW < γD
              W
                < γCW ).

                            16th judicial district.


   The open question is whether the rank-order violations are statistically
significant or not. We conduct a statistical test in which the null hypothesis is
that judges have no tastes for discrimination. We can formulate the null with

the following set of         2
                                   inequality constraints:


                        Ho : (γjM − γjM0 )(γjW − γjW0 ) ≥ 0 ∀j 6= j 0                       (3)


where k denotes the number of judges and, again, γjM and γjW represent the
male and female incarceration rates for judge j, respectively. These inequalities
convey the intuition that in the absence of taste-based discrimination, judge
j should incarcerate both men and women at either higher or lower rates in
comparison with judge j 0 . More extreme violations of these constraints will
constitute stronger evidence of tastes for discrimination. Note that when this
set of inequality constraints are satisfied a plot of judicial incarceration ranks
should show data points that lie atop the 45o line.
   We compute a test statistic that is analogous to the F -statistic used in
conventional tests in which the null hypothesis consists of equality constraints.
Specifically, we compute the residual sum of squares from models that relax
versus impose the inequality constraints in equation 3. Our test statistic,
which we will denote as the F̄ -statistic, computes the difference in the residual
variation across the two models, normalizes this by the residual variation from
the unrestricted model, and adjusts for degrees of freedom. Intuitively, the
F̄ -statistic will take larger values when the data exhibits inconsistency with
the inequality constraints. On the other hand, if the data satisfy all of the
inequality constraints, then the value of the F̄ -statistic will be zero. In this
sense, the F̄ -statistic captures the change in model fit as we relax the inequality
constraints.32
  32
       An important difference between the F and F̄ -statistic is that the latter is distributed


                                               37
   There is an important consideration in statistical tests with inequality con-
straints that can be ignored in tests with only equality constraints. Because
multiple parameter values can satisfy the inequality constraints, the asymp-
totic null distribution of our test statistic as well as the (1 − α) quantile that
serves as the critical value can vary depending on the location of the null. The
crucial point made in the literature is that critical values are generally larger
at locations where more inequality constraints bind. Thus, if the researcher
could credibly test which constraints bind, then she could potentially leverage
a more powerful statistical test by conducting inference under a re-centered
null distribution where fewer inequality constraints bind. Our statistical pro-
cedure, which is detailed in Section 2 of the Appendix, adopts elements from
well-developed techniques that allow one to select critical values in ways that
increase statistical power while still controlling asymptotic size (Bugni (2010),
Andrews and Soares (2010), Bugni et al. (2015), and Canay (2010)).
   Table 7 shows results from the rank-order test. In particular, we show
the district, the number of judges in the district, the F̄ -statistic, and its cor-
responding p-value. Note that we conduct the analysis separately for each
district in order to control for district-level factors such as prosecutor or po-
lice effects. Again, values of the test statistic close to 0 indicate that the
data are highly consistent with the inequality constraints whereas larger val-
ues constitute stronger evidence against the null. We find that for all but
one district, the p-values sit comfortably above the 0.05 threshold required to


as a mixture of Snedecor’s F -distributions due to the presence of inequality constraints
(Wolak (1987)). While we cannot write closed form expressions due the large number of
constraints, the distribution can be simulated via re-sampling techniques (Kudo (1963)).

achieve statistical significance. Only in the 19th district is the p-value below
the conventional 0.05 level. On the whole, we cannot reject that the judicial
incarceration ranks are independent of gender.

    It is worth noting that the rank-order test plausibly identifies taste-based
discrimination under a set of moderate assumptions. These are that (i) worse
case facts signal that the offender poses a relatively high versus low threat
to society, (ii) that judicial sentencing preferences are not substantially non-
monotonic, and (iii) there is no gender gap in case facts across judges.33 While
the first seems intuitive and the third should hold due to random case as-
signment, recent research has shown that judges can exhibit considerable non-
monotonicity in their sentencing preferences (Mueller-Smith (2014)). However,
note that non-monotonicity should have the effect of increasing Type I error.
For example, a judge who is particularly harsh on forgeries (the modal crime
among women) will have higher female incarceration rates in comparison with
other judges because of jurisprudence not gender-related tastes. Thus, our null
finding is unlikely to be driven by non-monotonic sentencing preferences.34
    While we find no statistical evidence of tastes for discrimination, it is im-
portant to emphasize that the rank-order test has low power. A rank-order
violation implies tastes for discrimination, but as shown in Anwar and Fang
(2006) as well as in Section 1 of the Appendix, the converse is not necessar-
ily true. Thus, we cautiously interpret these results as providing suggestive
evidence that tastes for discrimination are not a principle mechanism driving
the earlier results on the mean gender difference or the variation in sentenc-

  33
     A formal illustration of these assumptions is provided in Section 1.1 of the Appendix.
  34
     If a researcher does find a rank-order violation in the data, then she should address
these potential confounds more systematically. To account for non-monotonic sentencing
preferences, a researcher could check whether the results are robust to “local” versions of
the test in which attention is restricted to specific types of criminal offenses. To assess
the importance of gender difference in case composition across judges, the researcher could
apply a re-weighting technique that equalizes the gender gap in case facts across judges.


                                            40
ing outcomes across judges. Instead, these results imply that the unexplained
gender differences in sentencing are more likely driven by unobservables that
differ across men and women, for example: the ability to negotiate favorable
pleas, supportive social ties, or other relevant factors that are not captured in
our analysis.



5     Conclusion

    We find that men and women have very different crime profiles. Women
are much more likely to commit non-violent, less severe crimes, and have less
extensive criminal histories. However, conditional on all observable character-
istics, both regression and semi-parametric results show that women are less
likely to be incarcerated in comparison with similar men. In fact, roughly
30% of the gender gap in incarceration remains unexplained. We also find
substantial heterogeneity in treatment of both female and male offenders by
judges. Being assigned a judge one standard deviation above the mean judge
will increase the probability of incarceration by 53% and 18% for women and
men, respectively.
    An oft-cited explanation for this “unexplained” gap and heterogeneity in
sentencing is chivalry, or taste-based discrimination, in favor of female offend-
ers by judges. We use a test of taste-based discrimination that relies on the
rank-order of judicial incarceration rates of males and females and find that
there is no statistical evidence of taste-based discrimination along gender lines.
In other words, to a first approximation judges who are more lenient toward



                                       41
women are also more lenient toward men. To the extent that there are vi-
olations in the rank-order of judicial gender-specific incarceration rates, we
cannot reject that it is random.
   Our results that there are large unexplained differences in incarceration
rates for men and women who are observably similar that do not seem to
be consistent with taste-based discrimination begs the question of what is
driving the gender gap. If men and women differ systematically in terms of
unobservable (to the researcher) characteristics that judges respond to, then
that may result in gender gaps, but no rank-order violation in judicial behavior.
For example, if judges do not like to incarcerate custodial parents, and women
are more likely to be custodial parents than men, we may see substantial
“unexplained” gender gaps. This suggests that other factors considered by the
judge have to be worse for women than men in order for judges to get over the
hurdle of incarceration for women. This is consistent with the finding, both
here and elsewhere, that women who are incarcerated are more negatively
selected than are men.
   A larger remaining question is whether judges are making the right de-
cision from a societal point of view. Are the gaps in punishment between
men and women indicative of judges using the information they observe, but
is not available to researchers in the data, to promote public safety in cost-
effective ways? Without more information we cannot know. For now, we know
from LaLonde (and co-authors) that the “types” of women that judges choose
to incarcerate are the types for whom the prison term has little adverse ef-
fect on their employment, welfare receipt, and children’s test score outcomes.


                                       42
Whether that is consistent with reserving (costly) prison terms for only those
who most threaten public safety is another question.
