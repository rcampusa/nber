This paper estimates the effect of access to transportation networks on regional economic outcomes
in China over a twenty-period of rapid income growth. It addresses the problem of the endogenous
placement of networks by exploiting the fact that these networks tend to connect historical cities. Our
results show that proximity to transportation networks have a moderate positive causal effect on per
capita GDP levels across sectors, but no effect on per capita GDP growth. We provide a simple theoretical
framework with empirically testable predictions to interpret our results. We argue that our results are
consistent with factor mobility playing an important role in determining the economic benefits of infrastructure
development.

              “A key issue [on whether railroads benefit economic development], however, is

          whether such railroad influence was primarily exogenous or endogenous, whether

          railroads first set in motion the forces culminating in the economic development

          of the decade, or whether arising in response to profitable situations, they played

          a more passive role.” – Albert Fishlow, American Railroads and the Transfor-

          mation of the Ante-bellum Economy, 1965 pp. 203



1        Introduction

Transportation infrastructure is often mentioned as a key to promoting growth and develop-

ment. The argument relies on the simple logic that one first needs to have access to markets

and ideas before one can benefit from them. This belief is supported by the observation

that the historical construction of infrastructure such as railroads coincided with periods of

rapid economic growth in Western Europe, Japan and the United States. Today, it is in-

disputable that richer countries have dramatically better transportation infrastructure than

poorer ones. However, policymakers considering the trade-offs of investing in infrastructure

must consider several related questions. First, they must consider the question of causality:

is infrastructure development a worthwhile object of policy, or is it better to rely on the

natural forces of the market and/or competition between local jurisdictions to endogenously

provide the necessary infrastructure when the demand is there? For example, Fogel (1962,

1964) famously argues that one of the most frequently mentioned historical innovations in

transportation infrastructure, railroads, was less effective for economic development in the

United States than the pre-existing river networks and that this misdirected investment was

a result of government policies for promoting railroads.

        Second, policymakers are typically concerned about the distributional effects of infras-

tructure, which are by no means obvious. On the one hand, for fixed factor endowments, the

increased access to markets and ideas should benefit all regions. For example, in the histori-

cal context of the United States, it has been argued that transportation infrastructure gives

rise to more cities, which then turned into “engines” of growth for the country as a whole.1
    1
        For example, see the World Bank’s World Development Report 2009 on Reshaping Economic Geography


                                                    2
On the other hand, transportation infrastructure increases the access of rural regions to

cities, and the well-known agglomeration effects of cities may cause productive capital and

skilled labor to move from rural regions to cities over time, with the result that those who

remain in rural areas receive very limited benefits from urbanization or even become impov-

erished. Along similar lines, it has been argued that the expansion of motor road networks

in the United States promoted large-scale suburbanization and left many cities without a

viable economic model (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 1999).

   This paper makes progress in understanding the impact of access to transportation in-

frastructure by examining the causal effect of access on economic performance in different

regions in China during a twenty-year period of rapid growth. We ask the straightforward

question: Do areas that are “quasi-randomly” assigned to have better access to transporta-

tion networks consequently have better economic outcomes in the long run? Specifically, we

attempt to empirically examine two closely related questions. First, we ask whether access

to better transportation enriches the average region that is affected (because it draws in or

generates more new economic activities) or impoverishes it (because it becomes easier for

human and physical capital to exit). Second, we ask whether areas that have better access

to transportation networks benefit much more and serve as engines of growth when new

economic opportunities arise and growth becomes possible.

   For our discussion, it is important to keep three points in mind. First, our focus is on

long term effects. We are interested not just in the impact on trade and prices that result

from greater access, which tends to be relatively short-term, but also in the subsequent

changes in the patterns of localization of economic activity as people and factories relocate.

Second, the emphasis on understanding the effect of infrastructure for the average location

is crucial to our study since it is entirely possible that some of the largest cities benefit from

infrastructure through greater concentration of resources while most other places lose out.

Finally, there cannot be one definitive answer to these questions, since the answer will clearly

depend on the starting point – i.e. the first road to connect the agricultural hinterland to a

port is very different from the fifth such road.
by Aoyama and Horner (2009) for a nuanced statement of this view.



                                                  3
      We use county-level economic data from China to try to answer these questions. In many

ways, China offers an ideal setting for our work. In the late 19th and early 20th century,

the Chinese government and a set of Western Colonial powers built railroads connecting

the historical cities of China to each other and to the newly constructed so-called “Treaty

Ports”.2 We identify our average “treated” areas to be those that were close to the straight

line connecting the same set of cities. Our analysis excludes the termini cities, where there

are obviously additional termini effects. Our strategy compares areas closer to the lines

to areas further away and interpret the result of this comparison as the overall effect of

any transportation infrastructure – the original railroads and any other infrastructure later

added – along these historical transportation corridors.

      This strategy has a number of advantages. First, it provides us with an exogenous source

of variation in access to transportation networks. Second, this variation goes back to at least

fifty years before our study begins in 1986, by which time the patterns of economic activity

would have had ample chance to relocate. We can therefore ask what the long run level

effect of being close to the line (and hence to transportation) was, say around 1986. Third,

our study period, 1986-2006, coincides with China’s opening up and subsequent growth

acceleration. Our treatment areas were in a very good position to take the lead in exploiting

these new opportunities. We therefore also study growth effects of being close to the line

over the period 1986-2003.

      The results show that being close to the line had a positive level effect. Per capita

GDP was higher in places closer to the line. However the effect is not large. The elastic-

ity of per capita GDP with respect to distance from historical transportation networks is

approximately -0.07. The lack of a large level effect is consistent with independent data

from a higher-quality household survey, the National Fixed Point Survey (NFS) collected

by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, which shows that distance has no significant effect

on household income. This might reflect the effects of the two contending forces that we

discussed earlier. For the estimates of the effect of proximity on growth, we find a precisely

estimated zero effect. The estimated elasticity between distance to the line and annual per
  2
      For example, see Pong (1973).



                                               4
capita GDP growth is -0.002 and statistically insignificant (the standard error is 0.003).

Places close to the line grew exactly as fast as places further away.

   Our finding that better access to transportation networks does not have a large impact on

the (relative) economic performance of those areas is consistent with the Fogelian view that

transportation infrastructure by itself does not really do very much, excepting perhaps where

there was already a demand for it. Based on similar logic, China scholars have criticized

public investment in transportation infrastructure in China after 1990 (Huang, 2008).

   However, in the interest of understanding the potential benefits and limitations of in-

frastructural investment in developing countries more fully, we also consider an alternative

and complimentary interpretation. We ask whether there are any obvious characteristics

of China (or developing countries in general) that could cause the measured benefits of in-

frastructure to be small even if better transportation causes substantial gains to GDP. In

particular, our model emphasizes the role of factor mobility – i.e., labor is assumed to be

completely immobile, while capital is assumed to move at a cost. Using a simple model, we

argue that the empirical evidence is consistent with a version of the model where capital

is less mobile than goods such that even distant places retain high levels of capital. The

result is that the level differences in productivity will tend to be relatively small and both

near and far places will be involved in the production of exports. This, in turn, means (in

the world of our model) that both locations will gain equally in proportional terms from

China’s integration into world markets. Therefore, even though better transportation does

help China as a whole to gain more from trade, GDP level differences between well- and

poorly connected areas can be small and there may be no differences in growth rates between

the two areas.

   The premise of this model is, as we emphasized above, that goods move more easily

than capital. Unfortunately we cannot directly observe the relative mobility of goods and

capital. However, our model tells us that relatively low mobility of capital is likely to be

associated with a situation, where there is higher inequality in better connected areas, under

the assumption that the direction of capital movement is from less connected areas towards

better connected ones. Using regional income inequality data computed from the National


                                              5
Fixed Point Survey collected by China’s Ministry of Agriculture (1987-2005), we do find

that inequality is higher in better connected areas.

       In assessing what general lessons one can learn from our results, one should consider

whether our results and theory are driven by conditions specific to the Chinese context.

For example, one may be concerned that the marginal effect of access to infrastructure is

especially low in China due to the massive investment into infrastructure during recent years

on the part of the government.3 We believe that this is highly unlikely to be driving our

results because our data shows large variation in access to infrastructure. In our data, the

distance to the railroad for the counties that are the nearest the line (defined as the nearest

decile) are only a third of the distance for those that are the furthest (defined as the furthest

decile). Similarly, the nearest counties have more than twice the length of highway relative

to the furthest counties (despite the fact that the latter are almost eight times as large in

area).

       Another concern for external validity is that the lack of factor mobility stems from the

Chinese government’s attempts to control labor mobility and that the empirical findings are

not easily generalizable to the context of other developing countries.4 We acknowledge that

the Chinese government may be unique in implementing an explicit policy for controlling

migration for so long. However, it is important to note that the actual patterns of low levels

of migration are not unique to China. In particular, the main policy effort has focused on

unskilled low-wage rural workers (Meng, 2005), a group that has been found to be relatively

immobile in other contexts such as India (Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2009). Moreover, the

theory predicts similar effects regardless of which factor (e.g., labor, capital) is immobile

and the immobility of capital has been documented in several developing country contexts.5

       A growing number of recent papers have developed compelling identification strategies to

evaluate the impact of transportation infrastructure (e.g., Michaels, 2008; Donaldson, 2010;

Keller and Shiue, 2008).6 These studies examine the effect of transportation infrastructure

     For example, see West and Zhao (2000) for a review of studies on labor migration.

     For example, see Duflo (2004) for evidence of limited capital mobility within Indonesia.
   6
     Michaels (2008) examines the effect of highway construction in the United States in the 1950s, using
both a difference-in-difference (DD) approach and an instrumental variables approach, where he exploits the



                                                    6
from the point of view of market integration and the focus is on price convergence and

changes in the relative price of factors along the lines predicted by trade models. The

results suggest that transportation infrastructure favors greater price convergence and that

factor prices shift in the direction predicted by trade theory.

    Our study differs from earlier studies in its focus on the longer-run and more macro

question: do areas that benefit from access to the reduction in trade costs and perhaps

other costs become wealthier as a consequence? This is by no means obvious even if there

is clear evidence that trade and other flows such as migration increased when infrastructure

became available. Our estimates provide a much more reduced form effect, which presumably

includes not just the possible gains from more efficient trade but also the effects of greater

factor mobility, better access to education, health care and finance, and other, more diffuse,

effects coming from the diffusion of ideas, technologies, etc. Along these lines, our study is

more closely related to Atack et al. (2009), which finds that access to railroads has a strong

positive effect on urbanization but a small effect on population growth in the United States.

Similarly, in a study contemporaneous to ours, Faber (2009) uses a straight-line instrument

to study the impact of recently constructed highways in China on economic performance.7

    Moreover, our paper provides a potential interpretation of the lack of infrastructure

effects which is of some independent interest. The idea that the lack of factor mobility might

limit the impact of better infrastructure is of considerable relevance to many developing

countries that are currently investing in improving their infrastructure.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We start with a brief review of the literature

in Section 2. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework that we use to think about

our results including a simple model of industrial location choice. Section 4 provides the

background and the empirical strategy. Section 5 describes the data. Section 6 presents the
variation in access caused by the fact that highways tended to be built in either a North-South direction or
an East-West direction starting from big cities. Donaldson (2010) studies the effects of railroad construction
in 19th century India using a DD approach. Keller and Shiue (2008) uses a similar strategy to examine the
opening up of railways between regions within Germany.
   7
     While Atack et al. (2009) primarily uses a DD approach, it also constructs an instrument for the distance
to the railroad based on the straight line between the start and end points of a railway line. Similarly, Faber
(2009) both uses a straight-line instrument as well as estimates of transportation costs for exogenous variation
in access to transportation. Both studies generously credit the straight-line instrument to an earlier version
of our paper (Banerjee et al., 2004).

results. Section 7 offers concluding remarks.



2        Growth, Capital and Mobility

This section briefly discusses factor mobility in China in the aspects that relate to the

simple model we present in the next section. We aim to make three points. First, central

planning policies caused the endowment of human and physical capital to be higher in

urban areas relative to rural areas in the pre-reform era (1949-76). However, to promote

rural industrialization, the pre-reform government also invested high quantities of capital in

rural areas (Unger, 2002). Second, restrictions on migration largely prohibit the mobility of

unskilled labor during the post-reform period of our study and limited financial development

probably did inhibit capital mobility (West and Zhao, 2000). Finally, the post-reform era

was characterized by very high growth rates.8

        Chinese central planners have always focused on economic growth and industrialization.

In the early 1950s, this meant moving skilled workers and machines into cities. During

this period, the percentage of government revenues used to fund industrial development

increased from 32% in 1952 to 57% in 1957 (Eckstein, 1977). Much emphasis was also put

into improving human capital in cities. In addition to moving skilled workers into cities, a

special emphasis was put on secondary and higher education. Note that all secondary and

higher education institutions in China are located in cities. This naturally causes human

capital to be drawn into cities even if some of the students were born in rural areas.

        Rural areas also received investment, albeit less than the cities. An enormous number

of primary schools were established so that all rural children will have access to a basic

education. Literacy rates in China reportedly improved from less than 20% in 1949 to 68%

by 1982, even though almost 80% of the population was still rural (Jowett, 1989). Rural

areas also received investments in physical capital: villages were collectivized and physical

capital was owned and managed by collectives. When China de-collectivized during the

early 1980s, collective assets were inherited by villages, and were often used to form Town

and Village Enterprises (TVE). The ownership structure of TVEs are peculiar to China.
    8
        See, for example, Hu et al. (1997) for an overview of Chinese growth.


                                                        8
       For our study, it is important to note the following facts. First, a significant proportion

of industrial output in China during our study period came from TVEs. As a percentage

of national industrial output, output from TVEs grew from 9% in 1978 to 36% in 1993.9

Second, TVE assets are jointly owned by all community residents, which were approxi-

mately 400 households in an average village and 3,500 households in an average township.

Households owned equal shares in TVEs and it was illegal to sell or transfer their shares

to non-community members. Third, the law required that at least 60% of the profits be

retained in the village.10 The data show that over half of the profits were re-invested.11

These three facts together suggest that a significant amount of productive capital was in

rural areas, and policy both prevented their mobility to cities and promoted further capital

accumulation in rural areas.

       Labor mobility was also restricted. If a worker moved without official permission, she

lost access to all public goods. For urban residents, this meant losing access to schools,

healthcare, and during the 1980s and early 90s, it also meant the loss of food rations and

housing. For rural residents, this meant the loss of farmland. Government permission was

easier to obtain for skilled workers such as college graduates who could obtain jobs that

assisted them in getting the permission to relocate or workers with skills that are needed in

specific industries such as construction during the mid- and late- 1990s. But for the rest of

the population, permission was extremely difficult to obtain (e.g., Meng, 2005; Meng and

Kidd, 1997). Therefore, while the number of migrant workers increased greatly during this

period, most of them were temporary migrants who maintained their original residences.12

       Finally, it is important to point out the differences in growth rates between cities and

rural areas and how they changed over time in China during the post-Mao reform era, when

income increased rapidly for the country. During the first years of the period, 1978-84,

the real income of rural residents grew at 17.7% per year while it was only 7.9% for urban

residents. This pattern was reversed in the mid-1980s and the urban advantage increased

     There has been numerous studies on migration in China. Zhao (1999) provides a survey of recent
evidence.

steadily for the remainder of the reform era. On average, rural real income growth rates

declined to only 4.1% while urban real income growth was approximately 6.6% (Cai, 2010).



3     Conceptual Framework

There are a number of reasons why good transportation infrastructure can be advantageous

for economic development. First, it plausibly reduces trade costs and promotes market

integration. This should lead to a convergence in prices, reduce price volatility and reallocate

resources along the lines of comparative advantage. It also increases market size, which

allows firms to capture gains from increasing returns and promotes more intense competition.

Second, it promotes factor mobility – e.g., it is easier to migrate to the city if one can return

easily whenever needed; easier to lend to a borrower whose project you can visit; and easier

to deposit your savings in a bank if the bank is more accessible. Third, it is easier to take

advantage of opportunities for investment in human capital – e.g., you can send your child

to a better school or take him to a better doctor. Finally, there are intangible benefits. For

example, freer movement of people and goods may bring with it new aspirations, new ideas

and information about new technologies.


3.1     A simple model of trade and factor mobility

The goal of the model is to look at the effects of distance in a setting where distance affects

both the mobility of goods and that of factors of production. The model will illustrate how

access to infrastructure can produce very different results depending on which of the two is

more affected by distance.


3.1.1    Building blocks

There are M + N + 1 regions in this economy: M distant regions, N connected regions

and 1 metropolis. Each region produces one good exclusively for export which could be the

same as or different from the goods that it imports (e.g. food), and another good which

it consumes. These goods could be either identical or differentiated. The key assumption



                                               10
is that the relative price of the exportable in terms of the importable good in the “world

market” is the same, p. However, distance to the market adds to the cost. We model this by

assuming that this transportation cost is increasing in distance from the market such that

the price received by the exporters is p in the metropolis, p(1 − d1 ) in the connected region

and p(1 − d2 ) in the distant regions, where d2 > d1 .

       Production is carried out by a population of firms of identical size in each region. Pro-

duction requires two inputs which we will call labor and capital, but could also be labor

and human capital with small adjustments in the arguments. Output of the exportable is

given by AK α L1−α (K)β everywhere, where K is the average level of K in firms in that

region.13 In other words, in the urban economics tradition, we allow for spillovers from co-

location. However, we assume that the spillovers are not so large as to swamp diminishing

returns entirely: α + β < 1.14 Assume for the time being that there is no other technology

of production.

       The key assumption is with respect to factor mobility. We assume that labor does not

move: The metropolis has an endowment of labor of L∗ while all other regions have an

endowment of L0 . Capital, on the other hand, does move, but moving is costly. We assume

that in equilibrium, the direction of movement that would be needed is from the various

regions to the metropolis. This is consistent with the view that in the initial years of Chinese

growth after 1978, much of the growth and capital accumulation occurred in rural areas,

and it was only later that economic freedoms were extended to urban areas and the urban

growth rate crossed its rural counterpart. Therefore, when the rental rate for capital in the

metropolis is r, we assume that the opportunity cost of capital in the connected regions is

r(1 − ρd1 ) and that in the distant regions, is r(1 − ρd2 ). In other words, the further one is,

the more it costs her to send capital to the metropolis. Therefore, she is willing to accept

a lower return on capital if it is invested in her own region (e.g., because she can monitor

the borrower more easily).15 We assume that there are no other constraints on mobility (no
  13
      We could easily let A vary across the locations to captures differences in the flow of ideas.
  14
      See Duranton and Puga (2004) for a review of this literature.
   15
      The equivalent assumption for human capital would be that there is a cost to relocating from one’s home
region to the city, but the cost is lower if she is better connected (e.g., because it is easier to travel to and
fro).

3.1.2   Analysis of the basic model

Analysis of this model is straightforward. Profit maximization with respect to the inputs

yields the generic conditions:

                                  w = p(1 − d)A(1 − α)(     ) (K)β and                      (1)
                                                          L
                                                     L 1−α
                        r(1 − ρd) = p(1 − d)Aα(        )   (K)β ,
                                                     K

where w is the wage rate in that type of region, L is the labor endowment, K is the

equilibrium amount of capital invested in a firm in that region and d is the corresponding

distance variable (d = 0 for the metropolis, d = d1 for the connected regions and d = d2 for

the distant regions). In addition, there is the capital market clearing condition:


                                  M KD + N KC + KM = K,                                     (2)


where KD is the average amount of capital used in the distant region (per firm), KC is the

same thing in a connected region and KM is that in the metropolis. K is the total supply

of capital in the economy.

   Manipulating the capital demand condition and using the fact K = K and L = L0

outside the metropolis yields

                                              p(1 − d)
                                 K 1−α−β =             Aα(L0 )1−α ,                         (3)
                                             r(1 − ρd)

which tells us that whether the distant regions or the connected have more capital per firm
                                   (1−d)
depends on whether the ratio      (1−ρd)   is increasing or decreasing in d. If ρ > 1, which is

the case where capital is less mobile than goods, then the distant region will actually have

more capital per worker. Using the wage-rental ratio as the measure of inequality, as is




                                                12
conventional in trade models, we see that

                                        w       (1 − α)( LK0 )
                                              =                .                             (4)
                                    r(1 − ρd)       Aα

It follows directly that inequality is higher wherever K is lower. In other words, if capital

is less mobile than goods, then the more distant region would have less inequality because

it is able to retain more of its capital. A similar result would hold if we replaced capital by

human capital and used the skill premium to measure inequality.

   Finally, we compare outputs per worker/capita,

                                                       1 α
                                  y = p(1 − d)A((         ) (K)α+β ,                         (5)
                                                       L0

which can be written as

                                           1 α p(1 − d)                α+β
                                                                0 1−α 1−α−β
                         y = p(1 − d)A((      ) (           Aα(L )   )      .                (6)
                                           L0     r(1 − ρd)

In the case where ρ < 1, this expression is clearly decreasing in d since both the p(1 − d)
                p(1−d)
term and the   r(1−ρd)   term declines with d, but when ρ > 1, we might actually observe the
                                                                                            α+β
reverse, especially when spillovers are large (1 − α − β is close to zero) and therefore   1−α−β

is large. Once again this is because the better connected region loses more of its capital.


Result 1: In the basic model, output per capita will always be higher and inequality lower

in the better connected region as long as capital is more mobile than goods. However when

capital is less mobile than goods, the more distant area will have less inequality and the

difference in per capita output between the regions will tend to be small and may even be

higher in the more distant region.

   What is the effect of trade opening in this economy? If we model it as an increase in p,

the price of the exportable, it increases incomes everywhere at the same rate. The rate of

growth will not depend on the location.




                                                  13
Result 2: In the basic model, the effect of trade opening would be to raise income levels

everywhere in proportion and hence have no differential growth effect.


3.1.3    A simple extension

The growth result here is somewhat of an artifact of the way the model is set up. Suppose

we add an alternative production technology that uses only labor and produces a perfect

substitute for the importable good (e.g. agriculture) using the technology x = BL , where

L is the labor input. The good is consumed in the location and does not need transporting.

The point is that now the wage in the exporting sector, w, needs to be bigger than B for

there to be production of exportable goods. In this model, there can be three types of

equilibria: type A, where both close and distant locations export; type B, where one of the

locations exports and the other does not; and type C, where neither exports. As long as

ρ < 1, we know that wages, which are proportional to output per capita, will be lower in

the more distant location, and therefore, if we are in case B, the distant location will not

export. It follows that as long as ρ < 1, the effect of trade opening will either be the same

in both areas (types A and C), or the more connected area will grow faster.

    On the other hand, when ρ > 1, it is not clear which of the two locations will have lower

wages, and the gap between wages is likely to be small. Therefore we are more likely to be

in either type A or C equilibria. Given the high average growth rate of approximately 8%

in both close and far regions (see Table 2 column 3), scenario A seems more likely at least

for the present. This is consistent with the fact that China now has excellent infrastructure

and both near and far places are relatively easily accessed.16 In any case, in both type A

and type C equilibria, the effect of trade opening on growth rates is the same both in close

and distant places, unless the effect of the trade shock is just big enough to move one area

from not exporting to exporting but not the other.
  16
     In the model, it is possible for even a very poorly connected area to export because we place no lower
bound on the interest rate. But if transportation is really expensive, the interest rate will have to be very
negative in the distant areas to permit exporting. It seems likely that capital owners will then prefer to hold
cash or gold and therefore, there will not be any exports.




                                                      14
Result 3: In the model with “agriculture”, trade opening is likely to benefit the closer

area more in terms of growth rates as long as capital is more mobile than goods, but in the

reverse case, growth rates in both close and distant areas should react relatively similarly to

trade opening. Moreover, assuming that China is in a type A equilibrium, Result 1 should

continue to hold in this case.

    To summarize, a pattern where inequality is higher in more connected areas, but output

level differences are small and growth rate differences are absent, is consistent with a setting

where capital is less mobile than goods. The lack of a differential growth effect in this

scenario is consistent with an overall beneficial effect of transportation infrastructure, which

is what allows both close and more distant areas to be exporting.



4     Historical Background and Empirical Strategy

4.1    The Birth of Modern Infrastructure

As explained above, the basic idea behind our empirical strategy is to examine the corre-

lation between the distance to the nearest straight line connecting two historical cities and

the outcomes of interest. Throughout the paper, we assert that these lines capture major

transportation networks during the 1980s because they capture the first modern infrastruc-

ture (e.g. railroads) built in China and much of the infrastructure development afterwards

began by initially building along these routes. Later in Section 6.4, we will provide evidence

for our assertion.

    To draw the lines, we start with the set of important historical cities in China circa 1860:

Beijing, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming and Nanchang. These were

urban centers that were politically and economically important. To these we add the four

Treaty Ports that were set up by the League of Eight Nations after they defeated the Qing

government in the First Opium War in 1842 (Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou and Guangzhou).

These four cities were chosen for their strategic locations. The “unequal treaties” that were

signed between China and the League of Eight Nations after the Opium Wars allowed the

Western countries to house their military in the Treaty Ports but not beyond. Therefore,


                                              15
these ports were chosen to be easily accessible by European ships and also to be strategically

advantageous for reaching Chinese cities in case of an uprising or war.

    The four Treaty Ports in our sample are all along the coast or a major navigable river.

Shanghai and Ningbo are on the northern and southern mouth of the Yangtze River, Fuzhou

was on the southern coast of the Yellow Sea, and Guangzhou was on the Xi River, near its

mouth on the South China Sea. All of these ports were easily accessible by the naval gunships

of the Western countries and therefore allowed them to both impose their military presence

as well as control international trade with China.17 With the exception of Guangzhou, these

locations were villages and not prominent historical urban centers prior to becoming Treaty

Ports (such as Nanchang or Xian). Therefore, the lines that we draw between these Treaty

Ports and the historical Chinese cities have no reason to go through regions of particular

importance to the Chinese.

    Moreover, it is important to point out that the Chinese were significantly behind the

Europeans in terms of naval technology in 1842, and did not possess a fleet of similar navel

gunships for which the Treaty Ports were chosen. More generally, China had conducted a

very limited amount of international trade since the 16th Century through the Ming and

Qing Dynasties. Similarly, it did not have an outgoing navy for several centuries leading

up to the Opium Wars.18 Therefore, places such as Shanghai, Ningbo and Fuzhou, while

not entirely uninhabited prior to 1842, were only rural agricultural areas with small stations

for domestic naval patrol boats. Their insignificance before 1842 is shown by the fact that

none of the four cities were connected to the Grand Canal, which was a north-south canal

built to connect Beijing to the important Southern cities. It follows then, that when we

draw lines to connect the Treaty Ports and historical Chinese cities, we are unlikely to be

systematically capturing important routes from before 1842. Instead, the lines will capture

modern transportation networks built afterwards.
  17
     The Treaty Ports were established in Article 2 of The Treaty of Nanjing, which was signed between
the British and the Qing government. Article 2 requested the four cities we mention and Xiamen to be
established as Treaty Ports. But in practice, Xiamen did not receive significant investment from the West
and only became a Treaty Port during the second wave of Treaty Port Relinquishment by the Qing in 1865.
Therefore, in our line construction, we omit Xiamen. The other Treaty Ports of the second wave were
Tianjin, Niuzhang, Yantai, Zhenjiang, Hankou, Shantou, Taibei and Tainan (Spence, 1990; Pong).
  18
     See Spence (1990, Ch. 2) for a detailed discussion of China during the 19th Century.



                                                   16
    The first and perhaps most important transportation infrastructure are railroads. They

were mostly built during the early 20th Century jointly by the Qing government and Western

countries. The latter provided much of the financing and had much influence over the

placement of the railroads. They were largely built to promote Western economic and

military interests in China and connected Treaty Ports to historical cities, and also connected

historical cities to Colonial cities outside of China. For example, the British planned and

financed railways to connect the Yangtze River valley as well as a north-south railway to

connect Wuhan to Guangzhou against the protest of the Qing government, who feared that

this would facilitate fast British troop deployment from Shanghai and Ningbo to important

Chinese cities. The French planned and financed a railway to connect Kunming to Hanoi,

an important city in French Indochina. The Russians planned a railway that was almost a

straight line from Beijing to Vladivostok through Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces

(Spence, 1991: pp. 249-56).


4.2    Straight Lines

We construct our independent variable using a simple algorithm. We draw a straight line

from each historically important city to the nearest Treaty Port and/or to the nearest other

historically important city. If there are two cities (or ports) where the difference in distances

are less than 100km, we draw a line to both. The line is continued past the city until it

hits a natural barrier (e.g. Tibetan Plateau, coast line), or a border to another country. If

extended, many of these lines will reach important Colonial cities outside of China. They

lines are shown in Figure 1.

    As expected, the lines drawn this way coincide well with railroads constructed during

the early 20th century.19 The three places where they do not match well are North-Western

China, where construction occurred under the Communist government after the 1970s, partly

as an attempt to politically integrate these areas into China; and North Eastern China

(Manchuria), where most of the construction was done by a de facto colonial Japanese
  19
     While the railroads suffered much damage during World War II, after the war, the Guomingtang (KMT)
and then the Communist (post -1949) governments undertook extensive repairs and construction focused on
upgrading the physical structure. A comparison of maps from the 1930s to maps from the 1950s indicate
that they mostly did not alter the course of the railroads.


                                                  17
government during the 1920-30s as part of their attempt to lay claims to these areas (Figure

1 shows that in Manchuria, most counties have a railroad). For this reason, our estimating

sample will exclude Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and the provinces in Manchuria.

   Our main source of plausibly exogenous variation for access to infrastructure is the

nearest distance from the center of each county to this straight line. The centroid of counties

are illustrated in Figure 1. Both the centroids and the nearest distance are computed by

ArcGIS using the Asia Conical Projection. We use geographic distance rather than travel

distance measured as kilometers. This line is also our proxy for transportation infrastructure.

   To check that the lines do indeed proxy for transportation infrastructure, we estimate

the correlation between distance to the line and various measures of infrastructure using the

following equation:

                                 Icpt = δlnLcp + ρp + γt + εcpt .                               (7)

   Transportation infrastructure in county c in province p and year t, Icpt , is a function

of: the natural logarithm of the distance to the nearest line connection treaty ports and

historical cities illustrated in Figure 1, Lcp ; province fixed effects, ρp ; and year fixed effects

γt . Note that the fact that the line is likely to be corrected with many different types of

transportation infrastructure means that Lcp is not an excludable instrument for any given

infrastructure.

   Our main estimating equation is the following:


                             ycpt = βlnLcp + ΓZ cp + ρp + γt + εcpt .                           (8)


   The outcome for county c, province p and year t, Ycpt , is a function of: the natural

logarithm of the shortest distance to the line for county c in province p, Lcp ; a vector of

county-specific controls, Xcp ; province fixed effects, ρp ; and, year fixed effects, γt . The

standard errors are clustered at the county level. If proximity to the line is beneficial, then

β̂ < 0.

   Interpreting β as the causal effect of proximity to the line assumes that the only difference

between places near the line and places further away is the distance to the line. This


                                                18
obviously relies on the terminal cities not being chosen so that the straight line between

them would run through economically important regions. This is the reason for why we

focus on the ancient cities of China and the Treaty ports – i.e., the historical cities are both

sufficiently far from each other and clearly more important than any place between them

in the historical era that it is easy to be comfortable with the identification assumption

in this context. Similarly, the Treaty Ports were chosen for their suitability for European

gunships rather than what laid between them and the historical cities. Note that we restrict

our attention to the first four Treaty Ports to avoid the potentially endogenous influences

of later Treaty Ports, which may have been chosen for economic reasons (e.g. proximity to

economically viable or prosperous regions).

   There are two caveats. First, being closer to the line will by construction mean that a

county is also closer to the terminal cities. Therefore, our baseline specification will control

for distance to the terminal cities. Second, the line from some historically important cities to

a Treaty Port might follow along a river, an important traditional means for transportation

as well as an important input for agriculture (e.g., river beds provide fertile soils). In this

case, distance from our line will also capture the distance from the river, which presumably

captures many other effects. To address this, our baseline specifications always control for

distance to the nearest navigable river.

   The baseline estimation also controls for other potentially influential factors, which we

will discuss and motivate later in the paper.

   Note that it is not clear that we can expand the set of cities being connected (and

therefore use more of the data) without running into potential problems. One issue is that

of endogeneity raised earlier. Another equally important issue comes from the very nature

of the construction of lines. We compare places that are close to a line with those that are

further away. The implicit assumption is that moving further away from one line does not

bring us closer to a different line, a problem that occurs when there are too many lines. We

ensure this by having relatively few lines and using a sample of counties that are not too

distant from any line. The maximum distance of any county in our sample from the nearest

line will be 336 km. Figure 1 shows that there are only ten lines. We will return to discuss


                                                19
this further in Section 6.4.



5    Data

This paper uses data from multiple sources. All maps are obtained in digital format from the

Michigan China Data Center. Geographic measures are constructed using ArcGIS software,

assuming a Conical Projection. We define centroids of cities and counties. The lines are

constructed to connect the centroids of segment cities (using the algorithm described earlier).

We compute the nearest distance from each centroid to the straight line, railroads, navigable

rivers, the coastline, the country border and segment cities. Figure 1 displays a map of county

boundaries, their calculated centroids, our constructed lines, railways and major navigable

rivers. Since the road network in China is quite dense, the distance between an arbitrarily

defined centroid and the nearest road is not a meaningful measure of access to roads. Our

proxy for access to roads is instead the density of roads in each county. Since our regressions

will control for county area, we can control for road density by controlling for road length.

Therefore, we compute the length of highways (multi-lane highways) and paved roads (paved

motor-roads) in each county.

    The first outcome measure we examine is county-level per capita GDP. These are from the

Provincial Statistical Yearbooks from China from 1986-2003 stored in the National Library in

Beijing, China. In 2004-6, we collected and digitized data from all published yearbooks that

reported county-level statistics on GDP. These data are interesting because they measure

production whereas previous studies have mainly focused on prices. However, there are

several problems with these data. First, GDP may have been measured using different

techniques across provinces and over time. To the extent that these changes are documented

or obvious (e.g., changes in the units of measurement), we have corrected for them. But this

is clearly still imperfect. Second, not all counties report GDP and those that are reported are

not a random sample of Chinese counties. Third, many counties do not consistently report

over time, which means that we have an unbalanced panel where attrition is non-random.

There is little documentation on the logic behind the decision of which counties report GDP



                                              20
and we can do little to correct for it. Our final sample is an unbalanced panel of 310 counties

within seventeen provinces.20 In addition to the data on GDP, we collected data on county

population so that we can calculate per capita GDP. Figure 2 maps the counties for which

we have GDP data.

    To address these measurement difficulties, we supplement the analysis with two addi-

tional data sets of higher quality. While they cannot allow us to directly correct for the

county-level GDP data, they do allow us to check that the estimated effects in these two

alternative data sets are consistent to our theory. The first of these are firm-level data from

the Census of of Industrial Plants in 1993 and the Census of Manufacturing Firms during

2004-2006. We are able to geocode these data to the county level.21 The first survey includes

all industrial plants. The second survey samples all manufacturing firms in China that have

market capitalization of five million RMBs or more. We will examine two outcomes, the

number of firms and their profits. The data are aggregated to the county and year level and

form an unbalanced panel of counties. Figure 3 maps the counties for which we have firm

data.

    The second additional data are village-level data for rural household incomes from the

National Fixed Point Survey (NFS) for the years 1987-1991, 1993, 1995-2005. There were

no surveys in 1992 and 94 for administrative reasons. The NFS is a longitudinal survey of

about 320 villages and 24,000 households distributed across all continental Chinese provinces

conducted by the research arm of the Ministry of Agriculture (RCRE). The villages were

chosen in 1987 to be nationally representative. There is very little attrition. To maintain

its representativeness, villages and households are added over time. Therefore, the panel of

villages is not perfectly balanced. For this study, we use household level data on income.

Each village contains on average 400 households and approximately a third of them are

surveyed by the NFS. The large number of households surveyed in each village means that we
  20
     Beijing, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi,
Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia.
  21
     These data are in principle available for other years. However, we only use the four years for which we
could geographically identify the location of the firm at the county level. This data has been recently used
by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and Banerjee et al. (2012). See these studies for a more detailed description of
the data.




                                                    21
can examine the within village income distribution.22 Our income variable measures total net

income – i.e., the sum of household income (e.g., home production, agricultural production,

wages) minus the sum of production costs, excluding labor costs for home production and

agriculture. The data are aggregated to the county and year level. The RCRE provided us

with income for each decile of the village income distribution and the Gini coefficient for

the within village income distribution each year and did not provide us with average income

across all households. Therefore, in the analysis, we will focus on income of the 10th, 50th,

90th percentiles and the Gini coefficient. Figure 4 maps the counties for which we have

NFS data. Note that the exact location of these villages are confidential. Therefore, our

distance variables measure the distance from the centroid of the county that contains the

village to the object of interest. This introduces measurement error to the right-hand-side

of our estimates for household income that is most likely classical in nature.

    For all samples, we exclude the autonomous regions of Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongo-

lia both because these provinces are predominantly non-Han ethnic minorities, faced different

policies, and because the railroads constructed in these regions were the results of very dif-

ferent imperatives. For the latter reason, we also excluded the three Manchurian provinces

of Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin. The large cities that are on the segment termini are

also excluded to avoid the results being driven by the end-points, which are on the line and

were chosen because they were important to begin with. It is important to note that other

cities on the line (that are not the termini of line segments) are included in our sample so

that our estimates will capture any effects that transportation infrastructure may have on

the formation or growth of cities.

    Table 1 describes the data. Panel A describes the sample with GDP data. On aver-

age, these counties are approximately 71 kilometers from the line and 39 kilometers from

railroads. The fact that the average distance to railroads is less than the average distance

to the line reflects the fact that we constructed many fewer lines than there are railroads

to only capture to major transportation networks and to avoid the problem of having too
  22
     Villages and households are surveyed every year. The survey uses a stratified sampling approach. For
each province, it first randomly selects a number of counties, and then randomly selects a number of villages
within each county. Households are then randomly selected from each village. See Martinez-Bravo et al.
(2010) for a description of these data.


                                                     22
many lines that we discussed earlier. During our study period, there are very few highways

with median dividers in China. On average, a county has only approximately six kilometers

of divided highways. Most motor traffic occurred on paved motor roads without dividers.

An average county has approximately 84 kilometers of such undivided paved roads. The

average county is far from a navigable river, the coastline and the country border.

   Note that the data show significant variation in access to transportation infrastructure.

This alleviates any concerns that our study cannot detect significant marginal effects of

access because high levels of infrastructure investment by the Chinese government causes

there to be too little variation in access.

   The average population of a county is approximately 201,347. Per capita GDP is 6,834

RMB. The nominal GDP reported in the statistical yearbooks are adjusted by the national

CPI. GDP from primary, secondary and tertiary sectors are roughly similar in size. Average

per capita GDP growth is 8% in this sample, which is similar to the national average

during the study period. Most of the income growth comes from the secondary and tertiary

sectors. Note that the number of observations differ across the GDP variables because not

every county is engaged in economic activity in every sector.

   Panel B displays the descriptive statistics for the sample of household income data. For

the sake of brevity, we focus our discussion on the economic variables. The average within-

village Gini coefficient is 0.28. The net household income for the median household is on

average 5,460 RMB (constant), which is almost twice as much as the income of the 10th

percentile household and approximately half of the income of the 90th percentile. Inequality

is growing over time. The Gini coefficient increases by 0.001 per year on average. This

is driven by higher income growth rate for richer households, although the level of income

increases across all parts of the income distribution.

   Since there are approximately three people per household in these data, the household

income here implies a slightly lower income than the per capita GDP from the sample in

panel A. This is not surprising since the earlier sample includes urban and rural areas, while

the household income data in panel B only includes rural households, which are on average

poorer than urban households. Similarly, income growth is slower in rural areas. Recall


                                              23
that there are no data for 1992 and 94. Therefore, we interpolate the annual growth rates

between 1991 and 93, and 1993 and 95 as the growth rates for each two-year interval divided

by two.

    Panel C describes the firm data. Again, for the sake of brevity, we focus on the economic

variables. On average, there are 82 manufacturing firms in a county. For interest, we

divide these firms into three ownership types: firms owned by the state, firms of mixed

ownership and firms owned by private individuals. State-owned firms are directly controlled

by the state. Mixed-ownership firms are typically privatized state firms for which the state

owns most of the equity. Individually owned firms are truly private enterprises that have

little connection to the state. The data show that most firms are owned by the state and

individuals. There are only a few firms that are owned by a mix of state and private parties.

Next, we describe the data on firm profits. These only report profits on counties with at

least one firm. Therefore, the number of observations will differ across variables because

not every county has a manufacturing firm of a particular type. The high level of reported

profits is consistent with the fact that these data sample large firms (more than five million

in market capitalization).

    Table 2 shows the outcome variables of interest for different distances to the line. These

data show that most of the economic measures of interest decline with distance from the line.

Most importantly, we do not observe systematic upticks in these measures as we approach

the furthest deciles, which is reassuring for the concern that distance from our line bring a

count towards another transportation network.

6.1   Lines, Railroads and Transportation Networks

Table 3 shows the estimates of the correlation between the distance to the nearest trans-

portation infrastructure and the distance to our constructed lines based on equation (7).

Distance is measured in terms of kilometers. Panel A shows that distance from the histor-

ical lines are positively correlated with distances from railroads, the coastline and segment


                                             24
cities, and the length of paved roads; negatively correlated with the distance to the country

border and the length of highways within a county; and uncorrelated with whether a county

is on the coast line or near a navigable river. The correlations shown in Panels B and C will

be discussed later in this section.


6.2      The Effect of Distance from the Line on GDP

To illustrate the effects of our baseline controls, we first estimate the effects of distance

to the line on the log of GDP per capita. In Table 4, we begin with a specification that

only controls for province and year fixed effects (see column (1)). In columns (2)-(7), we

gradually introduce the baseline controls. The distances to the segment city controls for the

effect of proximity to a large urban terminus. The distances to the nearest navigable river

and coastline control for access to traditional methods of transportation that existed before

the lines of interest were constructed. The lengths of highways and roads, and total county

area, control for the density of motorways that were constructed long after the lines of

interest. Controlling for the distance to the country border addresses the possible influences

of a “border” effect.23 Finally, the control for the distance to the coastline also addresses

the fact that during the period of our study, economic conditions diverged greatly between

the coastal areas and the interior areas. Without this control, one could be concerned that

a positive correlation between economic outcomes and distance to our lines is an outcome

of faster growth in the coastal areas, which may also be coincidentally closer to our lines

on average. In addition to controlling for the log of the linear measure of these distance

measures, we also control for the quadratic terms to capture the idea that the costs of

distance from transportation may be diminishing over distance (e.g., there maybe increasing

returns to profit).

      The estimates show that the coefficient for the log distance to the historical line and

its standard error are very stable across specifications. The full baseline specification from

equation (8) is shown in column (8). It is statistically significant at the 1% level. It shows

that the elasticity between the distance to the line and per capita GDP is -0.0672. Note
 23
      For example, see Feenstra (2002) and the studies referenced there within.



                                                     25
that because the data indicate that the relationship between the distance from historical

lines and per capita GDP is log-linear, our main specification in column (8) does not control

for the quadratic of the distance from the line.

      One way to assess the magnitude of our results is to benchmark our estimates of the

effect of distance on GDP across space to the total increase of GDP over time in our sample.

In our sample, the 75th-percentile county in terms of distance is 3.8 times further away from

line than the 25th-percentile county. Our estimates imply that distance will cause the 75th-

percentile county to have almost nineteen percent (−0.0672×2.8 = −0.188) lower per capita

GDP. During the eighteen years covered by our data, per capita GDP in our sample grew

from approximately 2,744 to 9,916 RMB (e.g., the annual growth rate was approximately

7.5 percent), which is approximately a 242% increase. Therefore, a comparison of the effect

of distance across space to the increase in GDP over time suggests that the spatial difference

attributable to distance from the line is relatively moderate in size.

      For the remaining results, we will show only the baseline specification for the sake of

brevity. All regressions will control for the full set of baseline controls shown in column (8)

of Table 4: the distances to segment cities, the nearest navigable river, the coastline and

the country border; the length of highways and paved roads within a county; the total area

of the county; the squared terms of each of the aforementioned variables; and province and

year fixed effects. As with the results in Table 4, the estimated coefficients for the distance

from the line are very similar with different combinations of controls.24

      In Table 5, we examine per capita GDP and annual growth in per capita GDP by sector.

We estimate the reduced form effect of the distance to the line from equation (7). The

estimates for the full sample are shown in Panel A. Columns (1)-(4) show that distance to the

line is negatively correlated with GDP levels across sectors. The estimates are statistically

significant at the 1% level for per capita GDP in all sectors and tertiary sectors, and at

the 10% level for secondary sectors. To interpret the magnitude of the coefficient, consider

the estimate in column (1). It shows that the elasticity of per capita GDP with respect to

distance from the line is -0.0672. In other words, a 1% increase in distance from the line

results in a 0.07% reduction in per capita GDP.

       Columns (5)-(8) show the estimates of the effect of distance from the line on per capita

GDP growth. We calculate per capita GDP growth as the difference between log per capita

GDP growth next year and this year for each county, ln(pcgdpc,t+1 )−ln(pcgdpc,t ). To control

for the possibility that poorer regions may experience different rates of growth relative

to rich regions for reasons that are independent of access to infrastructure (i.e. income

may be mean-reverting), we control for two lags of the level measures of the dependent

variable: ln(pcgdpc,t−1 ) and ln(pcgdpc,t−2 ).25 The estimates are statistically insignificant

for all sectors. They are also very small in magnitude, especially when we consider that

the mean growth rate in our sample is 4-8% percent per year, depending on the sector.

Therefore, we conclude that we find a precisely estimated zero effect the distance from the

line on GDP per capita growth.26

       Another way to assess the magnitude of the estimates is to make the extreme assumption

that being near the line benefits production only through a region’s access to railroads.

Under this extreme assumption, we can estimate the upper-bound of the effect of the distance

from railroads by dividing our main estimates by the estimated correlation between distance

to the line and distance to the railroad (e.g., equation (8) with the dependent variable being

the log of distance to railroads). This estimate is 0.133 (the standard error is 0.0628), which
  25
      To check that our results are not driven by the particular lag structure of the controls, we alternatively
control for 3, 4 or 5 year moving averages of lag per capita GDP. Our results are robust and we find no effect
of distance to the line on growth. The estimated coefficients are similarly small in magnitude and statistically
insignificant. The sample size becomes smaller as we introduce longer lags and the estimates become more
imprecise. These estimates are not shown for the sake of brevity, but are available upon request. Note that
one could alternatively control for per capita GDP in the first year of the panel. We do not do this because
the unbalanced nature of our panel means that we would lose too many observations.
   26
      Note that the estimates above avoid the Nickell (1981) bias as we do not control for lag growth. To check
that our results are not driven by this choice of specification, we also estimate the growth regression using the
more traditional method of the Arrellano-Bond System Dynamic Panel Estimation, where we control for the
lag of per capita growth rate. The lags of the level measures are now used as instruments for lag growth rates
rather than controls in the second stage equation. The system GMM estimator uses the levels equation from
the standard Arrellano-Bond estimate to obtain a system of two equations: one differenced and one in levels.
The variables in levels in the second equation are instrumented with their own first differences. This method
has the advantage over the standard Arrellano-Bond Estimate that it typically increases efficiency. Like the
standard estimate, it assumes that the lags of the level measures of the growth variable are exogenous to the
error term. And it has the additional assumption that the first-differenced instruments used for the variables
in levels are also uncorrelated with the unobserved county effects. For references, see Arellano and Bond
(1991) and Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) for more discussion. The estimates are presented in Appendix Table
A.1 panel A. The estimates are mall in magnitude and statistically insignificant. Thus, they are consistent
with our main estimates that distance from the lines have little effect on growth.



                                                       27
means that conditional on all of the baseline controls, doubling a county’s distance from

the line increases the distance to the nearest railroad by approximately thirteen percent.

Dividing the estimate in Table 5 panel A column (1) by 0.133, we calculate that the maximum

elasticity of per capita GDP with respect to the distance to the line is 0.5 for all GDP.

Dividing the estimate in column (5) by 0.133, we calculate that the maximum elasticity

of growth with respect to distance is -0.0156. As pointed out earlier, the distance to the

line is not an excludable instrument for the distance to the railroads because it is also

correlated with other forms of transportation infrastructure. However, by interpreting these

two-stage calculations as the upper-bound effects of railroads, we can starkly illustrate the

small magnitude of the effect (e.g. zero effect) of access to transportation on per capita

growth relative to the effect on the level differences in per capita GDP.

   One potential issue for interpreting for our finding that per capita GDP levels are higher

in regions near the line is the possibility of displacement. For example, the placement of

transportation may cause a “crowding-in” effect such that firms re-locate to be near the line.

This could cause proximity to the line to be positively correlated with production even if the

investment in having a line does not increase aggregate (provincial or national) production

from when there is no line. To investigate this issue, we repeat the estimation on a sample

where the 10% nearest counties are excluded, and then again on samples where the 20%

are excluded. If the full sample results are caused by productive firms relocating to be very

near the railroad, then the estimated effect should decrease in magnitude when we omit

those groups (since one would expect firms that choose to relocate to be close to the line to

relocate as close as possible to the line).

   Table 5 panels B and C provide little support for the crowding-in hypothesizes. For

example, a comparison of the estimates in columns (1)-(4) between the full sample estimates

in panel A to panel C, where the 20% nearest counties are omitted shows that per capita

GDP is, if anything, slightly larger in magnitude as we move further away from the line. As

with the full sample, we find no effect on per capita GDP growth.




                                              28
6.3      The Effect on Firms Placement and Household Income

Table 6 shows the estimated effects of the distance from the line on the number and average

profits of manufacturing firms. Panel A shows the estimates for the full sample. Columns

(1)-(4) show that distance from the line results in fewer firms. The estimates are statistically

significant at the 1% level for all firm ownership types. The coefficient in column (1) indicates

that increasing the distance by 1% will result in a 0.08% reduction in the number of firms.

In columns (5)-(8), we examine log average firm profits. The estimates show that amongst

counties that have at least one firm (of the relevant type), distance results in lower profits.

The estimates are statistically significant for all firms and publicly owned firms at the 1%

and 5% levels. Column (5) shows that a 1% increase in distance results in a 0.1% reduction

in average firm profits.

       As with our earlier exercise, we assess the magnitude of our estimates by comparing

our estimates of the effect of distance on the number of firms across space to the total

increase in the number of firms over time. Since the 75th-percentile county in terms of

distance from the line is approximately 4.68 times further away than the 25th-percentile

county, our estimate in column (1) implies that it should have approximately thirty percent

fewer firms (−0.084 × 3.68 = −0.309). During the three years for which our data uses a

consistent sample frame (2004-06), the average number of firms per county grew by twelve

percent from approximately 83 to 93 firms per county.27 Relative to the change over time,

our cross-sectional estimate implies a high elasticity between distance and the number of

firms. However, this is partly an artifact of the short time horizon the firm panel data. For

example, if the number of firms had grown at the same rate (approximately five percent per

year) for eighteen years (which is the sample length of our GDP data), then the number

of firms would have grown by approximately 130% from approximately forty to 91 firms

per county. Relative to this cumulative growth over the longer time horizon, the implied

elasticity between the number of firms and distance to the line appear more moderate.

       Repeating the same calculation for average firm profits, the estimate in column (5)
  27
    Recall that the 1993 firm data is from a census of all industrial plants and has a different sampling
frame relative to the Census of Manufacturing firms which samples all firms with 5 million RMB or more
in market capitalization.


                                                   29
implies that firms in the 75th-percentile county in terms of distance from the line should

have approximately 38% lower profits than firms in the 25th-percentile county on average

(−0.102 × 3.68 = −0.375). In contrast, average firm profits grew at approximately sixty

percent per year during 2004-6. If this was sustained for eighteen years, the cumulative

growth in firm profits would be 2,950%. While firm profits did not grow until the later reform

era and this crude estimate of cumulative profit growth is likely to be significantly higher

than actual firm profit growth over the eighteen year period, it nevertheless illustrates the

fact that the implied elasticities between distance from the line and firm profits is relatively

small in size.

   In panels B and C, we repeat the estimates on samples where the nearest 10% and 20%

counties to the line are excluded. The estimates are similar to the main sample estimates.

This means that our finding that more firms locate nearer the line is unlikely to reflect a

crowding-in effect.

   We also examined the effect of distance on the growth of the number of firms, the growth

of average firm profits and the returns to capital as measured by profits divided by the

value of total capital. These estimates were negative, small in magnitude and statistically

insignificant. We do not report them in the paper for the sake of brevity and because of

concerns over the quality of the data for returns to capital. Specifically, it is unclear how

capital is valued by these firms. Much of the capital is inherited from the state or collectives

and one would only know the market value if she observed the market transaction of another

similar piece of capital. If further away regions have fewer market transactions such that

firms there are more likely to under-value the capital, then our estimate of the returns to

capital will systematically over-state the effect of the line as we move further away from the

line. This measurement issue is a generic problem in the Chinese data on firm assets.

   Table 7 shows the estimated effects of distance on average household income for agri-

cultural households at the village level. Panel A column (1) shows that distance from the

line is negatively correlated with the Gini coefficient for village household incomes. The

estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level. This is consistent with the finding that

distance from the line is positively correlated with the incomes of the median household, but


                                              30
negatively correlated with incomes of the poorest and richest households. However, these

estimates are not statistically significant.

    In Column (5), we estimate the effect of distance on the annual change of the Gini

coefficient. It shows that distance from the line is correlated with slower growth in inequality.

The estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level. The estimated effects on income

growth are statistically indistinguishable from zero.28

    In panels B and C, we present the results for restricted samples where we omit 10% and

20% closest counties to the line. The estimates show that the effect on household income

inequality is mainly driven by the nearest counties. This might reflect that these areas are

the ones that both gain the most in terms of trade opportunities, but also lose most from

capital (and, though it is not in our model, human capital) mobility.


6.4    Robustness to Additional Lines

One obvious concern with our strategy regards the relevance of our historical lines. Earlier in

this section, we showed that proximity to our lines is positively correlated with proximity to

transportation infrastructure such as railroads and coastal routes. However, our estimates

also suggested that our lines are uncorrelated with the more recently constructed paved

motorways, which have been found by a working paper by Faber (2009) to also affect pro-

duction and growth. In this section, we test that our main results are robust to controlling

for access to such recent transportation infrastructure. Specifically, we directly control for

distance to the expanded set of lines constructed by Faber (2009), which he kindly shared

with us. This expanded set of lines includes our historical lines of transportation and adds

many additional lines to capture recently constructed road networks.

    First, we investigate the difference between the historical and expanded lines in terms of

how each correlates to transportation networks. Table 3 Panel B shows that on average, the

distance from the expanded set of lines is positively correlated to distance from railroads and

the distance from the segment city; negatively correlated with the length of highways and
  28
     Arrellano-Bond estimates are presented in Appendix Table A.1 panel B. They are consistent with the
main results in showing that distance from the line has little effect on income growth. The estimates are
small in magnitude and statistically insignificant.



                                                   31
roads; and uncorrelated with distance from rivers, coastline and country borders. Therefore

the key difference between the expanded set of lines and our historical lines is that the

distance to the former are negatively correlated with road density (recall that we control

for county area), while the distance to the latter are uncorrelated with road density. This

is consistent with the fact that the new lines capture new road networks built away from

the railroads. In Panel C, we examine the correlations of our historical and expanded set

of lines with transportation infrastructure in one regression. The correlation between our

historical lines and transportation infrastructure are robust to controlling for the additional

lines.

    In Table 8, we test the robustness our main estimates by running a “horse race” between

the historical and expanded sets of lines. Note that the sample size is smaller than the one for

our main estimates because Faber’s, (2009) data do not match exactly to ours. Nevertheless,

our baseline estimates from using this restricted sample are similar to those from using our

full sample. More importantly, the estimates show that our baseline estimates of the effect

of historical lines are very robust to controlling for the additional lines. These estimates

suggest that the historical lines are indeed the relevant lines to study in our context.



7    Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate the effects of having access to transportation infrastructure

during the two decades after China opened up to trade and market reforms, when it experi-

enced rapid GDP growth. We find that regions closer to historical transportation networks

have higher levels of GDP per capita, higher income inequality, a higher number of firms

and higher average firm profits. However, these level differences are relatively small in mag-

nitude and we find no evidence that distance affected income growth during the two decades

of rapid economic growth after China opened up its economy to trade and market reforms.

    Our results do not contradict the Fogelian (Fogel, 1992, 1964) interpretation or Huang’s

(2008) view that during this period of fast growth, the Chinese government should not have

focused so much on building transportation infrastructure. However, they are also consistent



                                              32
with an alternative explanation where the infrastructure might have brought sizeable benefits

for the economy as a whole, but the localization of the gains (and the overall level of the

gains) was limited by the lack of factor mobility. The fact that we do not see a strong

divergence between well- and poorly connected areas does not rule out the possibility that

infrastructure had benefits for all of them, but the lack of factor mobility prevented the

gains from being concentrated in relatively better connected areas.

   These results should not discourage those who believe that investment in transportation

infrastructure can promote economic development. Rather, they highlight the importance of

other factors in thinking of the effects of infrastructure on growth. Moreover, as we noted in

the introduction of this paper, without knowing the returns of such investment, one cannot

say whether investments in transportation infrastructure ought to be made. Finding credible

ways to estimate or even bound the social returns remains a very important next step in

this research agenda.

Notes: All regressions control for the full set of baseline controls in Table 4 column (8). Standard errors are clustered at the county
level. The sample is an unbalanced county-year level panel. The GDP data used in panels A-B are from Provincial Statistical
Yearbooks. The income data used in Panels C-D are from the National Fixed Point Surveys. The firm data used in panels E-F are
from the Censuses of Manufacturing Firms. The distance to the historical line is calculated by the authors. The distance to the
expanded set of lines is taken from Farber (2009).

     Note: All regressions control for the full set of baseline controls in Table 4 column (8). In panel A, the lagged dependent variable is instrumented using 1, 2 or 3 lags of the per capita
     GDP level for the relevant sector. In panel B, the lagged dependent variable is instrumented with 1, 2, or 3 lags of the relevant income level. The standard errors are clustered at the
     county level. The sample is an unbalanced panel of counties. The data in panle A are from Provincial Statistical Yearbooks.The data in panel B are from the National Fixed Point
     Survey. All geographic data are calculated by the authors.
