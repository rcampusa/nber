                                           ABSTRACT


We examine the impact of bank supervision on the financing obstacles faced by almost 5,000
corporations across 49 countries. We find that firms in countries with strong official supervisory

agencies that directly monitor banks tend to face greater financing obstacles. Moreover, powerful
official supervision tends to increase firm reliance on special connections and corruption in raising
external finance, which is consistent with political/regulatory capture theories. Creating a

supervisory agency that is independent of the government and banks mitigates the adverse
consequences of powerful supervision. Finally, we find that bank supervisory agencies that force
accurate information disclosure by banks and enhance private monitoring tend to ease the financing
obstacles faced by firms.

1. Introduction

         Banks provide a substantial proportion of external finance to corporations around the

globe (Mayer, 1988). Yet, there have been no studies of whether international differences in

bank supervision influence the obstacles that corporations face in raising external finance.

         This paper examines competing theories regarding which bank supervisory approaches

work best to facilitate the flow of credit to firms. Due to information and transaction costs, core

theories of public policy and regulation imply that strong official supervision of banks can

improve the corporate governance of banks (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1980; Stigler, 1971).1 This

“official supervision view” holds that private agents frequently lack the information, incentives,

and capabilities to monitor powerful firms and banks (Becker, 1968; Becker and Stigler; 1974).

From this perspective a powerful supervisory agency will enhance corporate governance of

banks, improve the incentives facing bank managers, and thereby boost the efficiency with

which banks intermediate society’s savings. The official supervision theory assumes that

governments have both the expertise and the incentives to ameliorate information, enforcement,

and transaction costs and improve corporate governance of banks.

         An alternative to the official supervision view also draws on core theories of public

policy and regulation. The “political/regulatory capture view” argues that politicians do not

maximize social welfare; they maximize their own welfare (Hamilton, et al., 1788; Buchanan

and Tullock, 1962; Becker, 1983). Thus, politicians may induce banks to divert the flow of

credit to politically connected firms, or powerful banks may “capture” politicians and induce

official supervisors to act in the best interests of banks rather than in the best interests of society


1
 In a world with (i) no information or transactions costs, (ii) governments that maximize social welfare, and (iii)
well-defined and efficiently enforced property rights, market participants will achieve efficient outcomes (Coase,
1960). If the prerequisites for this laissez-faire – invisible hand – theory hold, government supervision of banks
would be at best irrelevant and potentially harmful to social welfare (Stigler, 1975).
                                                                                                                      2

(Becker and Stigler, 1974; Stigler, 1975; Rajan and Zingales, 2003). This political/regulatory

capture theory suggests that direct official supervision of banks may actually reduce the

efficiency with which banks allocate credit. Specifically, while powerful official supervision

may increase the flow of credit to a few well-connected firms, the political/regulatory capture

theory holds that powerful supervision will hurt the availability of credit to firms in general.

         Economists have attempted to derive mechanisms that simultaneously recognize the

importance of market failures, which motivate government intervention, and political failures,

which suggest that politicians and regulators do not necessarily have incentives to ease market

failures (Becker and Stigler, 1974). From this perspective, the challenge is to create mechanisms

that negate the “grabbing hand” of politicians while creating incentives for official agencies to

improve social welfare (North, 1990; Shleifer and Vishny, 1998; Haber, 2003).2

         In the area of bank supervision, proponents of the “independent supervision view”

argue that creating an independent agency is a useful mechanism for balancing market and

political failures. This view holds that if supervisors are independent from the government and if

supervisors have proper incentives, then this reduces the likelihood that politicians will use the

supervisory agency to induce banks to funnel credit to favored ends. Similarly, if the

supervisory agency is independent from banks and if supervisors have proper incentives, then

this lowers the probability that banks will capture supervisors. Thus, the independent

supervision view proposes a compromise to create a supervisory agency that has the resources to

overcome information asymmetries but that is sufficiently independent so that it avoids




2
 Shleifer and Vishny (1998) use the phrase “grabbing hand” to describe the maximizing behavior of politicians in
contrast to the “helping hand” view, which assumes that governments maximize social welfare. These phrases
contrast nicely with the “invisible hand” theory, which posits that with (i) no market frictions, (ii) social maximizing
governments, and (iii) well-defined and enforced property rights, private agents will produce efficient outcomes.
                                                                                                    3

political/regulatory capture. Under these conditions, independent supervision can enhance the

corporate governance of banks and lower firms’ external financing obstacles.

       The “private empowerment view” takes a different approach to confronting information

and enforcement costs while recognizing that politicians act in their own interests. The private

empowerment theory suggests that bank supervisory strategies should (1) focus on enhancing the

ability and incentives of private agents to overcome informational barriers and exert corporate

control over banks and (2) limit the power of official supervisors. Thus, the “private

empowerment” theory seeks to limit the powers of the supervisory agency so that the

government is unable to use bank supervision to achieve political ends. Simultaneously, the

private empowerment theory seeks to provide the supervisor with sufficient power to force

accurate information disclosure so that private agents can more easily monitor banks (Hay and

Shleifer, 1998). This will boost private monitoring of banks and thereby enhance the incentives

of bank managers to allocate capital based on efficiency considerations (Grossman and Hart,

1980). Furthermore, this view argues that many empowered bank creditors will be less

susceptible to capture by politicians and banks than a single government supervisory agency.

Thus, special connections and corruption may play less of a role in countries that foster private

monitoring. Finally, a second component of the private empowerment view stresses incentives.

Private creditors will more effectively exert corporate governance of banks and therefore

enhance corporate financing if the government does not distort incentives through excessively

generous deposit insurance.

       This paper is further motivated by basic finance theory, banking sector policy concerns,

and broad public policy debates. Consider first corporate finance theory and core theories of

financial intermediation. An enormous theoretical literature examines the role of banks, along
                                                                                                   4

with shareholders and other financiers, in easing financing constraints and exerting corporate

governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Based on some of these models, new research

examines how laws and regulations concerning shareholders influence corporate finance (e.g., La

Porta et al., 2000). Yet, there exists no corresponding work that examines how bank supervision

influences corporate finance. Also, core theories of financial intermediation provide a theoretical

mechanism linking bank supervisory approaches to credit availability. Calomiris and Kahn

(1991), Flannery (1994), and Diamond and Rajan (2001) develop models in which the fragile

structure of banks, i.e., liquid deposits and illiquid assets, serves as an effective commitment

device that keeps banks from assuming excessive risks or from shirking on collecting payment

from firms. Put succinctly, the sequential service constraint on bank deposits creates a collective

action problem among depositors that induces depositors to run if they acquire information that

the bank is not monitoring firms and managing risk appropriately. In this context, generous

deposit insurance impedes the commitment device (threat of a run) and raises barriers to firm

financing (Diamond and Rajan, 2001). Similarly, supervisory policies that induce greater

information disclosure by banks will enhance the commitment mechanism and facilitate external

finance. This paper is an initial attempt to understand how different supervisory strategies affect

the obstacles faced by firms in raising external finance.

       Second, bank supervision is frequently discussed in the context of avoiding banking

crises. However, crises cannot be the only criterion because policymakers can essentially

eliminate banking crises through a 100 percent reserve requirement. Thus, an important

objective of bank supervision – though often under-stated – is to foster efficient capital

allocation; i.e., to finance worthy firms. This is the first paper to assess the impact of bank

supervision on the firms’ financing obstacles across a broad cross-section of countries.
                                                                                                    5

       Finally, this paper provides information on a broad public policy issue. In a host of

circumstances, policymakers face the question, should governments do nothing, empower the

private sector, or directly oversee private activities? This paper addresses this concern by

conducting an investigation of different bank supervisory approaches.

       This paper uses firm-level data on almost 5,000 firms across 49 countries to examine the

impact of bank supervision on the obstacles that firms encounter in raising external capital. The

firm-level data comes from the World Business Environment Survey (WBES), which was

conducted in 1999. This dataset includes information on firm characteristics, including (i) the

obstacles that firms face in raising capital, (ii) the degree to which special connections are

important to raising bank loans, and (iii) the degree to which bank corruption is important to

raising capital. These data are based on survey questions in which firms rank the impediments

on a scale from one to four, in which larger values imply greater obstacles and greater needs for

special connections and corruption. The dataset has extensive coverage of small firms, which

distinguishes it from other cross-country studies of financing constraints that rely on data from

large corporations.

       The bank supervisory data are for 1999 and come from Barth, Caprio and Levine (2003,

henceforth BCL). This database includes information on the official supervisory power, such as

the ability to intervene banks, replace managers, force provisioning, stop dividends and other

payments, acquire information, etc. BCL also have information on the degree of supervisory

independence from the government and whether banks can sue bank supervisors. BCL collect

information on the empowerment of the private sector. This includes information on whether

bank directors and officials face criminal prosecution for failure to accurately disclose

information, whether banks must disclose consolidated accounts, whether international
                                                                                                    6

accounting firms audit banks, etc. Finally, to measure incentives facing private creditors, we use

data on the deposit insurance system from Demirguc-Kunt and Detragiache (2003).

       Econometrically, we use an ordered probit, where the dependent variable is either

financing obstacles faced by firms, the need for special connections, or the extent of corruption

in raising external finance. The main explanatory variables are measures of (1) official

supervisory power, (2) the independence of the official supervisory agency from the government

and banks, (3) the degree to which the bank regulations facilitate private monitoring of banks,

and (4) the generosity of the deposit insurance regime to measure the incentives of the private

sector to monitor banks. In assessing the impact of bank supervision strategies on the financing

obstacles faced by firms, we also control for a range of firm-specific traits and numerous country

specific characteristics, such as inflation, economic growth, and overall financial development.

In the sensitivity analyses, we further control for state-ownership of banks, regulatory restrictions

on bank activities, minority shareholder rights, and checks and balances in the political system.

       The results are inconsistent with the official supervision view and supportive of the

political/regulatory capture view. Specifically, official supervisory power is positively

associated with the financing obstacles faced by firms and positively associated with both special

connections and corruption in raising external finance. Even after controlling for firm-specific

traits and country-specific factors, the results suggest that official supervisory power hinders

external financing opportunities and raises the need for special connections and corruption.

       The data also lend support to the independent supervision view. In particular, when the

supervisory agency is independent, this is associated with lower obstacles to obtaining external

finance. Moreover, independence reduces the negative effects from powerful supervision. As

independence rises, the negative effect of powerful supervision dissipates and indeed vanishes at
                                                                                                    7

the highest levels of supervisory independence. More specifically, as the supervisory agency

becomes more independent from the government, this mitigates the positive impact that powerful

official supervision has on firms’ reliance on special connections and corruption. Thus, the

results suggest that independence tends to reduce political control of the supervisory authority

and hence political manipulation of the flow of credit to firms.

       The paper also presents evidence that supports the private empowerment view.

Regulations that force accurate information disclosure lower obstacles to firm financing and

lower the impression that corruption of bank officials is important for raising external finance.

Furthermore, moral hazard – as measured by the generosity of the deposit insurance system – is

also important. Greater moral hazard tends to raise the corporate financing obstacles faced by

firms. The data are consistent with the view that governments that force accurate information

disclosure to the private sector and do not distort the incentives of banks through excessively

generous insurance of bank liabilities will tend to lower financing obstacles.

       This paper is related to recent research. BCL (2003) conduct a purely cross-country

analysis and find that financial development is (1) positively associated with supervisory

approaches that empower private monitoring of banks and (2) negatively associated with

powerful supervisory agencies that directly monitor banks. In this paper, we use microeconomic

data to examine the channels running from bank supervision to corporate finance, rather than

examining the cross-country connections between bank supervision and banking system size. In

a pure cross-country analysis, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002) find that securities

market regulations that empower private monitoring of corporations promote stock market

development, while securities market regulations that rely on official oversight of markets only
                                                                                                                     8

promote equity market capitalization in countries with efficient government bureaucracies.3 In

this paper, we focus on bank supervision and use firm-level data in assessing whether national

approaches to bank supervision influence firms’ financing obstacles.

        A number of methodological concerns need to be noted. First, individual firms

subjectively report financing obstacles. Thus a firm facing the same obstacles in two different

countries may report different obstacles for reasons that do not depend on actual constraints.

Although it is not clear that this would bias the results in any particular direction, we provide

evidence on the validity of the survey information below. Second, this paper faces the problem

that the supervisory variables might proxy for some other country specific factor. Importantly,

however, we get the same results when including official supervisory power and the private

empowerment variables simultaneously. Thus, supervisory power and private monitoring are not

proxying for the same unspecified factor. Also, the results hold even when controlling for many

economic growth, macroeconomic stability, overall financial development, differences in

political systems, state-ownership of banks, regulatory restrictions on bank activities, laws

governing the rights of shareholders, and the degree to which the state controls or represses the

media. Third, simultaneity bias may influence the results. For instance, the banking crises may

raise financing obstacles and boost official supervisory power. When we control for the

presence of systemic banking crisis, however, this does not change the findings.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the

methodology is described in Section 3. Section 4 gives the results and Section 5 concludes.

 There is a literature on balancing law and regulations to enhance securities market operations. Glaeser, Johnson,
and Shleifer (2001) provide theory and examples concerning the incentives facing judges and regulators in
monitoring financial markets. More broadly, Glaeser and Shleifer (2001) analyze the reasons underlying the
                                                                                                                   9


2. Data and Summary Statistics

        a. Obstacles to firms obtaining external finance: Definitions

        To examine the relationship between bank supervisory strategies and corporate financing

obstacles, we use data from two main sources: the World Business Environment Survey (WBES)

for firm-level data and BCL (2001a,b, 2003) for country-level data on bank supervision.

        From the WBES firm-level survey data, we use information on almost 5,000 firms across

49 countries. While the WBES comprises 80 countries and the BCL database includes data on

107 countries, there is limited overlap, which reduces our sample to 49 countries. The WBES

surveyed firms of all sizes; small firms (between 5 and 50 employees) represent 40% of the

sample, medium-sized (between 51 and 500 employees) firms are 40% of the sample, and the

remaining 20% are large firms (more than 500 employees). The survey comprises mostly firms

of the manufacturing, construction and services sectors. We also have information on whether

these are government-owned, foreign-owned, or privately-owned domestic firms. The data

indicate whether the firm is an exporter and provide information on firm employment, sales,

industry, growth, financing patterns, and the number of competitors.

        Financing Obstacles are measured by using responses to the following question: “How

problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between

1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor obstacle), 3 (moderate obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Table 1 shows

that perceived financing obstacles do not only vary across firms within a country, but also across

countries. Portuguese firms rate financing obstacles as relatively insignificant (1.73), while firms

in Moldova rate financing obstacles as more than moderate (3.44). Overall, 35% of the firms in




increased use of regulation in the United States, while Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) develop a theory and provide
evidence from England and France concerning why different legal systems evolve to regulate behavior.
                                                                                                  10

our sample rate financing as major obstacle, 27% as a moderate obstacle, 19% as a minor

obstacle, and 20% as no obstacle.

       Apart from this general financing obstacle, firms were also asked about the need for

special connections (Special Connection) and corruption of bank officials (Bank Corruption)

in obtaining external funding. Answers vary between one and four, where higher values indicate

a greater needs for special connections and corruption. Table 2 provides summary statistics and

indicates that general financing obstacles is positively correlated with the needs for special

connections and corruption to obtain financing.

       b. Obstacles to firms obtaining external finance: Justification

       The corporate finance literature has used several different approaches to identify firms

that are constrained (Kaplan and Zingales, 1997). Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) use a

priori reasoning to argue that low-dividend firms are constrained. Rajan and Zingales (1998) use

the external financing patterns by US firms as a benchmark for the “natural” dependence of

industries on external financing. Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) rely on a financial

planning model to identify firms that have access to long-term external financing.

       We use survey responses as indicators of the incidence and severity of financial obstacles

for four reasons. First, the survey acquires direct information from firms about perceived

obstacles and therefore does not infer the existence of financing constraints from other

information. Second, the survey data not only has information on general financing obstacles. It

also provides information on the specific types of obstacles that firms face, e.g., special

connections or corruption. Third, the WBES database has excellent coverage of small and

medium size firms (as well as large firms), while other cross-country studies use data that focus
                                                                                                    11

heavily on large corporations. Finally, the WBES has very broad country coverage that is

important for linking the firm-level data with the bank supervision data.

       As noted in the Introduction, using data based on self-reporting by firms may produce

concerns that a firm facing the same obstacles will respond to questions differently in different

institutional and cultural environments. If this were pure measurement error, it would bias the

results against finding a relationship between bank supervision and firm financing obstacles.

       While problems with survey data may bias the results against this paper’s conclusions,

we (a) control for many country-specific traits in our analyses and (b) present four pieces of

information that support the validity of the survey data. First, Hellman et al. (2000) show that in

a sub-sample of 20 countries there is a close connection between responses and measurable

outcomes. They find no systematic bias in the survey responses.

       Second, reported firm financing obstacles are highly, negatively correlated with firm

growth. Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2002) show that the negative impact of

reported financing obstacles on firm growth hold after controlling for many factors and using

instrumental variables to control for endogeneity. Thus, firms’ responses to the survey on

financing obstacles are capturing more than idiosyncratic differences in how firms rank

obstacles.

       Third, we examined the connection between reported firm financing obstacles and

Wurgler’s (2000) measure of the efficiency of investment flows. This is an investment elasticity

that gauges the extent to which a country increases investment in growing industries and

decreases investment in declining ones. We find the reported financing obstacles are negatively

and significantly correlated with this efficiency of investment indicator. Again, the survey data

are associated with a measurable outcome: the efficient allocation of capital.
                                                                                                                12

        Fourth, we study the link between survey responses regarding firm financing obstacles

and industrial expansion. Based on Rajan and Zingales (1998), we examine whether industries

that are naturally heavy users of external finance grow faster in economies that face lower

reported financing obstacles. Thus, we use the same data and specification employed by Rajan

and Zingales (1998). We find that externally dependent industries grow faster in countries where

firms report lower obstacles. While these observations certainly do not eliminate concerns about

the survey data, they suggest that the reported obstacles are closely associated with (i) the growth

of externally dependent industries, (ii) the efficient flow of investment, and (iii) firm growth.

        c. Firm-specific traits

        In our analysis of bank supervision and corporate finance, we control for several firm

attributes such as ownership. Government takes on the value one if the government owns any

percentage of the firm, and Foreign takes on the value one if foreign entities own any fraction of

the firm.4 Our sample includes 12% government owned firms and 20% foreign firms.

        We also control for each firm’s business, competitive environment, and size. The

regressions include dummy variables for whether the firm is an exporting firm (Exporter),

whether it is a manufacturing firm (Manufacturing), and whether it is a service sector firm

(Services). The analyses also include the log of the number of competitors that each firm faces

(Number of Competitors). In sum, 36% of the firms in our sample are in manufacturing and

46% in service, and on average they face 2.3 competitors. Finally, we include the log of sales in

USD as indicator of size (Sales), which ranges from –2.12 to 25.3, with an average of 12.



4
  While these simple zero-one indicators of ownership may not capture the varying degrees of influence that arise
from different levels of government or foreign ownership, information on the percentage of ownership is available
for less than 10 percent of the sample. However, among the firms for which we have data on the percentage of
foreign and government ownership, more than two thirds of firms with foreign ownership are majority foreign
owned and more than 60% of firms with government ownership are majority state-owned.
                                                                                                                 13

        The correlation analysis in Table 2 Panel B indicates that government-owned firms,

domestically owned firms, non-exporting firms, smaller firms (as measured by sales), and firms

with more competitors suffer more financing obstacles.

        d. Bank supervisory policies

        We use four indicators of supervisory practices to test the empirical validity of the

competing hypotheses outlined in the Introduction.

        Official Supervisory Power indicates whether the supervisory authorities have the

authority to take specific actions to prevent and correct problems in banks. This indicator is

constructed from 14 dummy variables that indicate whether bank supervisors can take specific

actions against external auditors, bank management and bank shareholders both in normal times

and times of distress. The exact definition is provided in the data appendix. We use the first

principal component indicator of these variables, which varies between –3.05 (Singapore) and

1.14 (U.S.) with a mean of –0.08, and higher values indicating wider authority for bank

supervisors.5

        Supervisory Independence indicates independence of supervisors from both banks and

the government. Supervisory Independence-Banks is a dummy variable that indicates whether

supervisors are legally protected against lawsuits brought by banks. Supervisory

Independence-Government is the sum of three dummy variables indicating the involvement of

government in appointment, control and removal of supervisors. Supervisory Independence is

the sum of the individual indicators. We examine Supervisory Independence, Supervisory

Independence-Banks and Supervisory Independence-Government.

 The mean is not exactly equal to zero because we use the raw data available from Barth et al. (2003)on the
supervisory indicators. These data are available for a larger number countries than the corresponding data on firm
obstacles.
                                                                                                                 14

        Regarding the theories discussed in the Introduction, the official supervision view

predicts a negative relation between Financing Obstacles and Official Supervisory Power.6 In

contrast, the political/regulatory capture view predicts a positive relationship between Financing

Obstacles and Supervisory Power. The independent supervision view predicts a negative

relation between Supervisory Independence and financing obstacles and also predicts that

independence will reduce the adverse impact of supervisory power on Financing Obstacles.

        We use two indicators to measure the tools and incentives of private bank creditors to

monitor banks and exercise market discipline.

        Private Monitoring is designed to measure the degree to which bank supervision forces

banks to disclose accurate information to the public and induces private sector monitoring of

banks. Private Monitoring is constructed from nine dummy variables that measure whether bank

directors and officials are legally liable for the accuracy of information disclosed to the public,

whether banks must publish consolidated accounts, whether banks must be rated and audited,

whether banks must be audited by certified international auditors, and whether subordinated debt

is allowable (which may create a class of private monitors). The Private Monitoring Index is

constructed as principal component indicator, with higher values indicating more tools and

incentives for private bank creditors to monitor banks, ranging from –1.83 (Moldova) to 1.46

(United Kingdom).

        Moral Hazard, a principal component indicator, measures the generosity of the deposit

insurance scheme and thus proxies for the incentives or the lack thereof for private bank

 See Polinsky and Shavell’s (2000) review of the theory of public enforcement and the discussion in Coase (1988).
Also, Spiller and Ferejohn (1992) note that lawmakers do not have sufficient information to anticipate all possible
circumstances. Thus, there may be efficiency gains to delegating power to a supervisory agency that has the
expertise and resources to set and change the specific rules as events evolve.
                                                                                                  15

creditors to monitor banks. As noted, the Appendix provides the precise definitions of Moral

Hazard and the Private Monitoring variables.

       In terms of theory, the private empowerment view predicts a negative relationship

between Private Monitoring and financing obstacles. The private empowerment view predicts a

positive link between Moral Hazard and the degree of external financing obstacles. As

emphasized, the private empowerment theory presumes that there are market failures and that

these market failures can be ameliorated though information disclosure that facilitates private

sector monitoring, not by direct official monitoring of banks.

       d. Country-level control variables

        To assess the robustness of the relation between bank supervision and firms’ access to

external financing, we include other country-level variables. We include the growth rate of GDP

per capita (Growth) since firms in faster growing countries are expected to grow faster and face

lower obstacles. We use the inflation rate (Inflation) to proxy for monetary instability,

conjecturing that firms in more stable environments face fewer obstacles and grow faster (Boyd,

Smith, and Levine, 2001).

       We also include the level of financial development (Priv), which measures bank credit to

the private sector as a share of GDP. We include financial development to assess the impact of

supervision on corporate finance independent of overall financial development. Overall financial

development is positively associated with economic and firm performance (King and Levine,

1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998; Levine, Loayza, and Beck, 2000; Rajan and Zingales, 1998; and

Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998). Thus, we examine the independent impact of bank

supervision on the financing obstacles faced by firms after controlling for overall financial

development and conditions in the macroeconomic economy.
                                                                                                    16

       Firms in countries with higher inflation, lower financial development, less independent

supervisors and less private monitoring report higher financing obstacles (Table 2 Panel C).

       In our sensitivity analyses, we run regressions including a variety of legal and

institutional indicators and a dummy variable indicating the occurrence of systemic banking

crisis. Specifically, we control for (i) Checks and Balances in the political process, i.e., the

number of veto players in the political system; (ii) Banking Freedom, which measures the

absence of government regulatory restrictions on bank activities; (iii) State-Owned Banks, which

equals the share of a country’s bank assets that are held by banks that are more than 50 percent

government owned; (iv) Shareholder Rights, which is a measure of the legal rights of minority

shareholders vis-à-vis management and large shareholders and (v) the occurrence of a Systemic

Banking Crisis. The Appendix defines each of these variables in detail and we discuss the use of

these variables further when we present the sensitivity analyses.



3. The Empirical Model

       To examine the relationship between bank supervision and corporate finance, we use the

following regression:



Financing Obstaclej,k = α + β1 Governmentj,k + β2 Foreignj,k + β3 Exporterj,k + β4 No. of

Competitorsj,k + β5 Manufacturingj,k + β6 Servicesj,k + β7 Sizej,k + β8Inflationk + β9 Growthk +

β10Privk +β11 Supervisionk + εj,k.                                                            (1)

       The j and k subscripts indicate firm and country respectively. The variable Supervision

in equation (1) represents one – or more – of the various supervision variables discussed earlier.

These supervisory indicators change across the different specifications as we discuss below.
                                                                                                                            17

           Given that Financing Obstacle is a polychotomous dependent variable with a natural

order, we use the ordered probit model to estimate regression (1). We assume that the

disturbance parameter ε is normally distributed and use standard maximum likelihood

estimation.7 The coefficients, however, cannot be interpreted as marginal effects of a one-unit

increase in the independent variable on the dependent variable, given the non-linear structure of

the model. Rather, the marginal effect is calculated as φ(β’x)β, where φ is the standard normal

density at β’x. We use the same estimation procedure when using (a) the importance of special

connections for obtaining external finance (Special Connection) and (b) the importance of bank

corruption (Bank Corruption) for obtaining external finance as dependent variables.



4. Results

       A. Initial Findings

           The results in Table III suggest that (1) firms in countries with powerful supervisors face

higher financing obstacles and (2) firms in countries with strong private monitoring and lower

moral hazard face lower financing obstacles. These results are consistent with the

political/regulatory capture view, but inconsistent with the official supervision view. These

findings also support the private empowerment view since firms face lower financing obstacles

in countries where private bank creditors have the tools and incentives to monitor banks. Official

Supervisory Power and Moral Hazard enter significantly and positively in the regressions of

General Financing Obstacle, while Private Monitoring Index enters significantly and negatively.

           The results also support the independent supervision view. The independence of bank

supervisors is negatively related with financing obstacles (column 2), and it helps alleviate the

7
    Alternatively, we can assume a logistic function for the distribution of e, resulting in the application of the logit
                                                                                                                   18

adverse effect of official supervisory power (column 3). Indeed, at the maximum level of

supervisory independence (4), the marginal impact of additional supervisory power is zero. The

results also indicate that supervisory independence is particularly important for reducing

financing obstacles when bank supervisors have extensive powers.8

         The effect of supervisory practices on firms’ financing obstacles is not only statistically

significant, but also economically relevant. Table IV provides information on the change in the

probability that a firm rates financing obstacles as major (i.e., the probability that a firm rates

financial obstacles as a four) when changing bank supervisory policies. In other words, using the

coefficient estimates from Table III, we examine the impact of changing bank supervisory

policies from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile on the probability that a firm will rank

financing obstacles as major. As we move from the country at the 25th percentile of Official

Supervisory Power to the country at the 75th percentile, the probability that a firm rates financing

as major obstacle increases from 33% to 38%, compared to the sample mean of 35%. The

probability decreases from 38% to 20% and 38% to 30% in the case of Supervisory

Independence and Private Monitoring respectively. As another example, consider Chile and

Canada. The Table III regression estimates indicate that if Chile had the Official Supervisory

Power of Canada (-2.15) instead of its own level (0.05), there would be a nine percent decrease

in the probability that Chilean firms rank financing obstacles as extreme. If Chile had the

Supervisory Independence of Canada (4) instead of the current value in Chile (1), the regression

estimates predict that there would be a 53 percent drop in the probability that Chilean firms rank

financing obstacles as extremely high. Finally, the coefficient estimates on Private Monitoring


model. However, it is difficult to justify the preference of one over the other, and in practice, the two models seem
to give very similar results (Greene, 2000).
                                                                                                                19

indicate that if Chile had the private monitoring values of Canada (1.05 instead of 0.29), there

would be a six percent drop in the probability that Chilean firms rank financing obstacles as

major.

    B. Robustness of the Initial Findings

         Table V confirms our finding for the sub-sample of firms that actually received bank

financing. Our sample might contain firms that have not applied for bank credit, either because

they feel discouraged or because they do not see the need. Excluding firms that have not

received bank finance does not change our results. Official Supervisory Power and Moral

Hazard enter significantly and positively, while Supervisory Independence and Private

Monitoring enter significantly and negatively. The interaction of Official Supervisory Power

and Supervisory Independence enters significantly and negatively, indicating that supervisory

independence alleviates the adverse effect of supervisory power.

         The relationship between supervisory practices and financing obstacles is robust to

controlling for other legal and institutional variables and the occurrence of banking crisis (Table

VI). Here we include Checks and Balances, Banking Freedom, State-Owned Banks, Shareholder

Rights and a dummy variable indicating a systemic banking crisis in the country during the

1990s. We confirm all of the results reported above when controlling for either the extent to

which the political system impedes the exercise of power by one part of government (Checks and

Balances, Panel A) or regulatory restrictions on bank activities (Banking Freedom, Panel B).

Unsurprisingly, state-ownership of banks is highly, positively correlated with supervisory power.

Thus, when we include the State-owned bank variable, neither supervisory power nor state-

owned banks enters independently significantly (Panel C). All the other results hold. We also

8
 The bulk of the paper uses linear regressions. We experimented with including quadratic terms for official
supervisory power and private monitoring. Although we find some attenuation at high levels of official supervisory
                                                                                                                  20

find that shareholder rights, i.e., the degree to which the law protects the rights of minority

shareholders against large shareholders and management, enters negatively and significantly

(Panel D). Stronger shareholder rights reduce external financing obstacles. We also see a

weakening of the link between supervisory power and financing obstacles when controlling for

shareholder rights. This is consistent with the view that when savers have greater legal

protection as equity holders, they feel more comfortable providing equity finance so that firms

have easier access to non-bank forms of external finance. All the other results on private

monitoring and moral hazard hold when controlling for shareholder rights.9 Finally, our results

hold when controlling for the occurrence of a systemic banking crisis in the country (Panel E).

Conceivably, a banking crisis could increase the financing obstacles facing firms and change

supervisory policies. While we do find that systemic crises are associated with firms perceiving

greater financing obstacles, this paper’s core results hold. Overall, the data support the

supervisory independence and private empowerment view, and are inconsistent with the official

supervision view.

         We also conducted further robustness checks on the negative impact of supervisory

power and the positive effects of supervisory independence by controlling or the competitiveness

of the political system and the freedom of the media. Specifically, we ran regressions where we

include supervisory power and independence and their interaction as well as indicators of (i)

competitiveness of legislative elections, (ii) degree of state ownership of media, and (iii) degree

to which the state represses media (Table VII Panel A). While the competitiveness of legislative

elections and absence of state ownership and repression of media decreases financing obstacles,

controlling for these effects does not change (i) the positive impact of supervisory power on


power and private monitoring, we find that the direct effects do not change in these non-linear specifications.
9
  We also ran regressions using Creditor Rights instead of Shareholder Rights. All results hold.
                                                                                                  21

financing obstacles, (ii) the negative impact of supervisory independence, and (iii) the

dampening impact of supervisory independence on the relation between supervisory power and

financing obstacles.

         We also include interaction terms between supervisory power and indicators of political

and media openness. Thus, we assess whether political openness and media openness ameliorate

the negative impact of supervisory power (Table VII Panel B). We find that state ownership and

repression of media exacerbates the impact of supervisory power on financing obstacles. Thus,

empowering the supervisory authority in countries with high levels of state-ownership of the

media and state repression of the media is likely to aggravate the financing obstacles faced by

firms.

   C. Simultaneous Examination of the Bank Supervision Indicators

         In Table VIII, several of the bank supervision variables are included simultaneously.

Specifically, we include (i) Official Supervisory Power, or Supervisory Independence and (ii)

Private Monitoring or Moral Hazard. We also include Private Monitoring and Moral Hazard in

the same regression to assess whether both components of the private empowerment view

independently influence firm financing obstacles.

         When including the bank supervision variables simultaneously, we again find evidence

that is inconsistent with the official supervision view, but consistent with both the

political/regulatory capture view and the private empowerment view. Supervisory power tends

to be associated with greater financing obstacles. Independence of the supervisory authority is

associated with lower obstacles.

         The data further indicate that Private Monitoring enters significantly and negatively,

while Moral Hazard enters significantly and positively. This underlines the importance of both
                                                                                                  22

components of the private empowerment view: private agents can more effectively exert

corporate control over banks if they have the tools (high levels of Private Monitoring) and sound

incentives (low levels of Moral Hazard).

   D. Channels: Special Connections and Corruption

       Next, we turn to the channels through which supervision operates. We examine whether

supervision influences external financing constraints by raising the need for special connections

and corruption in raising capital. Thus, we use alternatively the variables measuring (1) the

importance of special connections and (2) the importance of bank corruption in obtaining

external finance.

       The Table IX results indicate that firms in countries with more powerful and less

independent supervisors are more likely to report the need of special connections for obtaining

corporate finance. While the official supervision view posits the need for powerful official

supervision to minimize favoritism and nepotism in banks’ lending decisions, the

political/regulatory capture view holds that politicians or banks will capture official supervisors

and thus increase the likelihood of favoritism and nepotism.

       Official Supervisory Power enters significantly and positively, supporting the

political/regulatory capture view. Supervisory Independence also enters significantly and

negatively, suggesting the beneficial effects of an independent supervisory agency. Finally, note

that the interaction of Official Supervisory Power and Supervisory Independence enters

significantly and negatively. Thus, independence reduces the negative effects of having a

powerful supervisory agency. These results are consistent with the Political/Regulatory Capture

and Independent Supervision predictions, but inconsistent with the Official Supervision View.
                                                                                                 23

       The Table X results indicate that firms in countries with more powerful and less

independent supervisors are also more likely to report that corruption of bank officials is

important for raising corporate financing. Official Supervisory Power enters significantly and

positively, which again runs counter to the Official Supervisory theory. Supervisory

Independence enters significantly and negatively. These results are consistent with the

political/regulatory view, but inconsistent with the official supervision view. Furthermore,

Private Monitoring enters significantly and negatively, which suggests that empowering private

monitoring of banks tends to reduce the importance of corruption in raising external funds.

Thus, the results lend support to the political/regulatory capture view, the private empowerment

view, and the independent supervision view and run counter to the official supervision view.

   E. More on Independence

       Table XI underlines the importance of supervisory independence from both the

government and banks. Here, we break apart the two components of the Supervisory

Independence index separately into supervisory independence from banks (Supervisory

Independence-Banks) and supervisory independence from the government (Supervisory

Independence-Government). We then examine the independent effects of these two components

of supervisory independence in the regressions.

       We find that supervisory independence from the government and banks decreases general

financing obstacles. Furthermore, independence from banks has a direct, negative impact on both

the need for special connections and bank corruption in raising capital.

       We also find evidence that supervisory independence from the government helps

alleviate the effect of official supervisory power on the general financing obstacles faced by

firms. Thus, the interaction term between Supervisory Independence-Government and Official
                                                                                                    24

Supervisory Power enters with a negative and significant coefficient. Similarly, the Table XI

regressions indicate that supervisory independence from the government also reduces the effect

of supervisory power on the need for firms to have special connection in order to raise funds

from banks. Official Supervisory Power enters positively and significantly in all regressions.

Again, these results are inconsistent with the official supervision view and underline the

importance of an independent supervisory body to avoid both political and regulatory capture.



5. Conclusion

       This paper provides evidence on different theories of bank supervision. The results

provide four tentative conclusions about which bank supervisory practices work best to ease the

external financing obstacles faced by firms.

       First, we examined whether strong official supervision of banks facilitates corporate

finance. Here, the answer is a resounding no. Countries with stronger bank supervisory agencies

– countries where supervisory agencies can intervene banks, replace managers, force

provisioning, stop dividends, etc. – tend to have firms that face greater financing obstacles than

firms in countries where the supervisory agency is less powerful. Even after controlling for

firms-specific traits and country-specific characteristics, we find that supervisory power hinders

external financing opportunities and raises the need for special connections and corruption. The

results are inconsistent with theories that hold that official supervisory agencies will promote

social welfare by overcoming the information and enforcement costs faced by private agents.

Rather, these findings are consistent with the view that politicians will use powerful supervisory

agencies to divert the flow of credit to politically connected firms and that powerful banks will
                                                                                                   25

“capture” politicians and induce bank supervisors to support the interests of banks, not the

interests of society (Stigler, 1975; Shleifer and Vishny, 1998; Rajan and Zingales, 2003).

       Second, we evaluate whether creating an independent supervisory agency mitigates the

adverse effects of having a powerful official regulator. We find evidence consistent with this

view. Greater supervisory independence from the government and from banks tends to lower

impediments to obtaining external finance. Furthermore, independence reduces the negative

effects from power supervision. As independence rises, the negative impact of powerful

supervision on firm financing obstacles dissipates. Specifically, as supervisory independence

from the government rises, the adverse impact of powerful supervision on firms’ reliance on

special connections and corruption in raising capital falls. These findings are consistent with the

view that supervisory independence moderates political control of the supervisory agency and

therefore reduces political manipulation of the flow of credit to firms.

       Third, we examine whether bank supervisory strategies that focus on empowering the

private sector facilitate corporate finance. The answer is yes. In countries where bank

supervision forces accurate information disclosure by banks and eases private monitoring of

banks, firms tend to face lower obstacles to raising external finance. We also find that greater

moral hazard – as measured by the generosity of the deposit insurance regime – tends to raise the

financing obstacles faced by firms. The results support the view that forcing accurate

information disclosure and not distorting the incentives of private agents tends to lower financial

obstacles. These findings are consistent with approaches that simultaneously recognize that

private agents face substantive information and enforcement costs when monitoring banks, while

also recognizing that politicians and regulators will act in their own interests and not necessarily

act to reduce market frictions.
                                                                                                       26

       Finally, at a very general level, these results emphasize the importance of both market

and political failures. Bank supervision clearly matters. Bank supervisory policies that seek to

ameliorate market failures by forcing the accurate disclosure of information reduce the obstacles

that firms face in raising external finance. This is not a laissez faire – invisible hand – finding.

This result suggests that active bank supervision can help ease information and enforcement

costs and enhance corporate finance. Just as clearly, however, the results highlight the

importance of theories that emphasize that politicians act in their own interests. Countries with

powerful bank supervisors tend to have firms that face (i) greater financing obstacles and (ii)

greater reliance on special connections and corruption in raising capital. Thus, mechanisms that

simultaneously recognize the importance of market and political failures – such as creating bank

supervisory agencies that focus on forcing accurate information disclosure by banks and easing

private monitoring of banks – tend to foster more efficient financial intermediation.

Based on the regressions of Table III, estimated probabilities of rating financing as a major obstacle to the operation and growth of the enterprises
(Financing Obstacle=4) are presented for the 25%, 50% and 75% percentiles (Panel A) and at the actual level for Chile and Canada (Panel B) of
the respective supervisory variable. Estimated probabilities are calculated for each enterprise setting all variables at its actual value, except for
the supervisory variables, which is set at either the 25%, 50% or 75% percentile of the sample (Panel A) or the values for Chile and Canada.

   Supervision and Financing Obstacles – Controlling for Legal and Regulatory Variables

The regression estimated is: General Financing Obstacle = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4 Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6
Sales +β7 No. of Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + β11X +β12 Supervision + ε. General Financing Obstacle is the response to the
question “How problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor
obstacle), 3 (moderate obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has
government or foreign ownership and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing
and Services are industry dummies. Sales is the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors
the firm has. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as share of GDP. Growth is the growth rate of GDP. Inflation is the log
difference of the consumer price index. Supervision is one of four supervisory variables. Supervisory Power indicates the power of the
supervisor vis-à-vis banks; Supervisory Independence the independence of the bank supervisor from government and banks. Private Monitoring
is the amount of information available to bank creditors and Moral Hazard indicates the generosity of the deposit insurance scheme. X is one of
five variables. Checks and Balances indicates the number of veto players in the political process; Banking Freedom indicates the absence of
government interference in banking; State-Owned Banks is the share of assets in banks that are majority-owned by the government in total
banking assets; Shareholder Rights is an indicator of minority shareholder rights vis-à-vis blockholders and management. Systemic Banking
Crisis is a dummy variable that takes on the value one if the country has suffered a systemic banking crisis during the 1990s. The regression is
run with ordered probit. Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix. P-values are reported in parentheses.

        Supervision and Financing Obstacles – Controlling for the Political Environment

The regression estimated is: General Financing Obstacle = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4 Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6
Sales +β7 No. of Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + β11X +β12 Supervision + ε. General Financing Obstacle is the response to the
question “How problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor
obstacle), 3 (moderate obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has
government or foreign ownership and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing
and Services are industry dummies. Sales is the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors
the firm has. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as share of GDP. Growth is the growth rate of GDP. Inflation is the log
difference of the consumer price index. Supervision is one of two supervisory variables. Supervisory Power indicates the power of the supervisor
vis-à-vis banks; Supervisory Independence the independence of the bank supervisor from government and banks. X is one of three variables.
Legislative Competition indicates the degree of competitiven4ess of legislative elections. State repression of media is an indicator of the degree
to which the government represses a country’s media. State ownership of media indicates the share of media owned by the government. The
regression is run with ordered probit. Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix. P-values are reported in parentheses.

                                 Independent Supervisors and Financing Obstacles
The regression estimated is: Financing Obstacle = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6 Sales +β7 No.
of Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + +β11 Supervision + ε. Financing Obstacle is either the General Financing Obstacle, Special
Connection or Bank Corruption. Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor obstacle), 3 (moderate obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle).
Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has government or foreign ownership and zero if not. Exporter is a
dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing and Services are industry dummies. Sales is the logarithm of sales
in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors the firm has. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money
banks as share of GDP. Growth is the growth rate of GDP. Inflation is the log difference of the consumer price index. Supervision is one of
three supervisory variables. Supervisory Power indicates the power of the supervisor vis-à-vis banks; Supervisory Independence from
Banks/Government the independence of the bank supervisor from government and banks, respectively. The regression is run with ordered probit.
Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix. P-values are reported in parentheses.
