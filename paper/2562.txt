      Evaluating the European View that the U.S. has No Unemploiient Problem


                                        ABSTRACT




      This study contrasts the labor market performance of the U.S. and OECD

 Europe in the l980s and critically evaluates the view that the U.S. has

 generated more jobs because its labor market is more 'flexible'. The study

 finds that the greater employment expansion in the U.S. was associated with

 slower growth of real wages and productivi ty than in most of OECD Europe

 rather than with relatively costless flexibility. It also finds that while

 some aspects of relative wage flexibility, for instance in youth versus adult

wages, helped limit U.S. unemployment, other aspects, for instance regional

wage, show no greater flexibility in the U.S. than in the U.K., where labor

markets are allegedly less flexible. Finally, the study argues that the

disparate experiences of the U.K. ,    with   a relatively decentralized labor

market, and Sweden, with a centralized wage-setting system, show that

decentralized labor markets are neither necessary nor sufficient for employment-

enhancing wage settlements.

       Evaluating the European View that the US has No Unemployment Problem

       'A session on unemployment in America? Ridicule! The U.S. has produced
 20 million jobs since 1975.   If only Europe had America's flexible labor market
 and 'unemployment' ." -- Archetypal European economist, circa 1987.

      Significant differences between the unemployment and employment

experiences of the US and OECD-Europe have made views like these popular

overseas and led many European observers to look longingly at the American

labor market as a paragon of decentralized wage and employment flexibility.

      Do the labor market performances of the US and OECD-Europe support this

view? How much of the difference between American and European employment and

unemployment can be attributee to differences in labor market 'flexibility'?

      In this paper I examine these questions. I review the labor market

outcomes that have led many Europeans to see the American economy as having no

'real' unemployment problem; evaluate the claim that greater labor market

flexibility underlies US-OECD Europe differences in outcomes; and consider the

costs that accompanied American employment expansion. My main claim is that

the US paid for its employment expansion with reduced growth of real wages and

productivity rather than with relatively costless flexibility. I find that

some aspects of flexibility in relative wage setting helped limit US

unemployment while others did not and argue that the disparate experiences of

the UK and Sweden show that a decentralized labor market is neither necessary

nor sufficient for employment-enhancing wage settlements.

Contrasts in Unemployment/Employment Experiences

     Three fundamental facts underlie the European view of American unemploy-

ment: first, the l980s reversal of the longstanding pattern of higher rates of

unemployment in the US than in OECD-Europe (fig. lA); second, the growth of

employment in the US, evinced In a rising employment/working age population

ratio compared to a declining ratio in OECD Europe and even more dramatically

in employment rates adjusted for the sizeable drop in annual hours per employee
                                           2



in Europe (fig. 1B); and, third, the relatively short duration of unemployment

spells in the US, where incomplete spells have averaged from 12 to 20 weeks

compared to several years in many OECD European countries (fig. 1C). While

spell lengths differ partly because many US spells end in labor force with-

drawal (Clark and Summers) adult male durations are so much longer in Europe

than in the US that this cannot explain the differences (OECD 1987, table R).

     Youth unemployment is also widely judged to be a greater problem in Europe

than in the U.S. ,   though differences in schooling and student work behavior
creates problems in comparisons. In some European countries, such as Italy,

Spain, France, and the UK (but not Germany) the ratio of youth to adult

unemployment rates exceeds that for the U.S. The duration of unemployment

among European youths also tend to be quite lortg, exceeding durations for the

young blacks who bear a disproportionate brunt of US unemployment. And OECD-

Europe had nothing like the US's 1970-1980 6 point increase in the employnient/

population ratio of 16-24 year olds when the influx of baby boomers into the

job market could have created massive youth joblessness.

     Less widely recognized, US and European patterns of unemployment also

differ along gender lines, with the rate of female unemployment relatively

lower in the US than in Europe (save for the U1( and Ireland). Because of the

differences in youth and female unemployment rates, adult male unemployment

rates in the US are closer to those in Europe than the average rates shown in

figure 1A, offsetting somewhat the presumptively greater cost of unemployment

in Europe due to the long durations (OECD 1987, table 2).

     Turning to growth of employment, there is a widespread belief that US

growth has been concentrated in low-wage Mcdonald's-type service jobs. Some

hail this as the desireable outcome of flexible wage-setting that permits wide

variation in pay among industries, Others view it as a sign of American

economic decline. In fact, there is nothing special about the growth of
                                             3



service sector employment in the US. From 1973 to 1984 OECD data (1986a) show

that the service share of employment rose by 9 percentage points in OECD-Europe

(45% to 54%) compared to an increase of 5 points in the US (63% to 68%).

Moreover, the shift to services has had only a modest impact on average wages,

in part because the service sector includes high-paying professional and

business services as well as burger joints. Perhaps most telling, employment

and wages have grown more in high level than low skill occupations, not what

one would expect if the skill structure was deteriorating.

     This said, it is the patterns of unemployment and employment shown in

Figure 1 that has altered European thinking about the American labor market:

"What at the start of the period was being dubbed as a poor labour productivity

performance in the United States was being hailed at the end as an impressive

job creating performance" (OECD,1986b,p.8). Whereas in the 1950s and l960s

analysts rejected textbook claims that decentralized labor market arrangements

work best on the basis of actual outcomes ("you say unfettered labor markets,

but our .   .. arbitration   tribunals (Australia); bargaining with legal extension

(France); shop-floor unionism (UK) ... produce unemployment far below that in

America") in the 1980s the word is flexibility, US style.

     So, the question is: to what extent is the US unemployment/employment

record the result of the flexibility of decentralized labor markets? The

answer turns on the ways in which wage-setting and employment determination is

in fact more flexible in the U.S. than in OECD-Europe and on the quantitative

contribution of those aspects of flexibility to employment. It requires

consideration of aggregate wage change and of wage adjustments and labor

mobility along disaggregate industry, occupation, region, etc. lines.

the contribution of macro-flexibility

     In terms of aggregate wages, recent studies in the Phillips curve

tradition suggest that wages in the US react less to price changes and more to
                                        4


unemployment than wages in many European countries, producing greater 'real

wage flexibility' (Bruno and Sachs, Coe). As I am uneasy about the robustness

of inferences from these time series regressions, I focus instead on the basic

fact that the US (and Sweden and some other countries) had smaller changes in

real wages in the l970s-early 1980s than most of OECD-Europe and ask: were

these modest wage changes (call them the 'flexible' response to the post-oil

shock economic world) associated with differences in employment growth across

countries? As table 1 shows, conditional on the growth of real GDP (which

increased more rapidly in the US than in OECD-Europe in total but not in per

capita terms), the answer is yes: in each period countries with large increases

in real wages (measured by mfg hourly earnings, employee compensation/employees

or mfg hourly compensation) had smaller growth in employment or total hours

than countries with small wage increases, with elasticities ranging from -O.

to â€¢O.i. As changes in output per worker and wages are highly correlated

across countries, moreover, there is a parallel inverse relation between

employment and productivity growth, with, for example, wages and productivity

growing slowly and employment rapidly in the US and Sweden and the converse

occuring in Belgium, Spain. and in the 1980s the UK, among others.

     If one takes country differences in changes in wages as exogenously

determined by labor market institutions (about which I have some doubts) and

assumes similar rates of exogenous productivity advance in the US and OECD-

Europe, the estimated wage-employment trade-off schedule suggests that much of

the US-OECD Europe difference in employment growth was 'paid for' by lower real

wage growth in the U.S. Between 1973 and 1979, for instance, the OECD (1986a)

estimates that compound annual rates of GDP growth differed only modestly

between the US and OECD-Europe (2.6% versus 2.4%) while the difference in

annual growth in manufacturing wages relative to the COP deflator was huge

(1.0% in US versus 4.7% in OECD-Europe), implying a dominant role for the wage-
                                          5



employment trade-off in the difference in employment growth. While from 1979

to 1984 differences in real wage growth lessened (-0.3% in US v 0.3% in OECD-

Europe) cr4   differences   in COP growth widened (2.0% in US v 1.1% in OECD-

Europe) the trade-off still remains important           in the employment story.

     Now for problems with this interpretation. First, differences in real

wage growth cannot be firmly tied to specific labor market structures. On the

one hand, as noted, Sweden and some other countries with quite different labor

market institutions than the US had similar slow real wage growth and sizeable

employment expansion, indicating at the minimum that decentralized US style

labor markets were not necessary for real wage moderation (Indeed, the

performance of Scandinavia and Austria has fueled claims that corporatist

economies perform best in this respect). On the other hand, the UK --     which

has the most decentralized and unregulated labor market in OECD-Europe -   - had
sizeable growth of real wages iii the l980s and experienced the employment

consequences thereof. Reinforcing this point, OECD countries with disparate

labor market institutions such as Belgium, Australia, and Italy reduced their

growth of real wages in the early l980s, some with noticeable employment

consequences, but others with no upswing in employment. Second, workers

bargain for money wages while real wages depend on prices as well as wages,

raising the possibility that country differences in price-setting also

contributed to observed differences in real wage patterns across countries. As

Solow has stressed in this context, the trade-off curve can be Interpreted as

reflecting the joint determination of wages and employment by exogenous

aggregate demand factors, suggesting the need to examine differences in those

factors across countries and their relation to the observed changes.

Regardless of how one interprets the evidence in table 1, however, the wage-

employment trade-off represents the key fact that any explanation of US and

OECD-Europe differences must   address.

the contribution of relative flexibility

     Turning to relative wages and employment (where labor economists feel more

comfortable as they can get 'in close' to behavior), the evidence suggests that

along some dimensions the US labor market has evinced flexibility of the kind

likely to be unemployment reducing, while along other dimensions, it has not.

     The strongest case for employment-enhancing flexible market responses is

found in the changing wage and employment of young workers. Between 1970 and

1983 when baby-boomers flooded the U.S. job market, the earnings of the young

men fell sharply: real median weekly earnings of workers 16-24 dropped by 25Z

between 1970 and 1985, with the result that the premium of men 25 and older to

the 16-24 year olds jumped from 43% to 90% (US Department of Labor). On the

demand side, the reduced cost of young workers induced employers to increase

the youth share of employment in virtually all industries, from manufacturing

to services. In several European countries, by contrast, the relative wages of

youths rose or remained steady through the l970s-early 1980s. Regressions of

youth unemployment rates on adult unemployment rates and the ratio of youth to

adult pay in a pooled time-series cross-section of OECD countries shows that

countries where relative pay for youths declined, such as the US, had less

youth unemployment than countries without such responses (Bloom and Freeman;

OECD 1986). While the drop in youth wages presumably affected overall

unemployment more modestly (due to substitution among workers of different

ages), it more likely than not dampened total unemployment as well.

     Relative wages by region tell a different story. Consider, for example,

the summary data on the relation between pay, changes in pay and unemployment

across geographic units in countries X and Y in table 2: in-f wages are higher

in high unemployment areas and increases in unemployment have no impact on area

wages; in< wages are uncorrelated with unemployment at a point in time and

declined in areas with relatively rising unemployment - -   seemingly   indicative
                                        7



of a more responsive labor market. Who are the mysterious economies?         is the

US, with states as areas. is the UK, with counties as areas. While the

different pattern of wages might be due to differences in labor market

conditions not reflected in unemployment rates, the data seem prima fade to

reject the notion that geographic wage adjustments are more responsive in

unemployment-reducing ways in the US than in the UK.

     It is not only along geographic dimensions, moreover, that the US does not

seem to have more flexibility in the labor market than other OECD countries.

While there are sizeable differences in wage differentials between the US and

some countries (e.g. dispersion of industry wages is much smaller in Sweden and

Denmark than in the US), analyses of changes in wages by industry in West

Germany (Bell) and the UK (Freeman,1987) show the same factors altering

relative wages in those countries with similar magnitudes as in the US. In

addition, in the 1980s pay differentials by skill and by age changed at least

as much in the UK as in the US (with no sizeable impact on unemployment).

     With respect to mobility, the U.S. labor market evinces enormous short run

changes in employment among establishments, with gross employment flows far

exceeding the net flows that determine whether aggregate employment expands or

contracts (Leonard). A recent OECD analysis (1987, chapter 4) estimates that

the annual rate of 'job turnover' (the sum of gross job gains and gross job

losses among establishment relative to employment) among Pennsylvania esta-

blishments averaged 25.8% from 1976 to 1985. If European labor markets were

less flexible (say because of hiring and firing laws), one would expect smaller

job turnover rates there. But the OECD reports job turnover rates of 23.3% in

France and 23.5% in Sweden. While Germany had a low job turnover rate (16.5%),

Japan had the lowest (7.7%) as well as the lowest unemployment --   fair   warning

to anyone who believes that high mobility is necessary for low unemployment.
Costs of Employment Expansion

     If the l970s and 1980s employment growth in the US resulted from

relatively costless flexible' labor market adjustments, the European

assessment of the experience "as an impressive job creating performance" would

be difficult to assail. But the evidence suggests, au contraire, that there

were substantial costs associated with the US expansion. First, the cross-

country analysis of the wage-employment tradeoff suggests that the U.S. paid

for job creation with slow growth in real wages and productivity. The

magnitude of the trade-off was such, moreover, that despite the fact that

employment/population rates and annual hours per employee increased in the US

relative to OECD-Europe, per capita COP grew at the same 1.3% rate. From this

perspective, Americans worked harder for the same gain in living standards as

Europeans. Second, if, as seems reasonable, some persons entered the labor

market in response to low earnings of heads of households (e.g. married women

with children under 1 year of age, whose 1987 participation exceeded 50%),

their employment reflects a worsening not an improvement in economic well-

being. Third, to the extent that the CDP-expansion generated part of

employment growth entailed the 'double deficits' that turned the nation into

the world's greatest debtor, future living standards will be lower, implying an

even higher cost to job creation. Finally, even with employment expansion, the

U.S. unemployment rate was markedly greater in the 1980s than in the 1970s,

which itself exceeded that in the 1960s, while, as noted, unemployment (and

wages) were more unequally distributed along some dimensions than in the past.

     In sum, the US paid more for its improved employment and unemployment

position relative to OECD-Europe than is recognized by those who peddle flex-

ible decentralized labor markets, US style, as the l980s Economic Cure-All.

There were pluses to the US experience but there were also costs that make the

change in overall economic well-being not so different than in OECD-Europe.
