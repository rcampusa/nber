                A Symmetric Two Country Analysis


                              ABSTRACT



    This paper analyzes the effects of anticipated and unanticipated

domestic monetary and fiscal expansions on both the domestic and

foreign economies. The analysis is based on symmetric behavior, which

is not only not an unreasonable first approximation, but also offers

significant analytical advantages. Specifically, it enables the

dynamics of the system to be decoupled into (a) averages and (b) dif-

ferences of relevant variables. Not only does this render the analy-

sis tractable, but it also helps provide economic insight. One

striking aspect is that the differences, but not the averages, respond

to announcements. The consequences of this for the dynamic adjust-

ments of the two economies to the various disturbances are discussed

at length.

1.   INTRODUCTION

          The last decade has witnessed an explosion of literature

analyzing exchange rate dynamics under rational expectations and effi-

cient markets. This work focuses almost exclusively on small open

economies, with virtually no attention being devoted to large two

country models.--" Presumably, the main reason for this neglect is

the technical difficulty of computing and analyzing rational expecta-

tions equilibria in these more complex models.

          In this paper we analyze the effects of monetary and fiscal

policies in a two country macro model of two symmetric economies. The

assumption of symmetry is not unreasonable as a first approximation,

since there is no a priori reason for say the United States and Europe

to differ in terms of their aggregate behavior in any systematic way.

Further, this assumption is being adopted extensively in the current

literature applying game theory to problems of international policy

coordination.-' It has the enormous advantage of allowing one to

exploit a method introduced by Aoki (1981). This procedure enables the

dynamics of the system to be decoupled into:   (a) averages and (b)

differences of the relevant variables. Not only does this render the

analysis tractable, but it also helps provide insight into the analysis.

          The main focus of our analysis will be on the impact of mone-

tary and fiscal expansions in one economy, say the domestic, on both

the domestic and foreign economies. The decomposition of the dynamics

into averages and differences makes it clear how the anticipations of

future policy changes, which operate through their impact on the current

exchange rate, affect the two economies in offsetting ways in the short
                                                       —2—


run. Thus, for example, we shall demonstrate how the anticipation of

a future domestic monetary expansion will, in the short run, generate

increased output and inflation domestically, while causing a recession

and deflation abroad. The anticipation of a fiscal expansion has the

opposite effects in the two economies during the initial phase of the

adjustment.

          The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes

the model. The steady state and the solution to the dynamics are dis-

cussed in the following two sections. The effects of both unanticipated

and anticipated domestic monetary expansions are analyzed in Section 5

while Section 6 deals with fiscal expansion. The conclusions are con-

tained in Section 7. The formal details of the solution are contained

in the appendix.


2. A TWO COUNTRY MACROECONOMIC MODEL

          We consider the following two country macroeconomic model

which is a direct extension of the standard Dornbusch (1976) framework;

see, e.g., Gray and Turnovsky (1979). It describes two economies each

specializing in the production of a distinct good and trading a single

common bond.

Domestic variables are unstarred; foreign variables are denoted with

an asterisk.

             Equations (1), (1') describe goods market equilibrium in the

two economies. Private demand depends upon the real interest rate,

output in the other country, and relative price.-" The corresponding

effects across the two economies are identical, with the relative price

influencing demand in exactly offsetting ways. The money market

equilibrium in the economies are standard and are described by (2) and

(2').-' The perfect substitutability of the domestic and foreign bonds

is described by the interest parity condition (3). Equations (4) and

(4') describe the CPI at home and abroad. The assumption is made that

the proportion of consumption 5 spent on the respective home good is
                                                              1
the same in the two economies. We assume 5 >                  -i-, so   residents in both

countries have a preference for their own good. Finally, equations

(5) and (5') define the price adjustment in the two economies in terms

of simple Phillips curves.

              The complete world system described by equations (l)—(5) con-

sists of a third order dynamic system in the prices of the two outputs,

}',   p*,   and the exchange rate E. We assume that the prices P. *                 adjust
continuously everywhere, while the exchange rate is free to jump in

response to new information. The analysis can be simplified by def in—

ing the averages and differences for any variable X say

            Equations (6a)—(6c) describe the aggregate world economy. The

aggregate IS and LM curves (6a) and (6b) determine the average output

level and average nominal interest rate in terms of the average price

level, the evolution of which is described by the Phillips curve (6c).

We assume

so that the IS curve in a 1a space is downward sloping. Equations (7)

describe the differences in the two economies, together with the exchange

rate. it is shown below that the dynamics of d and E is a saddlepoint.


3. STEADY STATE

            Since the analysis is based on perfect foresight, the dynamics,

which is our prime concern, is determined in part by the steady state.

It is therefore convenient to begin with a characterization of this

equilibrium. Denoting the steady state by bars, it is attained when

p   p* =   E =   0, so that Y = 0, I = 1*.                     Thus the equilibrium in the goods

and money markets of the two economies is

          It is seen that in the long run, an increase in government

expenditure at home or abroad will raise the equilibrium interest rate

equally. An increase in domestic government expenditure will raise

the relative price of domestic goods, while an increase in foreign

government expenditure will have the reverse effect. The increase in

the world interest rate lowers the demand for money in both countries.

The rise in the relative price of domestic goods increases the real

stock of domestic money. Given that the nominal stock remains fixed,
                                          —7—


the price of domestic output, P, must increase in order to reduce the

real supply of money and maintain money market equilibrium. On the

other hand, the rise in the relative price of foreign goods causes

the real stock of foreign money to decrease. This requires the

foreign price level to increase less than the domestic and indeed,

In extreme cases it may even fall. The effects of an increase in

foreign government expenditure on the two price levels are symmetric.

The nominal exchange rate depends upon the differential government

expenditure in the two economies. With 6 >          -, the   increase in domestic

government expenditure causes a nominal appreciation of the domestic

currency, while the opposite applies with respect to an increase in 0*.

           An increase in the domestic money supply increases the domestic

price level proportionately, causing the domestic nominal exchange rate

to depreciate proportionately. The foreign price level, as well as the

real exchange rate and world interest rate remain unchanged. The

effects of an increase in the foreign money supply are analogous.


4. SOLUTIONS TO DYNAMICS

           The solution to the dynamic adjustment of the economy is

obtained in two parts, first for the average variables, then for the

differences. These solutions are then transformed to the original

variables. We assume that at time 0 the world economy is in steady

                                  E =
state with P =
                 P,   P' =
                             P,         E1.
                                              At time 0 a policy change is

anticipated to take effect at time T. The new steady state correspond-

ing to the disturbed system is P = P2 = P1 + dP, P =            P=P     + dP*,

E =    =    + dE.

                    By substitution, equations (6a)—(6c) describing the behavior

of the average world economy can be expressed by the following equation

in the average price level,

our subsequent discussion of the transition of policy changes. After

the disturbance, the world economy converges monotonically to its new

where the changes in the steady state equilibrium are dependent upon

the specific disturbance. Equation (17a) is obtained from the initial

condition on the price level, and the assumption that P1 and P2 move

continuously everywhere. The latter two equations are obtained by

assuming that prices and the exchange rate move continuously at time

T. By contrast, we allow the exchange rate to undergo an initial jump

at the announcement date t =            0,   in response to the new information

impinging on the economy at that time. It is this jump that brings

about the eventual stability of the system. After the change occurs

at time T, the     and E converge monotonically to their new equilibrium

values at a rate A2.

                   It is seen from the solutions (15b), (16b) that the nature

of the time path of the nominal exchange rate, and in particular,

whether at any stage it overshoots or undershoots its equilibrium

response to an anticipated monetary disturbance depends upon the sign

of h12. If output is fixed, h12 >                    0,       but with output endogenous, in

general h12           0. For the sake of being concrete, we shall base our

exposition on the assumption


                                                h12 > 0


Loosely speaking, this condition will be met if the income effect in

the demand for money is sufficiently small.-' We shall also assume


                                                h21 > 0


A sufficient condition for this to be met is d3 >                              d2/8c2, which for
plausible parameter values will surely be met.-7-" The economic explana-

tion of the results will require minor modification if either of these

inequalities is reversed, as in principle they may be.

5. DOMESTIC MONETARY EXPANSION

            Consider a unit increase in the domesticmoney supply, with

the foreign money supply held constant; that is, dM =          1,   dN* =   0.     It

follows from (10) that dP = dE = 1, dP* = 0.


A. Unanticipated Monetary Expansion

            The formal solution to the model in the case of an unanticipated

monetary disturbance is given in equation (A.l) of the appendix and is

illustrated in Figure 1, on the assumption h12 > 0.            In this case, the

exchange rate overshoots on impact its long—run response, thereafter

appreciating towards its new steady state level. The price of domestic

output gradually increases, while domestic output initially increases,

thereafter falling monotonically towards its natural rate level. The

monetary expansion causes an immediate fall in the domestic interest

rate, which thereafter rises monotonically towards its equilibrium. All

of these effects are familiar from the Dornbusch model or its immediate

variants.
                                 —13—


          The effects of the domestic monetary expansion on the foreign

economy are less clear cut. The rate of inflation of foreign goods,

    and the level of output abroad will rise or fall on impact, depend-

ing upon whether A2 A. The monetary expansion in the domestic

economy increases both the average world output, a and the difference,

     While this obviously implies a rise in the domestic level of out-

put, foreign output will rise if and only if the increase in average

output exceeds half the increase in the difference.

          More intuitively, the appreciation of the foreign currency

vis—a--vis the domestic, following the domestic monetary expansion,

leads to an increase in the relative price of foreign goods, leading

to a fall in demand, and hence in output and in inflation abroad. On

the other hand, the fact that the foreign currency immediately begins

to depreciate following its initial (discrete) appreciation, increases

the rate of inflation abroad, thereby reducing the foreign real rate

of interest. This leads to a positive effect on foreign demand, out-

put, and inflation. In addition, the increase in domestic output leads

to an increase in imports by the domestic economy and this too leads to

an increase in output and inflation abroad. The net effect on output

and inflation abroad depends upon which of these two opposing effects

dominates. However, if the foreign level of output does initially rise,

it will immediately begin to fall, an vice versa. This is because

if foreign output does increase initially, the accompanying rise in

the foreign inflation rate will begin to raise the foreign price level.

Thus the level of the real foreign money supply will begin to fall,

thereby inducing a contraction in foreign output. Indeed, as long as
                                     —14—


foreign output is above its equilibrium level and the foreign price

level continues to rise, the contractionary force on foreign output

will continue. It can be shown from (A.le) that *      will   always fall

below its original level during the transition, giving rise to the

overshooting pattern shown in Figure l.C.' The time path is reversed

in the case of an initial fall in foreign output. With h12 > 0 and

the domestic currency appreciating following the initial monetary

expansion, it follows that the fall in the domestic nominal interest

rate exceeds that of the foreign rate, which in fact may either rise

or fall. On the one hand, the initial appreciation of the foreign

currency causes the foreign real stock of money to rise, leading to

a fall in the foreign interest rate. On the other hand, the rise or

fall in the foreign level of income may generate an increase or decrease

in the demand for money abroad, thereby rendering the overall effect on

the foreign interest rate indeterminate.-" Both alternative time

paths for *,   *, and   1* are illustrated.'


B. Announced Monetary Expansion

          Consider now the behavior of the economy in response to a

monetary expansion which the authorities announce at time 0 to take

place at some future time T >   0.   The formal solution is given in (A.3),

(A.3'), while the time paths for the relevant domestic and foreign

variables are illustrated in Figure 2.

          At the time of announcement, t = 0, the domestic currency

immediately depreciates in anticipation of the    future   monetary expan-

sion. Whether the initial jump involves overshooting of the exchange

rate, depends upon the lead time T. Following the announcement, the
                                 —15—

domestic currency continues to depreciate until time T, when it reaches

a point above the new long—run equilibrium. Thereafter, it appreciates

steadily until the new steady state equilibrium is reached   This behavior

is identical to that in the Gray—Turnovsky (1979) model.

          The anticipation of the future monetary expansion causes the

domestic price level to begin rising at time 0. The inflation rate

increases during the period 0 to T, when the monetary expansion occurs.

This expansion causes a further increase in the inflation rate, which

thereafter begins to slow down as the new equilibrium price level is

approached. The behavior of the inflation rate is mirrored in the

level of output. The positive inflation rate generated by the announce-

ment is accompanied by an immediate increase in output, which increases

continuously until the monetary expansion occurs at time T. At that

time a further discrete increase in output occurs. Thereafter, as the

domestic currency appreciates, the relative price of domestic goods

rises and demand and domestic output gradually decline to its equilibrium

level.

         The initial depreciation of the domestic currency causes an

immediate jump in the domestic CPI, which with the domestic nominal

money supply fixed (prior to time T), creates an initial fall in the

real money supply. At the same time, the initial increase in domestic

real output, stimulated by the depreciation of the domestic currency

as a result of the announcement, increases the demand for real money

balances. In order for domestic money market equilibrium to be main-

tained, the domestic nominal interest rate must rise. As the price of

domestic output increases during the period prior to the monetary

expansion, the real domestic money supply contracts further, while the
                                 —16—


increasing real income causes the real money demand to continue rising.

In order for money market equilibrium to be maintained, the domestic

nominal interest must therefore continue to rise. At time T, when the

anticipated monetary expansion takes place, the domestic interest rate

drops, falling to level below its long run equilibrium. Thereafter, it

rises steadily back towards its (unchanged) long run equilibrium.

         As we have seen, the average world economy remains unchanged

by the ant1c1paton of the impending monetary expansion until the moment

it is actually implemented. Thus during the period 0 z.   <   T, the
averages of the domestic and foreign variables all remain fixed at

their initial equilibria. Since all adjustments during this phase

stem entirely from the initial announcement and the jump in the

exchange rate this generates, it follows that given the symmetry of

the two economies, the adjustment in theforeign economy is an exact

mirror image of that in the domestic economy.

          Thus during the period prior to the monetary expansion, the

rising price of domestic output is matched by a falling price of

foreign output, which arises from the appreciating foreign currency.

At time T, following the domestic monetary expansion, the domestic

currency begins to appreciate, as we have noted. This depreciation

of the foreign currency puts upward pressure on the price of foreign

output. The downward trend is therefore gradually reversed and eventually

the price of foreign output increases back up to its original equilibrium

level.

          Similarly, the behavior of foreign output mirrors that of

domestic output during the initial phases. The initial appreciation

of the foreign currency at the announcement date causes an immediate
                                  —17—

 fall in foreign output, which continues to fall further in response

 to the continuing appreciation of the foreign currency. The increase

 in the foreign inflation rate occurring at time T causes the real

interest rate abroad to decline, thereby stimulating foreign demand

and foreign output at that time. During the subsequent transition,

the depreciating foreign currency stimulates foreign output sufficiently

to cause it to rise above its national rate level, after which it
                        11 /
declines   mono

           The appreciation of the foreign currency at the time of

announcement causes the real money supply abroad to increase, while

the fall in foreign output leads to a decline in the foreign demand

for money. These two effects together ensure an immediate reduction

in the foreign interest rate. This continues to be so with the

appreciating foreign currency, the declining foreign output, and its

price level during this initial phase. At time T, when the domestic

monetary expansion occurs, the foreign interest rate increases to a

level above the domestic rate, but below its long—run equilibrium.

Thereafter, 1* increases steadily towards its equilibrium. The reason

is that the increase in foreign output at time T, stimulated by the

domestic monetary expansion, increases the demand for money balances

abroad. Since the foreign nominal money balances remain fixed and

prices and the exchange rate move continuously at time T, the real

stock of foreign money balances remains fixed at time T. Thus in

order for foreign money market equilibrium to hold, the foreign nominal

interest rate must rise in order to offset the increased money demand

resulting from the higher level of income. With the continuous appre-

ciation of the domestic currency following the monetary expansion, the
                                     —18—


fact that 1* must lie above I during the subsequent transition back

to equilibrium is an immediate consequence of the interest rate parity

condition.

             Finally, we may note that it is possible to analyze the effects

of the monetary disturbance upon other variables such as the real exchange

rate E + P — P, the domestic and foreign CPI, C, C, as well as the

domestic and foreign real exchange rates, I — C, 1* —        C*.   Their

responses as essentially composites of those we have been discussing.

             Taking an overview of Figure 2, it is seen that the antici-

pation of a future domestic monetary expansion has markedly different

effects on the two economies, particularly during the initial phases.

Domestically, it generates an increase in output, together with rising

prices, although the boom is reversed after the expansion occurs. Abroad,

it initially generates a recession with falling prices, although this

too is reversed after the expansion.


6. DOMESTIC FISCAL EXPMSION

          We turn now to a consideration of a unit increase in domestic

government expenditure, i.e., dG = 1.          The corresponding changes in the

equilibrium exchange rate and price levels are


                               dE = l—2ó < o
                                      2d3




                             dP* =         —   (l—5)
                                     2d2        2d3

where we shall assume dP* > 0.
                                 —19—


A. Unanticipated Fiscal Expansio.n

          The solutions for the relevant variables are given in (A.4),

with the time paths being illustrated in Figure 3.

          The increase in demand resulting from the increase in govern-

ment expenditure leads to an increase in the relative price of the

domestic good. With the prices of domestic and foreign goods fixed

instantaneously, this is brought about by an appreciation of the domestic

currency- At the same time, the fiscal expansion leads to an increase

in domestic output, thereby causing the rate of inflation of domestic

output to increase. With the domestic nominal money supply fixed, the

initial appreciation of the domestic currency causes the real domestic

money supply to increase, while the expansion in output stimulates the

demand for real money balances. The response of the domestic interest

rate depends upon which of these two effects dominates. We have

illustrated the more usual one, where the latter is dominant, in which

case the domestic interest rate rises.

          The initial appreciation of the domestic currency is only a

partial one. Thereafter, it continues to appreciate gradually towards

its new equilibrium level. As a result of this, the fall in the relative

price of foreign goods continues, causing the demand for domestic goods

to decline. This in turn moderates the rate of inflation of domestic

goods. The combination of the appreciating domestic currency and the

rising real money supply together with the falling output causes the

domestic interest rate to continue rising.

          The impact of the domestic fiscal expansion on the foreign

economy is slightly less clear cut, although the effects are probably

as indicated.--' The initial depreciation of the foreign currency
                                 —20—

stimulates the demand for the foreign good and its output. At the same

time the upward pressure on interest rates (without the accompanying

increase in government expenditure abroad) has a contractionary effect

abroad. We assume that on balance the expansionary effect dominates

and foreign output rises, although by a lesser amount than does the

domestic. As a consequence, the inflation rate abroad rises, although

again less than in the domestic economy. The combination of the depreciat-

ing foreign currency and increase in foreign output drives the foreign

interest rate up.

          The continued depreciation of the foreign currency following

its initial depreciation causes real money balances abroad to continue

declining. This is contractionary, so that output begins to fall

steadily. While the depreciating foreign currency puts upward pressure

on the foreign price level, these contractionary effects cause the foreign

inflation rate to decline, with the price of foreign output ultimately

levelling off at its new equilibrium level, which as we have noted is

below that in the domestic economy. Finally, the rising domestic

interest rate and the depreciating foreign currency means that the foreign

interest rate must keep rising, remaining above the domestic rate during

the transition.


B. Announced Fiscal Expansion

          The solution for an announced fiscal expansion is given in

(A.5), with the time paths being illustrated in Figure 4.

          The anticipation of the future fiscal expansion and the long—

run appreciation of the domestic currency leads to an immediate partial

appreciation. With sluggish output prices, this leads to an immediate

increase in the relative price of the domestic good, causing the demand
                                 —21—

for domestic output, and hence domestic output itself to decline. This

fall in activity causes the price of domestic output to begin falling.

The appreciation of the domestic currency, given the fixed nominal money

supply, raises the domestic real money supply, while the fall in output

leads to a decline in real money demand. For domestic money market

equilibrium to prevail, the domestic nominal interest rate must fall.

          The domestic currency continues to appreciate following the

announcement. This further reduces demand for the domestic good, thereby

continuing to reduce domestic output and the domestic rate of inflation.

The combination of the continuously appreciating exchange rate, fall-

ing domestic price level, together with falling real output, generates

a continuously downward pressure on thedomestic nominal interest rate.

          This pattern continues until time T, when the anticipated

fiscal expansion occurs. This expansion stimulates domestic output

to a level above its long—run equilibrium. The deflation is reversed

and the price of domestic output begins to start rising. This in turn

means that the real stock of domestic money starts to fall, thereby

providing an offsetting contractionary effect to output, which then

gradually falls to its equilibrium level. As this occurs, the infla-

tion rate is moderated and the price of domestic output gradually

approaches its new, higher, equilibrium level. The expansion in out-

put at time T, generated by the additional government expenditure

also increases the demand for money. With real money balances fixed

at that point, this causes the domestic interest rate to undergo a

discrete jump at time T after which it continues to rise towards its

new equilibrium level. The fiscal expansion at time T impacts most

directly on domestic output. As a consequence, the domestic demand
                                   —22—

for money rises relative to the foreign demand. Given that the respec-

tive real money stocks in the two economies are given at time T (since

they adjust continuously at that time), this means that the domestic

interest rate must rise more than the foreign, so that the real rate

of appreciation of the domestic currency is reduced at time T. There-

after, the domestic currency continues appreciating, gradually

approaching its new equilibrium level.

          We turn now to the foreign economy. As in the case of an

anticipated monetary expansion, the aggregate world economy remains

stationary until time T, when the fiscal expansion actually takes

place. Since the appreciation of the domestic currency during the

initial phase 0 <   t<T   is ipso facto a depreciation of the foreign

currency, during this period the foreign economy behaves as an exact

mirror image of the domestic. Again this is an immediate consequence

of the symmetry being assumed.

          Thus during the period following the announcement, but prior

to the fiscal expansion, the initial fall in domestic output, together

with the subsequent continuous fall, is matched by an equivalent initial

increase and continued rise abroad, stemming from the depreciation of

the foreign currency. The rising foreign output causes the price of

foreign output to begin rising at an increasing rate. The initial

depreciation of the foreign currency, together with the increase in

foreign output forces an immediate increase in the foreign interest

rate, which continues to rise during the initial phase.

          At the time of the fiscal expansion, the increase in domestic

activity thus stimulated, generates some spillover effects onto demand and

output in the foreign economy. Output abroad therefore undergoes a modest
                                       —23—



increase   at time T. increasing the foreign rate of inflation at that

time. With the foreign money supply fixed throughout, the increase in

the real demand for money abroad resulting from the increase in output

causes    the foreign interest rate to rise at that point. The rising
foreign price level causes the relative price of foreign goods to
increase, causing foreign output to fall, thereby moderating the
inflation. The fiscal expansion in the domestic economy drives up
the long—run world rate of interest and the foreign rate continues
to converge to this new equilibrium level.

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS

             In this paper we have analyzed the effects of anticipated and
unanticipated domestic monetary and fiscal expansions on both the domestic
and foreign economies. The analysis is based on symmetric       behavior,

enabling it    to be carried    out in terms of sums and differences

of   the two economies. The properties of the dynamic     time paths follow-

ing these disturbances have been discussed in the text and the details

need   not be repeated here. However, one striking aspect which is worth
highlighting      is that the domestic and foreign economies are affected in
precisely offsetting ways during      the initial phase of the adjustment,

following    the announcement   of the future policy change. This behavior

is   a direct consequence   of symmetry underlying the analysis.

            The   analysis has considered the effects stemming from uni-
lateral    policy actions by the domestic government on the level of economic

performance at home and abroad. By symmetry, analogous policy changes

abroad will have similar effects on the domestic economy. It is easy to

establish that if both governments undertake parallel expansions
                                 —24—


simultaneously, of either monetary or fiscal type, so either dM = dM*

or dG = dG*, that the exchange rate will remain fixed.-" As a

consequence, neither economy responds to the announcement of a future

policy change of this type. Instead, the adjustment begins only when

the policy change is actually implemented.

          Finally, we may note that the framework we have adopted in

this paper is well suited to considering questions of strategic behavior

by domestic and foreign governments with respect to monetary and fiscal

policy. We plan to pursue this topical issue in subsequent work.

in the case of the specific disturbances analyzed in the text.


A. Unanticipated Monetary Expansion

            The arbitrary constants in the solution for the case of an

unanticipated monetary expansion are obtained by setting T = 0,

dE = dP =   1, dP = 0 in (17a)—(17c). The relevant constant is A =         —1.

Substituting into (19), the solutions for P, P*, B, are given by

(for t   > 0).

-'See, e.g., the comprehensive survey of exchange rate dynamics by

  Obstfeld and Stockman (1984). Several of the early Mundell—Fleming

  type models do of course analyze monetary and fiscal policy for two

  countries, but in a static context. In addition, some of the more

  recent work on transmission mechanisms uses two country models,

  although these too are typically static, or perhaps assume some

  kind of backward—looking dynamics, see, e.g., Hamada and Sakurai

  (1978), Corden and Turnovsky (1983).

        assume that a unit increase in foreign output has a less than

  equivalent increase on the demand for the domestic good, i.e.,

        <   1.

'Like most of the literature, we assume that the residents of each

  country do not hold the money of the other country. We may also

  note that the analysis remains unchanged if the money demand func-

  tions are modified to

"The numerator of the expression of h21 is


                         4yd22 — 6yd2 + 21(d2 + d3c2)


    This will be positive everywhere in the range 0 <       < 1 and hence

    h21 > 0 if and only if

    With both A1 < 0, A2 < 0, this quantity is necessarily positive.


       the case that h12 <    0,   the exchange rate does not overshoot, so

    that E >   0, throughout the adjustment. The interest parity condi—
    tion then implies I >    1*.


        time path for 1* may or may not overshoot its long run

    adjustment, during the transition. We have drawn monotonic

    adjustment paths.


-"This occurs at the point where the foreign price level begins to

    rise. If the spillover of the domestic monetary expansion is

    sufficiently great to cause the foreign price level to begin ris—

    ing immediately at time T, then Y* will be driven above its equilibrium

    level at that time.

         =   1,   as in the Dornbusch model, then the exchange rate completes

    its adjustment instantaneously in response to an unanticipated fiscal

    expansion.

—     In   either of these cases it       follows   from (lOc)—(lOe) that the long—

    run exchange rate remains fixed, while the price of domestic and

    foreign goods increase proportionately. It then follows from (17a)—

                             =       =
     (l7c) that A2 =
                        A3       A       0, so that the exchange rate remains fixed
    at all times. Since anticipations of future policy changes impinge

    on the current system through the exchange rate, it follows that

    these are non—operative in the case of such balanced policy changes.
