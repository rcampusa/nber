                                           ABSTRACT

Exploiting random assignment of Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care plans, we identify plan-
specific effects on healthcare utilization. Auto-assignment to the lowest-spending plan generates
30% lower spending than if the same enrollee were assigned to the highest-spending plan, despite
identical cost-sharing. Effects via quantities, rather than differences in negotiated prices, explain
these patterns. Rather than reducing “wasteful” spending, low-spending plans cause broad
reductions in the use of medical services—including low-cost, high-value care—and worsen
beneficiary satisfaction and health. Supply side tools circumvent the classic trade-off between
financial risk protection and moral hazard, but give rise instead to a cost/quality trade-off.

1   Introduction

Regulated competition between private health plans is becoming the dominant form of social health

insurance in the United States (Gruber, 2017). In 2017, 54 million Medicaid beneficiaries (69%) and

19 million Medicare beneficiaries (33%) were enrolled in a private managed care plan (Kaiser Family

Foundation, 2017, 2019). In the same year, almost $500 billion of the $1.3 trillion spent on public

health insurance programs went to private managed care plans.

    An important feature of publicly-subsidized health insurance markets is that beneficiaries typ-

ically have a choice among competing private plans. The availability of consumer choice makes it

difficult to establish important facts about the plans with which governments are contracting. For

example, do plans with observably lower levels of spending (or higher quality) relative to their com-

petitors in the same markets causally reduce spending (or increase quality)? Or are performance

differences due to the fact that plans attract different mixes of enrollees? This selection bias hampers

efforts to understand what role plans can play in constraining healthcare spending growth and to

characterize the trade-offs that accompany the cost-saving approaches of plans. The identification

challenge echoes that in other contexts inside and outside of healthcare—e.g., estimating physician

effects (Doyle, Ewer and Wagner, 2010); hospital effects (Doyle et al., 2015; Hull, 2020); place effects

(Finkelstein, Gentzkow and Williams, 2016, 2019); teacher effects (Chetty, Friedman and Rockoff,

2014a,b); school effects (Aizer, Currie and Moretti, 2007); and neighborhood effects (Chetty, Hendren

and Katz, 2016; Chetty and Hendren, 2018a,b).

    Understanding the extent to which competing plans can impact healthcare spending, consumer

satisfaction, and enrollee health is of first-order importance in the management of these publicly-

subsidized private markets. In some cases, observational measures of plan spending per beneficiary

lead to statutory transfers to or from plans (e.g., penalties tied to Minimum Loss Ratio requirements

or subsidies provided via risk-sharing arrangements). In others, observed plan quality is publicly-

reported to consumers, factored into plan incentive payments (e.g., plan benchmark payments linked

to star ratings in Medicare Advantage), or incorporated into policies that encourage enrollment in

“higher quality” plans (e.g., default assignment policies in Medicaid). And yet, the prior literature

has not established the extent to which plans—rather than the enrollees they attract—can, in fact,

influence these metrics.

    In this paper, we identify the causal effects of the health plan in which a beneficiary enrolls on


                                                   1
her healthcare utilization, the quality of care received, and proxies for satisfaction and health. The

context of our analysis is Medicaid Managed Care (MMC), the privatized system through which most

Medicaid beneficiaries receive benefits today. In particular, we study the second-largest MMC market

in the United States, New York City (NYC), where ten plans competed for enrollees during our study

period. Like many state Medicaid programs, beneficiaries in New York who do not actively choose a

plan within the designated choice period are randomly assigned to one. Using administrative data that

cover nearly 70,000 randomly-assigned enrollees, we estimate causal plan differences in healthcare

spending and outcomes for the ten plans operating in NYC.

    In our setting, all plans are required to provide care at zero marginal cost to beneficiaries. It is

therefore an ideal context for studying whether various non-cost-sharing plan features (e.g., networks,

negotiated provider rates, patient follow-up and medication adherence programs, etc.) can constrain

healthcare spending. In contrast, nearly all of the prior econometric literature studying how health

plans affect utilization and health outcomes has focused on consumer cost-sharing provisions like

copays, coinsurance, and deductibles. But a modern health plan is more than a set of consumer-facing

prices, and our analysis sheds new light on the range of impacts generated by supply-side (non-cost-

sharing) plan features. To facilitate a transparent comparison between our results and results from

cost-sharing studies including the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Manning et al., 1987) and

more recent quasi-experimental work (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017), we focus our analysis on the types

of outcomes that have been the focus of this prior literature. These include overall service utilization

and spending, utilization of high- and low-value care, conventional measures of healthcare quality,

and surrogate health outcomes like avoidable hospitalizations.

    As our first main result, we document statistically and economically significant causal variation

in spending across plans. If an individual enrolls in the lowest-spending plan in the market she will

generate about 30% less in healthcare spending than if the same individual enrolled in the highest-

spending plan in the market. We show that risk-adjusted observational measures and causal esti-

mates of plan spending effects are correlated, but find that the risk-adjusted measures tend to over-

state causal differences in spending across plans. Plans that attract healthier patients thus do more to

constrain spending—i.e., provide less care—consistent with a classic adverse selection model, where

sicker individuals select plans providing more care. This fact has important implications for the use

of observational measures of spending and quality as a basis for regulatory rewards or penalties.



                                                   2
    After establishing important differences between risk-adjusted (OLS) plan spending effects and

causal (IV) estimates, we investigate which factors drive the bottom-line causal differences. First, we

find that almost all services are marginal. That is, lower spending plans tend to provide less of nearly

everything. This includes inpatient and outpatient visits, primary care physician office visits, and

high-value/cost effective drugs. Second, unlike in other markets (Cutler, McClellan and Newhouse,

2000; Gruber and McKnight, 2016; Cooper et al., 2019), differences in provider prices do not explain

the differences in healthcare spending across plans in our setting. In a decomposition, prices account

for very little of the cross-plan spending differences.

    Instead, spending differs because enrollees in low-spending plans use less care, with much of the

utilization gap driven by the extensive margin. Importantly (and similar to the effects of deductibles

in Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017), utilization reductions do not seem to focus on “low-value” care or

“waste”: We estimate that low-spending plans reduce utilization of high-value drugs used to treat

diabetes, asthma, and severe mental illnesses, as well as high-value screenings for diabetes, cancer,

and sexually transmitted infections.

    Finally, we show that the low-spending plans also increase avoidable hospitalizations and de-

crease consumer satisfaction, as measured by the propensity of auto-assigned enrollees to switch out

of their plan post-assignment. These results suggest a clear trade-off between spending and benefi-

ciary satisfaction and health.

    This paper contributes to a nascent literature attempting to estimate health plan effects in settings

where health plans differ in more than cost-sharing parameters. This complements contemporaneous

research on Medicare Advantage by Abaluck et al. (2020), Medicaid Managed Care in South Carolina

by Garthwaite and Notowidigdo (2019), and health plans serving the non-elderly, non-Medicaid pop-

ulation by Handel et al. (2018). Our work also contributes to the literature on optimal insurance

design in the presence of moral hazard. We provide new evidence on how an under-studied set

of health plan features (those not related to cost-sharing) constrain spending, adding to a smaller

recent literature concerned with these features (see, e.g., Curto et al. (2017); Layton et al. (2019); Wal-

lace (2019)). Consistent with Garthwaite and Notowidigdo (2019), we show that there is substantial

causal heterogeneity across plans in spending and utilization that arises without any differences in

consumer cost-sharing exposure.

    Our findings complement a large literature extending back to the RAND health insurance exper-



                                                    3
iment (Manning et al., 1987) that documents how consumer prices impact healthcare utilization. In

RAND, and the studies that have followed, patient cost-sharing has proven to be a blunt instrument,

affecting the use of low- and high-value services alike (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017). These findings

sparked interest in whether managed care tools offer a scalpel that can target inefficient spending

and better manage the high-cost patients responsible for the majority of spending. But our results,

along with prior work studying managed care in Medicare (Curto et al., 2017), indicate that supply-

side tools exhibit many of the same features and limitations as demand-side tools. Their impacts

on healthcare spending are blunt. They indiscriminately reduce utilization, limiting both high- and

low-value care rather than targeting “waste.” In another similarity to the effects of consumer cost-

sharing (as found in Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017), lower-spending managed care plans in our setting

do not appear to generate savings by steering patients to lower-cost providers or lowering negotiated

prices.

      Lastly, our work highlights how supply side tools can achieve spending reductions while circum-

venting the classic trade-off between financial risk protection and moral hazard noted by Zeckhauser

(1970) and Pauly (1974). The spread of plan effects we estimate are similar to the utilization differ-

ence between the 0% and 95% coinsurance rate treatment arms in the RAND HIE. Thus, significantly

constraining healthcare spending need not require exposing consumers to out of pocket spending.

But there is no “free lunch” here, as we also document that these spending reductions come at the

cost of beneficiary satisfaction and, ultimately, health.



2     Data and Setting

2.1     Medicaid Managed Care in New York

New York State is similar to the broader US in its reliance on private managed care organizations

(MCOs) to deliver Medicaid benefits to the majority of its Medicaid beneficiaries.1 New York is typ-

ical in that Medicaid beneficiaries may choose plans from a range of carriers that include national

for-profits, local for-profits, and local non-profits, though we are not permitted to identify specific

plans in our analysis. We focus on New York City, which is comprised of five counties where en-

rollment in managed care is mandatory, and which contains about two-thirds of the state’s Medicaid
    1 See   Appendix A for additional detail.

population. Restricting attention to a single large city allows us to identify differences across man-

aged care plans operating in the same healthcare market.


2.2    Auto-assignment to Plans

For our study period (2008-2012), beneficiaries in New York City had 30, 60, or 90 days to actively

choose an MCO. In excess of 90 percent of beneficiaries did so. Our study design focuses on the

beneficiaries who did not choose within the required timeframe and were automatically assigned to

a plan, a policy known as “auto-assignment.” These auto-assigned enrollees were randomly allocated

across eligible plans with equal probability. We observe the assignment and use it as an instrument

for enrollment in a given plan, as we discuss below in Section 3.

      After notification of auto-assignment, each beneficiary had three months to switch plans with-

out cause before a nine-month lock-in period began. This is the primary explanation for imperfect

compliance (i.e., a first stage effect of assignment on enrollment smaller than 1.0). Additional institu-

tional details regarding auto-assignment are available in Appendix A and are documented in Wallace

(2019), which examines the effect of Medicaid managed care provider networks in New York.

      We construct our “auto-assignee sample” with the following restrictions. First, we restrict the

sample to beneficiaries aged 18 to 64. We exclude individuals aged 65 and older because they are

excluded from managed care. We remove beneficiaries below age 18 because children are often non-

randomly auto-assigned to their parents’ plans. Second, we exclude Medicaid beneficiaries with

family members in a Medicaid managed care plan at the time of auto assignment and beneficiaries

who were enrolled in a managed care plan in the year prior to assignment. Plan assignments for

these beneficiaries are automatic, but not random. Third, we restrict to beneficiaries with at least six

months of post-assignment enrollment in Medicaid to allow us to observe plan effects on spending,

utilization, and quality outcomes.

      In primary analyses we restrict attention to the initial six months post-assignment. Enrollment is

high and stable until six months and then drops off precipitously (see Appendix Figure A1). This is

due to high levels of churn in the Medicaid program combined with a NY regulation guaranteeing

Medicaid eligibility for six months following the beginning of an MMC enrollment spell. We show

robustness of our main results to expanding the sample to include additional months in Appendix

D. The expanded-sample results are nearly identical.


                                                    5
      These sample restrictions leave us with 65,596 beneficiaries in five boroughs and ten plans. The

final “auto-assignee” sample includes 285 county × year × month (the unit of randomization) co-

horts of observations. In some instances, we make comparisons to the full NYC MMC population

from the sample period, which includes the 1,011,169 18- to 64-year-old “active choosers” who were

not randomized to a plan. Tables 1 and A1 describe these samples. Internal validity does not re-

quire that auto-assignees and active choosers are similar. Nonetheless, one might be concerned that

auto-assignees are healthier and less-engaged with the healthcare system, so that estimates reflect

impacts on consumers who use little care. Table A1 shows that auto-assignees do differ somewhat

from active-choosers, being more likely to be black males. But on overall healthcare spending, the

groups appear similar. In fact, auto-assignees use slightly more care than active-choosers. The IV anal-

ysis thus estimates plan effects on patterns of healthcare utilization, health, and satisfaction among

individuals actively using care.2


2.3    Administrative data and outcomes

We obtained detailed administrative data from the New York State Department of Health (NYS-

DOH) for the non-elderly New York Medicaid population from 2008 to 2012. The data contain

beneficiary-level demographic and enrollment data linked to healthcare claims for services covered

by fee-for-service Medicaid (FFS) and private MCOs. The MCO enrollment data include an indicator

for whether a beneficiary made an active plan choice or was auto-assigned, and, for auto-assignees,

the plan of assignment. Monthly plan enrollment data allow us to observe whether beneficiaries re-

mained in their assigned plans. We construct beneficiary-month level outcomes related to healthcare

use and spending.

      Healthcare use, prices, and spending. Claims data include information on providers, transaction

prices, procedures, and quantities. When measuring healthcare use and spending we include all

services paid for by the managed care plans and by fee-for-service Medicaid, which carves out certain

services from managed care financial responsibility. Also, most beneficiaries spend a few months

enrolled in the FFS program prior to choosing or being assigned to a managed care plan, allowing us

to observe utilization under a common fee-for-service regime prior to randomization. This enables

powerful balance tests.
   2 Anywhere where we compare results for active-choosers and auto-assignees, we re-weight the active-choosers to match

the auto-assignees on demographics and detailed, pre-enrollment healthcare utilization.


                                                           6
      Healthcare quality. We measure healthcare quality by adapting access measures developed by the

Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the adult Medicaid population. We determined

whether beneficiaries complied with recommended preventive care, measured as the frequency of

flu vaccination for adults ages 18 to 64, breast cancer screenings, cervical cancer screenings, and

chlamydia screenings in women. We also examined the frequency of avoidable hospitalizations (a

surrogate health outcome), operationalized as admission rates for four conditions: diabetes short-

term complications, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in adults, heart failure,

and asthma in younger adults. We use additional measures of potentially high- and low-value care

that follow recent contributions in the literature (Schwartz et al., 2014; Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017).

      Willingness-to-Stay. Because Medicaid enrollees do not pay a premium (price) for enrolling with

any of the plans in the market, we cannot measure beneficiary willingness-to-pay for one plan versus

another. Instead, we assume beneficiaries’ preferences are revealed through their subsequent plan

choices (voting with their feet). While switching rates are low, enrollees are not locked-in to their

assigned plans: For the first three months after assignment they may switch for any reason, after

which they can switch for “good cause.” As we discuss in Section 4.3, we measure willingness-to-

stay as the likelihood that a randomly-assigned enrollee remains in her assigned plan.



3     Empirical Framework and First-Stage

3.1    Econometric Model

Our main empirical goal in this paper is to measure the causal effect of enrollment in health plan

j ∈ J on outcomes at the beneficiary (i) level. We follow Finkelstein, Gentzkow and Williams (2016) in

modeling a data generating process for healthcare spending in which log spending (Yij ) is determined

by a plan component (γ j ), a person-level fixed effect (ξ i ), time-varying observables (Xit ), and a mean

zero shock (eijct ) that may be influenced by both beneficiary and plan:3


                                           Yijct = νXit + γ j + ξ i + eijct .                                        (1)


      To recover plan effects, γ j , we estimate Equation 1 as a regression at the individual-level, com-
   3 FGW decompose spending into beneficiary and place effects, holding plan (fee-for-service Medicare) fixed. We (effec-

tively) decompose spending into beneficiary and plan effects, holding place fixed.



                                                           7
bining the ξ i and eijct terms into a compound error term µijct :

                                                               9
                                Yijct = ρ + ψct + νXict + ∑ γ j 1[Plan_j ict ] + µijct .               (2)
                                                            j =1


In these regressions, an observation is a beneficiary-month. The regressors of interest are indicators

for enrollment in month t in each of the ten plans competing in the New York City market (with one

plan as the omitted category). Fixed effects ψct for month t × county c of enrollment are included in

all specifications. The X vector of individual controls is described below.

    To address the endogeneity of beneficiaries sorting themselves across plans—correlation between

plan choice and µijct —we exploit random assignment. We restrict to individuals who were randomly

auto-assigned to plans and instrument for plan enrollment indicators with plan assignment indicators.

There are ten plans that receive auto-assigned enrollees during our time period, requiring nine first-

stage regressions (with plan 10 omitted):

                                                                9
                    Plan_1 ict = α1 + φ1ct + δ1 Xict + ∑ λ1j 1[Assigned_j ict ] + η1,ict
                                                               j =1
                           ..
                            .                                                                          (3)
                                                                9
                    Plan_9 ict = α9 + φ9ct + δ9 Xict + ∑ λ9j 1[Assigned_j ict ] + η9,ict .
                                                               j =1


We use the nine first-stage regressions to predict enrollment in each plan. For each auto-assigned

enrollee, only one of the plan assignment variables will be equal to one. The coefficient λkj captures

the probability that an individual auto-assigned to plan j will be enrolled in plan k during any given

month, relative to the omitted plan. For each first-stage regression, a λkj equal to one for k = j and

equal to zero for k 6= j would indicate perfect compliance. The second stage estimating equation uses
                                            \
the vector of predicted enrollment values (Plan ijct ) from the first-stage regressions:


                                                               9
                                Yijct = ρ + ψct + νXict + ∑ γ j 1[Plan_j
                                                                   \ ] + µijct .
                                                                         ict                           (4)
                                                            j =1


This IV strategy results in estimates of the plan effects, γ j , that use only variation in enrollment due

to quasi-random auto-assignment.

3.2    First-Stage and Instrument Validity

Figure 1B plots λ jj for each plan—roughly, the probability that a beneficiary who is auto-assigned

to a plan is enrolled in that plan after assignment. In the six-months post-assignment, beneficiaries

spend more than ninety percent of the time in their assigned plan. The overall first-stage F-statistic

is reported in Table 1 and exceeds 7,000. Table A2 lists all of the first-stage coefficient estimates, λkj .

The high rate of compliance implies the local-average treatment effects recovered by IV are unlikely

to differ much from average treatment effects for the auto-assignee sample.

      Figure 1A presents a series of randomization tests to assess the independence assumption to

the extent possible, using information on pre-determined characteristics like demographics, as well

as pre-randomization medical expenditure. To test for correlations between assignment and pre-

determined characteristics, each baseline characteristic is regressed on nine indicators for benefi-

ciaries’ assigned plans (omitting one plan to prevent perfect collinearity). We perform this regres-

sion separately for auto-assignees and a random sample of active-choosers of equal size to the auto-

assignee sample to equalize statistical power across the two groups.

      In the left panel of Figure 1A, we plot plan effect coefficients from the active-chooser regres-

sions as hollow circles and coefficients from the auto-assignee regressions as solid circles. In the

right panel, we plot for each dependent variable the p-value from an F-test that the plan effects are

jointly different from zero, again separately for the active-chooser and auto-assignee samples.4 High

p-values are consistent with random assignment. The results in the figure provide strong evidence

of balance across plans for the auto-assignees, with plan effects tightly clustered around zero for all

pre-determined characteristics. p-values exceed 0.05 for all but one characteristic. In contrast, the

analogous estimates for the active-choosers show that plan “effects” on pre-determined character-

istics are large, and each characteristic is predicted by plan choice with p < 0.05. The imbalance

among active-choosers indicates that the lack of statistical imbalance among the auto-assignees is not

due to noisy or uninformative observables. It also suggests that selection would be an important

confounder in the absence of quasi-random assignment. Below in Figure 4 and Table A4, we provide

evidence that there is no differential attrition as a function of plan of assignment, another important

fact to establish for our identification.
  4 Tabular   versions of these results are in Table A3.

4     Results

4.1      Healthcare spending

We start by presenting results for each plan’s causal effect on spending relative to an omitted plan,

using the IV regression in Equation 4. Panel (a) of Figure 2 reports the main result—plan effects

on monthly log(spending + 1) from the IV regression. The plotted coefficients reveal substantial

heterogeneity in spending and utilization across plans. We estimate that the highest-spending plan,

Plan D, spends 11.5% more than the omitted plan. The lowest-spending plan, Plan I, spends 20.3%

less than the omitted plan. This implies a range in spending of 31.8%, with six plans (A, B, C, G,

H, I) spending significantly less than the omitted plan (X), two plans (E and F) exhibiting spending

levels similar to the omitted plan, and one plan (D) having significantly higher spending. The same

panel also reports coefficients from a regression in which the dependent variable is an indicator for

any utilization in the month. This regression reveals similar patterns, with lower-spending plans

exhibiting lower probabilities of non-zero utilization each month.

      These patterns are robust to alternative specifications and constructions of the dependent vari-

able. Table 1 reports results with and without controls for pre-determined characteristics. We esti-

mate similar variation in plan effects when the outcome is parameterized as the inverse hyperbolic

sine of spending or Windsorized spending levels (Table A5), and when we aggregate spending over

the entire six-month enrollment spell, rather than analyzing monthly outcomes (Table A6). In Ap-

pendix C, we show that these results are not merely reflecting a temporary disruption of care at the

time of assignment; month-by-month event studies (Figure A2) show differences that persist for the

entire enrollment spell.

      The range of these estimates is large. For example, the range of our plan effects corresponds to

2.5 times the size of the spending difference between plans featuring care at zero marginal cost versus

a high deductible (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017).5 Yet, our estimates are considerably smaller than the
    5A collage of additional evidence indicates that these plan effects are not merely the artifacts of differential reporting
across plans. E.g., the Office of the Inspector General examined New York Medicaid managed care plans in 2012 and found
a large range (about a 30 percentage point span) in medical loss ratios across plans (OIG, 2015). As we discuss in detail in
Appendix B, the underlying cost data for the OIG report differs from the claims data we use and so provides independent
corroboration. Carve-outs provide further corroboration: A minority of services for MMC enrollees are carved-out and
paid by the state via FFS. When we examine each spending component (FFS and MMC) separately, we show that the
patterns of FFS claims—in which the plans themselves have no reporting role—track the patterns of MMC claims. Thus,
reduced utilization in low-spending plans is observed even where data originate with the state rather than with any plan.
See Appendix B for full detail and additional supporting evidence.

observational, cross-sectional differences in plan spending. To better understand this relationship,

Panel (b) of Figure 2 plots plan effects identified via random assignment in the IV sample against plan

effects (estimated via OLS) that compare the spending of enrollees making active plan choices. Both

regressions include rich controls (risk adjusters) for observable enrollee characteristics, including

deciles of ex-ante spending from the period prior to the beneficiary entering MMC, during which

all beneficiaries were enrolled in FFS. Further, the active-chooser sample is reweighted to match the

distribution of observables in the auto-assignee IV sample to provide the most consistent comparison

the data allow. These coefficients are also reported in Tables 1 and A7.

      Figure 2 indicates a noisy relationship between the observational and causal estimates. On aver-

age, enrolling in a plan with high risk-adjusted spending among active choosers (x-axis) will cause

an enrollee to have higher spending (y-axis). But this average relationship masks substantial hetero-

geneity: The size and even ranking of plan effects varies in the two sets of estimates, indicative of

substantial selection across plans. On average, the observed selection is adverse: Higher-spending

enrollees opt into plans with larger positive causal effects on spending. Such selection suggests that

conventional cross-sectional comparisons of spending or other outcomes across plans would be dif-

ficult to interpret, as differences will be driven by both causal plan effects and residual selection. This

is true even when adjusting for a rich set of observables that include prior healthcare spending.


4.2    Mechanisms

To better understand mechanisms behind the spending differences, we divide the ten plans into three

sets based on the IV spending effects: low (Plans A, B, C, G, H, I), medium (Plans E, F, and X), and high

(Plan D). The grouping aids with statistical power, as well as with tractability of the comparisons. In

the modified IV regression, the endogenous variables are indicators for enrollment in any plan in

each set, and the instruments are indicators for assignment to any plan in each set.6 Because Plan D

(the single outlier high-spending plan) is so different from the others in terms of overall spending, we

focus on the low versus medium coefficients in the main text. We report our consistent, but noisier,

estimates for the high plan in Appendix Figures A3 and A4.

      We focus on two classes of potential mechanisms that mirror the mechanisms most often explored

in the literature examining the effects of consumer cost-sharing parameters like deductibles and coin-

                                                                  11
surance rates. First, we explore the role of negotiated provider prices, which could operate by lower-

spending plans steering consumers to different, lower-priced providers or by lower-spending plans

negotiating lower prices with the same providers. Second, we explore whether the tools used by the

lower-spending plans to reduce utilization are “blunt” in that they tend to reduce all types of care

or “sharp,” in the sense of targeting and cutting low-value services. In Appendix D, we also briefly

study the role of provider network breadth, finding little relationship between network size and plan

spending effects in this setting.


Prices The similarity of plan effects on total spending and plan effects on an indicator for any uti-

lization (Figure 2) suggests that quantity differences may be more important than negotiated price

differences in explaining spending differences in this context. Figure 3 investigates the role of prices

in greater detail. In it we plot the median log prices for the medium- versus low-spending plans for

thousands of services. A price here is the paid amount at the level of the DRG for inpatient admis-

sions (Panel a) and at the level of the procedure code for outpatient services (Panel b). The figure

shows that prices appear very similar across medium- and lower-spending plans. Systematically

higher prices in the medium-spending group would appear as a vertical shift of the cloud of points

above the 45 degree line. No shift is evident. Analogous figures for high- versus medium-spending

plans are shown in Figure A3, revealing a similar pattern.

    To decompose exactly how much of the spending differences can be accounted for by prices,

we next re-price all claims as if all plans transacted at a common set of prices. We then re-calculate

enrollee spending using the re-priced claims and re-run the IV analysis.7 The results are displayed

in Table A5. For ease of comparison, Panel (c) of Figure 3 plots our main IV plan effects against

plan effects estimated on the price-standardized data. Re-pricing has almost no effect on our esti-

mates of plan spending coefficients, indicating that price differences cannot account for the spending

differences we observe.

    In the spending panel of Figure 4, we show that denied claims also do not appear to be important

for explaining plan spending effect differences. Each row of the figure corresponds to a separate

regression. In the first row of the first panel, we report the main result at the group level: Low-

spending plans, on average, generate 16% less spending than medium-spending plans. To illustrate

the role of denials, we reprice each denied (zero paid) claim as if it had been paid at a common-across-
  7 See   Appendix C for full detail on the repricing, which follows Cooper et al. (2019).


                                                              12
plans price, and then re-estimate the effect of low- versus medium-spending plans. This change does

not alter the difference in spending we calculate between the two groups of plans.


Blunt versus sharp In the RAND HIE and the quasi-experimental studies that have followed it,

patient cost-sharing has proven to be a blunt instrument, with deductibles and coinsurance affecting

use of low- and high-value services alike. Are the reductions in spending generated by managed care

similarly blunt or are these better targeted?

    Figure 4 investigates. The figure shows that reductions in low-spending plans occur across all

services: inpatient admissions, pharmacy, outpatient care, office visits, lab services, and dental care.

The most-rationed services were office visits and hospital outpatient services.

    So far, our findings do not rule out the possibility that low-spending plans invest in high-value

treatments that make people healthier and decrease the need for costly inpatient and outpatient hos-

pital treatments. To investigate this, we examine two sets of potentially high-value services that could

produce spending offsets: drugs and preventive services.

    Figure 4 show no evidence that low-spending plans invest more in high-value drugs or preven-

tive services. With respect to drugs, we focus on a set of maintenance drugs used to treat chronic

conditions. Specifically, we estimate plan effects on diabetes drugs, statins, anti-depressants, anti-

psychotics, anti-hypertensives, anti-stroke drugs, asthma drugs, and contraceptives. Rather than

increase utilization, low-spending plans decrease utilization of most of these drugs, though some

reductions are statistically insignificant. This is inconsistent with the idea that lower-spending plans

use scalpel-like tools to reduce inefficient spending while improving or maintaining provision of

high-value care: For many of these drugs non-adherence can result in health deterioration and ex-

pensive hospitalizations.

    We also study the effects of enrolling in a low-spending plan on the use of other, non-drug, high-

value services. Figure 4 analyzes four measures of compliance with recommended care developed

by Health and Human Services for Medicaid enrollees: the prevalence of HbA1c testing, breast can-

cer screening rates, cervical cancer screening rates, and chlamydia screening rates. For each of the

measures except breast cancer screening, we find that enrollment in a low-spending spending plan

significantly reduces the use of recommended preventive care.

    We next investigate whether low-spending plans target low-value care for cutting. We estimate

the effects of enrolling in a low-spending plan on the use of a variety of potentially low-value services,

                                                   13
including inappropriate abdominal imaging, back imaging, and colorectal screening (Schwartz et al.,

2014; Charlesworth et al., 2016). We find no evidence that low-spending plans reduce the use of these

low-value services, with suggestive evidence that rates of low-value care may actually be higher.

      In sum, there is no indication that low-spending plans achieve savings by promoting high-value

care and achieving offsets or by targeting low-value care for elimination. Instead, similar to what

happens when consumers face a high deductible, supply-side managed care tools appear to constrain

virtually all types of care.


4.3    Trade-offs

Finally, to the extent possible in our data, we evaluate the effects of enrolling in low-spending plans

on welfare-relevant outcomes beyond utilization. The literature on demand-side cost-sharing has

shown that cost-sharing involves a trade-off between risk protection and moral hazard (Zeckhauser,

1970). Researchers and policymakers have also been interested in the effects of demand-side cost-

sharing on health. The evidence on this relationship has been mixed.

      In the Medicaid setting, beneficiaries enrolling in lower-spending plans are not subject to cost-

sharing. So the financial risk trade-off is absent. There may, however, still be a trade-off between

satisfaction/utility and plan spending. We study this trade-off by estimating differences in the prob-

ability that an individual assigned to a low- versus medium-spending plan opts to stay in that

plan post-assignment rather than switch to a different plan. We call our measure of this probabil-

ity “willingness-to-stay," and assume that differential switching behavior across randomly-assigned

plans is correlated with enrollees’ experienced utility across plans.

      Figure 4 shows that people are less likely to stay in lower-spending plans. Appendix Figure

A4 shows that beneficiaries are likewise more likely to stay in the high-spending plan versus the

medium-spending plans. To give a finer view of these results, in Appendix Figure A5, we plot plan-

level estimates of willingness-to-stay against the plan effects on spending—first for all beneficiaries

and then stratified according to health status. The relationship is clear, with higher-spending plans

having higher estimates of willingness-to-stay. It is also clear that sicker beneficiaries—those who

use more care and so have more experience with their plans—drive this relationship. These results

provide evidence of a real trade-off between plan spending and beneficiary satisfaction.

      Finally, to the extent possible in our data, we examine whether there are measurable health effects


                                                    14
of the tools used by low-spending plans to constrain cost. We do this with a standard surrogate health

outcome that can be constructed from claims data: hospitalizations that are potentially avoidable

given appropriate treatment and management of a set of common conditions. The measures were

developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for the Medicaid population.

(See Appendix B for details.) Figure 4 shows that enrollees in the low-spending plans are 16% more

likely to have an avoidable hospitalization despite having lower utilization for most other types of

care. This result suggests that the tools used by low-spending plans to constrain costs could have

negative consequences for beneficiary health.



5   Conclusion

Our results are important for understanding the potential for managed care to constrain healthcare

spending growth. We show that the baskets of rationing devices implicit in managed care can have

spending and utilization impacts significantly larger than what could be accomplished by exposing

consumers to high deductibles and reasonable coinsurance and copays.

    Importantly, rationing via managed care reduces spending without exposing consumers to fi-

nancial risk, circumventing the classic trade-off between financial risk protection and moral hazard

noted by Zeckhauser (1970) and Pauly (1974). These findings are particularly relevant for public in-

surance programs—including the low-income segments of HIX Marketplaces and Medicare—where

policymakers have been reluctant to expose low-income consumers to financial risk.

    However, these spending reductions appear to come with a utility cost. Willingness to remain

enrolled in a plan is negatively related to that plan’s cost savings. And cost reductions are blunt—

reducing utilization of all types of care, lowering traditional measures of healthcare quality, and

increasing the likelihood of adverse health events.

             Figure 1: First Stage and Instrument Balance on Predetermined Characteristics




Note: Figure displays a balance test for the randomization in Panel (a) and first stage regression coefficients in
Panel (b). Pre-determined characteristics include demographics and healthcare utilization in FFS Medicaid prior to
randomized auto-assignment to a managed care plan. Each enrollee spent a pre-period (often a few months, once
retroactive enrollment is included) enrolled in the FFS program prior to choosing or being assigned to a managed
care plan. For the balance test, two samples are used: the main IV analysis sample of auto-assignees (AA) and a same-
sized random subsample of active choosers (AC) for comparison. On the left side of Panel (a), each pre-determined
characteristic is regressed on the set of indicators for the assigned plan (for auto-assignees) or for the chosen plan
(for active choosers), and the plan effects are plotted. Separate regressions are run for the AA and AC groups, so that
each horizontal line plots plan coefficients from two regressions. The plan effects are demeaned within the AA and
AC groups separately, and then scaled by the same factor (the standard deviation of the combined set of demeaned
plan effects). Hence, the scales (not displayed) differ for each dependent variable but are identical for the AA and AC
regressions within a dependent variable. Tighter groupings of estimated plan coefficients indicate smaller differences
across plans in the characteristics of enrollees. In the right side of Panel (a), we show the p-values from F-tests that
the plan effects in these regressions are jointly different from zero. Tabular versions of these results are in Table A3.
Large p-values are consistent with random assignment. Small p-values indicate selection on observables. The vertical
dashed line is at p=0.05. In the bottom panel, bar heights correspond to coefficients from the first stage regressions
(Eq. 3), in which observations are enrollee-months, the coefficient plotted is on an indicator for assignment to plan j,
and the dependent variable is enrollment in plan j. Bar heights can be interpreted as approximately the fraction of
months auto-assignees remain in their plan of assignment. Table A2 reports all first stage coefficients.

Note: Figure displays the main results of the paper—plan effects on healthcare utilization identified by random
plan assignment. Panel (a) plots IV coefficients corresponding to Eq. 4, where the dependent variable is log(total
healthcare spending +1) on the left axis or an indicator for any spending in the enrollee-month on the right axis.
Plan of enrollment is instrumented with plan of assignment. Coefficients are relative to the omitted plan, X. For the
plot, plans are ordered by their spending effects. Whiskers indicate 95% confidence intervals. Standard errors are
clustered at the county × year × month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the randomization operates.
Panel (b) compares the same IV estimates from panel (a) with the observational differences in spending across plans
within the active chooser sample. Active chooser (observational) differences are estimated as OLS coefficients in a
regression of log total monthly spending on a full set of plan indicators, as in Eq. 2. The active chooser sample
is reweighted to match the IV sample on observables, including FFS healthcare utilization prior to managed care
enrollment. Person-level controls are identical in the OLS and IV specifications. See the notes to Tables 1 and A7 for
tabular forms of these results and for complete details on the control variables and reweighting.

Note: Figure shows the minor role played by transaction prices in explaining spending differences across plans. The
top two panels divide plans into high-, medium-, and low-spending groups as described in the text. We focus on
medium- and low-spending plan groups as the high spender is a single plan outlier. Figure A3 shows analogous
comparisons for high- versus medium- and high- versus low-cost plans. Panel (a) plots the log of median prices for
all inpatient admissions with common support in our data among medium- and low-spending plans. Each circle in
Panel (a) is a diagnosis-related group (DRG), and marker size is proportional to frequency in our claims data. Panel
(b) plots the analogous price comparison for outpatient claims, using the Healthcare Common Procedural Coding
System (HCPCS). Panel (c) reverts to a plan-level analysis and reprices all claims to a common set of prices across all
plans and then re-estimates the main IV specification for plan effects on log spending. The plan spending effects for
the repriced data are plotted along the vertical axis, against the main (non-repriced) IV estimates along the horizontal
axis.

Note: Figure shows spending and utilization in low-spending plans compared to medium-spending plans across vari-
ous categories and service settings. Plans are divided into three sets: low- (Plans A, B, C, G, H, I), medium- (Plans E,
F, and X), and high- (Plan D) spending. We estimate a modified version of the IV regression in Eq. 4 in which the en-
dogenous variables are indicators for enrollment in any plan in each set: Y = ρ + ψct + νX + γLow 1[Low
                                                                             ict                ict
                                                                                                            \ Plan ] +ict
           \
γHigh 1[High  Planict ] + µict . Medium spending is the omitted category. The instruments are indicators for assignment to
any plan in each set. We focus here on coefficients on the low-spending group indicator (γLow ), because the high spender
is a single plan outlier. (Figure A4 reports the analogous results for the single high-spending outlier.) Labels to the left
within each panel describe the dependent variable. Coefficients are plotted with 95% confidence intervals. Coefficients in
the first panel are effects on log spending. In the next four panels, coefficients are divided by the mean of the dependent
variable in the omitted group to allow placing multiple outcomes on the same scale. In the last panel, which describes
willingness-to-stay enrolled in the assigned plan (WTS) and attrition out of sample, the dependent variables are indicators
and the coefficients are not scaled. For example, a WTS coefficient of -0.03 would correspond to an effect in which enroll-
ment in a low-spending plan—in place of a medium-spending plan—increased the probability of switching plans by three
percentage points. For a complete tabulation of all regression results displayed in the Figure, see Tables A8, A9, A10, and
A11.

Note: Table displays summary statistics and main results. Column 1 reports counts of auto-assignees. When aggregated
over the study period, plans received different numbers of auto-assignees depending on whether the plans were offered
in the county and eligible for auto-enrollees at the time of assignment (see Appendix A). Column 2 reports the percent of
active choosers selecting each plan. Remaining columns report OLS or IV regression results, where dependent variables
are indicated in the column headers. In columns 3–7, plan regressors correspond to the plan of current enrollment in the
enrollee-month. For the IV regressions (columns 5–7), these are instrumented with plan of initial assignment. Kleibergen-
Paap F statistics from the first stage are reported. See Table A2 for first stage coefficients. In columns 8 and 9, the dependent
variable is an indicator for remaining in the auto-assigned plan at three and six months post-assignment, respectively.
Observations are enrollee × months in columns 3 through 7 and enrollees in columns 8 and 9. OLS regressions include
only active-choosers; see Table A12 for additional OLS results that pool the active chooser and auto-assignee (IV) samples.
Person-level controls include: sex, 5 race categories, deciles of spending in FFS prior to MMC enrollment, and 47 age
categories (single years from 18 to 64). All regressions control for county × year × month-of-assignment and the count
of months since plan assignment/plan enrollment, both as saturated sets of indicators. Standard errors in parentheses are
clustered at the county × year × month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the randomization operates. +

Are All Managed Care Plans Created Equal: Evidence from Random Plan
                      Assignment in Medicaid


A      Medicaid Managed Care in New York
New York State began experimenting with managed care in Medicaid in 1967. In 1997, New York
obtained a Section 1115 waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services that authorized a
statewide Medicaid Managed Care program utilizing private carriers in place of a traditional fee-for-
service program. This program was voluntary in the 1980s and expanded into a mandatory program
in the 1990s and 2000s.1 Under mandatory managed care, beneficiaries are required to join a managed
care plan operated by a for-profit or not-for-profit third party organization.

A.1     Broader Nationwide Context
During the study sample period New York State was similar to the national mean in its use of private
managed care organizations to administer Medicaid enrollee benefits. According to CMS, as of July
2011 (toward the end of the study sample period), about three quarters of New York State’s Medicaid
beneficiaries were enrolled in a managed care program. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that
as of 2014, 77 percent of the US Medicaid population was enrolled in a Medicaid Managed Care plan,
with 39 states using MCOs to deliver Medicaid benefits.

A.2     Auto Assignment in NYC
There are two exceptions to the auto-assignment policies described in Section 2. First, New York
takes into account family member enrollment, defaulting beneficiaries into their family member’s
plan. Second, beneficiaries who were enrolled in a managed care plan in the year prior to assignment
are reassigned to their previous plan.2 Beneficiaries assigned on the basis of family members or prior
enrollment are flagged and removed from our analysis sample.3
     For our study period, in New York City beneficiaries had 30, 60, or 90 days to make an active
choice. In practice, the gap we observe between enrollment and auto-assignment (see Appendix Fig-
ure A1) is often in excess of 90 days. During our study period (and today), Medicaid beneficiaries
were retroactively enrolled upon successful application—a mechanism intended to cover recent un-
paid medical bills that would have been covered by Medicaid. From a 2011 NY Medicaid policy
document: “the retroactive eligibility period ... begins on the first day of the third month prior to the
month in which the individual applied for Medicaid and ends on the date the individual applies for
Medicaid.”4 Thus, although auto-assignment happens within 90 days of successful application, the
    1 Theshift to mandatory managed care took place via county-by-county “enrollment mandates.” The mandates initially
applied only to children and TANF adults, but were expanded to include disabled Medicaid beneficiaries (Sparer, 2012).
   2 Preferential assignment to a prior plan does not apply if the beneficiary’s prior plan was a partial capitation plan, a low

quality plan, or a plan without further capacity.
   3 Auto assignments on the basis of family members of prior enrollees are not directly separately identified in the data.

We adopt a conservative approach to removing these beneficiaries, flagging and dropping anyone with a case (family)
member in their file at the time they are auto-assigned. We also remove beneficiaries with any managed care enrollment in
the year prior to auto-assignment.
   4 The document, which includes additional details on New York’s retroactive eligibility policy, is available here:

https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/reference/mrg/june2011/pages495.6-8.pdf. (Accessed 8/17/2020)


                                                               1
Online Appendix


observed enrollment spell often extends back prior to application, including the retroactive period as
well. When taking this retroactive eligibility period into account, beneficiaries could be enrolled in
the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid program for as long as 6 months prior to auto-assignment (which
we often observe, as reported in Appendix Figure A1). Beneficiaries could also be enrolled for longer
than six months prior to assignment if their assignment occurs due to a new MMC enrollment man-
date for their eligibility group. While MMC enrollment mandates were in effect for most populations
in NYC prior to the beginning of our study period, some small groups were transitioned at some
point during the period. These groups would have 30, 60, or 90 days to make an active choice from
the date the mandate kicks in, not from the date they applied for Medicaid. Given that some of these
individuals could have been enrolled in Medicaid for years prior to the implementation of an MMC
enrollment mandate for their group, it is possible for these beneficiaries to have pre-assignment en-
rollment periods much longer than six months.
     Plans qualify as eligible for assignment based on a yearly composite measure that incorpo-
rates state-specific quality measures, Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
(CAHPS) responses, Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs), and regulatory compliance measures. Pre-
vention Quality Indicators (PQIs) are a set of measures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality to evaluate the quality of care for “ambulatory care sensitive conditions.” These
are conditions for which good outpatient care can prevent hospitalizations or complications. Because
plans do not necessarily qualify for random assignment over our entire study period and are not
always available in all counties, we treat a beneficiary’s county-by-year-by-month of assignment as
the unit of randomization.

A.3   Auto Assignee Sample Sizes by Plan
The sample size of auto-assignees is not identical across plans for several reasons. First, as noted
above, plans qualify to receive auto-assignees based on a yearly performance composite that mea-
sures plan-level quality, consumer satisfaction, and regulatory compliance. Plans that don’t qualify
are ineligible to receive auto-assignees during the specified period. Second, some of the plans in
our sample do not service Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, and so will not
receive auto-assignees that reside there.
    In addition to the two factors above, there was a merger of two of the plans in our sample. The
merger, which took place in the final year of our study (2012), led to all enrollees in the acquired plan
being transferred to the acquiring plan. Since this was not a voluntary plan switch, for the set of
auto-assignees that were in the acquired plan, we recoded their plan of assignment to be the acquirer
beginning the month of the acquisition.


B     Data
B.1   Administrative data and outcomes
All managed care plans are required to submit standardized encounter data for the services they pro-
vide and the NYSDOH has linked this data to the claims they pay directly through the FFS program.
Thus, our claims data include both MMC and FFS components. An evaluation by the Lewin Group
indicated that the New York data was ready for use in research (Lewin Group, 2012).
     We use the validated administrative data from the NYSDOH to construct a series of outcomes
including enrollee spending, utilization of medical services and drugs, healthcare quality (including
avoidable hospitalizations), plan satisfaction, and the likelihood of re-enrolling in Medicaid. All
of these outcomes are either used by policymakers to regulate plans, publicly-reported to enrollees
during the plan choice process, or both. We briefly describe the details of these outcomes below.

                                                   2
Online Appendix


  • Categories of service. We use an algorithm provided by the New York State Department of
    Health to classify administrative healthcare claims into mutually-exclusive categories of ser-
    vice. The state’s algorithm takes into account the claim type, provider category of service,
    provider specialty code, rate code (a New York data element used to identify the broad type of
    service provided), procedure code (e.g., CPT, HCPCS, ICD), modifier code, and enrollee age.

  • Drug classification. We use Truven Health Analytics Red Book to classify the pharmaceutical
    claims in our data. Red Book groups claims into mutually-exclusive buckets based on the Na-
    tional Drug Code (NDC). Our drug groups are supersets of REDBOOK therapeutic classes. Di-
    abetes includes: Anti-diabetic agents, Sulfonylureas; Anti-diabetic agents, misc; Anti-diabetic
    agents, Insulins. Statins include: Anti-hyper-lipidemic Drugs. Anti-depressants include: Psy-
    chother, Anti-depressants. Anti-psychotics include: Psychother, Tranq/Antipsychotic; ASH,
    Benzodiazepines; Anticonvulsant, Benzodiazepine. Anti-hypertension includes: Cardiac, ACE
    Inhibitors; Cardiac, Beta Blockers; Cardiac, Alpha-Beta Blockers. Anti-stroke includes: Coag/
    Anticoag, Anticoagulants. Asthma/COPD includes: Adrenals Comb, NEC.

  • Healthcare quality. We construct three sets of healthcare quality measures. First, we determine
    whether beneficiaries comply with recommended preventive care. Second, we examine the rate
    of avoidable hospitalizations. And, third, we measure the prevalence of low value care.
    Preventive care. We examined whether beneficiaries complied with recommended flu vaccina-
    tions for adults ages 18 to 64, breast cancer screenings, cervical cancer screenings, and chlamy-
    dia screenings in women. These measures follow the specifications of the Medicaid Adult Core
    Set HEDIS measures but do not include any continuous enrollment restriction for inclusion. The
    Breast cancer screening measure determines the percentage of women ages 50 to 65 who had
    a mammogram. The cervical cancer screening measure determines the percentage of women
    ages 21 to 64 who were screened for cervical cancer. Chlamydia screening determines the per-
    centage of sexually active women 18 to 24 who were tested for chlamydia. The HbA1c measure
    determines the percentage of diabetic adults ages 18 to 64 who had a hemoglobin A1c test.
    Avoidable hospitalizations. Avoidable hospitalizations follow the specifications of the Medicaid
    Adult Core Set HEDIS measures. PQI-01 counts the number of inpatient hospitalizations for di-
    abetes short term complications for adults ages 18 to 64. PQI-05 counts the number of inpatient
    hospitalizations for COPD or asthma for adults ages 40 to 64. PQI-08 measures the number of
    inpatient hospitalizations for heart failure for adults age 18 to 64. PQI-15 measures inpatient
    hospitalizations for COPD or asthma for adults 18 to 39.
    Low value care. We use 5 claims-based measures from Charlesworth et al. (2016) to measure low
    value care. These measures are recommendations from CMS or the Choosing Wisely initiative,
    which aims to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments, and procedures. We selected these
    5 measures as they had both a large number of qualifying diagnoses for the denominator and a
    high overall prevalence of low value care conditional on that diagnosis.

  • Denied claims. In our administrative claims data, we observe the final payment status of each
    encounter reported by the Medicaid managed care plans. Since there is very minimal cost-
    sharing in New York Medicaid, these administrative denials represent the denial of claims sub-
    mitted to Medicaid managed care plans by healthcare providers. We are unable to observe
    the reasons for denial in our data. Denials may occur for several reasons, including duplicate
    claims being submitted, claims submitted with errors, and claims submitted for unapproved
    services. We evaluate the role of denied claims (which are paid $0 in our data) by re-pricing
    each denied claim using the pricing regression described in Appendix Section C.5.

B.2   Differential Reporting?
In Section 4 we document substantial spread across plans in their causal impacts on spending and
utilization. Are these findings, which are established via claims data, likely to be driven by differen-
tial reporting in which our so-called “low-spending” plans merely report incomplete claims data to
the regulator? Several facts and patterns suggest the answer is no:

    • External Validation. An evaluation by the Lewin Group indicated that the New York data was
      ready for use in research (Lewin Group, 2012). This is not the case for Medicaid encounter data
      from all states.

    • MLR Reports/OIG. The Office of the Inspector General examined New York Medicaid man-
      aged care plans in 2012 and found that differences in medical loss ratios (MLRs) across plans
      spanned a 27 percentage point spread (68% to 95%) (OIG, 2015). Though not directly numeri-
      cally comparable to our log spending difference estimates (and impossible to correlate with our
      data due to de-identification of individual plans in the OIG report), these numbers indicate sig-
      nificant heterogeneity across plans in spending relative to (risk-adjusted) capitation payments.
      This is consistent with our interpretation of the claims data as revealing plan spending differ-
      ences. Importantly, the cost data entering the MLR calculation do not originate from the same
      systems as our claims data, so this offers an independent corroboration of plan heterogeneity
      in spending per beneficiary.

    • FFS Claims. Some services are carved out of MMC plan responsibility and reimbursed di-
      rectly by the state under a FFS arrangement. If plans differed in reporting but not in utilization,
      then FFS claims—in which the plans themselves have no reporting role—may be similar across
      plans. Figure A6 compares FFS spending and total spending across enrollees assigned to differ-
      ent plans. FFS spending differs across plans and in fact closely tracks the across-plan differences
      in total spending. This is consistent with there being true utilization reductions by low spend-
      ing plans and complementarities between MMC and FFS utilization. (And complementarity,
      rather than substitution, appears likely, as we show in Section 4.2 that MMC is a blunt instru-
      ment, reducing nearly all types of utilization.)

    • Incentives. Finally, we merely note that plans have an incentive to make their claims reporting
      complete. Future market-level capitation rates depend on past market-level claims.


C     Identification and Robustness
C.1   IV Assumptions
We briefly discuss the IV assumptions. We begin by noting that the fixed effects that control for the
month t × county c of enrollment (φct ) are important here, as the month × county determines the set
of plans eligible to receive enrollees via auto assignment.

    • Independence. The intention of the state Medicaid administrator was to randomly assign auto-
      assignees across the eligible plans. Figure 1 provides strong evidence that plan assignment is
      indeed as good as random, by examining correlation between pre-determined characteristics
      and plan of assignment. Each pre-determined baseline characteristic is regressed on the full set
      of ten indicators for beneficiaries’ assigned plans. The figure shows p-values from the F-tests
      of the null hypothesis that the baseline characteristics do not differ significantly among ben-
      eficiaries assigned to different plans. Successful random assignment would tend to generate
      large p-values, indicating no significant relationship. These values tend to be large across the

                                                    4
Online Appendix


      pre-determined characteristics. We also present p-values for the same tests for an equal-sized
      (random) sample of active choosers, showing important relationships between choices and ob-
      servables in the population that was not auto-assigned. This exercise demonstrates that these
      variables do indeed capture relevant dimensions on which enrollees select across plans. We also
      present the individual plan effect estimates for auto-assignees and active-choosers in the figure,
      showing that while the active-chooser estimates of plan “effects” on predetermined characteris-
      tics are often substantial (indicating imbalance), the auto-assignee estimates are typically close
      to zero (indicating balance).

   • Relevance. From Figure 1, assignment has a clear, quantitatively large effect on enrollment.
     Beneficiaries assigned to a plan spend more than ninety percent of the months in a Medicaid
     episode in the plan to which they were assigned. In other words, the first-stage effect of plan of
     assignment on plan of enrollment is near one for all plans. The first-stage F-stat is above 7,000.

   • Exclusion. Here, the exclusion-restriction requires that plan of assignment influences outcomes
     like healthcare utilization only via plan of enrollment. That is a natural assumption in this
     context, in which the plan of enrollment is the vehicle through which healthcare is provided.
     Although it is impossible to rule out, for example, that assignment to some plan—as distinct
     from enrollment in that plan—causes the healthcare utilization outcomes we document, such an
     interpretation would be significantly at odds with the existing small experimental and quasi-
     experimental literature on health plan effects. Another potential violation of the exclusion-
     restriction could occur if plan of assignment caused attrition out of the observation sample.
     This would be the case if plan of assignment caused beneficiaries to exit the Medicaid system
     altogether (as opposed to exiting the plan of assignment or exiting the managed care program to
     enroll in FFS Medicaid). We rule out this possibility directly in the data, showing no differential
     attrition over our study window (see Figure 4).

   • Monotonicity. Finally, the monotonicity assumption is supported by the near-completeness of
     take-up. The first-stage enrollment effects are nearly 1.0, leaving little room for defiers.

Separate from these issues of instrument validity, it is useful to consider the LATE identified here.
Compliers are those whose plan of observed enrollment (from the econometrician’s viewpoint) is
affected by assignment. First and most importantly, the LATE here is likely to be close to the ATE
for the quasi-experimental sample because of the size of the first-stage: Over ninety percent of the
enrollee-months in a Medicaid episode are spent in the plan of assignment. At the limit of one hun-
dred percent, the LATE converges to the ATE. There is a subtlety in this setting because there are
ten first stage regressions, each instrumenting for enrollment in one of the ten plans. Conceptually,
this opens the possibility that the LATEs are different across the first-stages. Compliers could, in
principle, be different types of enrollees with different counterfactuals across the ten assignment pos-
sibilities. The strongest evidence against this possibility is that the first-stage coefficient is so similar
and so close to 1.0 across all first stage regressions.

C.2   Plan Group IV Regressions
In Section 4.2 we describe an IV regression in which the regressors are plan groups: low- (Plans A,
B, C, G, H, I), medium- (Plans E, F, and X), and high-spending (Plan D). The corresponding equation
is:
                                                  \
                Yict = ρ + ψct + νXict + γLow 1[Low                       \
                                                    Planict ] + γHigh 1[High Planict ] + µict (A.1)
Medium spending is the omitted category. The endogenous variables are indicators for enrollment
in any plan in each set, and the instruments are indicators for assignment to any plan in each set, so

                                                     5

there are two first-stage regressions:

                  Low Planict = φ1ct + δ1 Xict +       ∑         λ1j 1[Assigned j ict ] + η1,ict ,   (A.2)
                                                    j∈High,Low

                  High Planict = φ2ct + δ2 Xict +      ∑         λ2j 1[Assigned j ict ] + η2,ict .   (A.3)
                                                    j∈High,Low

Results using this specification are presented in Figure 4 and Tables A13 and A14.

C.3   Short- vs. Long-run Effects, Disruption, and Alternate Construction of Spending
      Variables
As discussed in Section 2, for all analyses in the main text we restrict to the six months following
plan assignment. This is due to the fact that few auto-assignees remain enrolled after the sixth month
post-assignment. This can be seen in Figure A1. Panel (a) shows the full length of enrollment spells
for auto-assignees. Panel (b) shows post-assignment enrollment. The modal beneficiary is enrolled
in Medicaid for 12 months, though many are enrolled for less than 12 months. Focusing on post-
assignment enrollment, over 30% of auto-assignees are enrolled for exactly 6 months. Only a few
auto-assignees remain enrolled past 6 months. Because of this, in the main text, we focus all of our
attention on the first 6 months of enrollment post-assignment.
     Here, we investigate (to the extent possible) whether our key results hold up as we add additional
months post-assignment. In Table A15 we report coefficient estimates for low- vs. medium-plan ef-
fects over different time periods. In column 1 we report our original results, where we restrict to the
first 6 months post-assignment. In columns 2 and 3 we maintain the same sample of beneficiaries, but
we allow post-assignment months 7-9 and 7-12 to enter the regression, respectively. In columns 4 and
5, we restrict to balanced panels of beneficiaries enrolled for at least 9 and at least 12 months, respec-
tively, also restricting the observations to 9 months and 12 months post-assignment. In all cases, the
coefficients on “high” and “low” are virtually unchanged, though statistical power decreases for the
“high” coefficient. These results provide evidence that the main effects presented in Table 1 and Fig-
ure 4 persist into the longer run—for the minority of managed care enrollees that have these longer
enrollment spells.
     To understand the role of disruption, we examine the time-pattern of spending effects in Fig-
ure A2, which plots IV estimates separately for each post-assignment month. Plans are divided into
medium- and low-spending groups. The figure shows whether and how spending effects differ for
low-spending plans relative to medium-spending plans in each month. Some disruption is likely to
occur in any plan, but if disruption is relatively larger in low spending plans, one might expect a
greater dip in spending in the earliest post-assignment months. Panels (a) and (b) use our original
sample, with Panel (a) showing only the first 6 months post-assignment (for which we have data for
everyone in the original sample) and Panel (b) extending up to 12 months post-assignment (where
we only have data for a subset of beneficiaries beyond 6 months). Panels (c) and (d) use new bal-
anced samples of beneficiaries with at least 9 and at least 12 months of post-assignment enrollment,
respectively, so that the patterns over time cannot be explained by a change in the composition of ben-
eficiaries remaining enrolled in Medicaid. In all cases, effects do appear somewhat larger in the first
months post-assignment, but they remain large throughout the post-assignment months we analyze.
     In Table A6, we investigate the sensitivity of our estimates in the main estimation sample to pool-
ing per-enrollee spending over the entire six-month spell, rather than examining month-by-month
spending. One practical consequence is that there are fewer observations (now enrollee-spells, rather
than enrollee-months) with zero spending. This change in the underlying distribution of the depen-
dent variable leads to spending results that are numerically different in the log specification (though

not in the Winsorized level specification), with the aggregated spending estimates generally being
larger than the monthly estimates. The table nonetheless shows that all specification variations yield
results that qualitatively track the main spending estimates.

C.4   Networks
We briefly explore networks as a mechanism for the spending, quality, and satisfaction gaps we
estimate across plans. We start by discussing how we construct the measures of healthcare provider
network breadth we use to assess the role of networks.
     We measure network breadth as the share of simulated physician and hospital visits from a given
zip code covered by each plan’s network. To simulate physician and hospital visits, we use estimates
from models of physician and hospital demand in Wallace (2019), which include a “hassle cost” for
going to an out-of-network provider. The estimates from these models are used to simulate where
Medicaid enrollees would seek care if every provider was in-network. Lastly, as in Ericson and
Starc (2015), the “simulated visit shares” measure is a calculation of the share of simulated physician
and hospital visits for Medicaid enrollees living in a given zip code that are covered by each plan’s
network.5
     We assess whether provider network breadth mediates our causal plan differences in two ways.
First, we re-estimate the plan-level spending and satisfaction results in our randomly-assigned sam-
ple but with controls for network breadth. Appendix Table A16 presents the results of this analysis.
Columns 1 and 2 contain comparisons of high vs. medium and low vs. medium spending esti-
mates with and without controls for network breadth. Adding controls for network breadth does not
change the large estimated differences across plan spending groups.
     Second, we plot our causal estimates of plan-level spending and willingness-to-stay (i.e., con-
sumer satisfaction) against plan-level measures of network breadth. We measure plan-level network
breadth as the average of the zip-level network breadth measures, weighted by the zip code-specific
count of Medicaid beneficiaries assigned to each plan. We plot these relationships in Appendix Fig-
ure A7. Panel A plots our estimated plan-level spending effects against network breadth measured
at the plan-level. The slope of the line of best fit is close to zero. The same pattern emerges when
we compare our estimated plan-level willingness-to-stay effects against network breadth in Panel B.
We do not find strong evidence of a relationship between our plan-level spending and satisfaction
estimates and provider network breadth. This can be reconciled with evidence from Gruber and
McKnight (2016) and Wallace (2019) that broader provider networks increase spending and satisfac-
tion by noting that the complex set of tools that modern health insurers rely on to constrain spending
may counteract the effects of broader networks. For example, one of the Medicaid managed care
plans in our sample is vertically-integrated with the public, safety net hospitals in New York City.
That plan operates a very narrow hospital network but, when enrollees are randomly-assigned to it,
we observe high levels of spending. Hence, it is likely that it combines a narrow hospital network
with a relatively lenient set of utilization management tools. Indeed, this multi-dimensional nature
of the contract is the primary motivation for the strategy used by Wallace (2019) to separately identify
the effect of networks from other dimensions of MMC plans.

C.5   Re-pricing of Claims
In Section 4.2, we re-priced all claims to a common set of reference prices. To construct our list of
common reference prices, we begin by following Cooper et al. (2019) in estimating plan “effects” on
  5 Additional   details on network breadth measure construction and summary statistics are available in Wallace (2019).

prices. The estimating equation is:
                                                  9
                                    Pdjc = νd + ∑ Ψ j 1[Plan j ] + µdjc ,                              (A.4)
                                                 j =1

where Pdjc indicates the log price paid by plan j for service d on individual claim record c in our data.
Services d are comprised of DRGs for inpatient admissions and HCPCS for outpatient procedures.
The regressors include service fixed effects (νd ) and nine plan fixed effects (Ψ j ) that indicate the rela-
tive price level of each plan. If the data generating process underlying prices consisted of each plan
determining prices as a constant-multiple markup for all services relative to some common index
price for each service (such as the FFS Medicaid price), then Ψ j would exactly recover that markup.
     To reprice the claims, we use predicted values from this regression, assigning a common price
across plans for each procedure. This common price is set to equal e(νd +ΨX ) —the procedure fixed
effect plus the plan effect from the omitted plan, de-logged. To establish the robustness of this
price standardization method, in Figure A8 we plot the IV plan spending effects from this regres-
sion standardization against the IV plan spending effects based on the alternative price standardiza-
tion method of setting all prices to the across-plan median. The two repricing methods yield nearly
identical results.

includes a fee-for-service (FFS) spell prior to assignment and a managed care (MMC) spell post-assignment. The bot-
tom panel shows the length of the managed care (MMC) spell post-assignment. The typical post-assignment spell
is 6 months due to a NY regulation that guarantees Medicaid eligibility for 6 months following the beginning of a
managed care enrollment spell.

        Note: Figure displays results in the spirit of difference-in-difference event studies showing the spending impacts of
        being assigned to a low- versus medium-spending plan. As in Table A13, we divide the ten plans into three sets:
        low- (Plans A, B, C, G, H, I), medium- (Plans E, F, and X), and high- (Plan D) spending plans. Medium-spending
        plans are the omitted category and results for low-spending plans are shown. Event time (τ) is along the horizontal
        axis with month zero corresponding to the first month post-assignment. Using a modification of the IV regression in
        Equation (4), each point is estimated from a separate regression (one for each τ) of the form:

        We plot point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for λlow  τ . For the regressions corresponding to τ = −1 and τ =

        −2, we use a reduced form specification since enrollees are in FFS rather than any specific plan prior to assignment.
        The estimates show the (null) effect of a low plan relative to a medium plan on spending prior to the assignment
        occurring. For τ = −1 and τ = −2, spending is pre-randomization FFS spending, rather than post-assignment
        spending in managed care. No coefficients presented, including coefficients for τ = −1 or τ = −2, are normalized
        to zero. Panel (a) uses the main IV sample of auto-assignees and the main follow-up period of 6 months post-
        assignment. Panel (b) also uses the main IV sample of auto-assignees, but includes observations in months 7–12
        post-assignment, if available for the beneficiary. This leads to an unbalanced sample over the event time window
        as many beneficiaries exit Medicaid after month 6. Panels (c) and (d) create new balanced samples that restrict to
        beneficiaries enrolled for at least 9 and at least 12 months, respectively, and restrict observations to the first 9 months
        and first 12 months post-assignment, respectively.

                          spending plans. We divide plans into high-, medium-, and low-spending groups as described in the text. Figure 3
                          shows analogous comparisons for low- versus medium-spending plans. Each circle represents a pricing unit: either
                          a diagnosis-related group (DRG) in the case of inpatient prices or a Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System
                          unit (HCPCS) in the case of outpatient prices. Marker size is proportional to frequency in our claims data. See Figure

  Note: Figure shows the correspondence between willingness-to-stay (WTS) and IV plan spending effects. In the
  top panel, each plan corresponds to one point, with the coordinates corresponding to the coefficient estimates from
  Table 1. In the bottom panel, each plan corresponds to two points: The WTS and plan spending effects are estimated
  separately for enrollees with some spending during the baseline FFS period (prior to random assignment) and for
  enrollees with no spending during the baseline FFS period. The lines in each panel correspond to the OLS fit of the
  10 points.

  Note: Figure plots IV estimates of plan effects on carved-out FFS claims against plan effects on total (FFS plus MMC)
  claims. The sample is the main IV analysis sample. Carved-out FFS claims for MMC enrollees are paid and reported
  directly by the state, rather than by the plans despite occurring during MMC enrollment. Markers correspond to
  plans. The coefficients plotted along the horizontal axis are identical to those reported in Figure 3. Correlation
  between FFS claims and total claims is consistent with the joint hypothesis that low-spending plans affect spending
  across a broad set of services (including carved-out services) and that MMC claims data reveal true differences in
  utilization rather than merely differences in reporting (see Appendix Section B.2).

  Note: Figure displays the association between the main results of the paper—plan effects on healthcare spending and
  satisfaction—and plan-level measures of provider network breadth. Panel (a) plots IV coefficients corresponding to
  Eq. (4), where the dependent variable is log healthcare spending on the y-axis. Plan of enrollment is instrumented
  with plan of assignment. Coefficients are relative to the omitted plan, X. The x-axis contains the average network
  breadth for each plan, measured using the simulated visit shares measure. Panel (b) plots coefficients from the last
  column in Table 1, where the dependent variable is an indicator for whether an enrollee remained in their assigned
  plan at six months post-assignment. Coefficients are relative to the omitted plan, X. The x-axis contains the average
  network breadth for each plan, measured using the simulated visit shares measure. Appendix Section C.4 describes
  how the network breadth measure was constructed.

  Note: Figure compares two different approaches to re-pricing claims prior to estimating IV plan spending coeffi-
  cients. Along the horizontal axis, the common set of median prices are applied to each pricing unit (HCPCS and
  DRGs) for every plan and the IV plan effects on total spending are re-estimated. To generate coordinates along the
  vertical axis, plan price effects are estimated as coefficients via Equation A.4. (See Appendix C.5.) Then every price
  for every plan is replaced with the predicted prices for the omitted plan and the IV plan effects on total spending
  are re-estimated. The correspondence between the two sets of points indicates the extent to which the details of the
  repricing exercise matter.

  Note: Table reports coefficients from the nine first stage regressions defined in Equation 3. In each regression, the
  outcome is a binary indicator for being enrolled in one of the ten plans. The right-hand-side variables of interest—
  the plan assignment instruments—are nine indicators for whether the individual was assigned to each of the plans.
  All regressions control for county × year × month-of-assignment and the count of months since plan assignment,
  both as indicators. Person level controls, as described in Table 1 are included as well in all columns. Standard
  errors in parentheses are clustered at the county × year × month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the
  randomization operates. + p < 0.1, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01

          Note: Table reports results from balance tests on the pre-determined characteristics of auto-
          assignees who are randomized to different plans, and of active choosers who selected dif-
          ferent plans. These tabulated values are used in the plot in Figure 1. Pre-determined char-
          acteristics include demographics and healthcare utilization in FFS Medicaid prior to joining
          a managed care plan. Each managed care enrollee spent a pre-period (often a few months,
          once retroactive enrollment is included) enrolled in the FFS program prior to choosing or
          being assigned to a managed care plan. Two samples are used: the main IV analysis sam-
          ple of auto-assignees (AA) and a same-sized random subsample of active choosers (AC), for
          comparison. Each pre-determined characteristic is regressed on the set of indicators for the
          assigned plan (for auto-assignees) or for the chosen plan (for active choosers). We report the
          p-values from F-tests that the plan effects in these regressions are jointly different from zero.
          Large p-values are consistent with random assignment. Small p-values indicate selection
          (endogenous sorting).

           Note: Table reports on the probability of continued enrollment in Medicaid—in any man-
           aged care plan or in fee-for-service—as a function of plan of assignment. The sample is
           restricted to enrollees auto-assigned to plans prior to January 2011, in order to allow a full
           24 month run out and therefore keep a consistent sample across columns (i.e., to avoid cen-
           soring due to the end date of our data). Attrition out of the Medicaid program would imply
           attrition out of our data and sample. The table displays regression coefficients for plan of
           assignment, where coefficients are relative to the omitted plan (X). The dependent variables
           are indicators for continued enrollment at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, as indicated. See Ap-
           pendix A.3. Observations are enrollees. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the
           county × year × month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the randomization
           operates. + p < 0.1, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01 p < 0.01.

     Note: Table reports IV estimates of each plan’s causal effect on utilization relative to an omitted plan (X), using the IV regression in Equation 4. The
     columns vary the parameterization of spending used as the dependent variable, as indicated in the column headers. For columns with price-standardized
     spending (“Std.”), we first reprice all claims across all plans to a common set of prices and then re-estimate the IV specifications for plan effects on
     spending. The repricing follows the procedure used to create Figure 3 Panel c and is described in full detail in Appendix C.5. Winsorized outcomes
     are Winsorized above only, at the 99th percentile. “Any Spending” is a binary variable for the presence of any paid claim. All regressions control for
     county × year × month-of-assignment and the count of months since plan assignment, both as a set of indicators. Person level controls, as described in
     Table 1 are included as well in all columns. Observations are enrollee × months. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county × year ×
     month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the randomization operates. + p < 0.1, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01.

     Note: Table reports IV estimates of each plan’s causal effect on utilization relative to an omitted plan (X), using the IV regression in Equation 4. The
     columns vary the parameterization of spending used as the dependent variable, as indicated in the column headers. The difference here compared to
     Table A5 is that spending and utilization outcomes are totalled over the full six-month enrollment spell. The endogenous variables instrumented are the
     fraction of the enrollment spell spent in the indicated plan. Observations are enrollees. See Table A5 notes for additional details. + p < 0.1, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗

         Note: Column 1 repeats the specification from Table 1, column 4. Column 2 reweights the active chooser sample to match the auto-assignee (IV) sample
         based on observable characteristics. Weights are set to equalize sizes of cells defined by the interactions of: deciles of FFS (prior to managed care
         enrollment) spending, sex, six age groups, five race groups, and each county × year × month tuple. Risk adjusted regressions include the following
         person-level controls: sex, 5 race categories, deciles of spending in FFS prior to MMC enrollment, and 47 age categories (single years from 18 to 64).
         All regressions control for county × year × month-of-assignment and the count of months since plan assignment/plan enrollment, both as indicators.
         Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county × year × month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the randomization operates.

Note: Table reports IV regression results for category or place of service, using a modification to the IV regression in
Equation 4. The dependent variables, corresponding to the column headers, are binary variables for whether there was
any use of the indicated category/place of service in the enrollee × month. To construct the plan group regressors, we
divide the ten plans into three sets: low- (Plans A, B, C, G, H, I), medium- (Plans E, F, and X), and high- (Plan D) spending
plans. Medium plans are the omitted category. The endogenous variables are indicators for enrollment in any plan in each
set, and the instruments are indicators for assignment to any plan in each set. See Equation (A.1) in Appendix C.2. All
regressions control for county × year × month-of-assignment and the count of months since plan assignment, both as sets
of indicators. Person level controls, as described in Table 1 are included as well in all columns. Observations are enrollee ×

  Note: Table reports IV estimates of each plan grouping’s causal effect on utilization, using a modification to the IV
  regression in Equation 4. We divide the ten plans into three sets: low- (Plans A, B, C, G, H, I), medium- (Plans E, F, and
  X), and high- (Plan D) spending plans. Medium plans are the omitted category. The first column reproduces column
  1 from A13, which includes only the first six months post-assignment. See Table A13 for additional specification
  detail. Columns 2 and 3 maintain the same sample of enrollees as column 1, but include observations in months 7–9
  and 7–12 post-assignment, respectively, in the regression. This leads to an unbalanced panel as many beneficiaries
  exit Medicaid after month 6. Columns 4 and 5 restrict to balanced panels of beneficiaries enrolled for at least 9 and
  at least 12 months, respectively, and restrict observations to the first 9 months and first 12 months post-assignment,
  respectively. + p < 0.1, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01.

  Note: Table reports IV estimates of each plan’s causal effect on utilization relative to an omitted plan (X), using a
  modified version of the IV regression in Equation 4. In addition to instrumenting for plan with plan of assignment,
  we also instrument for network breadth (which varies at the plan-by-ZIP code level) using the network breadth of
  plan of assignment. Observations are enrollee × months. The dependent variable is log spending, as in the main
  specification in Table 1. All regressions control for county × year × month-of-assignment and the count of months
  since plan assignment, both as indicators. Person level controls, as described in Table 1 are included as well in all
  columns. Observations are enrollee × months. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the county × year ×
  month-of-assignment level. This is the level at which the randomization operates. + p < 0.1, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01.
